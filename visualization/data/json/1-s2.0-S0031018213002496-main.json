In order to decouple the influence of environmental factors (salinity, pH, base level and temperature) from depositional and climatic factors (atmospheric CO2) in organic δ13C, a high resolution study was performed on 24 coal seams (total 24.6 m) in the Late Permian stratigraphy in the northern Bowen Basin. The Late Permian stratigraphy of the Bowen Basin records a transition from deltaic and lacustrine conditionswithin the Tinowan Formation and Black Alley Shale Formation, to fluvial deposition in the Kaloola and Bandanna Formations. Intermittent volcanism is recorded by tuff layers during periods of peat accumulation. Variations of coal lithotypes were recorded and formed the basis of sampling for petrography and isotope analysis. Coal samples were etched to expose cellular anatomy, and systematically identified to recognise palaeoflora assemblages. When observed within seam, δ13C of the coal varied cyclically (13C enriched-depleted-enriched) as a response to environmental changes expressed in palaeoflora communities. The total range of δ13C was −26.6‰ to −21.9‰. The overall trend of δ13C progresses to increasing 13C enrichment, corresponding with dull lithotypes (rich in inertinite) which indicate fluctuations in base level. The 13C enrichment peaks at −22.5‰ within the Kaloola Member and shifting rapidly toward a depletion (maximum −26.6‰) of 13C in the upper Bandanna Formation, prior to the P–T boundary. These changes are expressed in palaeoflora communities where ecosystems shifted from dominant Glossopteris flora, to climax community flora including Palaeosmunda, Cycadales and Ginkgo, suited to temperate, early Mesozoic climates. The results of this study represent an insight into the effects of environmental variables on 13C uptake of plants. The identification of flora within coal gives an insight into palaeowetland evolution, and can be partnered with classic petrographical techniques for integrated analysis in coals. Both the geochemistry and the anatomical aspects of coal represent an important tool for future palaeowetland research.\n© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "text": "Enrichment and depletion of 13C in coal is an indicator of palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic settings (Schoell et al., 1994; Lücke et al., 1999;Widodo et al., 2009). Factors of deposition, salinity, altitude, acidity, atmospheric CO2, water availability and plant type can be determined from carbon isotope information (Smith et al., 1976; Arens et al., 2000). Different macerals, the biochemical components of coal (Teichmüller, 1989), and phyterals, the anatomical components of plants preserved in coal (Lapo and Drozdova, 1989), also vary in δ13C (Rimmer et al., 2006). Liptinites have themost depleted 13C of themaceral groups, followed by vitrinite, semifusinite and fusinite as a function of decreasing hydrocarbon content of the original plant (Benner et al., 1987; van Bergen and Poole, 2002; Faure and Mensing, 2005; Rimmer et al.,\nde Wetering).\nrights reserved.\n2006). Organic δ13C is a dominant proxy for atmospheric CO2 through geological time, though prior research has indicated that changes inmetabolic fractionation of plants influence 13C distribution (Bowen, 1959; Krishnamurthy and Epstein, 1990; Lücke et al., 1999). 13C fractionation in plants is often regarded as a problem when addressing the data from a purely geochemical standpoint, as environmental variables influencing plant growth mask the influence of atmospheric CO2 composition (Francey and Farquhar, 1982; Lloyd and Farquhar, 1994; Schleser, 1995; Poole et al., 2006).\nThe origins of coal as an organically derived rock, allow it to act as an important tool in understanding seasonal and stratigraphic changes in palaeoenvironments and palaeoclimates, by analysing its biological components (Diessel, 1992; Poole et al., 2006). Whilst petrographic techniques on coal are well established (Teichmüller, 1989), there has been limited research into extracting botanical information from coals given the problematic nature of compression and diagenesis experienced during the coalification process (Lapo and Drozdova, 1989;\nWinston, 1989). Studies into the enhancement of cellular structure of plant components in coals, through a method of oxidation dubbed “etching”, were critical in establishing palaeobotanical identification, although did not have adequate resolution of samples to effectively interpret vegetational cycles (Pierce et al., 1991;Moore and Swanson, 1993). The taxonomic recognition of key species preservedwithin coal has significant implications on the interpretation of geochemical data, as most botanical species are well constrained by environmental variables which control their growth and distribution (Cameron et al., 1989; Grocke, 1998; Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007). For modern peats, wetland development stages are controlled by successions in floral communities (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007; Newton and Bottrell, 2007). These successions have been identified in coal balls (e.g. Raymond, 1988), however, they are not yet correlated to non-mineralised coal. Botanical occurrences can work to further constrain the number of depositional factors that influence δ13C, and observe feedback between the atmosphere and biogeosphere (Poole et al., 2006). Constraining depositional environment, based on palaeoflora, is commonly used in organic facies analysis and organic geochemistry (Mendonça Filho et al., 2012), though not as widespread when applied to coal, which does not have limitations on preservation and abundance of organic matter.\nIn the absence of microscopic studies of botanical components, variation in coal lithotype and/or maceral composition is used as a proxy for gross vegetation and environmental changes (Beeston, 1986; Cameron et al., 1989; Diessel, 1992; Hower et al., 2008), particularly in response to base level (Moore and Shearer, 2003). Peat is highly susceptible to in situweathering andmaceration, with dull lithotypes representative of peat doming, fluctuating base level and stressed vegetative communities (Marchioni and Kalkreuth, 1991; Diessel, 2010). Repetition of increasing dull coal sequences within seam is attributed to relative base level rise and fall. Whilst coal lithotype alone is not adequate in assessing vegetational change due to base level sensitivity (Crosdale, 1993; Moore and Shearer, 2003), used carefully, it provides a basis for overall base level variation in sedimentary systems.\nThis paper presents a method of utilizing the effect of fractionation of 13C in plants by comparing it with the botanical components (phyterals), and preservation levels (macerals), which together are expressed megascopically as coal lithotypes, to recognise changes in wetland communities. Floral successions during wetland development indicate changes in environmental variables (i.e. salinity, pH, temperature, base level change) within each seam. The approach aims to decouple atmospheric and depositional change from environmental changes expressed by palaeoflora successions within a coal seam. This method is partnered with ‘traditional’ interpretation of δ13C as a proxy for atmospheric CO2 to interpret both depositional and climatic feedback reflected in coal deposits. To properly interpret environmental changes within the lifecycle of a peat forming community, a high resolution data set is required. A core through the Late Permian sequence of the Bowen Basin of Australia was selected for sampling, to provide an adequate resolution of data for interpretation. This sequence contains abundant coal seams that were deposited through a period of major climatic and tectonic shift in Eastern Australia (Fielding et al., 2001; Retallack and Krull, 2006; Korsch and Totterdell, 2009). A single well, rather than multiple wells, was selected for the study to investigate finer scale, wetland flora variations. Geographic distribution of flora has already been investigated in macrofossil studies (Anderson et al., 1999), thus a smaller scale approach was taken for this research."

    "text": "The Bowen Basin consists of primarily 10 km thick sequences of Permian to Triassic rocks deposited in terrestrial settings (Goscombe and Coxhead, 1995; Fielding et al., 2001). The terrestrial strata include numerous layers of coal accumulations initially forming at the basin margins before further covering the interior of the basin in the Late Permian (Mallett et al., 1995). The basin is structurally complex, incorporating several major NNW–SSE troughs and ridges which have regionally impacted the well's surrounding stratigraphy (Fielding, 1992; Mallett et al., 1995). The Bowen Basin was formed by three significant tectonic events (Betts et al., 2002; Veevers, 2006). The first event occurred during the Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous, as roll-back of the Eastern Australian subduction margin, formed a back-arc basin, followed by thermal subsidence in the mid-Permian (Veevers, 2006). A final event in the mid-Late Permian compressed the basin into a foreland setting (Betts et al., 2002). Late Permian thermal events associated with these tectonic changes stimulated interaction of hydrothermal fluids with Late Permian coal measures producing CO2 and CH4 (Uysal et al., 2000). The quantitative effects this alteration, and other diagenetic changes, have on the δ13C of coal remain unclear (Spiker and Hatcher, 1987; van Bergen and Poole, 2002; Poole et al., 2006)."

    "heading": "2.3. Stratigraphy and depositional history",
    "text": "The Late Permian stratigraphy of the study location (from oldest to youngest) is the Tinowan Formation, Black Alley Shale Formation,\nKaloola Member and Bandanna Formation (Fielding et al., 2001). The Tinowan Formation and Black Alley Shale Formation were deposited during the onset of foreland loading in near shore, deltaic to lacustrine systems (Fielding et al., 2001; Veevers, 2006). The depositional environment later shifted into a fluvial setting, depositing the Kaloola Member and Bandanna Formation. A number ofminor andmajorflood events facilitated wetland development and coal accumulation (Fielding et al., 2001). During this period of sedimentation in the very Late Permian, deposition of volcanic ash occurred throughout the basin, associated with\nforearc volcanics and increases of atmospheric CO2 (Retallack and Krull, 2006). Significant changes in tectonic setting, driving changes in depositional environment occurred concurrently to the extinction of Permian peat-forming flora (Fielding, 1992; Metcalfe and Isozaki, 2009). However, change in depositional environment alone does not give explanation to the global change in biological conditions sufficient enough to drive the 6 Ma ‘coal gap’ in the early Triassic (Michaelsen, 2002)."

    "heading": "2.4. Palaeoclimate and palaeogeography",
    "text": "Palaeomagnetic reconstructions of Gondwana show that the climate of Eastern Australia during the Late Permian was cold to temperate with high precipitation, consistent with high latitude biomes (Cuneo, 1996; Veevers, 2006). At this time Gondwana experienced a significant deglaciation following the late Palaeozoic glaciation stage P4 (Fielding et al., 2008; Birgenheier et al., 2010). This deglaciation is associated with a global increase in atmospheric CO2, reflected in organic δ13C values for this period (Montañez et al., 2007), coincident with a change in orbital cycling to high eccentricity modulation (Horton et al., 2012). This shift in palaeoclimatic factors preludes significant change in sedimentary environments at the P–T boundary, and the mass extinction of ~62.9% of terrestrial families (Benton and Newell, 2012)."

    "heading": "2.5. Palaeoflora",
    "text": "Prior to the P–T extinction event, Permian flora of Australia was dominated by the Glossopteris, which has an extensive fossil record within the Bowen Basin sediments, though less recognised within coal deposits (Pigg, 1997). Glossopteris has an incredibly diverse range of occurrence within high latitude regions (Cuneo et al., 1993), growing in soils with fluctuating water tables in both peat-forming and non peat-forming environments (Taylor et al., 2011). These, and other Permian flora, utilised C3 photosynthetic pathways, characterised by a δ13C between −23‰ and −34‰ (Grocke, 2002). C4 photosynthetic pathways used by most angiosperms, characterised by δ13C between −8‰ and−16‰ (Grocke, 2002), did not evolve until the lateMesozoic (Arens et al., 2000), and are thus not considered in this paper.\nThe Late Permian was punctuated by successive transient warming events and the increase in atmospheric CO2, reflected in the carbon isotope and fossil record (Retallack and Krull, 1999; Retallack et al., 2011). Themass extinction of Glossopteris and other terrestrial plant species as a response to this climate change occurred at the P–T boundary (Michaelsen, 2002; Taylor et al., 2011; Benton and Newell, 2012). Catastrophic changes in plant ecosystems also occurred at this time, recorded by excessive fungal activity in response to environmental stress (Visscher et al., 1996). Concurrently, an increase in fossilised charcoals in sediments and coal (as inertinite group macerals) is thought to be associated with forest fires (Glasspool, 2000; Diessel, 2010). This boundary is very well documented by various isotope, biological and geochronological studies, as reviewed in Benton and Newell (2012), however, investigations into changing vegetation conditions prior to the P–T boundary are limited (Michaelsen, 2002). An early investigation into palynological zones by Foster (1982), identified a gradual shift in palynology from Permian to Triassic dominated flora. This contrasts with the abrupt change in megafossil preservation at the P–T boundary. How this contrasting relationship between megafossil and microfossil preservation is reflected in coal deposits, remains unaddressed."

The data were later grouped into the ICCP classification for\nmaceral groups (vitrinite, inertinite and liptinites) for interpretation. Given its predominance and variation between samples, detrovitrinite was used as an indicator for fluctuating base level (Rimmer et al., 2000)."

    "heading": "3.3.2. Etching and phyteral analysis",
    "text": "Etching was applied to all coal blocks of banded lithotypes used for maceral analysis (n = 64) to remove the masking effects of diagenesis and coalification on plant material enabling its botanical structure to be observed (Lapo and Drozdova, 1989). The etching solution contained 25 g of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and 5 ml of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) (Moore and Stanton, 1994). The etching solution was heated until boiling point until all of the potassium permanganate had dissolved. A separate rinsing solution of 100 ml water, 25 g sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) and 5 ml H2SO4 to stop the etching process was also prepared (as per Moore and Stanton, 1994). The face of the coal block was submerged into the decanted etching solution. Each sample was etched for 10 to 15 s, and immediately placed in the rinsing solution for 1 min to remove all traces of the potassium permanganate stain. The blocks were then cleaned ultrasonically.\nGross phyteral classification, rather than identification of isolated components, has only been attempted in one such published study (Lapo and Drozdova, 1989), which gave broad constraints on the typical array of phyterals within coals of different ages. For this paper a new classification scheme was developed in order to quantitatively describe the floral diversity of the coals. The primary sources used to develop this classification are shown in Table 1. Identification of plant components used diagnostic criteria for floral genus or order, as well as the relationship the phyterals had with surrounding tissues (i.e. bark intact on a wood fragment, or heterogeneous within matrix). In the case for Araucarioxylon and Australoxylon wood, phyterals were classified to Glossopteris leaf genus (Bamford, 2004). Similarly, for Dadoxylon and Ginkgoxylon wood, phyterals were classified to Ginkgo leaf genus (Feng et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2011). Most wood phyterals of Cycadales did not have well preserved axial ray cells and, therefore, were not confidently classified by genus.Wood phyterals of Arthroxylon\n. a Glossopteris α differentiated by cell spacing b 5 μm cell spacing, b Glossopteris β difh poor cell structure preservation, fine grained with interdispersed plant tissue longer structure preservation, fine grained with interdispersed plant tissue less than 100 μm listed in order of significance for classification criteria.\ntissue did not preserve stem nodes (McLoughlin, 1992; Taylor et al., 2011), and thus classified as Paracalamites.\nImages were taken of each phyteral to aid in comparisons of anatomical structures, and to develop this classification scheme. Unidentifiable components were later removed from the count as they made up only ~1.4% of total data, and were not considered statistically significant.\nPhyteral count was only performed on etched fragments greater than 10 μm in size, to constrain the data to only constituent particles within the samples. Particles smaller than 10 μm were considered part of the organic matrix. The number of counts (n) per sample was constrained to the number of preserved specimens within a 5 cm long by 2 cm wide cross section of coal. The phyteral count of all samples ranged from n = 32 to n = 214.\nWood assemblages based on plant communities from preserved xylem tissues were separated using Ward's Cluster Analysis (Wilks, 2011). Themethods of determiningwetland communities fromwood assemblages were consistent with modern techniques of floral dominance and abundance by counting proportions of arborescent species (Lyon, 1993). The differentiation of root and shoot tissues was ambiguouswithin the samples. Compaction and poor preservation of aerenchymal and parenchymal tissues in root and shoot tissue did not offer potential for root/shoot ratios, typically performed in coal ball studies, such as Raymond (1988)."

Care was taken to ensure that no cleat calcite or mineral inclusions were present in the sampled regions, as thesemay act as contaminants. Each of these samples was manually ground to a fine powder then transferred to tubes for isotope analysis.\nThe δ13C isotope values were determined with a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Isoprime), coupled in continuous flow mode with an elemental analyser (Elementar Cube) (EA-CF-IRMS). Calibration was performed by use of two standards, USGS24 (−16.1‰ δ13CPDB) and NAT76H (−29.26‰ δ13CPDB), which were interspersed throughout analytical runs. Each sample was analysed in duplicate, using 50–200 μg of concentrate combusted at 1020 °C in 3.5 mm × 5 mm tin capsules.

Dulling upward sequences are observed in the coal seams within all formations. Older coal seams sampled within paralic environments of the Tinowan Formation and lower Black Alley Shale Formationwere thinner (xseam ¼ 0:19m) and brighter, with abundant framboidal pyrite mineralization. Younger coals of the Kaloola and Bandanna Formations, deposited in fluvial environments contain thicker (xseam ¼ 0:38m), duller coals with irregularly dispersed siderite nodules. Mineral matter in dull lithotypes was low (b4.7%), suggesting the lithotype responds tomaceral type and preservation rather than increasing inorganics. There is a gradual increase in dull lithotypes, peaking within the upper Kaloola Member, at ~1250 m and decreasing rapidly toward the upper Bandanna Formation.

Telovitrinite ranges from 1.0% to 83.8% of the total maceral composition. Seams high in telovitrinite ( xseam > xall seams > 20:77%) occur within the Tinowan Formation and Black Alley Shale Formation. Seams low in telovitrinite (xseambxall seamsb20:77%) occur in the KaloolaMember and Bandanna Formation. Telovitrinite has a loosely inverse relationship to detrovitrinitewithin each sample, which occurs both stratigraphically, and within seam.\nDetrovitrinite subgroupmacerals vary from8.1% to 85.9% (x ¼ 35:6%), peaking at ~1250 m coinciding with peak in dull lithotypes. This association suggests that dull lithotypes are controlled by detrovitrinite input, as a response to base level changes promoting degradation (Crosdale, 1993). Peat reworking by palaeofauna or flora was not evidenced by root\npenetration, siderite precipitation or presence of animal–plant interaction (Moore, 1987; Slater et al., 2012).\nInertinite group macerals vary from 1.0% to 65.3% for all samples. Overall, the inertinite group consisted of 86.0% inertodetrinite, 11.4% fusinite and semifusinite, 2.6% funginite and b0.1% macrinite. Variations in these macerals were ambiguous, thus grouped for analysis. Funginite was only observed in the seams above ~1250 m depthwithin the upper Kaloola and Bandanna Formations.

Inertinite varies within the Tinowan Formation to upper Kaloola Member between 2.0% and 45.4% (x ¼ 15:14%) of the total maceral composition. There is a substantial increase of inertinite group macerals at ~1250 m depth in the Kaloola Member to a peak value of 65.3% (xseam ¼ 45:7%).\nLiptinite group macerals varied from 0% to 45.3% of observed macerals.

    "text": "As etching has the most significant effects on vitrinite tissues derived from wood, cluster analysis (Ward's method) was used on the data collected to identify the assemblage of wood types by genus or order (Fig. 5). Wood Assemblage I includes Glossopteris (α). Wood Assemblage II includes Glossopteris (β) and Paracalamites. Wood Assemblage III includes Palaeosmunda, Cycadales and Ginkgo. Ginkgophytes have not been noted in Late Permian flora of Australia, although have been found elsewhere in Europe, Asia and Antarctica (Taylor et al., 2011). The observation of preserved Ginkgo as wetland flora has implications for the palaeoecology of the very Late Permian in this region. Stratigraphic trends in plant types, particularly those not of Glossopteris,\nI II III\nwere difficult to assess given the strong preservation bias associated with telovitrinite content. Glossopteriswood types dominatemost samples, making up 80.5% of all preserved wood tissue in the coal, and all other flora are consistent with Gondwana botanical assemblages in the Late Permian (Taylor and Taylor, 1990; Cuneo, 1996; Bamford, 2004). Microscope images of wood types are shown in Fig. 6.\nWood assemblages were analysed stratigraphically to overcome preservation bias of individual plant groups (Fig. 7). Results show proportional changes in plant communities within, and between, seams. Wood Assemblage I and II are the most dominant communities and occur inversely to one another. The occurrence of Wood Assemblage III increases significantly from the bottom to the top of each seam. Conversely, the occurrence of Wood Assemblage I decreases from the bottom to the top of each seam.Wood Assemblage II experiences no statistically significant variation from the top to bottom of each seam, though most abundant toward the middle of the seam.\nAll identified xylem tissues were telovitrinite group macerals. Wood Assemblage II and III did not correlate with lithotype patterns, however, Wood Assemblage I showed a very weak correlation with bright band thickness (Fig. 8). This suggests that whilst most bright lithotypes correspond to high telovitrinite, mainly occurring as Glossopteris wood, it is not well preserved during accumulation.\nCompaction between eachwood type varied significantly. Qualitatively, there appeared to be little relationship between compaction ratios in each sample. Glossopteris tissues appeared to be the least compact whilst Palaeosmunda, Paracalamites, Cycadales, Palaeosmunda andGinkgo tissues were each increasingly effected by compaction. Lignin rich, xylem tissue, with closer cell spacing experience less compaction (Schweingruber, 2006), which is consistent with palaeoflora observations. The irregularity of compaction between plant type andmaceral type has important implications for decompaction studies."

These fungal bodies occurred within all sampled coal seams but were comparatively more abundant within coal seams of the KaloolaMember (Fig. 10). This contrasts to the limited occurrence of funginite in unetched samples. Fungally replaced tissues often appear as fusinite in unetched sample, drawing into question the interpretation of fusinite-rich tissues to interpret fire events during typical maceral analysis (Diessel, 2010; Jasper et al., 2012)."

Lack of preserved cuticle and stomata makes these tissues difficult to formally identify (Fig. 9, photomicrographs c & d). These tissues are common throughout the coal seams, but are relatively abundant in the coals of the Kaloola Member (xn seam ¼ 8). Preservation of parenchymal/aerenchymal tissue has a weak inverse relationship with cuticle preservation (Fig. 10). These tissues are prevalent in Glossopteris root tissue (Vertebraria). The distinction betweenGlossopterisα andβwas not applied to root tissues. As such little xylem was preserved, the differentiation between the varieties was not enough to formally recognise variations between root phyterals."

Variations in the bright and dull specimens were not significant (p = 0.099), with the standard deviation of δ13C between the bright and dull ~0.564‰. This suggests uniform deviation in 13C between maceral groups within each sample, eliminating any significant variations influenced by lithotype variation. This pattern in enrichment and depletion is paralleled in the lithotype trends, corresponding to increased proportions of dull coal, or ‘dulling-up’ (Esterle et al., 1989). Thismidpoint in the Kaloola Member at ~1250 m represents a clear shift in both depositional, environmental and atmospheric conditions.\nWhen observed within seam, δ13C varies cyclically (13C enricheddepleted-enriched; Fig. 11, inset a and b). There are two significant outliers (Fig. 11) within the data at a depth of 1185.8 m and 1341.6 m (standard deviation ~1.52%0 and ~1.85%0, respectively). The samples used for carbon isotope analysis were observed petrographically and contain ~10–15% calcite precipitated within cleats. The presence of hydrothermal calcite (δ13C of between 11.5‰ and 4.4‰; Uysal et al. (2000)) within these samples may act as a possible contaminant, contributing to the unusually depleted 13C values. Disregarding the outlying values, the variation of δ13C within each seam is statistically significant (p b 0.001), thus occurring independently from the overlying stratigraphic trend. These trends, within and across the seams, allow for decoupling of environmental changes operating in the peat mire during deposition."

    "text": "The changes in maceral subgroups of inertinite, liptinite and telovitrinite appeared to have only weak correlations with variation in coal lithotype throughout sampled stratigraphy. Dulling-up sequences identified within each coal seam are influenced by detrovitrinite as opposed to increased mineral matter, although this was not confirmed by ash analysis. This suggests the degree of preservation is controlled by fluctuations in the water table that influence doming and peat preservation, resulting in dull lithotypes (Esterle et al., 1989). Overall the increase in dull lithotypes and corresponding increase in detrovitrinite toward the upper Kaloola and Bandanna Formations represent an overall change\nin hydrological conditions. Overall trends within the coal seams show a shift from stable base level, to increasingly strong variations in water level that promote peat degradation.\nFungal occurrences and increases in inertinite group macerals are consistent with ecosystem stress (Visscher et al., 1996), particularly within the final coal seams of the Bandanna Formation. These changes to the wetland environment also occur at a smaller scale, within each seam and represent dynamic ecosystem changes influenced by shorter lived, environmental variation. In this case, although maceral groups and coal lithotypes are adequate in making broad interpretations of palaeoenvironment, they provide little detail for smaller scale environmental changes that occur within each seam as expressed by the palaeoflora."

    "text": "The identified wood assemblages, represent wetland plant communities occurring in allogenic succession (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007). The distribution of floral assemblage within coal is controlled by their response to shorter lived environmental variations during\npeat accumulation, that are seen from changing lithotype and maceral groups. The changes observed in flora and maceral composition within each seam, contradict biota-controlled, autogenic succession (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007). This is consistent with the individualistic hypothesis for wetland development; no two floral communities can occupy the same wetland development stage (Anderson, 2007).\nThe distribution pattern of communities in the Late Permian coals, from bottom to top of each seam, indicates that peat accumulation is controlled by a continuumof communities each responding to changes in base level, controlling salinity (Crosdale, 1993) and pH (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007).Whilst each community laterally contributes to biomass accumulation, temporally the proportion of each community varies, resulting in overlapping communities preserved within each coal seam. These are observed by the succession of Wood Assemblages within each coal seam. Overall, the coal accumulations in the Late Permian succession of the Bowen Basin are low diversity forested, cool to temperate, fresh water palustrine systems (Cowardin et al., 1979; Cuneo, 1996).\nWood Assemblage I (Glossopteris α), represents the majority (55.8%) of the preserved wood tissue within the coal measures sampled. Glossopterishas a diverse range of occurrencewithinhigh latitude regions,\ngrowing in soils with fluctuating water tables in both peat-forming and non peat-forming environments (Cuneo et al., 1993). The presence of a singular preserved genus of flora within the community suggests a stable peat-forming environment with low diversity. This species diversity is consistent with modern high-latitude forested wetlands (Czerepko, 2008). The environment is optimised forGlossopteris growth,with low salinity, stable base level and cool temperatures (Taylor and Taylor, 1990; Cuneo, 1996). This style of community is characteristic of mature, climax communities with high biomass production, and thus peat accumulation (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007). This assemblage is not preceded by a preserved immature ecosystem, likely due to the low diversity of the wetland's floral assemblage (Odum and Barrett, 2005). The lack of a preserved immature ecosystem suggests low biological productivity, inadequate for peat accumulation and further preservation into coals.\nAlthough Glossopteris α is almost structurally identical to Glossopteris β, their occurrence responds independently to each other within each coal seam. Two morphologies may represent two different scenarios in vegetational change. One potential hypothesis is that the two morphotypes are different species of the Glossopteris. Pigg and Nishida (2006) discussed the problematic nature of differentiating\nGlossopteris species. Etching techniques are adequate in defining genus, howevermore detailed analysis is required to further investigate species changes in preserved tissues in coal. Another consideration is the morphologies represent a change in tree growth due to stress variables. Tree growth is controlled by environmental variables, such as water availability, pH, and salinity regulate the health of the plant (Lyon, 1993; Schweingruber, 2006). Modern trees experiencing flood stress or saturated conditions within a peat mire, respond with stunted growth and increased pore space, resulting in weaker and sparser wood tissue (Falcon-Lang, 2003; Downes et al., 2009).Glossopterismorphotypes were common in the Late Permian due to habitat distribution and diversification of the genus (Cuneo, 1996). Given the low diversity of Glossopteriswithin the samples and their associationwith telovitrinite, Glossopteris β is considered to represent high flood stress as opposed to a species variation.\nGlossopteris β populates 75% of Wood Assemblage II. The remaining 25% is accounted for by Paracalamites. Paracalamites, closely allied and morphologically similar to the Northern hemisphere's Calamites (Rigby, 1969), are sensitive to water level changes, and occupywet waterlogged conditions such as lake margin marshes (McLoughlin, 1992; Rößler and\nNoll, 2006). With the occurrence of higher proportions of Wood Assemblage II, there is increased preservation of parenchymal tissue, aerenchymal tissue and cuticle. Wetland flora has well-developed morphological mechanisms to avoid root anoxia, with aerenchymal tissue developed within the roots and stems of plants as a response to flooding and increased salinity (Mendelssohn and Postek, 1982). The occurrence of both these wood types, and associated tissues within the assemblage indicateswaterloggedenvironment, inwhichGlossopteris flora are experiencing increased stress and stunting due to standing water conditions.\nWood Assemblage III is made up of Palaeosmunda (80%), Cycadales (19.9%) and Ginkgo (b 0.1%). The occurrence of primitive cycad and Ginkgo flora is diagnostic of much more temperate conditions in which they flourished during the earlyMesozoic (Stewart, 1983). Palaeosmunda is a Late Permian Pteridophyta previously recognised by Gould (1970) in the Bowen Basin. This community succeeds the top of the coal seam in a similar manner to other Pteridophyta in Carboniferous coals (Raymond, 1988; Pryor, 1996; DiMichele et al., 2001). Raymond (1988) noted this transition from exclusively Cordaites flora, which made up a total of 56% of preserved material in Iowa coals, to Pteridophyta flora as a marker for increasing salinity. High density of modern Pteridophyta, such as Osmunda, is associated with pioneer communities in both stagnant water, and open woodland areas (Landi and Angiolini, 2008). In this case, for Permian coals, it appears this succession is analogous, though marked by transitions from dominantly Glossopteris to Palaeosmunda instead ofCordaites to Psaroniusflora.WoodAssemblage III floras were the last to colonise and represent the pioneer community. Thiswetland transitionwas characterised by increasing salinity and pH in response to fluctuating base level, unsuitable for thick peat accumulation. This transition is most notable within the upper Kaloola Member, corresponding to the increase in dull lithotypes with detrovitrinite and low mineral matter content promoted by peat doming, followed by subsidence and burial (Esterle et al., 1989).\nThe overall distribution and type of palaeoflora observed throughout the coal measures does not change substantially over time. The presence\nof the Bowen Basin: a: fungal bodies within ‘stringy’matrix, b: fungally degraded tissue leaf parenchymal tissue, (compacted).\nof Ginkgo and Cycadales, which are prominent in Mesozoic wetlands, suggest a transition in climatic conditions during the Late Permian. Exclusively Triassic floras were not observed within the coal measures. This may be due to preservation bias experienced by Triassic flora in the Bowen Basin due to depositional changes (Foster, 1982), however this relationship remains unclear in coal. Further complementary studies into palynology and macrofossils during this time period could benefit the interpretation of the rise of Triassic flora in the Late Permian. Within this study it appears the coals reflect the abrupt floral transition in macrofossils (Michaelsen, 2002), rather than gradual floral changes expressed in palynology in the Late Permian (Foster, 1982)."

    "text": "The clear three stage botanical changes within each coal seam represent unique environmental settings that influence the uptake of 13C within biomass. Each environmental setting is constrained by the flora, preservation and coal character as represented by macerals, phyterals\nand coal lithotypes. The δ13C difference between dull and bright lithotype within each sample is statistically insignificant, and the δ13C relationship to maceral composition within seam is ambiguous at best. This infers environmental variables expressed by palaeoflora control the changes in 13C uptakewithin a seam, rather than the preservedbiochemical components of macerals (Rimmer et al., 2006). Lithotype and maceral groups vary independently from the δ13C within seam, and therefore represent stratigraphic changes in climate and depositional regimes.\nWith this conclusion in mind, it is possible to isolate the environmental variables controlling 13C uptake within the coals, and interpret δ13C response within vegetational cycles in each seam. Fig. 12 shows the integrated interpretation of environmental factors represented by the floral communities observed within each coal seam. The three most dominant, local environmental variables controlling 13C uptake are base level (controlling water availability), salinity and temperature. These variables control wetland development determined from each palaeoflora community and their associated trends in preservation expressed by coal lithotype and macerals composition."

    "heading": "5.3.2. Effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on δ13C",
    "text": "The overall shift to more positive δ13C from the Tinowan Formation, peaking at −22.5‰ within the Kaloola Member (~1250 m) represents depositional and climatic changes expressed in peat preservation and deposition. Increasing water availability and temperature will have decreased 13C uptake in vegetation and resulted in more positive values. During this period a decrease in atmospheric 13C results from the increase of 13C trapped within biomass, despite relatively stable atmospheric CO2 occurring globally during this period (Retallack and Krull, 2006).\nThe overall negative excursion of the final coal seam within the Bandanna Formation (1156.89 m depth) represents a −1.4‰ shift in δ13C (p b 0.05) from the seam prior. This rapid depletion in δ13C is considered precursor to decreasing δ13C before the Permian– Triassic extinction 252.28 ± 0.08 Ma (Metcalfe and Isozaki, 2009; Retallack et al., 2011). Volatility in δ13C is globally distributed at the P–T boundary as a response to rapid injection of isotopically light carbon, as CO2, during excessive release of carbon by carbon sinks or volcanic events (Retallack and Krull, 2006; Montañez et al., 2007). Major volcanic events, distal to peat accumulation, are indicated by thick tuff layers occurring within the Kaloola Member and Bandanna Formation (Williams et al., 2012). Increasing atmospheric CO2 promoted depleted δ13C values from ~1250 m, and overrode the depositional and environmental variables expressed in coal lithotypes, macerals and phyterals. The absence of peat accumulation during the Triassic (Retallack et al., 2011) hinders the possibility of eustatic sea level increase associated with δ13C depletion and changes in sedimentary environments after the carbon isotopic peak. This suggests that the shift in δ13C toward increasingly negative values is influenced significantly\nby climatic factors, such as a substantial increase in atmospheric CO2, as opposed to environmental variables which control the palaeoflora communities."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "The Late Permian coal measures of the Bowen Basin express environmental, depositional and climatic changes that occurred prior to the Permian–Triassic boundary. At this time, the Bowen Basin underwent a notable change in climate from cool and wet conditions, to more arid and temperate climate typical of the Triassic (Fielding et al., 2001). The overall, negative excursion of δ13C in Late Permian coalmeasures is a precursor to rising atmospheric CO2 that occurred during the P–T extinction event (Retallack and Krull, 2006). These changes are expressed in palaeoflora communities that shifted from dominant Glossopteris flora, to Palaeosmunda, Cycadales and Ginkgo floras, suited to temperate, early Mesozoic climates. The environmental factors controlling the distribution of these floras directly influence δ13C within each coal seam.\nThe results of this study represent an insight into the effects of environmental variables on 13C uptake of plants.Multivariate effects on δ13C should be considered when interpreting data, particularly in highresolution studies where δ13C may be strongly influenced by other factors independent of atmospheric CO2. The quantitative analysis of phyterals by etching of coals also represents a new and exciting field of possibility within palaeoenvironmental analysis. The identification of flora within coal gives a fresh insight into palaeowetland evolution, and can be partnered with classic petrographical techniques for integrated analysis in coals. Both the geochemistry and the anatomical\naspects of coal represent an important tool for future palaeowetland research."
