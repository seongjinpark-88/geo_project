The prelude to these events is the late Campanian cooling that reachedminimum temperatures in the earliest Maastrichtian (base C31r) correlative with low primary productivity and species diversity. Event-1 begins during the persistent cool climate of the earlyMaastrichtian (lower C31r) when primary productivity rapidly increased accompanied by rapid species originations, attributed to increased nutrient influx from increased upwelling, erosion during the sea-level fall ~70.6 Ma, and Ninety East Ridge volcanism. During Event-2 (upper C31r to lower C30n), climate rapidly warmed by 2–3 °C in deep waters and peaked at 22 °C on land, primary productivity remainedhigh and diversification reachedmaximum for the entire Cretaceous.We attribute this climate warming to intense Ninety East Ridge volcanic activity beginning ~69.5Ma, accompanied by rapid reorganization of intermediate oceanic circulation. Enhanced greenhouse conditions due to the eruption of Deccan Phase-1 in India resulted in detrimental conditions for planktic foraminifera marking the end of diversification. Global cooling resumed in Event-3 (C30n), species diversity declined gradually accompanied by dwarfing, decreased large specialized species, increased small ecologically tolerant taxa, and ocean acidification. Event-3 is mainly the result of enhanced weathering and volcanogenic CO2 adsorption by the oceans during the preceding warm Event-2 that led to cooling and lower pH in the surface ocean. Event-4 marks the last 250 kyr of the Maastrichtian (C29r), which began with the largest Deccan eruptions (Phase-2) that caused rapid climate warming of 4 °C in deep waters and 8 °C on land, acid rain and ocean acidification leading to a major carbonate crisis preceding the K/T mass extinction.\n© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The Maastrichtian (the last stage of the Late Cretaceous, 72.1– 66.0 Ma; Gradstein et al., 2012) is a 6.1-Myr time interval that experienced climate and biological extremes ranging from maximum cooling to maximumwarming and from maximummarine evolutionary diversity to one of the largestmass extinctions in Earth's history at the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T; also known as Cretaceous-Paleogene K/Pg) boundary (review in Keller et al., 2016a).\nDespite this remarkable 6.1-Myr history of environmental changes, the Maastrichtian is mostly known for the mass extinction. For the past 30 years, research has concentrated on the K/T boundary centering on a contentious debate: was the mass extinction instantaneous and\nrsity, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.\ncaused by an asteroid impact or was it more gradual and the result of long-term environmental changes with the asteroid impact the final coup de grace? There aremultiple lines of evidence that unquestionably support an impact on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico: 1) the global iridium anomaly at the K/T boundary (Alvarez et al., 1980; Alvarez, 1983) that has become the hallmark for all K/T mass extinction studies, 2) discovery of the impact crater on Yucatan (Hildebrand et al., 1991), 3) global distribution of shocked quartz (e.g., Izett, 1990), 4) impact glass spherules discovered throughout the region surrounding the Chicxulub crater (e.g., Smit et al., 1992, Smit et al., 1996; Smit, 1999; Rocchia et al., 1996; Olsson et al., 1997; Norris et al., 1999; MacLeod et al., 2007; Schulte et al., 2010; Keller et al., 2013), and 5) impact breccia in the Chicxulub crater and large breccia and conglomerate deposits lacking impact glass but interpreted as generated by seismic disturbance from the Chicxulub impact (e.g., Bralower et al., 1998; Arenillas et al., 2006; Schulte et al., 2010). Likely environmental consequences of the Chicxulub impact have been widely discussed (e.g., Schultz and\nD'Hondt, 1996; Tsujita, 2001; Kring, 2007; Vellekoop et al., 2014). This is a formidable list of characteristics that unquestionably identify an impact on Yucatan, but did this impact crash into Yucatan precisely at K/ T time and cause the mass extinction as widely inferred? There is stratigraphic, geochemical, sedimentary and fossil evidence that indicates this impact predates the mass extinction by about 100 kyr (Keller, 2014, and references therein). This is a key issue in this ongoing debate over the cause of the K/T mass extinction.\nVarious advances over the past 10 years have shown that Deccan Trap volcanism in India could have been a critical source of environmental stress leading to the K/T mass extinction: (1) Deccan eruptions were most intense during magnetochron C29r spanning the K/T boundary (Chenet et al., 2007, 2008, 2009); (2) high-precision age based on UPb geochronology revealed that 80 % of Deccan eruptions occurred over the ~750 kyr (duration of C29r) with accelerating intensity across the K/T boundary (Schoene et al., 2015); (3) documentation of themass extinction in intertrappean sediments in India (Keller et al., 2011) between the longest lava flows recorded on Earth (Self et al., 2008); (4) rapid climate warming during C29r below the K/T boundary due to large inputs of volcanogenic greenhouse gases (reviews in Punekar et al., 2014a; Keller et al., 2016a). Based on these studies, it was suggested that the Chicxulub impact might have accelerated Deccan volcanism leading to the mass extinction (Richards et al., 2015; Renne et al., 2015). With this changing perspective, a better understanding of the preceding Maastrichtian environmental changes is imperative and the focus of this study.\nOne of thefirst detailed studies on Campanian to earlyMaastrichtian climate is from Shatsky Rise, Pacific Ocean: stable isotope records based on planktic and benthic foraminifera revealed ~2.5 °C and ~4 °C cooling in surface and bottom waters, respectively (Douglas and Savin, 1975). Subsequent studies on Seymour Island, Antarctica, and ODP Site 690 in theWeddell Sea reported ~2 °C cooling in surface and bottomwaters during the early Maastrichtian (Barrera et al., 1987; Barrera and Huber, 1990; Barrera, 1994). The first high-resolution study of Maastrichtian climate and associated faunal turnovers in planktic foraminifera was based on South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A (Li and Keller, 1998a, 1998b; Abramovich and Keller, 2003). These studies revealed that the generally cool Maastrichtian climate was interrupted by two rapid warm events: 1) at the early to late Maastrichtian transition (also known as midMaastrichtian event) with a 2–3 °Cwarming of surface and bottomwaters, and 2) in the latest Maastrichtian below the K/T boundary (C29r) when surface and bottom waters warmed rapidly by 4 °C. An updated high-resolution stable isotope record for the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian at Site 525A confirmed the observed cooling and warming events (Friedrich et al., 2009). Since Li and Keller (1998a, 1998b), the latest Maastrichtian C29r rapid marine warming has been documented globally (e.g., Barrera and Savin, 1999; MacLeod et al., 2005; Isaza-Londoño et al., 2006; Tobin et al., 2012; Thibault and Husson, 2016) and recently linked to the main phase of Deccan volcanism (reviews in Punekar et al., 2014a; Keller et al., 2016a). Some studies correlate the Maastrichtian terrestrial and marine climate records demonstrating that the same extreme climate changes occurred also on land (Nordt et al., 2003; Wilf et al., 2003).\nIn addition to the climate record, various studies focused on Maastrichtian primary productivity, sea-level fluctuations and the marine biotic response to climate changes based on planktic foraminifera (e.g., Li and Keller, 1998a, 1998c; Zepeda, 1998; Premoli Silva and Sliter, 1999; Li et al., 2000; MacLeod et al., 2001; Olsson et al., 2001; Abramovich and Keller, 2002, 2003; Abramovich et al., 2003, 2010; Hart, 2007; Punekar et al., 2014b) and nannofossils (e.g., Eshet and Almogi-Labin, 1996; Friedrich et al., 2005; Thibault and Gardin, 2007, 2010; Gardin et al., 2012; Thibault, 2016; Thibault and Husson, 2016). A particular focus of these studies is the early to late Maastrichtian warming and associated minor extinctions (review in Keller et al., 2016a) as well as the rapid warming during C29r and associated diversity decline (review in Punekar et al., 2014a).\nThe eruption of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) have been shown to be a direct cause for climate change (both cooling and warming), acid rains, ocean acidification and large inputs of toxic metals, as well as an indirect cause for anoxia and changes in sea-level and oceanic circulation disruptions, leading to major faunal turnovers including mass extinctions (e.g., Siberian Traps and Permo-Triassic, Central Atlantic (CAMP) and the Triassic-Jurassic, Deccan Traps and Cretaceous-Tertiary) (Wignall, 2001; Courtillot and Renne, 2003; Bond and Wignall, 2014; Courtillot and Fluteau, 2014). During the Maastrichtian, Ninety East Ridge volcanism in the Indian Ocean was active (e.g., Duncan, 1978, 1991; Pringle et al., 2008; Krishna et al., 2012) and overlapped the eruption of Deccan phase-1 in India (Chenet et al., 2009; Schöbel et al., 2014) potentially contributing to the climate and faunal changes recorded during this time.\nThemain objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental effects of climate change andmajor volcanic eruptions onmarine planktic foraminifer diversity during the Maastrichtian. We test the hypothesis that volcanism was the main driver of the evolutionary diversification in the early Maastrichtian, the likely cause for the early to late Maastrichtian climate warming, and the latest Maastrichtian warming (C29r) and high-stress environments. We focus on five localities from the Indian Ocean (Ninety East Ridge Site 217, Cauvery Basin, SE India), Tethys (El Kef and Elles, Tunisia) and South Atlantic (Site 525A) (Fig. 1). Analyses concentrate on: 1) high-resolution quantitative analysis of planktic foraminifera to determine biostratigraphy and assess the timing and nature of faunal turnovers at Site 217; 2) update taxonomy of the Tethys and South Atlantic sites, and extend the Cauvery Basin record through the early Maastrichtian to compare diversity trends through the Maastrichtian; 3) oxygen and carbon stable isotopes of planktic and benthic foraminifera at Site 217 to evaluate changes in climate and productivity compared with Site 525A; 4) planktic foraminiferal indices, including diversity, dwarfing, planktic/benthic ratio and fragmentation index, to gain a deeper understanding of the changing environment and associated faunal responses; and 5) correlation of sedimentation records, hiatus distribution and sea-level changes across regions Indian, Tethys and South Atlantic oceans to understand regional and global effects of climate and ocean circulation changes."

    "text": "DSDP Site 217 (8°55.57″N, 90°32.33'E) is located in the Indian Ocean on the northernmost part of the Ninety East Ridge at a water depth of 3010 m (Von der Borch et al., 1974). Ninety East Ridge is interpreted as a volcanic chain formed by the northward migration of the Indian plate over the Kerguelen mantle plume that was active from the late Cretaceous to the Paleogene (e.g., Duncan, 1978, 1991; Pringle et al., 2008; Krishna et al., 2012). With the passage over the mantle plume, lithospheric uplift led to the formation of volcanic islands and the deposition of thick ash sequences and shallowwater sediments overlying the basement (Moore et al., 1974; Thompson et al., 1974; Coffin, 1992); passage beyond the mantle plume led to rapid subsidence as the oceanic lithosphere cooled (Sclater and Fisher, 1974; Luyendyk, 1977; Coffin, 1992). Based on a linear progression rate of 118 km/Myr, an age of ~80 Ma was estimated for the location of Site 217 at the time of its position over the mantle plume (Pringle et al., 2008), which is consistent with the Campanian age of the oldest sediments recoveredwith shallow water affinities overlying the basement (Von der Borch et al., 1974). A progressive deepening to a depth of ~1000 m is recorded during the early to late Maastrichtian as indicated by the transition to foraminifera-rich nannofossil ooze (Von der Borch et al., 1974; Tantawy et al., 2009).\nSamples were taken every ~50 cm from cores 17 to 21; planktic foraminifera were originally analyzed by Alfonso Pardo and published in Tantawy et al. (2009). For this study, the species identifications were updated and additional size fractions were analyzed to focus on the very small (38–63 μm), small (63–150 μm) and larger (N150 μm) size\nfractions as environmental indicators. In addition, sample resolution was increased and additional samples were added to extend the record through core 23. A total of 70 samples were analyzed.\nFor paleontological analyses, samples were processed in the laboratory following the procedure described by Keller et al. (2002). Samples were soaked overnight in 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution to oxidize organic carbon. After disaggregation of sediment particles, the samples were washed through N63 μm and N38 μm sieves to obtain clean foraminiferal residues.Washed residueswere oven dried at 50 °C. Quantitative planktic species analyses were performed based on aliquots of 300 specimens in the 38–63 μm, 63–150 μm and N150 μm size fractions, with the remaining residues in each sample fraction examined for rare species. All specimens were identified based on standard taxonomic concepts (Robaszynski et al., 1983-1984; Nederbragt, 1991) and mounted on microslides for a permanent record.\nOxygen and carbon isotope analyses were performed on monospecific benthic foraminiferal tests (Gavelinella beccariformis and Cibicidoides species) in laboratories at Karlsruhe University, Germany, and at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. At the Karlsruhe laboratory, thedatawere obtained using a fully automated preparation system (MultiCarb) connected on-line to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Optima, Micromass Limited UK). All carbon and oxygen isotope values are reported relative to the VPDB standard, with reproducibility better than 0.1 ‰ (2σ). At the UNIL laboratory, analyses were performed for cores 21–23 with a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Bremen, Germany) GasBench II connected to a Thermo Fisher Scientific Delta Plus XL IRMS, in continuous He-flow mode. Analytical uncertainty (2σ) monitored by replicate analyses of the international calcite standard NBS19 (δ13C = +1.95 ‰, δ18O = −2.20 ‰) and the laboratory standard Carrara Marble (δ13C = +2.05 ‰, δ18O = −1.70 ‰) was better than ±0.05 ‰ for δ13C and ±0.1 ‰ for δ18O. Results from both laboratories are comparable based on replicate analyses.\nSpecies diversity was estimated based on cumulative species richness: number of species theoretically present in any given sample from first evolutionary appearance to extinction, ignoring any temporary exclusion (Abramovich and Keller, 2002). Species dwarfing estimates were based on the number of 150–250 μm specimens in the N150 μm size fraction of each sample. The planktic/benthic foraminiferal ratio was based on the number of benthic foraminifera associated\nwith the aliquot of 300 planktic foraminifera used for the quantitative species analysis in the 63–150 μm size fraction.\nThe fragmentation index (FM)was analyzed based on aliquots of approximately 500–700 foraminifera and fragments in the N63 μm size fraction. Three categorieswere identified based on the quality of preservation: 1) nearly perfect tests (good), 2) partially damaged, imperfect tests with holes (fair), and 3) fragments, less than two-thirds of an entire test (poor) (Punekar et al., 2016). The FM index was calculated as fragments %=(fragments/8)/[(fragments/8)+whole tests] (Williams et al., 1985; Malmgren, 1987). Based on the assumption that each test breaks into an average of 8 fragments, the equation requires the total number of counted fragments to be divided by 8 to estimate the original number of whole tests.\nAt the Cauvery Basin, India, we chose the Kali-H subsurface core previously analyzed in Keller et al. (2016b) for the upperMaastrichtian and extended this record through the lower Maastrichtian concentrating on species diversity and ranges from first to last appearances. To insure that the same species concepts were used in faunal analyses, species identifications were updated for the Tunisian sections in Elles and El Kef (Li and Keller, 1998c; Abramovich and Keller, 2002) and South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A (Li and Keller, 1998a)."

    "text": "High-resolution planktic foraminiferal biostratigraphy is a powerful tool for relative age dating and to assess the continuity of sediment deposition. In this study, we apply the Cretaceous foraminiferal (CF) biozonation of Li and Keller (1998a) and correlate the results with localities from the Indian, Tethys and South Atlantic oceans (Fig. 2).\nThe Maastrichtian interval at DSDP Site 217 spans zones CF8 to CF2 and was analyzed in two size fractions, N150 μm to evaluate relative abundances of larger specialized species and 63–150 μm to evaluate the smaller ecological generalist taxa.\nZone CF8 is defined by the first appearance (FA) of Globotruncana aegyptiaca at the base and the FA of Gansserina gansseri at the top (Fig. 2). At Site 217, a 5 m core gap prevents full assessment of zone CF8 and only the upper part may be present, assuming that the first\nappearance of G. aegyptiaca occurs below the analyzed interval (Fig. 3). Nine species appear above the core gap based on both size fractions (N150 μm, 63–150 μm). These species originations are part of the gradual diversification event that began in zone CF8 and was previously observed at Elles and El Kef, Tunisia, and South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A (Li and Keller, 1998a, 1998c).\nZone CF7 spans the interval between the FA of G. gansseri at the base and the FA of Contusotruncana contusa at the top (Fig. 2). At Site 217, a gradual increase in the relative abundance of Gublerina rajagopalani from 6.5 % to 16 % is observed in the N150 μm size fraction (Fig. 3) and in Heterohelix planata from 23 % to 45 % in the 63–150 μm size fraction (Fig. 4). These species have been shown to tolerate and thrive in a\ninifera (N150 μm size fraction) at Ninety East Ridge DSDP Site 217, Indian Ocean.\nwide range of environmental conditions (i.e., dominant in high-stress environments affected by temperature, salinity, nutrients and oxygen variations in which large specialized species struggle to survive), thus their increasing population abundances suggest increasing stressed environments (e.g., Pardo and Keller, 2008; Keller and Abramovich, 2009).\nZoneCF6 is defined by the FA of C. contusa at the base and the last appearance (LA) of Globotruncana linneiana at the top. The latter species also marks the base of zone CF5 and the FA of Racemiguembelina fructicosa defines the top (Fig. 2). At Site 217, zone CF6 is at least partially present, but zone CF5 is not recognized due to a core gap and likely hiatus as just ~2m of sediments represent the combined CF6–CF5 interval (Figs. 3, 4). In contrast, these two zones span 8mand 5m in the Cauvery Basin of SE India (Keller et al., 2016b), 6.5 m and 9.5 m at South Atlantic Site 525A, (Li and Keller, 1998a), 4 m and 13 m at El Kef, and 4.5 m and 6.5 m at Elles, Tunisia (Li and Keller, 1998c), respectively. However, at Site 525A and the Tunisian sections, zone CF6 is condensed (~5m) suggestingwidespread erosion betweenCF5 andCF6, coincident with a sea-level fall andmajor sequence boundary (SB) dated at 69.4Ma (Fig. 2) (Haq et al., 1987; Haq, 2014).\nZone CF4 spans the interval from the FA of R. fructicosa at the base to the FA of Pseudoguembelina hariaensis at the top (Fig. 2). At Site 217, a minor extinction event is marked by the disappearances of Contusotruncana fornicata, C. plummerae and Globotruncana bulloides (Fig. 3). These species disappearances, frequently including Archeoglobigerina cretacea, have also been recognized at Site 525A,Madagascar, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Poland and SE India (Li and Keller, 1998a, 1998c; Abramovich et al., 1998, 2002, 2010; Dubicka and Peryt, 2012; Meilijson et al., 2014; Punekar et al., 2014b; Keller et al., 2016b). Zone CF4 is marked by decreased abundance of Rugoglobigerina rotundata from 10 % to 3 % and R. rugosa from 5 % to 2 %, and increased abundance of G. rajagopalani from 10 % to 43.5 % followed by a rapid decrease to 20 % towards the top of CF4 (Fig. 3). In the smaller size fraction (63– 150 μm), major species variations include decreased abundance of H. planata parallel to increased abundances of Globigerinelloides yaucoensis\nfrom 19 % to 54.5 % and G. asper from 14 % to 36 %, reaching minimum values at the CF4/CF3 boundary (Fig. 4).\nThe CF4/CF3 boundary is marked by a hiatus as suggested by the abrupt decrease in all larger (N150 μm) species abundances (Fig. 3) and increase in very small stress-tolerant species (e.g., globigerinelloides, globotruncanellids, hedbergellids, guembelitrids, Fig. 4). A hiatus at the CF4/CF3 transition coincides with a major sealevel fall and SB ~66.8 Ma (Haq et al., 1987; Haq, 2014) and is recorded worldwide (e.g., SE India, Keller et al., 2016b; Madagascar, Abramovich et al., 2002; Israel, Abramovich et al., 1998; Fig. 2).\nZone CF3 is defined by the FA of P. hariaensis at the base and the LAof G. gansseri at the top (Fig. 2). At Site 217, G. rajagopalani and Pseudoguembelina palpebra dominate and Abathomphalus mayaroensis is common in the N150 μm size fraction of zone CF3 assemblages (Fig 3). Dwarfed specimens are common in several horizons (424.08 m, 424.59 m, 425.19 m, 426.70 m, 432.96 m, and 441.58m). In the smaller size fraction (63–150 μm) Heterohelix, Globigerinelloides, and Globotruncanella (havanensis, petaloidea) species dominate (Fig. 4). The disaster opportunist Guembelitria cretacea records increased abundances from1 % to 5 % on average. These faunal changes indicate continued and even increasing high-stress environments during zone CF3 compared with zone CF4 (e.g., Pardo and Keller, 2008; Keller and Abramovich, 2009).\nThe CF3/CF2 transition is represented by a hiatus marked by abrupt changes in the relative abundances of larger species (Fig. 3) and smaller species (Fig. 4). This hiatus coincides with a sea-level fall ~66.25 Ma (Haq et al., 1987; Haq, 2014) and is commonly observed in the Indian and Tethys Oceans (e.g., Abramovich et al., 1998, 2002; Keller, 2005; Tantawy et al., 2009; Punekar et al., 2014b; Fig. 2).\nZone CF2 spans the interval from the LA of G. gansseri at the base to the FA of Plummerita hantkeninoides at the top (Fig. 2). At Site 217, this zone is marked by decreased abundance of Gublerina rajagopalani from 27 % to 10 % and increased Pseudoguembelina palpebra from 12 % to 20 % in the N150 μm size fraction (Fig. 3). In the 63–150 μm size fraction,\nsmall species abruptly increase (e.g., Heterohelix, Globigerinella, Globotruncanella, Hedbergella). Pseudoguembelina costulata, a surface dweller, dominates both the larger and the smaller size fractions towards the top of the section, with peak abundances of 31 % and 20 %, respectively. This change is accompanied by a rapid increase in the abundance of Guembelitria species in the 38–63 μm size fraction suggesting severe high-stress environments just before the KTB hiatus (Fig. 4).\nAt Site 217, a major hiatus (~2 Myr) spans from the upper part of zone CF2 through the latest Maastrichtian zone CF1 and early Danian zones P0, P1a, P1b and lower P1c (Fig. 2). On a global basis, erosion is less extensive in this interval but marked by repeated short hiatuses. This erosion pattern is commonly attributed to rapid climate changes, periods of global cooling, intensified bottom-water circulation, and sea-level fluctuations across the K/T transition (e.g., MacLeod and Keller, 1991; Keller et al., 2013; Mateo et al., 2016)."

    "text": "Biostratigraphic correlation of localities across the Indian, Tethys and South Atlantic oceans compared with major sea-level changes and volcanic eruptions in India (Deccan Traps) and Ninety East Ridge reveal similarities and differences in sedimentation related to these events (Fig. 2). Although the current study concentrates on the Maastrichtian, the early Paleocene (Danian) record is also shown as it illustrates the pivotal change in sediment deposition and erosion pattern that began in the late Maastrichtian zone CF3.\nThe early Maastrichtian sediment record across the regions is remarkably continuous despite major sea-level fluctuations, Ninety East Ridge volcanic eruptions and associated climate changes (Fig. 2). The only significant interruption coincides with the sea-level fall and sequence boundary (SB) at ~69.4 Ma (Haq, 2014) correlative with zone CF5. The likely reasons for the reduced sediment erosion include lowermagnitude of sea-level changes, overall higher Cretaceous oceans inundating continents, higher rate of carbonate sedimentation and relatively low levels of volcanic eruptions.\nFig. 5.Maastrichtian stable isotopic data of benthic foraminifera (Gavelinella beccariformis and C East Ridge DSDP Site 217, Indian Ocean, as compared with South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A (Li an low-resolution record at Site 525A (Li and Keller, 1998a) is consistent with high-resolution rec\nIn contrast, sedimentation is highly fragmented during the latest Maastrichtian beginning in zone CF3 and continuing through the early Danian, except for areas protected from erosion, particularly in Tunisia (Fig. 2). Sediment erosion (hiatus) generally coincides with sea-level changes in zones CF4/CF3, CF3/CF2, KTB, P1a/P1b, P1b/P1c and P1c/P2. On Ninety East Ridge, Southeast India (Cauvery Basin), Madagascar and South Atlantic, erosion removed sediments spanning most of the early Danian and frequently through the KTB and zones CF1–CF2. This massive erosion is also observed in the North Atlantic (Keller et al., 2013; Mateo et al., 2016) and appears related to the significant sealevel fall at ~63.8 Ma, but a series of smaller sea-level falls contributed to erosion that resulted in shorter hiatuses observed in the Tethys (e.g., Israel, Egypt) and many deep-sea sections. However, the major erosion observed during the latest Maastrichtian through Danian can be attributed to the overall cooler climate (except for the shortwarming in C29r), lower sea-level and higher frequency of sea-level falls beginning in CF3 (C30n)."

    "text": "Carbon and oxygen isotopes of the benthic foraminifera Gavelinella beccariformis were analyzed for the Maastrichtian at Site 217, except for zone CF8where this species is rare and Cibicidoides species were analyzed instead. Both of these species are commonly used to evaluate deep-water changes in productivity and temperature (e.g., Shackleton, 1987; Zachos et al., 1989; Schrag et al., 1995; D'Hondt and Arthur, 2002). Although Site 217 has a fragmented record because of frequent core gaps, δ13C and δ18O trends are similar to Site 525A (Li and Keller, 1998a), except for zones CF8–CF7. At Site 217, δ13C values are significantly higher in CF8 (+1.46 ‰) and fluctuating in CF7 (+0.90 to +1.93‰) compared to Site 525A (+0.33‰ and+0.50 to+1.17‰, respectively) (Fig. 5). At Site 525A, δ13C values record an increase of +1.5 ‰ through the early Maastrichtian that is not observed at Site 217 (Fig. 5). This difference likely reflects higher, more stable primary productivity at Site 217 due to higher nutrient inputs from Ninety East Ridge volcanism that began ~82 Ma (Coffin et al., 2002).

Note that in these sections only part of zone CF8 is present but the number of species originations not yet reached at these sites can still be estimated based on Tunisia and Site 525A. At El Kef, 21 species originations occurred in the early Maastrichtian, which is comparable to Elles with 18 species (Fig. 8). At Site 525A, 23 species originations are identified during this interval (Fig. 9). Most of these species are also present in the Indian Ocean Site 217 and Kali-H but the first appearances of some are not recorded because of incomplete core recovery. If we add those first appearances, then species originations at Site 217 and Kali-H increase to 22 and 25 species, respectively (Table 1). Elles and Site 525A also show 7 and 6 species originations in zones CF9–CF8b, indicating gradual diversification already beginning in the latest Campanian.\nMost of the species originations occurred among subsurface and thermocline dwellers. The latter probably originated as subsurface dwellers that later migrated to thermocline depths during warm intervals and increased water mass stratification (Abramovich et al., 2003). Originations are likely due to a major increase in nutrient availability driving primary productivity (Fig. 5) and faunal diversification (Hallock, 1987). Ninety East Ridge volcanismwas probably amajor contributor of nutrients in the Indian Ocean as suggested by the inferred total number of species originations (22 at Site 217, 25 at Kali-H; Table 1) although recovery is incomplete for the base CF8–CF9 interval (Figs. 6, 7).

    "text": "Aminor extinction event coincides with the end of climate warming in the early late Maastrichtian and is commonly known as “midMaastrichtian event” (e.g., MacLeod, 1994; Barrera and Savin, 1999; Li and Keller, 1998a, 1999; Nordt et al., 2003; Frank et al., 2005; Friedrich et al., 2009; Keller et al., 2016a; Thibault, 2016). This midMaastrichtian event is also observed in all sections analyzed for this study.\nAt Site 217, this minor extinction event is observed at the CF4/CF3 transition and marked by the disappearances of Contusotruncana fornicata, C. plummerae and Globotruncana bulloides, with Archeoglobigerina cretacea and Gublerina acuta disappearing in zone CF3 above the CF4/CF3 hiatus (Fig. 6). In the Cauvery Basin Kali-H well, this event also includes the disappearances of C. fornicata, C. plummerae, as well as A. cretacea, G. acuta and Globotruncana esnehensis. Because the latter two species are known to range higher in the stratigraphic record (e.g., Li and Keller, 1998a; Abramovich and Keller, 2002; Abramovich et al., 2002; Darvishzad et al., 2007; Huber et al., 2008; Punekar et al., 2014b), their early disappearance in the Indian Ocean suggests regional differences (e.g., diachronous occurrences) in species ranges.\nAt El Kef and Elles, the disappearances of C. fornicata and C. plummerae occur in zone CF5, rather than CF4 (Fig. 8). At El Kef, this may be due to the incomplete Maastrichtian record cut by major faults, but at Elles the late Maastrichtian is undisturbed, suggesting that the zone CF4 index species R. fructicosa may be diachronous in the shallower middle shelf environment, or that high-stress conditions were more severe in shallower environments (e.g., Leckie, 1987). At Site 525A, C. fornicata, G. bulloides, C. plummerae, A. cretacea and Globotruncana ventricosa gradually disappear in zone CF4 (Fig. 9). This minor extinction event has also been recorded in Madagascar, Israel, Egypt and Poland (Abramovich et al., 2002, 2010; Dubicka and Peryt, 2012; Punekar et al., 2014b; Keller et al., 2016a). From shallow to\ndeep environments, this faunal turnover seems to have been the result of global environmental perturbations that coincide with the transition fromwarm to cool climate (Fig. 5) associated with reduced water mass stratification, increased competition and biotic stress leading to the extinction of specialized subsurface and thermocline dwelling species."

In zones CF2–CF1, diversity gradually decreased along with further reduction in specialist species populations prior to the very rapid mass extinction at the K/T boundary (Figs. 8, 9). Environmental changes in zones CF2–CF1 have been widely studied and recently linked to the massive Deccan eruptions and volcanic degassing that led to climate warming, eutrophication and ocean acidification contributing to this major biotic crisis (e.g., Punekar et al., 2014a, 2016; Font et al., 2014, 2016; Thibault, 2016)."

    "text": "Planktic foraminiferal assemblages consist of three main ecological groups: specialists, generalists and disaster opportunists. Specialists species, known as K-strategists, are diverse species with large, complex tests, that tolerate a narrow range of environmental conditions, have long life spans and produce a small number of offspring (Begon et al., 1996, 1998). A common group of K-strategists includes species of the genera Abathomphalus, Archeoglobigerina, Contusotruncana, Globotruncana, Globotruncanita, Gublerina, Planoglobulina, Pseudoguembelina, Pseudotextularia, Racemiguembelina and Rugoglobigerina (Premoli Silva and Sliter, 1999; Keller and Abramovich, 2009). These species are most abundant in stable environmentswith oligotrophic conditions, which foster optimumassemblages\nwith high species diversity, a variety of test sizes, morphologies and ornamentation (e.g., Premoli Silva and Sliter, 1999; Pardo and Keller, 2008; Keller and Abramovich, 2009).\nGeneralist and disaster opportunist species are known as ecological R-strategists: low-diversity species assemblages with relatively small, simple tests, able to occupy a wide range of ecological niches, have shorter life spans and produce larger numbers of offspring, thus maximizing their chance for survival (Begon et al., 1996, 1998; Premoli Silva and Sliter, 1999; Keller and Abramovich, 2009). Generalists are represented by species of the genera Globigerinelloides, Globotruncanella, Hedbergella and Heterohelix. They tend to dominate high-stress environments affected by temperature, salinity, nutrients and oxygen variations inwhich large specialized species struggle to survive. Heterohelix species are common under mesotrophic conditions in lowoxygen environments, usually thrivingduring times of an expanded oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) (Pardo and Keller, 2008), while Globigerinelloides species are most abundant in extreme eutrophic conditions (Ashckenazi-Polivoda et al., 2011). Disaster opportunists, such\nas Guembelitria species, thrived under themost severe biotic stress conditions generally associated with mesotrophic to eutrophic conditions in shallow continental shelves, upwelling areas and volcanically influenced regions (e.g., Kroon and Nederbragt, 1990; Koutsoukos, 1994; Coccioni and Luciani, 2006; Pardo and Keller, 2008; Keller and Abramovich, 2009; Ashckenazi-Polivoda et al., 2014; Punekar et al., 2014a).\nPlanktic foraminifera also occupy a wide variety of ecological niches at various depths in the water column. Previous studies determined species depth ranking in the water column based on their oxygen and carbon isotopic signals and grouped them into surface, subsurface, thermocline and deep dwellers (Abramovich et al., 2003, 2011; Ashckenazi-Polivoda et al., 2014). Diversity and abundance changes for each depth group can be used to interpret changes in climate and water mass stratification as well as paleoecology.\nAt Site 217, generalist species dominate the 63–150 μm size fraction, particularly Heterohelix and Globigerinelloides species, which are most abundant from zone CF8 to CF5 and from zone CF4 to CF3, respectively\n(Fig. 10), suggestingmesotrophic to eutrophic surfacewater conditions. A significant increase, from 4 % to 13 %, inGlobotruncanella species is observed in zone CF3 in the predominantly smaller 63–150 μm size fraction, indicating dwarfing due to increased biotic stress. Specialist species are the second-most abundant group in the assemblage with dwarfed pseudoguembelinids dominating. Disaster opportunist Guembelitria cretacea is present throughout the section but rare (b1 %) except for the upper part of zone CF4 through CF3 and CF2 where relative abundances average 5 %; maximum peaks of 43 % are observed in zone CF2 in the dwarfed 38–63 μm size fraction (Fig. 10). This increased abundance indicates increasing environmental stress mainly in zones CF3–CF2 compared with the lower part of the section. Overall, dwarfed specialists (pseudoguembelinids), a marked faunal turnover at the CF4/ CF3 transition, and presence of dwarfed Guembelitria with peak abundance in zone CF2 reveal increased biotic and environmental stress conditions from the early to the late Maastrichtian.\nThe N150 μm size fraction is dominated by specialist species with different degrees of environmental tolerance. Pseudoguembelinids, which are the only large surface dwellers with significant abundance, appear to be themost tolerant as evident by their maximum abundance (6.5 % to 32 %) during the increasingly high-stress environment of zones\nCF3–CF2 (Fig. 11). In contrast, the subsurface and thermocline dwelling globotruncanids appear less tolerant of environmental fluctuations as indicated by their permanent decrease beginning in zone CF3. A similar lack of tolerance in CF3–CF2 environments is observed in the subsurface dwelling rugoglobigerinids. Reduced abundance of subsurface dwellers appears to be the result of reduced water mass stratification that led to decreased ecological niches and increased competition.\nSmall heterohelicids generally dominate among generalists, H. globulosa, H. planata, and H. (Paraspiroplecta) navarroensis, but Gublerina rajagopalani, a deep dweller, is the most abundant species in the larger N150 μm size fraction at Site 217 (Fig. 11). The high abundance of this large, robust and thick-walled species may be attributed primarily to selective preservation during carbonate dissolution. Noteworthy is the peak in the surface dweller Guembelitria in the 38–63 μm size fraction in zone CF2 (Fig. 10) coincident with dominance of large surface dwellers in the N150 μm size fraction (Fig. 11b), which suggests further reduction in habitats for deeper dwellers. Stable isotope ranking shows that Guembelitria thrived at the very sea-surface (Pardo and Keller, 2008; Abramovich et al., 2011; Ashckenazi-Polivoda et al., 2014) where CO2 uptake from the air mitigates ocean acidification that affects other surface and\nasin well Kali-H, India (Keller et al., 2016b), El Kef and Elles, Tunisia (Li and Keller, 1998c; r zone represent averages; some speciesmayhave been grouped or not recognized because g the CF8a–CF5 diversification event (based on the complete records of Elles and Site 525A)\nsubsurface dwellers. All of these species population changes indicate increased high-stress environments beginning in CF4, increasing through CF3 and further increasing in CF2, as a result of reduced water mass stratification, reduced ecological niches and increased carbonate dissolution for planktic foraminifera.\n6.2. Dwarfing\nSpecies dwarfing refers to size reductions as a result of high-stress environments commonly associated with rapid climate change, perturbations in the water column and/or mesotrophic conditions (Abramovich andKeller, 2003; Keller and Abramovich, 2009). It is a survival response that enhances reproduction rates through early sexual maturation (i.e., organisms reach reproductive adulthood much below normal size; MacLeod et al., 2000; Keller and Abramovich, 2009).\nAt Site 217, there is a gradual trend throughout the section towards increased dwarfing suggesting a progressive increase in high-stress environmental conditions (Fig. 12). In zone CF8, the assemblage in the N150 μm size fraction is dominated by specimens N250 μm in size averaging 72 %. From zones CF7 to CF3, specimens in the 150–250 μmgroup are more abundant with an average of 52 %. In zone CF2, dwarfed specimens dominate averaging 60 % in the 150–250 μm group but several horizons have b50 specimens (e.g., 424.08 m, 424.59 m, 425.19 m, 426.70 m, 432.96 m). This indicates more severe environmental conditions associated with increased competition due to reduced water mass stratification and possibly carbonate dissolution. Similar results have been reported from wells in the Cauvery Basin, India, where planktic foraminifer diversity drops sharply and species tend to be dwarfed in the upper part of zone CF3 pointing to high biotic stress (Keller et al., 2016b)."

    "heading": "6.3. Dissolution (Fragmentation index)",
    "text": "Preservation of planktic foraminiferal tests ismainly controlled by 1) seawater saturation with respect to CaCO3 in the water column, and 2) the amount of organic matter buried in CaCO3 rich sediments (e.g., Emerson and Bender, 1981). Dissolution is assessed based on 1) fragmentation index, 2) preferential preservation of robust planktic foraminiferal morphologies (species-selective dissolution), and 3) planktic/ benthic (P/B) ratio of foraminifera (e.g., Parker and Berger, 1971; Thunell, 1976). The fragmentation index is calculated using the percentage of planktic foraminiferal fragments relative to the total number of whole tests and consists of three categories, “good”, “fair” and “poor” based on the quality of preservation: good = nearly perfect tests, fair = imperfect tests, and poor = fragments (Punekar et al., 2016).\nAt Site 217, the “fair” group is the most abundant resulting in ~58 % from zone CF8 to the lower part of zone CF4 (Fig. 12). The “poor” group increases in the upper part of zone CF4 and dominates (91 %) in CF3. In contrast, zone CF2 is dominated by the “fair” group (~48 %), similar to lower CF4. Just below the hiatus in CF2 at the top of the section, the “poor” group dominates (70 %). The “good” group is a relatively minor component and maintains an average of only 13 %.\nThese results indicate that dissolution effects aremost severe in zone CF3, as also evident by the dominance of robust, thick-walled and dissolution-resistant planktic species (e.g., G. rajagopalani, P. palpebra and A. mayaroensis, Fig. 3). Climate cooling in zone CF3 and the accompanying intensified bottom water circulation likely exacerbated effects of dissolution as suggested by the fragmentation ofmost foraminifera in this interval. Relative abundance of benthic compared to planktic foraminifera increase from 9 % in zones CF8–CF5 to 46 % in zone CF4 and dominate in zones CF3–CF2 with an average of 61 % (Fig. 12). These results reveal\nthat at Site 217 increased dissolution actually started in zone CF4 and was persistent through CF2, as benthic foraminifera are less vulnerable to dissolution than planktic foraminifera. Planktic foraminifera dominate again (90 %) just below the KTB hiatus in zone CF2, coincident with increased abundance of surface dwellers, including peak abundance of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria cretacea (Figs. 10, 11). This suggests severe high-stress environmental conditions detrimental to all but sea-surface dwellers. Ocean acidification and reduced water mass stratification are likely contributors to the biotic stress that affected planktic foraminiferal assemblages during zones CF4–CF2."

    "text": "The Cretaceous greenhouse warming ended in the late Campanian with global cooling that reached minimum temperatures in the earliest Maastrichtian (base C31r) accompanied by low primary productivity and low diversity in planktic foraminifera (Fig. 13) (e.g., Li and Keller, 1998a; Huber et al., 2002; Friedrich et al., 2009). From the latest Campanian through the Maastrichtian, four major climate and faunal events are identified in the South Atlantic, Tethys and Indian Oceans: (1) minimumdiversity in the late Campanian to earliestMaastrichtian followed by unprecedented diversification for the Cretaceous reachingmaximum in the early Maastrichtian (Event-1, C31r), (2) a period of warming and stable high diversity (Event-2, upper C31r to lower C30n), (3) return to global cooling and high-stress environments (Event-3, C30n), and (4) rapid global warming and severe stress conditions in the late Maastrichtian preceding the K/T mass extinction (Event-4, C29r). Here we summarize these climate and faunal events based on stable isotopes and diversity records of South Atlantic Site 525A (Li and Keller, 1998a) comparedwith diversity curves from four localities in the Tethys and Indian oceans (Fig. 13).\n7.1. Event-1: Early Maastrichtian cooling and diversification\nThe prelude to Event-1 is the late Campanian climate cooling (C32n, zones CF9–CF8) when bottom water temperatures dropped from 16 °C to 10 °C, surface water temperatures from 22 °C to 17 °C, and primary productivity and planktic foraminiferal diversity were relatively low (Fig. 13) (Li and Keller, 1998a). Event-1 spans most of the early\nMaastrichtian (zones CF8b–CF6, C31r) with steady cold bottom water temperatures and gradual cooling of surface waters. δ13C values rapidly increased by +1 ‰ and +1.4 ‰ in bottom and surface waters, respectively, indicating a major increase in primary productivity. Increasing primary productivity in the early Maastrichtian is also observed in northern middle to high latitudes as indicated by calcareous nannofossils and benthic foraminiferal assemblages (Friedrich et al., 2005). At Site 217, primary productivity was already high due to nutrient influx from Ninety East Ridge (Fig. 5). Planktic foraminifera responded with rapid evolutionary diversification among subsurface and thermocline dwellers (Fig. 13). Species originations vary from 45 % to 57 % (e.g., low of 35–42 to high of 55–61 species) among the five localities analyzed.\nWhat could have caused the diversity decrease during the late Campanian cooling and the rapid diversification during the subsequent maximum cooling of the early Maastrichtian? The late Campanian cooling that ended the late Cretaceous greenhouse world is commonly attributed to a combination of declining atmospheric CO2 related to decreasing oceanic crust production and the opening of ocean gateways that profoundly affected deep, intermediate and shallowwaters circulation patterns (review in Linnert et al., 2014). Specialist planktic foraminifera were ill-suited to adapt to these environmental changes and many disappeared. By the earliest Maastrichtian maximum cooling, decreased diversity, reduced competition and high nutrient availability created favorable conditions for species originations (Li and Keller, 1998a, 1998c). High nutrient inputs were likely due to several factors including (1) increased temperature gradient between equator and poles favoring development of zonal winds and thus coastal upwelling of nutrient-rich waters (e.g., Vincent and Berger, 1985; Zachos et al., 1993), (2) increased erosion and nutrient influx from the continents during the sea-level lowstand ~70.6 Ma (Haq, 2014), and (3) nutrient inputs from Ninety East Ridge volcanic activity (e.g., Vermeij, 1995) active since ~82 Ma (Coffin et al., 2002; Pringle et al., 2008)."

    "text": "Event-2, also known as mid-Maastrichtian event, begins near the end of the early Maastrichtian and persists through upper zones CF6 to middle CF4 (C31n) (Fig. 13). Bottom and surface waters warmed by\n2–3 °C and terrestrial temperatures peaked at 22 °C (e.g., Li and Keller, 1998a; Zepeda, 1998; Nordt et al., 2003; Thibault and Gardin, 2007). High primary productivity and maximum diversity in planktic foraminifera persisted through this interval (Li and Keller, 1998a). The cause for this warming, attributed to abrupt reorganization of intermediate oceanic circulation, has long been an enigma (Frank and Arthur, 1999; Li and Keller, 1999), but recent studies suggest the cause could have been Ninety East Ridge volcanism (Keller et al., 2016a). An intense phase of volcanic activity is recorded at DSDP Site 216 beginning ~69.5Ma and spanning zones CF5–CF3 coincident with persistentmaximum diversity, high primary productivity, climate warming and increased water mass stratification favoring planktic foraminiferal evolution (Keller, 2005; Tantawy et al., 2009).\nDeccan volcanism began near the end of Event-2 at the base of C30n (~67.1 Ma, Schöbel et al., 2014) further contributing to intense greenhouse warming and acid rains enhancing the delivery of nutrients to the oceans, thus resulting in mesotrophic conditions in surface waters favoring primary productivity. Faunal responses to these high-stress conditions include peak abundance of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria cretacea, and onset of the terminal decrease in large specialized globotruncanid species.\nEnhanced weathering and probably waning volcanism eventually lowered volcanic CO2 levels in the atmosphere resulting in climate cooling (e.g., Dessert et al., 2001), as observed in the upper part of zone CF4 (Fig. 13). Coolingwould have further affected planktic foraminiferal assemblages by leading to reduced water mass stratification as temperature gradients between surface and deep waters decreased (e.g., Doney et al., 2012), thus resulting in reduced ecological niches and disappearance of some species (e.g., minor extinction event), marking the end of diversification."

Faunal responses include species dwarfing, decreased populations of specialized species, temporary exclusions, dominance by generalist and/or disaster opportunist species and general diversity decrease, as observed in the Indian Ocean, Tethys and South Atlantic Oceans.\nWhat caused the diversity decline during cooling in the late Maastrichtian instead of a diversity increase as observed during the early Maastrichtian cooling? Volcanism was active on Ninety East Ridge and in India (Deccan phase-1) but on relatively reduced levels during zone CF3 (C30n; Keller, 2005; Chenet et al., 2009) and insufficient to sustain global warming but sufficient to cause persistent ocean acidification, which stressed already reduced habitats. Large amounts of volcanogenic CO2 adsorpt by the oceans changes seawater chemistry by lowering carbonate ion (CO32−) concentration, surface ocean pH and saturation states of calcium carbonate minerals (Kump et al., 2009). The result is a carbonate crisis (i.e., decrease in CaCO3 production) that significantly affects marine ecosystems, particularly marine calcifiers such as foraminifera (reviews in Doney et al., 2009; Hönisch et al., 2012). At Site 217, dissolution due to surface ocean acidification led to thinner planktic foraminiferal tests, thus more vulnerable to breakage (e.g., Moy et al., 2009), resulting in the high fragmentation index observed in zone CF3 (Fig. 12). Dissolution effects in other localities have not been routinely recorded and still have to be evaluated, although similar effects have been observed in zones CF4–CF3 in the Cauvery Basin (Keller et al., 2016b) and Site 525A (Punekar et al., unpublished data). Enhanced weathering and a major sea-level fall (~66.8 Ma) accompanied by widespread erosion also contributed to global cooling as well as increased nutrient input into the\noceans leading to mesotrophic conditions, detrimental to planktic foraminifera."

This interval has been discussed in several recent publications in which Deccan volcanism is directly associated to the K/T mass extinction in India (Keller et al., 2011; Gertsch et al., 2011), U-Pb dating of lava flows narrow the main phase of eruptions to just 250 kyr below the KTB (Schoene et al., 2015), and global faunal and geochemical studies point toDeccan volcanism as amajor trigger of the K/Tmass extinction (e.g., Font et al., 2014, 2016; Punekar et al., 2014a, 2016), whereas others proposed a link between accelerated Deccan volcanism and the Chicxulub impact (Richards et al., 2015; Renne et al., 2015)."

    "heading": "8. Conclusions",
    "text": "From the latest Campanian through the Maastrichtian, four major climate and faunal events are identified that ultimately ended with the K/T mass extinction.\n• Event-1: Maximum cooling in the early Maastrichtian (zones CF8blower CF6; C31r) is associated with rapid planktic foraminiferal species originations reaching maximum Cretaceous diversity as a result of increased nutrient input due to enhanced upwelling, costal erosion and/or volcanic activity. • Event-2: Warming during the early/late Maastrichtian transition (mid-Maastrichtian event; CF5 to lower CF4; upper C31r-C31n) is attributed to Ninety East Ridge volcanic activity that records an intense phase of eruptions at Site 216 in zones CF5–CF3. Warming led to increased water mass stratification that sustained maximum diversity. • Aminor extinction event ends Event 2 andmarks the onset of increasingly more stressful marine conditions for planktic foraminifera particularly specialized species living in subsurface and thermocline depths. • Event-3: Return to maximum cooling in zone CF3 (C30n) increased stress conditions for marine calcifiers leading to reduced specialized species populations, dwarfing, and dominance of smaller ecological generalists able to tolerate ongoing environmental changes. The global cooling and faunal turnover likely resulted from increased CO2 uptake by the oceans as a result of Ninety East Ridge and Deccan Trap volcanism, increased weathering after the greenhouse warming in the early-late Maastrichtian transition, ocean acidification and mesotrophic conditions. • Event-4: Massive Deccan volcanic eruptions (phase-2) in zones CF2– CF1 spanning the last 250 kyr of the Maastrichtian (C29r) coincident with increasingly high-stress environments, decreasing abundance of large specialized species and dominance of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria cretacea. In the Indian Ocean, South Atlantic and eastern Tethys a major KTB hiatus is present. • Positive and negative effects observed in planktic species diversification and population abundance variations through the Maastrichtian can be linked to volcanism. Positive effects correlate with increased nutrient input, increased water mass stratification and increased ecological niches during climate warming. Negative effects can be linked\nto increased tempo and rate of volcanism resulting in ocean acidification, carbonate crisis and extinction."

  "abstractText": "Article history: Received 17 January 2017 Accepted 19 January 2017 Available online 20 January 2017 Planktic foraminiferal analysis, including species populations, diversity trends, high-stress indices and stable isotopes of the latest Campanian through Maastrichtian in the South Atlantic, Tethys and Indian oceans reveal four major climate and faunal events that endedwith the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K/Pg), formerly Cretaceous-Tertiary (K/T),mass extinction. The prelude to these events is the late Campanian cooling that reachedminimum temperatures in the earliest Maastrichtian (base C31r) correlative with low primary productivity and species diversity. Event-1 begins during the persistent cool climate of the earlyMaastrichtian (lower C31r) when primary productivity rapidly increased accompanied by rapid species originations, attributed to increased nutrient influx from increased upwelling, erosion during the sea-level fall ~70.6 Ma, and Ninety East Ridge volcanism. During Event-2 (upper C31r to lower C30n), climate rapidly warmed by 2–3 °C in deep waters and peaked at 22 °C on land, primary productivity remainedhigh and diversification reachedmaximum for the entire Cretaceous.We attribute this climate warming to intense Ninety East Ridge volcanic activity beginning ~69.5Ma, accompanied by rapid reorganization of intermediate oceanic circulation. Enhanced greenhouse conditions due to the eruption of Deccan Phase-1 in India resulted in detrimental conditions for planktic foraminifera marking the end of diversification. Global cooling resumed in Event-3 (C30n), species diversity declined gradually accompanied by dwarfing, decreased large specialized species, increased small ecologically tolerant taxa, and ocean acidification. Event-3 is mainly the result of enhanced weathering and volcanogenic CO2 adsorption by the oceans during the preceding warm Event-2 that led to cooling and lower pH in the surface ocean. Event-4 marks the last 250 kyr of the Maastrichtian (C29r), which began with the largest Deccan eruptions (Phase-2) that caused rapid climate warming of 4 °C in deep waters and 8 °C on land, acid rain and ocean acidification leading to a major carbonate crisis preceding the K/T mass extinction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
