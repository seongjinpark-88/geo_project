DeMenocal\nKeywords: Cretaceous pCO2 pedogenic carbonate carbon isotopes Gyeongsang Basin\nStudying the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (pCO2) regulating temperature during the Cretaceous is important to understand the evolution of the Cretaceous climate. However, the pCO2 variation during the Cretaceous remains uncertain. Here we present a new paleo-pCO2 variation record spanning the Barremian to Maastrichtian time. The new paleo-pCO2 calculations are based on analyses of pedogenic carbonate from the Gyeongsang Basin, Korea and data from the literature on pedogenic carbonates. Our results show that the mid-Cretaceous pCO2 levels were higher than those observed during the Early and the Late Cretaceous, and that the highest pCO2 was achieved between the Cenomanian and the Turonian. This pCO2 trend is in agreement with the paleotemperature records. Our results also show that three intervals of low pCO2 (b400 ppmV) in the Early and the Late Cretaceous seem to be associated with climatic changes suggestive of glacial episodes. These results suggest that the Cretaceous climatic change was associated with pCO2 variations. Variations in the rate of outgassing caused by variations of oceanic crust production rate have been known as a major cause of the mid-Cretaceous warmth. However, our results show the discrepancy in the timing between the highest rate of oceanic crust production and the highest pCO2 levels during the mid-Cretaceous. We interpret that large subaerial volcanisms in the Caribbean and Madagascar Large Igneous Provinces were instrumental for providing additional CO2 to the atmosphere, resulting in the warmest midCretaceous.\n© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The proxy evidence for paleoclimatic changes suggested that (i) the paleotemperatures between the Cenomanian and the Turonian were the warmest during the Cretaceous (Pucéat et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2002), (ii) the Early and Late Cretaceous were cooler than the mid-Cretaceous (Pucéat et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2002), and (iii) there were several time intervals indicating possible existence of an ice sheet during the Cretaceous (Alley and Frakes, 2003; Bochum et al., 2009; De Lurio and Frakes, 1999; Frakes and Francis, 1988; Haq et al., 1987; Miller et al., 2007; Stoll and Schrag, 1996). However, the geochemical carbon cycle models provide a broad picture of pCO2 variations, showing reduction in pCO2 from the Early to Late Cretaceous (Berner, 2008; Tajika, 1999). In addition, the existing estimates from geochemical proxies (Fletcher et al., 2008; Haworth et al., 2005; Quan et al., 2009) lack the resolution necessary to examine the changes in pCO2 during the Cretaceous. Thus, the relationship between the paleotemperature and pCO2 variation is not yet clearly defined. Also, due to low-resolution of existing paleo-pCO2 record, the discussion of possible pCO2 forcing factors including rate of oceanic crust production is still under debate.\n82 2 878 0252.\nl rights reserved.\nPedogenic carbonates have been regarded as good proxies for the reconstruction of paleoatmospheric pCO2 (Cerling, 1999). However, pedogenic carbonates have provided significantly higher pCO2 levels than those provided by other proxies. It is notable that pCO2 reconstructions using pedogenic carbonates show large fluctuations in pCO2 levels over geologically brief periods of time; the reason for these large fluctuations cannot be readily explained. Breecker et al. (2010) pointed out that the previous studies using pedogenic carbonates for paleo-pCO2 reconstructions assumed very high soil-respired CO2 concentration [S(z)] values and, therefore, the reported atmospheric pCO2 levels of the Cretaceous are too high in comparison with other methods used. In this study it will be shown that lower S(z) values, reflecting climate condition of region studied, provide more reasonable paleo-pCO2 concentrations for the Cretaceous.\nThe Gyeongsang Basin, the largest Cretaceous non-marine basin located in Southeast Korea, contains several pedogenic carbonatebearing strata, whose age ranges from the Aptian to the Campanian (Fig. 1); the pedogenic carbonate records are obtained over this period. In this study, first we present the carbon isotope data of pedogenic carbonates formed during the Aptian–Cenomanian and the earliest Campanian in the Gyeongsang Basin, and the corresponding atmospheric pCO2 estimates. Then, we present a high-resolution Cretaceous pCO2 trend reconstructed by combining the results of this study with the recalculated pCO2 levels obtained from the literature using more reasonable S(z) values by considering paleoclimatic\nconditions under which pedogenic carbonate-bearing paleosols were formed."

    "text": "Cretaceous rocks in the Gyeongsang Basin (Gyeongsang Supergroup) are divided into three groups; namely, the Sindong, Hayang, and Yucheon groups with decreasing age (Fig. 1; Chang, 1975). The Sindong Group consists of alluvial (Nakdong Fm.), fluvial (Hasandong Fm.) and lacustrine sediments (Jinju Fm.) (Fig. 1) (Choi, 1985). After deposition of the Sindong group sediments, the Gyeongsang Basin was subdivided into, from north to south, the Yeongyang, Euiseong, and Milyang subbasins by volcanism and block faulting (Fig. 1) (Chang, 1975). For this study, the succession from the Milyang Subbasin was chosen for sampling. The Hayang Group in the Milyang Subbasin comprises the Chilgok, Silla, Haman, and Jindong Formations in ascending order (Fig. 1). Volcanism occurred intermittently in the northern part of the Milyang Subbasin, where the strata correlative to the Jindong Formation in the southern part are subdivided into the Banyaweol, Songnaedong, Chaeyaksan Andesite, and Geoncheonri Formations (Fig. 1). These sediments, belonging to the Hayang Group, were deposited in fluvial (Chilgok, Haman, and Songnaedong Fms.) and lacustrine (Jindong, Banyaweol, and Geoncheonri Fms.) settings (Choi, 1985). These sediments are overlain by the deposits of the Yucheon Group. The lowermost formation of this group consists of fluvial sediments (Goseong Fm.), and the rest of this group is composed of volcanic rocks (Choi, 1985; Paik et al., 2006).\nThe upper part of the Gyeongsang Supergroup includes volcanic rocks and tuffs; thus, the geological age can be determined by the geochronological studies of these volcanic rocks and tuffs. For the Sindong Group, the depositional age was constrained by using U–Pb detrital zircon ages. Geochronological ages of the Gyeongsang Supergroup are summarized as follows: (1) 118 Ma for the Nakdong\nFormation (U–Pb zircon age; Lee et al., 2010), (2) 109 Ma for the Hasandong Formation (U–Pb zircon age; Lee et al., 2010), (3) 106 Ma for the Jinju Formation (U–Pb zircon age; Lee et al., 2010), (4) 97–98 Ma for the tuff bed at the boundary between the Haman and Jindong Formations (U–Pb zircon age; Jwa et al., 2009), and (5) 94 Ma from the Chaeyaksan Andesite (K–Ar whole-rock age; Kang et al., 2000). From the results of paleomagnetic and geochronological studies, the Goseong Formation was interpreted as Campanian in age (Paik et al., 2006). Because of the lack of age data for the strata between the Chilgok and Haman Formations, the geological ages of the Chilgok, Silla, and Haman Formations were estimated by assuming a linear sedimentation rate. This approximation of depositional ages for these formations is justified by the fact that both the Chilgok and Haman formations are relatively thick (600 and 1300 m thick, respectively) and are composed of fine-grained alluvial deposits (Choi, 1985). The Silla Conglomerate, a gravel bar deposit, has a variable thickness up to 250 m. The inferred ages of the studied formations are shown in Table A1 and Fig. 1."

For a stable isotope study, a micritic component was selectively collected from the polished slabs with a dental drill. Powdered samples for carbon isotope analysis were reacted with 100% H3PO4 for 10 to 50 min following the common acid bath method. Isotope analysis was carried out using an IsoPrime model mass spectrometer at the Korea Basic Science Institute. Isotope data were reported in usual δ notation, with δ13C to the PDB scale.\nFor carbon isotopic analyses of organic matter, coal (Nakdong Formation), charcoal (Hasandong Formation) and lacustrine deposits\n(Jinju and Geoncheonri Formations) (Fig. 1) were powdered in an agate mortar. The organic matter in lacustrine deposits is composed only of phytoclasts (e.g., Hong et al., in press). Samples were treated with 10% HCl to remove carbonate minerals. In order to analyze the carbon-isotope composition of organic matter, the acid-processed samples were analyzed using an IsoPrime model elemental analyzerisotope ratio mass spectrometer at the Korea Basic Science Institute. The analytical reproducibility for carbon isotope values of pedogenic carbonate and organic matter was better than 0.1‰ and 0.2‰, respectively."

    "text": "The concentration of atmospheric CO2 can be determined from the δ13C value of pedogenic carbonate using a paleobarometer model (Cerling, 1999). This model is controlled by S(z) and the isotopic compositions of soil CO2, soil-respired CO2, and atmospheric CO2. The δ13C value of soil-respired CO2 of the Gyeongsang Basin was estimated from the average δ13C value of the bulk plant materials from lacustrine deposits, charcoal, and coal (Table A1). Large uncertainty in pCO2 reconstructions using pedogenic carbonates may arise from S(z) values (Breecker et al., 2010). The most important factor that may cause changes in S(z) is the variation of soil productivity which is sensitive to climatic change (Breecker et al., 2010). According to the S(z) map of Brook et al. (1983), the pCO2 of soil in semiarid climate is predicted to be 1000–3000 ppmV, and in arid climate it is lower than l000 ppmV. The S(z) value during pedogenic carbonate formation was below 2500 ppmV in the sub-humid temperate and tropical regions (Breecker et al., 2010), 2000 ppmV in semi-arid areas (Breecker et al., 2009), and 1000 ppmV in desert areas (Breecker et al., 2010). Dark-colored paleosols with pedogenic carbonates are indicative of a sub-humid climate, whereas red-soil pedogenic carbonates are representative of a semi-arid climate (Khadkikar et al., 2000). Therefore, in this study, the S(z) values for red paleosols (semi-arid climate) and dark-colored paleosols (subhumid climate) were assumed to be 2000 ppmV and 2500 ppmV, respectively. The same S(z) values were used to recalculate the pCO2 levels using the literature data. The depositional ages of two paleosols-bearing strata in Fig. 1A were reassigned by the recent studies on the corresponding strata by Horiuchi et al. (2009) and Lee et al. (2010). Table A1 lists the measured data and paleoenvironmental conditions used to calculate the pCO2 levels."

    "text": "The δ13C values of the pedogenic carbonates and plant materials in the Gyeongsang Basin range from −8.2‰ to −3.7‰ and from −23.9‰ to −23.2‰, respectively (Table A1). The pCO2 estimates derived from pedogenic carbonates of the Gyeongsang Basin show a wide variation ranging from 450 ppmV to 2030 ppmV, but an increasing trend from the Aptian to the earliest Campanian (Fig. 2B).\nDuring the Early Campanian, the estimated pCO2 record from the Gyeongsang Basin is characterized by an anomalous positive peak (a1 in Fig. 2B). We assume that the highest level of pCO2 during the Early Campanian may be ascribed to the overestimation of the S(z) value used. During the Cretaceous, the Gyeongsang Basin was located in an active continental margin setting (Choi, 1985). The following conditions seemed to have played important roles as atmospheric circulation barriers in creating rain-shadow conditions in the downwind area such as the Gyeongsang Basin (Haggart et al., 2006): (i) the presence of an uplifted accretionary complex to the east of the Gyeongsang Basin owing to the strike–slip movement related to the oblique subduction of the Izanagi Plate during the Late Albian\n(Lee, 2008) and (ii) the significant continental arc magmatism and uplift owing to the orthogonal subduction of the Izanagi–Pacific ridge during the Turonian (Maruyama et al., 1997). Moreover, the temporal changes in the distribution of desert deposits in Asia during the Cretaceous (Hasegawa et al., 2011) suggest that the subtropical arid zone was located much closer to the Gyeongsang Basin during the Late Cretaceous than during the mid-Cretaceous. Thus, it seems likely that the Gyeongsang Basin was more arid during the Early Campanian than during the Albian–Cenomanian. Assuming S(z)= 1500 ppmV, we estimate the pCO2 level of the Early Campanian to be below 1600 ppmV (a2 in Fig. 2B). Regardless of the S(z) values used, the new pCO2 estimates during the mid-Albian–earliest Campanian were higher than 1000 ppmV.\nThe complied Cretaceous pCO2 levels estimated from the pedogenic carbonates are shown in Fig. 1C. Except for the two high pCO2 values, each in the Late Aptian and in the Late Campanian (a and b\nin Fig. 2C), the recalculated pCO2 estimates of the published data (green dots in Fig. 2C) show a lower level during the Berriasian– Early Albian and the Campanian–Maastrichtian than those during the Cenomanian–Turonian.\nThe Cretaceous pCO2 levels suggest that except for the aforementioned two high pCO2 values, the global pCO2 changed from a low level during the Berriasian through the Early Albian (b1000 ppmV) to a high level during the mid-Albian through the Early Campanian (1000–1600 ppmV); it then showed a low level during the midCampanian through the Maastrichtian (b800 ppmV) (Fig. 2C).\nFig. 2D shows a comparison of our estimates with the pCO2 values estimated from other proxies and models. Although our complied pCO2 levels are within the estimated range from the other proxies and geochemical models, the detailed trend of our pCO2 variations is different from the others. Our pCO2 record shows a significant increase from the Late Aptian to the Albian, while the stomata data suggest a small increase in the same time interval (Haworth et al., 2005; Quan et al., 2009). A significant decrease in the pCO2 level from the Early to the Late Aptian and an increase in the pCO2 level from the Late Aptian to the Albian are observed in a fossil bryophytes pCO2 curve (Fletcher et al., 2008), similar to our pCO2 trend. However, this proxy information does not cover the whole Cretaceous. The data presented in this study suggest a more coherent record of variation in atmospheric pCO2 for the Cretaceous than that obtained from the other proxies."

    "heading": "4.2. Relationship between variations of pCO2 levels and climatic changes during the Cretaceous",
    "text": "Although the two high peaks in the Late Aptian and the Late Campanian do not support a precise covariation of pCO2 and paleotemperature, our long-term pCO2 trend is consistent with a broad trend of paleotemperatures that changed from a cool greenhouse state during the Berriasian through the Aptian to a warm greenhouse state during the Albian through the Early Campanian, and then to cool greenhouse conditions during the mid-Campanian through the Maastrichtian (Pucéat et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2002) (Fig. 3B). Such a long-term correspondence between pCO2 and temperature suggests that the pCO2 variation played an important role in the Cretaceous climatic change. The mid-Cretaceous global climatic optimum occurs between the Cenomanian and the Turonian (Pucéat et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2002). Our result showed that the pCO2 level increased from 400 ppmV in the Aptian to a peak of 1600 ppmV in the Late Cenomanian and then decreased to 700 ppmV in the mid-Campanian (Fig. 3C). Such variations provide strong geological evidence in support of the hypothesis that the mid-Cretaceous thermal maximum was caused by high levels of atmospheric CO2. The pCO2 levels during the Early and Late Cretaceous are marked by three lows: the first low occurs in the Early Barremian (a in Fig. 3C), the second low in the Late Aptian–Early Albian (b in Fig. 3C), and the third low in the Maastrichtian (c in Fig. 3C). Although the ages of the three lows remain uncertain, these estimated pCO2 values are lower than 500 ppmV, the suggested CO2 threshold concentration for initiation of glaciations (Royer, 2006). These results imply the presence of glacial conditions during the Early and Late Cretaceous. The three low pCO2 intervals can be correlated with times when ice sheet may have formed in high latitudes (Bochum et al., 2009; De Lurio and Frakes, 1999; Frakes and Francis, 1988; Miller et al., 2007; Stoll and Schrag, 1996; Weissert and Lini, 1991) (Fig. 3), thus suggesting that the temporary reduction in pCO2 was probably associated with global climate changes that led to the Cretaceous glacial episodes. If this interpretation is correct, our estimates provide a new insight for understanding the cause that led to the development of glacial conditions during the Cretaceous."

    "heading": "4.3. Cause of high pCO2 levels during the mid-Cretaceous",
    "text": "Changes in the rate of outgassing caused by variations in the oceanic crust production rate have been previously suggested as a major cause for the mid-Cretaceous warm climate (Larson, 1991). However, because there is little agreement in the timing between the peak production rate and the climatic optimum, and because\nfew pCO2 data existed through the mid-Cretaceous, the role of the oceanic crust production rate in increasing pCO2 level during the mid-Cretaceous has been questioned. Larson (1991) suggested that the oceanic crust production rate increased from the Early Aptian to the peak in the mid-Aptian and then decreased gradually to the Late Campanian (Fig. 3G). In addition to emitting large quantities of CO2 to the atmosphere, the increased seafloor spreading rate would have changed the chemical and isotopic compositions of seawater through the hydrothermal alteration (Timofeeff et al., 2006). The high rate of oceanic crust production during the mid-Aptian to midAlbian coincides with very low Mg/Ca ratios and sulfur isotope compositions in seawater along with the mid-Aptian negative excursion of 87Sr/86Sr ratios (red band in Fig. 3), all of which have been known to reflect high seafloor spreading rate. If emission of large quantities of CO2 from the oceanic crust production was a primary cause of pCO2 levels, the highest rate of oceanic crust production during the mid-Aptian to mid-Albian should correspond with the highest pCO2 levels. However, our results show that the pCO2 levels during the mid-Aptian to mid-Albian were lower than of the succeeding interval having reduced oceanic crust production rate. Although the oceanic crust production rate underwent decreasing, pCO2 levels increased from the Aptian to a peak in the Late Cenomanian and remained high for the Turonian–Santonian (Fig. 3C). The pCO2 levels during the Cenomanian–Santonian are estimated to be about 500 ppmV higher than those during the mid-Aptian–mid-Albian (Fig. 3C). This suggests that the outgassing from the oceanic crust production alone is not likely themain factor of high pCO2 levels triggering the mid-Cretaceous warmth. Except for the rapid decrease of 87Sr/86Sr ratios during the Turonian (Jones and Jenkyns, 2001), evidence for submarine hydrothermal activity is lacking during the Cenomanian–Santonian, and thus sources not associated with seafloor spreading, such as a decrease in the weathering of silicates or decreased rate of organic carbon burial, are necessary to supply additional CO2 into the atmosphere during this interval. Also, subaerial volcanisms may emit mantle CO2 directly into the atmosphere without altering ocean chemistry. It was reported that eruption of widespread basalts due to mantle plume activity occurred in Caribbean (95.1–92.2 Ma; Snow et al., 2005) and Madagascar (91.6–83 Ma; Storey et al., 1995; Torsvik et al., 1998) (green band in Fig. 3). Kuroda et al. (2007) showed that lead isotopic compositions of silicate sediment fraction in the Late Cenomanian Bonarelli black shale (Italy) indicate a supply of silicateminerals from subaerial volcanism associated with Caribbean and Madagascar Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) and suggested that the massive subaerial volcanisms could supply CO2 into the atmosphere on the order of 104 Gt. Accordingly, for high pCO2 levels during the mid-Cretaceous, massive subaerial volcanisms associated with these LIPs are regarded as additional sources of CO2 to the mid-Cretaceous atmosphere."

    "heading": "5. Conclusions",
    "text": "In this study, we present a more reasonable paleo-pCO2 variation record for the Cretaceous using S(z) values reflecting climate condition. During the Cretaceous, the long-term pCO2 trend changed from a low level during the Berriasian through the Early Albian to a high level during the mid-Albian through the Early Campanian, and then showed a low level during the mid-Campanian through the Maastrichtian. Such a long-term pCO2 trend is in agreement with variations of paleotemperature records. Also, short-term pCO2 changes well correspond to short-term global events, such as a thermal maximum during the mid-Cretaceous and glacial events during the Early and Late Cretaceous. Therefore, our results suggest that the variations of pCO2 levels were linked to long-term climatic changes as well as short-term events during the Cretaceous. The pCO2 levels and paleotemperatures during themid-Cretaceous were higher than those expected for the case with reduced oceanic crust production\nrate. This suggests that the oceanic crust production was not the main factor for increased pCO2 levels during the mid-Cretaceous. Considering that widespread subaerial volcanisms occurred in the Caribbean and Madagascar LIPs during the mid-Cretaceous, the increased pCO2 level during the mid-Cretaceous was aided by these additional CO2 sources. Our results explain how the climate responded to an increase in pCO2 and constrained feedbacks between the solid Earth and Earth's environment.\nSupplementary materials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2012.01.014."
