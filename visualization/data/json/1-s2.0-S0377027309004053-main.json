We investigate large-scale silicic volcanism in the past severalmillion years and present newgeochronologic results frommajor ignimbrite sheets exposed in Kamchatka. These ignimbrites are found in the vicinity of morphologically-preserved rims of partially eroded source calderas with diameters from ∼2 to ∼30 km and with estimated volumes of eruptions ranging from 10 to several hundred cubic kilometers of magma. We also identify and date two of the largest ignimbrites: Golygin Ignimbrite in southern Kamchatka (0.45 Ma), and Karymshina River Ignimbrites (1.78 Ma) in southcentral Kamchatka. We present whole-rock geochemical analyses that can be used to correlate ignimbrites laterally. These large-volume ignimbrites sample a significant proportion of remelted Kamchatkan crust as constrained by the oxygen isotopes. Oxygen isotope analyses of minerals and matrix span a 3‰ range with a significant proportion of moderately low-δ18O values. This suggests that the source for these ignimbrites involved a hydrothermally-altered shallow crust, while participation of the Cretaceous siliceous basement is also evidenced by moderately elevated δ18O and Sr isotopes and xenocryst contamination in two volcanoes. The majority of dates obtained for caldera-forming eruptions coincide with glacial stages in accordance with the sediment record in the NW Pacific, suggesting an increase in explosive volcanic activity since the onset of the last glaciation 2.6 Ma. Rapid changes in ice volume during glacial times and the resulting fluctuation of glacial loading/unloading could have caused volatile saturation in shallow magma chambers and, in combination with availability of low-δ18O glacial meltwaters, increased the proportion of explosive vs effusive eruptions. The presented results provide new constraints on Pliocene–Pleistocene volcanic activity in Kamchatka, and thus constrain an important component of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\nan).\nl rights reserved.\n© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia (Fig. 1) is one of the most active arc segments on Earth (Simkin and Siebert, 1994), with the largest number of collapse calderas per unit of arc length (Hughes and Mahood, 2008) and high magma and volatile output rates (Portnyagin et al., 2007; Taran, 2009). Built on accreted ocean arc terrains and slivers of Asian continental crust (Geist et al., 1994; Konstantinovskaia, 2001; Bindeman et al., 2002; Lander and Shapiro, 2007), it has been volcanically active for more than 70 Ma as a result\nof a nearly head on collision of the Kula and Pacific Plates with the Asian mainland (Fig. 1). Since the Late Eocene volcanic front was located in the accreted terrain of the Sredinny Range. Accretion of the Eastern Kamchatka Intraoceanic Terrain and the Pliocene accretion of cape-peninsulas onto Eastern Kamchatka (e.g., Lander and Shapiro, 2007) resulted in locking of the subduction zone, breaking-off and sinking of the subducting Kula Plate, and the subsequent subduction zone migrating east, to its present location. This transition initiated the formation of the Eastern Volcanic Front and the volcanic zone of the Central Kamchatka Depression, while activity on the former volcanic front in the Sredinny Range diminished.\nVolcanism patterns reflect Kamchatka's tectonic history from the Eocene to the present (e.g., Avdeiko et al., 2007) and are expressed in\nthree main volcanic belts (Fig. 1); the Sredinny Range, the Eastern Volcanic Front (EVF), and the Central Kamchatka Depression (CKD). In the CKD, the voluminous basaltic-intermediate volcanoes (Kliuchevskoi, Shiveluch, Bezymyanny) are the most active in the world. The majority of the calderas in Kamchatka occur in the Sredinny Range and the EVF (Fig. 1) and are associated with areas of long-term magmatism. The investigation of calderas in Kamchatka spans more than 40 years (Erlich et al., 1972; Erlich, 1986; Fedotov and Masurenkov, 1991; Leonov and Grib, 2004), but the majority of work has been published in Russian and remains relatively unknown in international literature. Furthermore, poor geological exposure and insufficient prior dating efforts resulted in interpretations that many collapse calderas were “volcano–tectonic depressions”, negative volcanic forms that develop over several hundred thousand years\nthrough a combination of volcanic activity, tectonic downdrop, and glacial erosion. Although the level of investigation of Holocene postglacial explosive eruptions, including correlation of their tephra, is superb and arguably one of the best in the world (Braitseva et al., 1987, 1995, 1997; Gusev et al., 2003; Ponomareva et al., 2004, 2007a,b), several factors prevent investigation of Pleistocene and older calderas: poor geological exposure, high uplift and erosion rates, tectonic burial rates, high volcanic activity that leads to concealing old volcanic products, heavy vegetation cover, and poor road infrastructure. For the same reasons, eruptive volume estimates for Kamchatkan calderas are imprecise. A rough correlation of caldera sizes, and thicknesses of outflow ignimbrite sheets all suggest eruption volumes in excess of 100 km3, and possibly N400 km3 for some calderas (e.g., Karymshina and Pauzhetka, see below).\nAs a result of decades-long efforts in geological mapping, and identification of most thick ignimbrites sheets in Kamchatka, our knowledge on calderas is much more complete (Erlich et al., 1972; Melekestsev et al., 1974; Melekestsev, 1980; Erlich, 1986; Leonov and Grib, 2004). In most cases, outcrops of these ignimbrites are located near topographically exposed calderas and caldera clusters visible on air photos or space images (Fig. 2). In many cases the source caldera is identified for an ignimbrite sheet based on geological correlation, mineralogy (e.g.±quartz or biotite) and major element composition of eruptive products (e.g. Grib and Leonov, 1993a,b). However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the number of eruptions per each center and their associated volumes within caldera complexes.\nCompositionally, Kamchatkan caldera-forming ignimbrites have clear distinctions in K2O and SiO2 contents and inherited their chemistry from their parental basaltic magmas and/or their crustal source regions (Fig. 9c). Given that all volcanic rocks in the Kurile–Kamchatka Volcanic Arc exhibit strong across-arc geochemical zonation that results in a tenfold increase inK2Oacross the arc (Volynets, 1994;Churikovaet al., 2001; Duggen et al., 2007), magmas in the Sredinny Range are most K2O-rich and contain biotite, while the majority of EVF rocks are K2O-poorer. Oxygen isotopic variations in Kamchatkan silicic rocks were shown to be large, spanning 3‰ (Bindeman et al., 2004), with a particularly large abundance of low-δ18O values (Fig. 9a,b). This result was interpreted to stem from the influence of the last glaciation: low-δ18O glacial meltwaters imprinted their isotopic signatureonhydrothermally-altered rocks that contributed to the crustal magmas through remelting and assimilation. Sr isotopic values of Kamchatkan rocks span 0.703–0.706, with higher values characteristic for the Sredinny Range Magmas (Pokrovsky and Volynets, 1999; Dril et al., 1999; Bindeman et al., 2004).\nInvestigation of the influence of the last glaciation on explosive volcanic activity in Kamchatka deserves consideration because\nglacial retreats and advances could have contributed to the periodicity of the largest explosive volcanic eruptions, and below we attempt to find a correlation between them. Contrary to the idea that glacial overload increases repose interval (Wallman et al., 1988), and deglaciation increases mantle melting (Slater et al., 1998), examination of the deep sea ash record suggests increased explosivity in Kamchatka during Late Quaternary glaciations. Several ODP holes (882, 883, 884 and others) were drilled near Kamchatka's coasts and sediment cores spanning the last several million years were retrieved from them. Prueher and Rea (2001a,b) and Cao et al. (1995) have examined the number and thickness of ash layers in these cores and discovered that the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation in Kamchatka at 2.6 Ma coincided with a sharp increase of explosive volcanism, as revealed by abundant ice rafted debris in the sedimentary record, (also noted by Bigg et al., 2008). Correlation of thicknesses of ash deposits, in combination with examination of their whole-rock and glass-shard chemistry (e.g., Cao et al., 1995) helps to identify the time intervals of increased explosive activity (and their relation to glacial–interglacial periods), and, in the case of several thicker ash layers that occur in the core, specific large-volume eruptions. Thus, a combined effort that includes dating and compositional fingerprinting of major subaerial ignimbrite sheets and correlation with their marine ash layer equivalents based on sedimentary stratigraphic age and composition serves several purposes.\nThis work reports Ar–Ar and U–Pb zircon ages of major ignimbrite eruptions in Kamchatka over the past several million years and their compositional (major and trace element), and isotopic values. Thus this work expands on the number of defined calderas in the existing databases (e.g. Geyer andMarti, 2008, Cambridge University database, Hughes and Mahood, 2008) and provides expanded and refined\nion of this area is shown by Frame 2 in Fig. 1.

    "text": "Samples of large-volume ignimbrites that are found in the vicinity of major caldera complexes in Kamchatka were collected by authors of the paper in the course of a decade-long investigation. We collected and geochemically characterized more samples than we dated (Tables 1 and 2) as each sample went through rigorous investigation based on the freshness in both hand specimen and thin section. In particular, we selected rocks with large, fresh feldspars and biotites without visible crystal clots for incremental heating analyses and densely welded groundmass and obsidianic samples for step-heating experiments. For zircon extraction, samples totaling 1 kg were crushed and treated with HF to dissolve glass attached to zircons, followed by density separation in heavy liquids and mineral picking.\nThe 40Ar/39Ar analyses were performed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison Rare Gas Geochronology Laboratory. Individual\nbiotite phenocrysts and/or multi-crystal aliquots of plagioclase were fused using a 25 W CO2 laser (5–16 fusions per sample). Obsidian separates (100–137 mg) were incrementally heated in a doublevacuum resistance furnace following the procedures of Jicha and Singer (2006). Because isochron regressions agreed with plateau ages and did not reveal evidence that excess argon or low temperaturealteration was significant in any of the samples, we consider the weighted mean plateau ages to give the best estimate of the time elapsed since eruption.\nU–Pb dating of zircons was performed using Cameca 1270 ion microprobe at UCLA. Typically, 20–30 zircon grains from each sample were hand-picked, mounted in epoxy, polished to ∼75% of their midsection, and mapped in reflected light and back-scatter electron microscopy. We followed standard analysis protocols for the analysis of youthful zircons (Schmitt et al., 2003a; Bindeman et al., 2006). Ion intensities were measured in 12–15 cycles using a mass-filtered O– primary ion beam of ∼15 nA focused to an oval 25–30 μm spot. AS-3 (Paces and Miller, 1993) reference zircons were used to calibrate U, Th, and Pb sensitivities. Measured ages were adjusted for the initial U– Th disequilibria using techniques described in Schärer, 1984; Reid, 2003, and Bindeman et al., 2006 which increase the age by ∼80 ky.\nCr Sc V Ba Rb Sr Zr Y Nb Ga Cu Zn Pb La Ce Th Nd U\nPauzhetka Caldera 3 6 35 497 27 241 103 10 0.8 12 5 33 7 6 14 1 9 2 4 8 57 521 25 276 102 12 1.8 12 10 45 8 8 14 1 7 0 4 6 53 572 32 231 110 13 1.8 15 7 34 7 9 20 3 9 0\n0 82 352 14 311 139 119 45 2.2 23 39 85 9 22 1 19 1 2 17 45 783 47 348 270 48 7.9 18 4 81 10 23 55 3 33 1\nKarymshina Caldera 3 5 28 783 51 261 94 12 1.7 14 5 27 8 12 24 4 9 2 3 6 40 807 51 274 100 13 2.3 14 5 37 8 13 24 4 11 2 4 6 32 793 51 274 97 12 3.3 13 4 23 9 10 22 4 9 2 4 4 29 801 51 274 98 13 2.9 13 3 25 8 15 28 3 12 0 3 5 40 783 52 277 95 13 1.8 13 5 30 8 13 23 3 11 1 4 5 45 790 50 272 98 12 2.4 14 5 41 7 9 22 3 10 1 4 5 36 791 53 280 98 15 2.5 12 5 35 7 12 26 4 13 2 3 5 37 782 55 268 97 12 2.7 14 5 33 9 11 29 3 12 2 4 5 36 779 49 288 97 13 2.2 13 5 41 14 15 23 3 10 3 3 5 36 822 55 263 98 14 2.4 14 4 35 8 15 26 3 14 2 3 6 38 786 49 285 98 12 2.4 13 5 33 6 12 22 4 12 1 3 7 41 748 45 300 100 13 1.9 14 4 37 7 12 24 2 12 2 5 11 78 729 49 310 182 22 3.9 16 17 55 11 14 31 3 18 1 2 4 14 909 67 143 86 14 3.9 13 1 25 11 17 31 5 13 3\n6 14 108 651 40 449 151 21 2.9 17 24 62 8 12 23 3 14 2\nCalderas of the Eastern Volcanic zone 1 30 258 238 17 402 105 30 2.9 17 172 98 1 9 24 0 19 2 2 29 227 255 19 392 113 30 3.2 16 129 100 2 10 26 0 18 2 1 8 37 581 41 196 141 26 2.7 13 7 41 7 14 27 2 16 3 2 22 116 411 24 328 152 35 1.8 17 28 98 6 15 26 1 19 3\n7 17 71 581 37 269 199 39 4.6 16 20 88 8 15 37 1 25 2 5 16 59 545 40 273 183 36 3.3 17 8 81 8 12 32 2 21 1 2 16 44 618 41 245 215 39 4.8 17 15 78 7 18 34 2 24 2 4 3 22 741 52 177 87 10 1.6 11 3 23 5 11 16 2 8 1\n3 18 45 443 30 219 167 38 3.8 17 8 83 7 10 23 0 17 1 11 66 391 35 201 183 34 2.3 16 13 57 6 16 31 2 19 0\nCaldera-forming ignimbrites of Sredinny Range 5 3 18 744 72 146 156 16 13.9 15 5 42 10 18 43 9 17 3 14 19 167 770 28 566 107 22 4.3 16 36 70 8 17 32 1 18 2 1 22 176 1231 55 561 190 33 4.5 18 29 104 12 18 46 1 33 2\n1300 46 420 4 16 141 2161 60 801 142 29 2.3 16 29 108 21 27 51 4 31 2\nOxygen isotope analyses were performed at the University of Oregon stable isotope lab using CO2–laser fluorination (e.g. Bindeman, 2008). Individual and bulk mineral grains ranging in weight between 0.6 and 2 mg were reacted in the presence of purified BrF5 reagent to liberate oxygen. The gas generated in the laser chamber was purified through a series of cryogenic traps held at liquid nitrogen temperature, and a mercury diffusion pump was used to remove traces of fluorine gas. Oxygen was converted to CO2 gas in a small platinum– graphite converter, the yield was measured, and then CO2 gas was analyzed on a MAT 253 mass spectrometer. Four to seven standards were analyzed together with the unknowns during each analytical session. San Carlos olivine (δ18O=5.35‰) and Gore Mt. Garnet (δ18O=5.75‰) were used. Day-to-day δ18O of standards ranged from –0.1 to –0.25‰ than their empirical value and therefore unknown samples were adjusted to correct for this small day-to-day variability on the SMOW scale. The precision on standards and duplicates of individual analyses is better than 0.1‰.\nMajor and trace element whole-rock X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were done at the GeoAnalytical Lab at Washington State University on their ThermoARL Advant'XP+sequential X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Sr and Nd isotope analyses were obtained by TIMS at the Institute of Earth Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan. The matrix of each crushed sample was picked up under a stereo microscope and\nanalyzed for the isotopic compositions of Sr and Nd using established techniques (Chen et al., 1990, 1993)."

    "text": "The Pauzhetka Depression measures 27×18 km (Fig. 3) and has vertical displacements of close to 1000m (Melekestsev, 1980; Erlich, 1986). The caldera-forming Golygin Ignimbrite is preserved around the Pauzhetka Depression (Fig. 3) as a sugar-white to pale, densely welded to pumiceous deposit with a total thickness of 20–30 m, approaching 100 m in the northern portion of the inferred caldera. The geothermal drill core drilled in the center of Pauzhetka Caldera has identified a 125–\n190 m thick inracaldera tuff layer overlain by 800 m thick volcano– terrigenic material (Erlich, 1986; Leonov, 1989). Previous geochronologic dating efforts of theGolygin Ignimbrite byMasurenkov (1980) and Kozhemyaka and Ogorodov (1977) yielded diverse ages ranging from 1.5 My to 0.2 Ma with the later age preferred by the authors. The uncertain dating resulted in the hypothesis that Pauzhetka represents a volcano–tectonic depression, formed over a long time, by a series of eruptions, rather than a collapse caldera. Gravity investigation (Masurenkov, 1980; Erlich, 1986) identified a gravity deficiency coinciding with the caldera boundaries while seismic methods and drilling in the caldera identified the Cretaceous basements at 2 km depth. The composition of the Golygin Ignimbrite (Table 2) is rhyolitic and it contains large quartz phenocrysts. Rhyolites with abundant quartz phenocrysts are rare in Kamchatka and other island arcs.\nThe Ar–Ar ages of three samples taken from three separate extracaldera ignimbrite lobes (Table 1) yielded overlapping ages within uncertainties, with an average age of 443±8 k.y. (1 st dev). The U–Pb zircon dating of two samples from ignimbrite lobes and one sample from a 190 m thick intracaldera tuff from the drill core also yielded overlapping ages with an average U–Pb zircon crystallization age of 488±24 k.y. (MSWD=0.47). Concordance between U–Pb zircon ages of extracaldera and intracaldera facies firmly establishes the age of Pauzhetka Caldera, with the 443±8 k.a. Ar–Ar age as the preferred eruption age of the large-volume Golygin Ignimbrite because zircon U–Pb ages typically predate Ar–Ar eruption ages by a few tens of thousand years (e.g. Reid et al., 1997; Bindeman et al., 2006; Simon et al., 2008).\nThese new geochronologic data, compositional and isotopic similarity of rhyolitic samples, and the radial distribution of extracaldera ignimbrites around the 20–25 km Pauzhetka Depression with their inferred directions of flow (Fig. 3) suggests that the Golygin Ignimbrite erupted in a single episode causing the formation of the Pauzhetka Caldera. Following the caldera collapse, a combination of post-caldera resurgence and regional tectonism has resulted in the\nformation of Kambalny Horst (ridge north of Kambalny volcano, Fig. 3), 250–400 m above the caldera moat, which cross-cuts the southern caldera boundary and uplifted precaldera basaltic rocks.\nGiven the caldera area and an estimated 1 km vertical downdrop, the volume of erupted products is estimated to be at least 450 km3. Alternatively, adding 1) the exposed volume of extracaldera Golygin Ignimbrite (100 km3; Sheimovich, 1979); and the Pauzhetka IntraCaldera Ignimbrite (200–300 km3; Sheimovich, 1979) yields estimates approaching 400 km3. Other estimates of exposed extracaldera ignimbrite volumes are 70–80 km3 (Kozhemyaka and Litasov, 1980), which combined with our intracaldera ignimbrite volume of 60–80 km3 yields an estimated 130–160 km3 of known volcanic products. Given the density of the Golygin Ignimbrite (about 2 g/cm3) this would correspond to 100–125 km3 DRE (dry rock equivalent) of magma. Taking into account ash loss using the relationship that ash constitutes 50% of the total erupted volume of rhyolitic arc magmas as demonstrated at Mt Mazama (Bacon, 1983), then the total volume of eruptive products at 443 ka is close to 300 km3, or perhaps closer to 200 km3 of magma. The latter estimate is also more realistic for the volume of Pauzhetka Caldera. Thus, the caldera-forming eruption of the Golygin Ignimbrite in Pauzhetka Caldera represents the largest known eruptive episode in Kamchatka during the past 1 Ma.\nThe 50 km3 of new, post-caldera silicic lavas (Kozhemyaka and Ogorodov, 1977) are represented by two extrusions (Leonov, 1989), with the most prominent unit, the Ploskaya (Flat) Extrusion, which has a rhyodacitic composition without quartz, constituting part of the resurgent dome. Its newly-determined Ar–Ar age is 235±4 ka (Table 1). It appears that the silicic magma was largely exhausted following the collapse from the Golygin Ignimbrite eruption and small-volume post-caldera silicic volcanism. Late Pleistocene eruptions of basaltic lava resulted in the formation of small stratocones while the large basaltic volcanoes of Koshelevsky and Kambalny were formed on the inferred rim boundaries outside of the caldera (Fig. 3).\nThe 443 ka caldera-forming eruption was the first in the series, as Pauzhetka represents a nested caldera complex that includes the subsequent eruption of the Kurile Lake Ignimbrite and formation of the 7×12 km Kurile-Lake Caldera (Fig. 3b, 7.6 ky, N140–170 km3 tuffs, N60 km3 DRE, Ponomareva et al., 2004). Additionally, silicic volcanism continued in the Holocene and resulted in the formation of intracaldera extrusions of rhyodacitic to dacitic composition, such as Dikiy Greben' Volcano, with a total volume of silicic rocks from10–15 km3 (Bindeman and Bailey, 1994), and dacitic flows in Iliinsky Volcano.\nOxygen isotope investigation of phenocrysts in the Golygin Ignimbrite, Ploskaya Lavas, Kurile Lake deposits, and Late Holocene eruptive products including those from Iliinsky and Dikiy Greben' Volcanoes, reveals a zig-zag pattern superimposed on an overall decrease in δ18O with younger age (see Bindeman et al., 2004, Fig. 7a). As volcanic rocks in Iliinsky Volcano are low-δ18O, their source is likely to be inside Pauzhetka Caldera and the inferred boundary of a hypothetical Late Pleistocene caldera (Fig. 3). The Golygin Ignimbrite represents low-K, normal to subtly high-δ18O magma with a nonradiogenic Sr isotopic value of 0.703255±0.000015 (Bindeman et al., 2004), indicative of derivation by fractional crystallization of more mafic parents or remelting of young crust. As in Ksudach Volcano described\nTable 3 New isotope analyses of rocks from Ksudach Volcano and Karymshina Caldera.\nlater in this paper, eruptions from a nested caldera complex resulted in burial of low-δ18O, hydrothermally-altered intracaldera fill by caldera collapse and loading. Subsequentmagmas are able to interactwith these low δ18O materials, thus becoming progressively lower in δ18O."

    "text": "The Karymshina “ring structure” was discovered during exploration of Bolshe-Banny geothermal field in late 1960s (Erlich, 1986 and earlier references within), and later redefined as a large volcano– tectonic structure (Lonshakov, 1979). The Karymshina River large silicic center in east-central Kamchatka is represented by a ∼1000 m thick layer of rhyolitic ignimbrite and about a dozen surrounding extrusive domes of high to low- silica composition (Fig. 4). The presence of quartz and biotite in rhyolites from the Karymshina Center distinguishes these old uplifted Early Pleistocene rocks from the biotite and amphibole-free Holocene lavas of the surrounding volcanoes in the EVF. Previous researchers (Sheimovish and Khatskin, 1996; Sheimovish and Golovin, 2003) reported K–Ar dates of these extrusive domes ranging from 0.5 to 2.2 Ma. They also dated samples of ignimbrites spanning from 4.2 to 1.2 Ma, with the majority of dates\nranging from 1.2 to 1.52 Ma, and concluded that the area is represented by a series of extrusive domes erupted approximately 2 Ma or more. Leonov and Rogozin (2007) reinterpreted silicic rocks from the Karymshina River as consisting of voluminous calderaforming ignimbrites and post-caldera ring-fracture domes, thus identifying a large-scale Early Pleistocene caldera (Fig. 4). The presently uplifted and eroded caldera floor (Fig. 4b) exposes only intracaldera ignimbrites, but the search for extracaldera ignimbrites is continuing. The latter are expected to be eroded but might be present under the volcanic edifices of neighboring stratovolcanoes. The 100–\n120 m thick extracaldera Karymshina Ignimbrite was found under Zhirovskoy Volcano, whose lavas are dated at 0.67 to 0.84 Ma by K–Ar method (Sheimovich and Karpenko, 1996).\nIn the field, ignimbrites are distinguished from the domes by the existence of subhorizontal fiamme. The domes form topographic highs around the inferred intracaldera Karymshina Ignimbrites, defining an ellipsoidal pattern (Fig. 4). Furthermore, Tolsty Mys mountain is exposed in the center of the inferred caldera boundaries and is represented by uplifted intracaldera ignimbrite interpreted to represent a resurgent dome (Leonov and Rogozin, 2007).\nIt is important to determine whether the eroded Pleistocene ignimbrites represent products of a single large-volume eruption or a series of smaller eruptions, as suggested earlier by Sheimovich and Khatskin (1996). In order to resolve this, we sampled the top and the bottom of the exposed rhyolitic intracaldera ignimbrite section in the eastern flank of the caldera and determined their Ar–Ar ages (Table 1). Biotite crystals from both samples yielded identical ages of 1.78± 0.02 Ma (MSWD=0.51) while plagioclase showed 1.54–1.68 Ma ages that overlap with the more precise biotite age within 2 sigma uncertainty. Zircon crystals from the top sample yielded a U–Pb age of 1.87±0.11 Ma (MSDW=0.32, n=9), with no evidence of inheritance. This zircon crystallization age overlaps with the 1.78 Ma Ar–Ar biotite agewhichwe adopt as the eruption age. It appears that the 1000m thick sequence of intracaldera ignimbrites was formed in the course of a single eruption or, pending better dating and geological study, a rapidly emplaced sequence of compositionally and mineralogically similar ignimbrites, beyond analytical resolution of Ar–Ar geochronology. Plagioclase from an intracaldera ignimbrite (sample 2005G-5) on the northwest side of the caldera near Bannaya River (Fig. 4) yielded an Ar– Ar age of 1.39±0.10 Ma. Additional age constraints are needed to determine if this dacitic ignimbrite is identical in age to the extracaldera dacitic ignimbrite (sample 426-L-1972) that yielded a 1.62±0.21 Ma Ar–Ar age from a Novosibirsk geochronology laboratory and could represent a younger caldera-formingepisode atKarymshinaCaldera.U– Pb zircon ages of one topographically-prominent extrusion Babii Kamen' average 0.92±0.08 Ma age (MSDW=0.26, n=9), significantly younger than the age of the intracaldera ignimbrites it intruded. Other high-silica–rhyolitic extrusions previously dated by K–Ar and Ar–Ar to be younger than 1 Ma are shown on Fig. 4.\nThe high-silica rhyolitic compositions of these extrusions, which is rare in Kamchatka, and their broad geochemical similarity with the Karymshina Ignimbrite suggests that they may represent post-caldera ring-fracture extrusions from the remobilized Karymshina reservoir. Oxygen isotopic investigation of the Karymshina Ignimbrite and postcaldera intrusions yielded nearly identical normal to high-δ18O values (Table 2) while newly-determined Sr and Nd isotopic ratios for the ignimbrite are 0.703317–0.703328, and 0.513015–0.513065 respectively (Table 3)."

    "heading": "4.3. Calderas of the Ksudach eruptive center and magma evolution",
    "text": "The multi-caldera Ksudach Volcano (Fig. 5) has been studied in great detail with respect to whole-rock isotopic variations of O, Sr and Nd (Table 3) and whole-rock and mineral chemistry (Volynets et al., 1999; Bindeman et al., 2004; Andrews, 2009). Ksudach Volcano is one of themost explosive Holocene volcanoes in Kamchatka and had three episodes of caldera formation during the Holocene; 8800 BP (Caldera III; tephra code KS4; N2 km3 of tephra), 6300 BP (KS3, 1 km3) and 6000 BP (Caldera IV; tephra code KS2, 7–8 km3), and 1800 BP (Caldera V; KS1, 18–19 km3). These tephras are widely used in Kamchatka for tephrochronology (Braitseva et al., 1997). Additionally, two Pleistocene caldera-forming episodes occurred, the oldest at 162 ka (see below). All the calderas of Ksudach Volcano are morphologically well preserved (Fig. 5), as is the stratigraphy of intracaldera domes and lavas (Table 3). The evolutionary pattern of Ksudach Volcano can thus serve as a model for older, more obscured calderas in Kamchatka. Geomorphological evidence suggests that Ksudach Volcano was glaciated during the Pleistocene and that interglacial lakes likely filled its calderas. A sudden outburst of post-glacial meltwaters during the Holocene created Teplaya River Canyon to the north (Fig. 5), exposing lavas of the old volcanic edifice.\nThis work constrains the age of the oldest Pleistocene caldera to 162±17 ka using an ignimbrite outcrop located near the caldera rim (sample 11 M-2002, Fig. 5). The diameter of this caldera is roughly 9 km. This dacitic ignimbrite likely represents the largest calderaforming eruption of Ksudach Volcano because its caldera boundary\nencloses all subsequent calderas. Younger Pleistocene pumices (samples 02IPE-15,16, Table 3), thought to represent another episode of caldera formation did not return meaningful Ar–Ar ages.\nNotably, all the silicic rocks of Ksudach Volcano are low-δ18O magmas that help fingerprint eruptive products of Ksudach Volcano (Fig. 6). The 162 ka ignimbrite, however, displays normal-δ18Omelt values of 5.97‰, higher than any younger eruptive products. New Sr isotope analyses of this ignimbrite reveal that it is the least radiogenic among subsequent units, with a 87Sr/86Sr value of 0.703298 (Table 3).\nCompositionally, caldera formations at Ksudach are associated with the cyclic evolution of magma composition through time, which oscillated between silicic andesites and rhyodacites (Volynets et al., 1999). Our investigation of Pleistocene ignimbrites extends this record to two older caldera-forming episodes (samples 11 M-2002/2, and 02IPE-15,16, Table 3). Furthermore, caldera-forming eruptions KS3 and KS4 are zoned, with more evolved rhyodacitic material erupting in the beginning of each eruption, which suggests a zoned magma reservoir of several km3 in volume and that each eruption caused draw-down to a bottom portion of this reservoir. Olivine– anorthite cumulate inclusions common in Kamchatka (Bindeman and Bailey, 1999) are abundant in many Ksudach Volcano products, especially in KS2. These cumulates record low-δ18Omelt values (5.2‰, Fig. 5b), suggesting their genetic relationship to the parental magma.\nThe most dramatic caldera-forming episode is related to the KS1 eruption of 18–19 km3 of rhyodacite, the most compositionallyevolved rock at Ksudach Volcano. This eruption, the largest in Kamchatka during the past 2000 years (Braitseva et al., 1996), likely tapped an evolved rhyodacitic reservoir. Following this large eruption, which likely evacuated the entire silicic reservoir, intracaldera volcanic activity resulted in formation of the post-caldera Stübel Cone, which eruptedmore mafic rocks in the beginning. Some later eruptions from the Stübel Cone, including one in 1907 AD, delivered ∼1 km3 of dacitic tephra signifying new differentiating episode (Volynets et al., 1999).\nAll the Ksudach magmas belong to the same subalkaline, low-K evolution trend that is common to the EVFmagmas of Kamchatka. The earliest stages of Ksudach Volcano, prior to its first caldera-forming eruption at ca 162 ky, were represented by mafic magmas, one of which (02IPE-49) was dated with large error at 324±160 ky (Table 3). These lavas and the early basaltic cinder cones of post KS5 age (Table 3) have similar Sr and Nd isotope compositions while the neighboring stratocone of Zheltaya mountain has higher Sr and lower Nd values. It is thus likely that for several thousand years prior to 162 ky, a volcano of largely basaltic composition existed at the current location of Ksudach Volcano (e.g. Selyangin, 1990).\nNew Ar–Ar and 14C geochronology demonstrate an interesting evolution pattern for the last 162 ky (Fig. 6a,b). Lavas and smallervolume pyroclastic units belonging to the pre-1800 BP sequence form a temporal array of decreasing δ18O values and increasing Sr isotopic values in phenocrysts. Oxygen isotope values in Holocene melts from Ksudach Volcano decrease from 5.4 to 4.7‰ while Sr isotope values increase from 0.70331 to 0.70338 and Sr and O isotopes are anticorrelated (Fig. 6). Products of the earliest caldera-forming eruption at 162 ky, precaldera mafic magmas and the extracaldera Zheltaya Mt deposits, have normal δ18O values (5.8‰) that are similar to other volcanoes in the EVF (Table 3; Bindeman et al., 2004; Duggen et al., 2007). At the same time, the youngest, most evolved, and most voluminous products of KS1 are most depleted in δ18O values and have the highest 87Sr/86Sr values. After the early portion of the KS1 eruption, lavas regain more normal δ18O values and have lower 87Sr/ 86Sr values. Nd isotopes do not show any temporal trend.\nElectron microprobe investigation of minerals in products of the caldera-forming eruptions (Fig. 7) demonstrates concurrent evolution of phenocrysts, with plagioclase becoming more sodic and pyroxene phenocrysts getting more Fe-rich at younger ages, reaching the most evolved values in KS1. Fe–Ti oxides demonstrate a trend of decreasing temperatures and increasing oxygen fugacity at younger ages, with\nKS1 tapping the most oxidized, thermally-zoned reservoir (Fig. 7b). Phase equilibria experiments on the KS1 composition suggest shallow (1.0 kbar) pre-eruptive storage conditions for the products of the 1800 BP KS1 caldera-forming eruption (Izbekov et al., 2003; Andrews, 2009).\nPatterns of compositional and isotopic evolution over time for Ksudach Volcano suggest the following model for its evolution.\nInitially, a large basaltic volcano (e.g. Selyangin, 1990) developed its first known silicic magma, which erupted in the course of caldera formation 162 ka yielding normal-δ18O magmas. Since then, wholerock and mineral compositional trends indicate periodic basaltic magma refills, differentiation, and magma mixing in shallow magma chambers between caldera-forming episodes. In addition to the important role of fractional crystallization, oxygen isotopic trends\nand Sr isotopes (Fig. 6a,b) suggest that assimilation and melting of low-δ18O hydrothermally-altered carapace around this magma body played an important role in explaining magma diversity and the predominance of silicic rocks in the later evolution of Ksudach Volcano. The fact that the 162 ka caldera-forming ignimbrite is normal-δ18O, and that other volcanoes nearby, in particular the closest, Zheltaya Mt, are normal δ18O, rules out that the low-δ18O anomaly at Ksudach Volcano is of mantle origin. Subsequent caldera collapses transported hydrothermally-altered low-δ18O intracaldera rocks vertically downwards towards the magma chamber where assimilation of these buried, hydrothermally-altered Ksudach rocks caused progressively lower δ18O with each new caldera collapse cycle. The rhyodacites of the youngest, most voluminous, and likely the shallowest KS1 caldera-forming eruption are the most depleted, requiring a composition of 15% hydrothermally-altered crust in magma products.\nLow-δ18O values, shallow storage pressures of 1 kb, and temporal isotopic trends imply that at least 18–19 km3 of siliceous magma was stored in the very shallow (∼3 km, Izbekov et al., 2003; Izbekov, unpublished data) crust prior to the 1800 BP KS1 eruption for several thousand years after the previous eruption. Because the trend of δ18O depletion is continuous while Sr and Nd isotopes quickly returned to pre-caldera values, it appears that older and smaller episodes of caldera-forming eruption failed to exhaust the low-δ18O, high 87Sr/ 86Sr components (magma+cumulates) completely and these components accumulated in the upper crustal magma generation zones. Temporal isotopic trends suggest that the dominant petrogenetic process for thousands of years before the 1800 BP eruption was progressive assimilation–remelting of the hydrothermally-altered predecessors driven by the heat of crystallizing basaltic magma.\nThe pre-1800 BP KS1 large magma body became the most δ18O depleted, but it was also the most water saturated and oxidized of all the KS eruptions (Fig. 6d, Izbekov et al., 2003). We speculate that the water inherited from assimilation of shallow, hydrothermally-altered roof-rocks contributed to oxidation. At 1800 BP, a large calderaforming eruption of KS1 emptied the entire low δ18O magma chamber signifying the end of the Pleistocene–Holocene magma body that had persisted for thousands of years. An alternate hypothesis is that the active system moved downward because of freezing of the shallow system, but this is less likely because the KS1 phase experiments indicate a shallowest (1 kb) equilibration pressure (Izbekov et al., 2003). Finally, eruptive degassing of the massive KS1 eruption could have caused the remaining KS1 magma to solidify.\nThe youngest (post 1800 BP) products of the post-KS1, are represented by the intracaldera Stübel Cone that have more normal, yet diverse, δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr values, signifying a fundamentally new cycle of magmatic activity involving fresh basalt that was able to get through the evacuated and solidified KS1 magma chamber. These basalts and more differentiated products have evidence of isotopic mixing with the leftover products of the KS1 chamber.\nSince lowering of the δ18O value from background, mantle-like values to the observed low-δ18O values has taken place over a period of ∼160 ky, Ksudach Volcano is an ideal example for comparison to identify other calderas in Kamchatka. After the initial caldera formation, a new meteoric–hydrothermal center was established and volcanic cannibalization of hydrothermally-altered rocks during overlapping caldera collapses contributed progressively more lowδ18O material into the younger magmas."

    "text": "This is the oldest known ignimbrite and is densely welded and nearly aphyric andesitic in composition, an outcrop of which is located to the west of the presently active EVF and occurring stratigraphically below a thick layer of basaltic lava, which presumably corresponds to that underlying most of the volcanic edifices in the EVF (Shantser and Krayevaya, 1980). The ages of these basalts were estimated at 3 to 1 Ma (Kozhemyaka et al., 1987). The Stol Mt Ignimbrite yielded an age of 3.71±0.08 Ma (sample 2007B-6), contained low-K values indicative of being derived from the EVF, and high-δ18O values (7.2‰). The existence of the Stol Mt Ignimbrite thus contradicts the present belief that volcanism in the EVF started in the Plio-Pleistocene with the eruption of basalts and finished with the eruption of silicic rocks that formed caldera centers in the Late Pleistocene. While the regional eruption of plateau basalts across Kamchatka in the Early Pleistocene may record intra-arc tectonic extension (Volynets et al., 1992), the Stol Mt Ignimbrite may represent the little known silicic counterpart of this process and the end of the previous basaltic–silicic cycle in eastern Kamchatka. Stol Mt. deposits sample rather similar stratigraphy of the EVF: 1) N200 m of conglomerate at the bottom (depression fill?); 2) mega-plagioclase rich basaltic lavas followed by silicic ignimbrites; 3) lake deposits; and 4) olivine basalts at the top."

    "heading": "4.4.2. Karymsky Caldera Center",
    "text": "Several large calderas are associated with the Karymsky Caldera Center (Fig. 2), which has overall dimensions of 55×65 km, and a total volume of exposed erupted material (younger than 3 Ma) of 1700 km3. The total volume of silicic ignimbrites is estimated to be 280 km3 (Masurenkov, 1980; Fedotov and Masurenkov, 1991). In the first half of the exposed Late Pliocene–Early Pleistocene volcanic record, volcanism was largely basaltic and is represented by plateau basalts, similar to those at Stol Mt.\nThe eastern portion of the oldest known ignimbrite east of the Karymsky Caldera Center, dated as 1.26±0.01 Ma (sample 509-1), is exposed along the Korneva River Valley. This ignimbrite is closely associated in time and space with similar ignimbrites, which have outcrops located in the banks of the neighboring Karymskaya and Zhupanova Rivers. Both exhibit similar zoning from densely welded ignimbrites that are continuously but sharply overlain by less welded ignimbrites with obsidianic fiamme and then by poorly sorted pumices. The estimated aerial extent of exposed remnants of these ignimbrite sheets, is 70–80 km2. The dated dacitic ignimbrites are exposed at sites 45 m high in the hills on the eastern side of the Karymsky Caldera Center, and exhibit low-δ18O magma values (4.6‰). The source caldera for the Korneva River Ignimbrites is debated. One coauthor (Bazanova) considers that the source caldera is not preserved and is most likely completely filled with younger volcanics in the region of the Upper Karymsky River and the surrounding territory presently occupied by the younger Stena– Soboliny and Polovinka Calderas. However, another coauthor (Leonov) considers these ignimbrites analogous to the Stena–Soboliny ignimbrites (sample 2007 L-22).\nThe second regional ignimbrite is associated with the 20×10km Stena–Soboliny Caldera in the northwest periphery of the Karymsky Caldera Center. The maximum thickness of this ignimbrite is 200 m and it is present in every direction surrounding the caldera (Fig. 2), which suggests its close association with this caldera. Field studies\nindicate that it is likely composed of two to four individual units, which are densely welded at the bottom and more pumiceous at the top, and all are dacitic–andesitic in composition. The lowest flow (sample 2007 L-22) yielded an Ar–Ar in plagioclase age of 1.13± 0.1 Ma (Table 1); This dacitic ignimbrite has normal to moderately low-δ18O values of 5.7‰. The youngest flow thought to be associated with Stena–Soboliny Caldera is compositionally zoned from rhyodacitic to dacitic–andesitic and contains no quartz. The time gap between the eruptive events that produced the top and bottom ignimbrites is yet to be determined.\nThe 11 km-wide Polovinka Caldera, preserved as a fragment on the southern edge of the Karymsky Caldera Center, has yielded an age of 0.432±0.008 Ma (Table 1) from its associated ignmibrite (sample 1999 L-9). Stratigraphically, this ignimbrite lies on top of ignimbrites from the Stena–Soboliny Caldera without an easily visible gap or erosional boundary. However, compositionally and mineralogically, Polovinka Caldera Ignimbites are primarily siliceous: high-silica to low-silica rhyolites with quartz and biotite, which are overlain by pumices of dacitic to andesitic compositions. The studied ignimbrites, located at Pravaya Zhupanova River, have a visible thickness of 100 m and show no evidence of a temporal break between earlier erupted high-silica rhyolites and the dacitic andesites on top. Another dated sample (7 L-27) contains xenocrysts of feldspar and partially fused rocks that yielded a much older (55 Ma) age. The δ18O value of this large-volume ignimbrite is 5.23‰, which is defined as moderately low-δ18O magma.\nThe small 4×6 km Odnoboky Volcano and its associated caldera is entirely enclosed within the Polovinka Caldera (Fig. 2) and yielded an Ar–Ar age of 0.069±0.003 ka (Table 1, sample 2001-L21) that had previously been dated between 0.08 and 0.11 Ma (Masurenkov, 1980). Oxygen isotopes define normal to moderately low-δ18O magmas (5.76‰). The Polovinka Ignimbrites are overlain regionally by thick layers of glacial moraines, which in turn are overlain by ignimbrites from the Odnoboky Caldera. The age of these regional moraines can thus be constrained as being younger than ∼0.43 Ma but older than 0.07 Ma, i.e. they can belong anywhere within the second through fourth glacial cycles (e.g. Martinson et al., 1987).\nThe remaining three calderas of the Karymsky Caldera Center are younger and were dated by fission track in apatite and whole-rock U– Th methods. Akademy Nauk Caldera is 4 km-wide and has an age ranging from 28–48 ka (fission track) and 18–39 ka (U–Th, Masurenkov, 1980). Karymsky Caldera is 5 km-wide and has an age of 7900 BP (14C), while the 7 km-wide Maly Semyachik Caldera is ∼15 ka (U–Th) (Masurenkov, 1980). Such young ages for morphologicallypreserved calderas and the age of the older caldera agree with observed geologic relations. Debris, ignimbrites, and pumice-pyroclastic flow deposits of the Akademy Nauk Caldera overlie deposits of Odnoboky Volcano, while Maly Semyachik Caldera is enclosed in the Stena–Soboliny Caldera Complex (Fig. 2).\nIt appears that most magmas that erupted from the Karymsky Caldera Center have had normal to moderately low-δ18O values for at least the past 1.2 Ma. These δ18O values could be used as a fingerprinting tool to distinguish Karymsky Caldera Center ignimbrites from the neigbouring ignimbrites; high-δ18O Bolshoy Semyachik, and lower-δ18O Uzon Ignimbrites."

Thick (up to 250 m) ignimbrite layers next to the caldera have been subdivided into several types. The earliest ones are rhyodacitic and contain quartz and biotite and yielded Ar–Ar age of 0.56± 0.045 Ma. These ignimbrites are overlain without visible time break by the more mafic dacitic to andesitic ignimbrites without quartz,\nwhich yielded a nearly identical age of 0.524±0.082 Ma. Large estimated volumes of these ignimbrites of 42 km3 and theMtMazama size caldera permits us to relate these ignimbrites to the caldera formation. At least two more smaller-volume ignimbrites, also zoned from more silicic to more mafic from bottom to top lye on top of the dated ignimbrites and have compositional and mineralogical characteristics of the Bolshoy Semiachik area (Leonov and Grib, 2004; Grib and Leonov, 1993a).

It is likely that these 30 ka ignimbrites fill river valleys of Left and Right forks of Zhupanova River up to 60 km downstream and are geomorphologically the youngest ignimbrites. This young ignimbrite also filled the river valley along the rim of the Bolshoy Semyachik Caldera. To the south of the caldera, more eroded Uzon Ignimbrites are exposed on the top of Shirokoye plateau, where three ignimbrite flows could be recognized without obvious time breaks. The geochronological sample 90 L-101 belongs to the upper of these ignimbrites and yielded an Ar–Ar age of 0.278±0.017 Ma. It thus appears that the Uzon–Geyzernaya Caldera is a nested complex of at least two superimposed calderas of different age and more mapping/geochronological work is required to distinguish their development. Compositionally the Uzon Ignimbrites belonging to both the northern and southern fields are rhyodacitic to dacitic without quartz. They are clearly distinguished from all other ignimbrites by having the lowest in Kamchatka δ18O magma values of 4.7–5.1‰; post-caldera extrusive domes on the ring fracture and in the center of the caldera are equally 18O depleted (Bindeman et al., 2004)."

It had at least\ntwo Pleistocene caldera-forming eruptions and a strong explosive eruption in early Holocene (Braitseva et al., 1997; Bazanova and Pevzner, 2001). Tentatively starting in Early Pleistocene, a series of basaltic to andesitic edifices were formed; followed by formation of a large caldera depressionmeasuring 12×16 km in diameter and in this work we dated this earliest ignimbrite of high-silica rhyolitic composition (sample CX-1436) that yielded 0.398±0.008 ka age, thus putting the age of Khangar in Mid Pleistocene. Following the caldera collapse, post-caldera extrusions of dacitic and rhyodacitic composition intruded along the caldera ring fractures. This was followed by another caldera-forming episode that has head to the formation of the caldera 6 km in diameter. Products of this eruption are represented pumice-rich ignimbrites. Volcanic activity in Late Pleistocene was characterized by continuing eruption of dacites and rhyodacites that rebuilt the cone-shaped volcanic edifice, with continuing smaller scale pyroclastic eruptions that are responsible for formation of two smaller craters. The age of two younger calderaforming eruption has been determined by 14C method at 38–40 ky BP (Braitseva et al., 1995). The last strong eruption 6900 yr BP resulted in\nformation of the crater with diameter of 3×3.5 km (Bazanova and Pevzner, 2001). The oxygen isotopic values of volcanic products is high-δ18O with magma values approaching 7.5‰ and easily explained by contaminationwithmetamorphic basement as is also supported by elevated 87Sr/86Sr values and the positive variation between the isotopes (Dril et al., 1999).

This caldera culminates the edifice building episodes that had stratovolcano and shield stages, consisting largely of high-K basalts and basaltic andesites at the base, and more differentiated products — shoshonites and latites. The two, closely spaced caldera-forming ignimbrites (ES-888 and ES-859) that we dated at 3.5±0.5 and 3.34±0.07 Ma are represented by latites. They were earlier believed to be of Late Pliocene–Early Pleistocene age. Following the two caldera collapses, a series of extrusive domes of latitic to high-K andesitic composition erupted in the center including the very large extrusions in the center that may represent a resurgent dome.

The new dataset is compared to the earlier dataset of Bindeman et al. (2004), which also includes the many smaller-volume intracaldera units. It is remarkable that more than half of analyzed samples of ignimbrites represent low-δ18O magmas, although the level of depletion is relatively small (b2‰), the volume of studied ignimbrites is significant (hundreds of cubic kilometers). Even 1–2‰ depletion in δ18O requires tens of percent assimilation of, or derivation from lowδ18O hydrothermally-altered crust. In this sense large-volume ignimbrites represent volume-averaged samples of this crust, fingerprinted by low-δ18O meteoric waters acquired during the 2.6 Ma-long Late Quaternary glaciation (e.g. Bindeman et al., 2004).\nCompositionally, themajority of ignimbrites aredacitic to rhyodacitic whereas the largest volume ignimbrites of Karymshina and Pauzhetka Calderas are rhyolitic with SiO2N72 wt.% on a volatile-free basis.

    "text": "The present paper determined the age of the majority of known large-scale caldera-forming episodes in Kamchatka, the significant portion of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Kamchatkan Calderas (and hence volume and magnitude) exceed mapped centers in the neighboring Aleutian and the Kurile arcs, possibly because of thick crust of the Kamchatkan arc, similar to N Japan and the Andes (Fig. 10). A recent compilation by Hughes andMahood (2008) show that Kamchatka has the highest density of calderas larger than 5 km/1000 km of island arc, for any volcanic arc, and this is likely due to a combination of high arcperpendicular convergence rate (7–8 cm/yr) and the presence of thick continental crust. Compositionally, Kamchatkan explosive eruptions rank equal to other island arcs with predominance of dacites to rhyodacites among ignimbrites, with lesser abundance of high-silica– rhyolites, the common feature of island arc petrogenesis as compared to intracontinental volcanic provinces, such as Yellowstone. Using the same database of Hughes and Mahood (2008) for other island arcs, and updating the information on caldera sizes and their relative number for Kamchatka based on the results of this paper, we observe that the average caldera size increases with the increase in the inferred crustal thickness in the sequence: Aleutians–Kuriles–N Japan–Kamchatka–Andes (Fig. 10). Average Kamchatkan Caldera sizes are slightly smaller than those in the Andes but the number of caldera-forming eruptions per 1000 km of arc length is significantly larger: 15 (in Kamchatka) vs. 7 (S Andes) or 2–3 (N and Central Andes). This comparison distinguishes Kamchatka as the volcanic arc with the most voluminous explosive output."

    "text": "Estimates on the extent of glaciation in Kamchatka and NW Asia range from continental (Grosswald, 1998) to alpine (Braitseva et al., 1968). Recent reconstruction of moraine distribution in Kamchatka supports the later view but permits significant glaciers to reach both Pacific and Okhotsk shores (Bigg et al., 2008). Ice rafted debris are abundant in N Pacific (Prueher and Rea, 2001a,b) and iceberg discharge pathways suggest Kamchatkan source at least to 882–884\ncores (Bigg et al., 2008). In all reconstructions, all volcanic ranges in the eastern volcanic front and in Sredinny Range were covered by hundreds of meters of ice.\nThe presented data allow us to put the ages of the eruptions in the context of the global SPECMAP bentic foraminifera δ18O record (Imbrie et al., 1984; Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005), which serves as a good globally-averaged proxy for climate change in Pliocene and Quaternary. In order to determine if Ar–Ar dates plot in “glacial” or “interglacial” time, we took the age of the eruptions and correlated it with the appropriate glacial cycle. Maximum and minimum δ18O foraminifera values of this glacial cycle were taken to reflect the full range of climate change during the climate change cycle, and thus position of the eruption closer to the maximum δ18O value (coldest, glacial time, maximum ice, Fig. 11) or low-δ18O value (warmest and interglacial) can be estimated for each age of the eruption.\nPerhaps the most surprising result of the present study is that out of 16 new ages of large caldera-forming eruptions three quarters plot in the “75% glacial” time. This result gets additional confirmation when we consider an radiocarbon-dated peak of volcanic activity that falls during the youngest glacial maximum near 37–38 ky (Table 1). Furthermore, the positive correlation of glaciation and the number of explosive volcanic eruptions is evident in N Pacific drill cores (Fig. 12; Prueher and Rea, 2001a,b; Cao et al., 1995) off the coast of Kamchatka, which shows sudden increase in glacial deposits and volcanic ash layers starting at about 2.6 Ma (Fig. 12b). The increased explosive volcanic activity in the Quaternary is a known observation in many other drill cores around Pacific and elsewhere (Kennett and Thunell, 1977) and thus this correlation may characterize other glaciated areas in the Aleutians and Alaska that supplied ash to the locations drilled, and the Hole 183 in particular (Fig. 12a).\n6.3. Ash record in NW Pacific and glacial–interglacial connection\nRecords of ash present in drillcores 881–884, 887 of the Ocean Deep Sea Drilling Project were presented by Prueher and Rea (2001a, 2001b) and Cao et al. (1995). The latter work presents exhaustive and highly detailed chemical analysis of a majority of many tens of ash layers including trace elemental and isotopic data. We plotted the stratigraphic sedimentological ages against thicknesses of ash layers over in drill cores 882, 883, and 887 from Prueher and Rea (2001a, 2001b) and 882A, 883A, and 884B from Cao et al. (1995). These are\ndrill cores in the vicinity of Kamchatka spanning over 5 Ma of sedimentological record (Fig. 12b,c). In particular, glass shards in ash record show oscillating high K2O and low-K2O rhyolitic varieties that can be attributed to volcanic eruptions in the Sredinny Range and Eastern Volcanic front respectively (Fig. 1). We also plotted newlydetermined ages of studied eruptions in an attempt to find a match of the thickest ash layers with the dated eruptions. This is particularly warranted for two supereruptions that we identified: 1.78 Ma Karymshina and 0.45 Ma Pauzhetka Calderas.\nResults of this comparison are rather inconclusive. Not only that is difficult to find identical ash layer of comparable thickness in these neighboring holes, the dated eruptions do not match even within several hundred thousand years. Exceptionally thick ash layers are found in the hole 884B (Cao et al., 1995): 370 cm at 1.3–1.55 Ma, 118 cm at 0.78–0.8 Ma. Should sedimentological ages for these ash layers be corrected, then these two thickest ash layers would correspond to Karymshina and Pauzhetka Caldera-forming eruptions. Compositionally both ash layers are low-K2O and thus this is permissive, pending better age resolution in the drill cores and/or using the ages of determined eruptions as marker layers in drill cores. Two additional thick ash layers: 41 cm at 1.02 Ma, and 48 cm at 1.21 Ma with K2O values appropriate for the Eastern Volcanic front may correspond to the Stena–Soboliny and Korneva River ignimbrites."

    "heading": "6.4. What causes explosive eruptions and low-δ18O values during the glacial times?",
    "text": "The observation presented here that the majority of eruptions happened during a maximal (“75% glacial”) period is counterintuitive and deserves discussion. There were many attempts to describe periodicity of volcanic eruptions, both basaltic and silicic, explosive and effusive, to external factors varying from sea-level change, tides, to glaciations (Kennett and Thunell, 1977; Rampino et al., 1979; Wallman et al, 1988; Glazner et al., 1999; Gusev et al., 2003; Jellinek et al., 2004; Jicha et al., 2009). It appears that glaciations have documented influences on volcanism in Iceland, Sierra Nevada, and NE Pacific, with increased mantle melting productivity and formation of the crustal magma chambers. However the connection between deglaciation and increased volcanism is not straightforward: melting glaciers (glacial unload) do not automatically cause volcanic eruptions because lithostatic and hydrostatic pressure differential remains the same. Thus, association of the thickest ice with calderas makes them most susceptible to pressure fluctuation during interstadial and deglaciation episodes: caldera walls may experience cone failure during deglaciation (Waythomas and Wallace, 2002; Huggel et al., 2007).\nJellinek et al. (2004) attributed the rate of change— first derivative of δ18O-time forminifera SPECMAP data — as a leading cause of triggering volcanic eruptions. Peaks of basaltic and silicic eruptions in eastern Sierra Nevada (Glazner et al., 1999) demonstrated delay after deglaciation at 3 ka (basaltic) and 11 ka (silicic) eruptions. These delays were explained by the elastic response of the mantle and the crust (Slater et al., 1998; Jellinek et al., 2004).\nOur observation that the majority of studied Kamchatkan eruptions happen during glacial times supports this view. Glacial times represent the more dynamic conditions for change, with multiple fluctuation of the amount of ice, while ice-free or ice poor interglacial periods do not cause oscillating pressure over magma chambers (Fig. 13). The other factors that may promote greater explosivity during glacial periods involve specific hydrogeologic conditions for hydrothermal circulation around caldera-covered volcanic centers (Fig. 13). Confined hydrothermal circulation under ice may cause greater weakening of the intracaldera roof rock, formation of structurally-weak and permeable tuyas and hyaloclastites like in Iceland, that are more prone to subsequent collapse in interstadial. This hydrothermal weakeningmay contribute to catastrophic volcanic\nedifice failures caused by glacial erosion and deglaciation (e.g. Waythomas and Wallace, 2002). An additional consideration for explosive eruptions happening during glacial periods may be related to increased accumulation of gas phase in their parental magma chamber (Fig. 13), both due to magma chamber saturation with volatiles, and by water inherited from assimilation of the surrounding meteoric–hydrothermal system.\nAn independent memory of glaciations in erupted volcanic products is delivered by their low-δ18O values, making Kamchatka one of the provinces around the world with abundant low-δ18O magmas. The appearance of low-δ18O signature inmagma is related to remelting of hydrothermally-altered rocks altered by low-δ18O snow water, and seasonally-averaged δ18O values of meteoric waters tend to be lower during the glacial, than intergracial times, which (other conditions being the same) should fingerprint the upper crust with lower δ18O values.\nIt is hard to distinguish which of these factors played the dominant role but the abundant low-δ18O values in volcanic products from Kamchatka (this work and Bindeman et al., 2004) suggest that the assimilation of hydrothermally-altered rocks from adjacent meteoric– hydrothermal systems played an equally-important role, in addition to the physical changes associated with glacial–interglacial pressure oscillations. While availability of water is likely to be similar in glacial vs. interglacial time in wet Kamchatkan climate, it is the lower-δ18O value of glacial precipitation that has greater isotopic leverage to fingerprint the crust, aiding identification of the shallow petrogenetic processes."
