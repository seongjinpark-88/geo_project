A critical aspect for the development of the Tibetan plateau that remains open to intense debate is whether the collision among the Tibetan continental blocks or the subduction of the Tethys prior to the Indo-Asian collision in the Cenozoic contributed to the plateau growth. We propose here that an Andean-type orogen could have been present in southern Tibet from the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, but collapsed during the Middle Cretaceous, based on a synthesis of existing structural, sedimentary, geochronological, and geochemical data. The orogeny is marked by north-verging Jurassic–Early Cretaceous thrusting in the Lhasa block, a result of flat subduction of the Yarlung-Zangpo Neo-tethys that is recorded by a narrow belt of 205–174 Ma adakitic rocks along the southernmost margin of the Lhasa block. Denudation of the orogen produced a thick (up to 15 km) sequence of Jurassic turbidites and molasse-type sediments on the northern Lhasa block. Widespread Middle Cretaceous (135–100 Ma) postorogenic, strongly peraluminous to calc-alkaline, magmatism and extensional deformation in the Lhasa block and an extensive marine transgression in Tibet indicate that the orogen broke down due to extension resulting from lithosphere delamination and asthenosphere upwelling. Meanwhile, the north-dipping subduction of the Bangong Meso-tethys produced a wide Jurassic–Middle Cretaceous magmatic arc along the southern margin of the Qiangtang block. Findings of 132–108 Ma-aged ophiolites rich with Middle Cretaceous radiolarians in central Tibet indicate that the Bangong Meso-tethys did not close until the Late Cretaceous. Repeated flat slab subduction of the Yarlung-Zangpo Neo-tethys occurred during the Late Cretaceous (90–78Ma) as indicated by the adakites in the southernmost Lhasa block, which, together with the ongoing Qiangtang–Lhasa collision, could have contributed to the growth of the Tibetan plateau.\n© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "The elevation of the Tibetan plateau has intensively impinged upon regional and global climate, monsoon intensity, and ocean chemistry (e.g., Ruddiman and Kutzbach, 1991; Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; Richter et al., 1992; Molnar et al., 1993; An et al., 2001). However, how and when the Tibetan Plateau has developed through geologic time still remains open to intense debate (e.g., Murphy et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1998; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Zhang et al., 2002; Kapp et al., 2003a; Zhang et al., 2004; Kapp et al., 2005b; Guynn et al., 2006; Kapp et al., 2007), although it is widely accepted that the Tibetan plateau is a late Cenozoic product of the Indo-Asian collision (e.g., Dewey et al., 1988; Royden et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008a). In fact, Tibet in western China not only possesses the largest plateau on Earth but also incorporates one of the largest Late Mesozoic magmatic arcs in its south (Gangdese arc), giving testimony to a spectacular subduction of the Tethys during the Mesozoic (Fig. 1; e.g., Maluski et al., 1982; Allègre et al., 1984; Scharer et al., 1984; Xu et al., 1985; Chang et al., 1986; Coulon et al., 1986; Debon et al., 1986; Dewey et al., 1988; XZBGM, 1993; Hsü et al., 1995; Ding and Lai, 2003; GSC and CIGMR, 2004). Furthermore, the Tibetan plateau comprises the Lhasa and Qiangtang continental blocks (Fig. 1), which got amalgamated along the Bangong Meso-tethyan suture during the Late Mesozoic (e.g., Allègre et al., 1984; Girardeau et al., 1984, 1985; Chang et al., 1986; Dewey et al., 1988; XZBGM, 1993; Matte et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2002; Zhang, 2004; Zhang et al., 2004). Such tectonic scenario\nimplies possible Tibetan-type orogeny due to the Lhasa–Qiangtang collision (e.g., Murphy et al., 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003a, 2005b; Guynn et al., 2006; Kapp et al., 2007) or Andean-type orogeny due to the Tethyan subduction (e.g., Burg et al., 1983; England and Searle, 1986), prior to the Indo-Asian collision. So far, there has been no consensus on the contribution of these LateMesozoic tectonisms to the plateau growth, and fundamental aspects about the tectonic development of Tibet, western China, remain open to debate. For example, were the Middle Cretaceous magmatic rocks in the Lhasa block produced by a north dipping subduction of the Yarlung-Zangpo Neo-tethys (e.g., Maluski et al., 1982; Coulon et al., 1986; Debon et al., 1986; Zhang et al., 2004), a south-dipping subduction of the Bangong Meso-tethys (Kang et al., 2006, 2009; Zhu et al., 2009b; Kang et al., 2010), or extensional collapse of an orogen related to the Lhasa– Qiangtang collision (e.g., Harris et al., 1990)? Was the Late Mesozoic contractional deformation in southern Tibet mainly controlled by the flat subduction (e.g., Zhang et al., 2004, 2007c) or the Lhasa–Qiangtang continental collision (e.g., Murphy et al., 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003a, 2005b; Guynn et al., 2006; Kapp et al., 2007)? Did the orogen created during the Early Cretaceous persist until the Cenozoic Indo-Asian collision (e.g., Murphy et al., 1997) or collapse (Zhang et al., 1998; Zhang, 2000; Zhang et al., 2002, 2004, 2007c)?\nClearly, the Late Mesozoic geologic and tectonic evolution of Tibet, in particular, of the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks, where Late Mesozoic magmatism and marine sedimentation were concentrated, is a key to understanding the development of the Tibetan plateau and the evolution\nain sutures or faults: A—Altyan fault zone, B—Bangong–Nujiang suture, Dq—Dian–Qiong menshan fault zone, Lt—Litang suture, Qi—Qilian suture, Ql—Qinling suture, S—Shuanghu lung Zangbo suture.\nof the Tethys. Since the turn of this century, a wealth of significant geologic, geochronological, and geochemical data have been accumulated through work by Chinese and international community, and so it is possible to significantly refine the geology of Tibet. This paper attempts to summarize the Late Mesozoic geology of these two blocks, in order to provide insight into those questions mentioned above. In particular, we pay special attention to the high-solution data that stay in Chinese literature generally inaccessible to the international community, which prevailingly are results of China Geological Survey-sponsored mapping throughout the Tibetan plateau at a scale of 1:250,000 by Chinese workers (e.g., Xie et al., 2002a, 2002b; GSC and CIGMR, 2004; Bai et al., 2005; Xiang et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2006a; Wang et al., 2006a, 2006b). Based on our interpretation these data testify to an Andean-type orogen in southern Tibet during the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, which broke down during the Middle Cretaceous. We also propose that the Bangong Meso-tethys did not close until the Late Cretaceous. During the Late Cretaceous, flat slab subduction of the Yarlung-Zangpo Neo-tethys in association with the Qiangtang–Lhasa collision possibly contributed to the plateau growth."

    "heading": "2. Geologic setting",
    "text": "The Tibetan plateau is a major part of the Tethyan orogenic collage (Sengör, 1990). It consists of four main terrains, including Qaidam, Songpan–Ganzi, Qiangtang, and Lhasa, from north to south, separated by the Mesozoic Kunlun, Jinsa, and Bangong suture zones, from north to south (Fig. 1; Allègre et al., 1984; Chang et al., 1986; Dewey et al., 1988; Sengör, 1990; Yin and Harrison, 2000).\nThe Jinsa Paleo-tethys suture, open at the Carboniferous (e.g., Jian et al., 2003), is possibly the main Cathaysian–Gondwanan divide in Tibet. To its southwest, the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks are underlain by the Precambrian basement that was expensively overlapped by Pan-African metamorphism and magmatism (~500 Ma; e.g., Ji et al., 2009a; Dong et al., 2011). These two blocks are covered by similar Paleozoic shelf strata (Allègre et al., 1984; Chang et al., 1986; Dewey et al., 1988; Yin et al., 1988), containing upper Paleozoic tillites and glaciomarine faunas (e.g., XZBGM, 1993; GSC and CIGMR, 2004). To the northeast of the suture, the Paleozoic–Triassic Qaidam and Yidun magmatic arcs are possibly underlain by the Precambrian basement with Cathaysian affinity (e.g., Reid et al., 2007) and Paleozoic warm-water sediments and faunas (e.g., XZBGM, 1993; GSC and CIGMR, 2004). The Songpan–Ganzi terrane, covered by Upper Triassic turbidites with a thickness up to 10–15 km, has traditionally been interpreted to be floored by oceanic crust (e.g., Sengör, 1990; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Roger et al., 2003). However, recent deep seismic probes into the crustal structure (e.g., Wang et al., 2007a), geochemical and isotopic investigations on the magmatic rocks (e.g., Yuan et al., 2010), and tectonic modeling (Zhang, 2001a, 2002) indicate that the terrane may currently be underlain by a Cathaysian-type continental basement. These huge Triassic turbidites have diversified provenances, with major sources derived from the Dabie–Qinling orogens (Weislogel et al., 2010) and the central Qiangtang metamorphic belt (e.g., Zhang et al., 2008a, 2012).\nThe Qiangtang block is divided into eastern and western blocks by the Triassic Shuanghu suture (e.g., XZBGM, 1993; Zhang, 2001b; Zhang et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2006c; Liu et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011a), which is marked by the central Qiangtang metamorphic terrane containing an assemblage of eclogites, eclogitic metasediments, metasedimentary schists and gneisses, and marble (Zhang et al., 2006a,b; Tang, 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Tang and Zhang, in press-a,b). Alternatively, this metamorphic terrane has been interpreted to contain a large blueschist- and eclogite-bearing metamorphic core complex underthrust from the Jinsa suture (Kapp et al., 2000; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003b; Pullen et al., 2008a). This metamorphic terrane possibly links eastward with the Ando (Zhang et al., 2010a) and Basu (Zhang et al., 2008b) metamorphic massifs,\nwhere (ultra) high-pressure rocks have been identified (Fig. 1; Zhang and Tang, 2009). Therefore, a Triassic orogen along central Tibet comprising these three high-pressure metamorphic terranes, is proposed (Tang, 2010; Tang and Zhang, 2012a, 2012b), whichwas overprinted by EarlyMesozoic post-orogenic, bimodal magmatism related to the collapse of this orogen (Zhang and Tang, 2009; Tang, 2010; Zhang et al., 2011a). The northern and southern flanks of the eastern Qiangtang block were involved into intensive arc magmatism during the PermoTriassic times, possibly related to the N-dipping subduction of the Jinsa Paleo-tethys (e.g., Wang et al., 2007b) and S-dipping subduction of the Shuanghu Paleo-tethys (Yang et al., 2011a), respectively.\nThe Lhasa block can be divided into a continental block in the north and a magmatic arc (Gangdese arc) in the south (Fig. 1; Burg et al., 1983; England and Searle, 1986; XZBGM, 1993). The northern continental Lhasa block contains scattered outcrops of Paleozoic shelf sediments. Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic volcanic and plutonic rocks can be traced along the entire Gangdese arc (XZBGM, 1993) and have a wide variety of compositions (e.g., Maluski et al., 1982; Scharer et al., 1984; Coulon et al., 1986; Debon et al., 1986; Harris et al., 1988; Pearce and Mei, 1988; Harris et al., 1990; XZBGM, 1993; Murphy et al., 1997; Miller et al., 2000). Notably, eclogite (e.g., Yang et al., 2009) and blueschist (Liu et al., 2010)-bearing Triassic metamorphic massif have been recently discovered in the southeastern corner of the Lhasa block. This metamorphic massif either represents a Paleo-tethyan suture within the block (e.g., Yang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011a), or an overthrust sheet transported from the central Tibetan orogen, since sporadic occurrence of similar Triassic ophiolitic fragments is present on the Lhasa block north of this metamorphic massif (Zhang and Tang, 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Tang, 2010; and references therein)."

    "text": "A narrow belt of Early Jurassic (205–174 Ma) adakitic rocks (andesites and dacites), >600-km-long, is present along the southernmost margin of the Lhasa block (Fig. 2, Table S1; Geng et al., 2005, 2006; Chu et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2007a, 2007b; Zhang et al., 2007a; Yang et al., 2008, 2011b; Zhu et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2009b; Zhang et al., 2009). These rocks are strongly depleted in Y (7.4–12.5 ppm) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and are in the adakite field on a plot of Sr/Y versus Y diagram (Fig. 3a). They have positive εNd (Fig. 3b, Table S2) and εHf (e.g., Geng et al., 2005; Chu et al., 2006; Qu et al., 2007b; Ji et al., 2009b; Yang et al., 2011b) values and show compositional characteristics that generally fit those of a slab melt as defined by Defant and Drummond (1990)."

    "text": "Sporadic syn-orogenic igneous rocks are exposed in the central segment of the Lhasa block and are dated at 170–137 Ma (Fig. 2, Table S1; Murphy et al., 1997; Ding and Lai, 2003; Huang et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2010; Du et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2011). There is a general younging trend toward the north (Fig. 2). The exposures are small intrusions of granitoids and minor potassic granites, characterized by the absence of intermediate to basic rocks. These rocks are generally rich in large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs, e.g., Rb, Th, U, K, Pb) and depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs, e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti). They have varying negative Hf values (−16.8 to −0.8) and Paleoproterozoic Hf crustal model ages (1.2 to 2.3 Ga) (Jiang et al., 2010; Du et al., 2011).\nGeochemically, most of the rocks are generally subduction-related calc-alkaline I-type granitoids. Small K-rich syenogranites and alkali\ngranites in the western part of the central Lhasa block (Jiang et al., 2010; Du et al., 2011) probably formed above the deepest parts of active subduction zone, similar to the high-K magmatic rocks in South China during the cratonward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific (Li and Li, 2007)."

    "heading": "3.3. Middle Cretaceous post-orogenic bimodal magmatism in the Lhasa block",
    "text": "Middle Cretaceous post-orogenic bimodal magmatism was widespread over the entire Lhasa block (Fig. 2), except the area covered by later volcanic rocks (XZBGM, 1993; GSC and CIGMR, 2004). This phase of magmatism commenced at ca. 135 Ma and lasted to ca. 100 Ma (Fig. 3b, Table S1; e.g., Scharer et al., 1984; Xu et al., 1985; Coulon et al., 1986; Pearce and Mei, 1988; Harris et al., 1988, 1990; Wu et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2000; Ding and Lai, 2003; Liu et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2004; Kapp et al., 2005a; Yang et al., 2005; Zhai et al., 2005; He et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008; Chiu et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2009b; Kang et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009a, 2009b; Kang et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010a, 2010b; Fei et al., 2010a, 2010b; Jiang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010c; Du et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011a; Qu et al., 2012). The rocks exhibit a varied composition, from strongly peraluminous (SP; molecular Al2O3/(CaO+Na2O+K2O) or A/CNK≥1.1) (e.g., Ding and Lai, 2003; Lu et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2005; Zhai et al., 2005; He et al., 2006; Fei et al., 2010b) to calc-alkaline (Fig. 3a, Table S1; e.g., Liu et al., 2004; Kang et al., 2006; Qu and Xin, 2006; Wen et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010b; Zhang et al., 2010c), as well asminor aluminous A-type granites (e.g., Qu et al., 2012).\nThe SP granites contain highly-aluminous minerals such as muscovite, cordierite, garnet, and tourmaline, and some are leucogranites with b5% mafic minerals (e.g., Ding and Lai, 2003; Lu et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2005; Zhai et al., 2005; He et al., 2006). These SP granites are characterized by very low εNd values (Fig. 3b, Table S2), indicating a source from melting of crustal material. They are associated with\nlarge volumes of contemporaneous calc-alkaline, intermediate to acidic rocks that display a high Y content, low Sr/Y and various, but generally negative, εNd values (Fig. 3a,b; Table S2; Li et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009a, 2009b; Chen et al., 2010a; Kang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010c, 2010d; Zhang et al., 2011b). The rocks are also characterized by a strong depletion in Nb and Ta concomitant with enrichments in light-rare-earth elements, Th, and Pb, indicative of a normal magmatic arc affinity (e.g., Coulon et al., 1986; Harris et al., 1988; Pearce and Mei, 1988; Harris et al., 1990; Wu et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2005; He et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008; Gao et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009a, 2009b; Chen et al., 2010a, 2010b; Jiang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010c; Du et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2011; Qu et al., 2012).\nLocalized outcrops of mafic-rich extrusive and volcanic rocks also occur in the Lhasa block (Tables S1, S2; e.g., Wu et al., 1999; Kang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009b; Fei et al., 2010a; Kang et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2011b). Some mafic rocks are characterized by high εNd values (Fig. 3b, Table S2) and high Mg and Cr, a characteristic of primitive magmas (e.g., Zhang et al., 2004). Some andesites contain contemporaneous mafic xenoliths and compositionally show a mixing of crustal melting with the primitive mafic magmas (e.g., Wu et al., 1999; Ji et al., 2009b; Kang et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009b; Fei et al., 2010a)."

Thrusting was clearly propagated northward as indicated by the ages of synkinematic metamorphism and syn-orogenic magmatism (205–137 Ma. Figs. 2, 6; Table S1), although some thrusts occurred out of sequence. The Emei La thrust system, penetrated by 153 and 154 Ma syn-orogenic granites (Figs. 6, 7; Table S1; Murphy et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2006) and dated at 171 Ma based on a measurement on the muscovite from the synkinematic schist using Ar–Ar method (Fig. 6; Table S1; Xie et al., 2002b), represents a major example of Middle Jurassic-aged thrusting (Fig. 6). It is also likely that the south-dipping Shibaluo thrust system of Murphy et al. (1997) in this area (not shown) was active during the Jurassic, based on the geometric relationships between thrust faults\nand magmatic rocks (Zhang et al., 2004). In the middle segment of the eastern Lhasa block, the Jiali fault was likely a major, south-dipping growth-reverse fault, active during the Jurassic and serving as the boundary fault of the Jurassic foreland molasse basin (Fig. 6). Its likely western extension, the Shilin thrust (Fig. 6), produced a 174 Ma Ar/Ar age from synkinematic granulite (Hu et al., 2004). In the northern part of the Lhasa block, we dated on the synkinematic mica schist from the north-dipping Gaize fault and produced a Late Jurassic Ar–Ar age of 153 Ma (Fig. 6; Table S1; Zhang, 2007).

A likely Middle Cretaceous metamorphic core complex is exposed along one of three faults in this region (Fig. 6; Yang et al., 2004; Geng et al., 2006).Minor normal growth faults, the abrupt variation of strata thickness and the existence of bimodal volcanic rocks along the boundary fault zone of the Asa basin in the central western Lhasa block imply normal faulting during the Middle Cretaceous, although most of these normal faults could have been reactivated as reverse faults during post-Middle Cretaceous contractional deformation (Fig. 7; Zhang et al., 2004).

    "text": "Existing numerical and petrologic models indicate that flat subduction can produce the temperature and pressure conditions necessary for adakitic magmas by fusion of moderately old (10–45 Ma) oceanic lithosphere crust (c.f. Gutscher et al., 2000). Based on the long duration\nof adakite igneous activity along the southernmost Tibetan margin (205–174 Ma. Figs. 2, 9; Table S1), it is reasonable to infer that the rocks could have been produced by syn-orogenic, partial melting of the flat subducting Yarlung-Zangpo Neotethyan oceanic crust (Fig. 10a, b). Flat subduction could have led to a contractional strain within the overriding plate (Gutscher et al., 2000) and is generally believed to be amain mechanism for building of the Andean-type orogen. For example, flat subduction could have played a main role in building of the Andean plateau (e.g., Jordan et al., 1983). Furthermore, it has been considered to be a dominant mechanism for the >1200 km-wide intracontinental orogens both in U.S. Cordillera (e.g., Coney and Reynolds, 1977) and in South China (Li and Li, 2007). Thrusting in the Lhasa block during the Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (Figs. 6, 9) was possibly a result of such flat subduction (Fig. 10a,c). The ages of both syn-orogenic magmatism and thrusting showa similar trend of younging northward (Figs. 2, 6), consistent with a mechanical source from the southern subduction zone of the Neo-tethys. Compressional deformation influenced most of the Lhasa\nblock (Figs. 6, 7, 9), and created topographic highs in the Lhasa block during the Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (Fig. 10b). This formed the source of the terrigenous clasts for the huge turbidite sequences in the northern margin of the Lhasa block and for the foreland molasses in the central Lhasa block (Fig. 10b). In fact, a regional deposition hiatus in the southern Lhasa block from the Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (e.g., Xie et al., 2002b; GSC and CIGMR, 2004) indicates that this area was heavily elevated and being eroded during this temporal interval.\nWithin the overwhelmingly southerly source of the thick, Jurassic turbidites and molasse-type sediments (up to 15 km) and Lower Cretaceous molasse-type sediments (up to 5 km) on the Lhasa block constrain the relative relief and elevation of the Andean-type orogen. The Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous siliciclastic rocks, with average thicknesses of 10 km and 2.5 km (e.g., XZBGM, 1993), cover about 20% (~100 km wide) and 25% (~125 km wide) of the Lhasa block (~1500 km long), respectively. The huge volume of denudation of this orogen could therefore have covered an area up to 2×106 km2 between ~170 Ma and ~135 Ma (Fig. 10b), with the denudation focusing on its southern half where the metamorphosed Paleozoic and Precambrian basements were exposed during intense unroofing and there was a huge depositional hiatus between the Middle Cretaceous and the Paleozoic (e.g., Xie et al., 2002b; GSC and CIGMR, 2004).\nFig. 7. A schematic cross section of the Lhasa block along the longitude of 86° E, based on l Cretaceous, oph—ophiolite sheet, pz—Paleozoic, Q—Quaternary, uk—Upper Cretaceous.\nCrustal anatexis genesis of the post-orogenic SP granites mentioned above also indicates a thickened crust. However, their spatial and temporal association with contemporaneous calc-alkaline igneous activity, normal faulting, and low-pressure metamorphism indicate areas of reduced, syn-orogenic crust thickening (≤ 50 km; Sylvester, 1999)."

Crustal anatexis for genesis of hot SP granite melts was related to a largemantle heat source at the base of the crust associatedwith asthenospheric upwelling that followed slab roll-back and break-off and lithospheric delamination (Fig. 10c).

Bilateral obduction of theMeso-tethyan oceanic crust is supported by thewidely distributed ophiolitic fragments on both the northern margin of the Lhasa block and the southern margin of the Qiangtang block (Fig. 8). It is likely that Upper Jurassic–Middle Cretaceous marine sediments that cover a Dongqiao ophiolitic fragment, as documented by Girardeau et al.

In fact, the geochemical features of depleted Y and HREE and high Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios and the mineral assemblages of these rocks indicate melting of a juvenile lower crust produced by basaltic underplating (Wen et al., 2008). Along with the flat slab subduction during the Early Jurassic, therefore,\nrepeated flat slab subduction of the Yarlung-Zangpo Neo-tethys occurred along the southern Tibetan margin during the Late Cretaceous (Fig. 10d; 90–78 Ma), although this adakitic magmatism has been argued to result from subduction of the oceanic ridge (e.g., Zhang et al., 2010b).

Late Cretaceous records of crustal shortening over the Lhasa block (e.g., England and Searle, 1986; Murphy et al., 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003a, 2005b; DeCelles et al., 2007; He et al., 2007; Kapp et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007; Pullen et al., 2008b) and even in the Qiangtang block (Kapp et al., 2005b) could be a product of contractional strain resulted from the Qiangtang–Lhasa collision and the flat-lying subduction of the Yarlung-Zangpo Neo-tethys (Fig. 10d). Substantial upper crustal shortening could have formed significant crustal thickening and topographic elevation in Tibet prior to the Indo-Asian collision. It is not impossible that the high reliefs could maintain to the Indo-Asian collision at the beginning of the Cenozoic, although no constraints on the elevation can be given now. In fact, much of the Lhasa block was apparently elevated and being eroded during this temporal interval, generating a regional Late Cretaceous angular unconformity (Coulon et al., 1986; Coward et al., 1988; Matte et al., 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003a; GSC and CIGMR, 2004; DeCelles et al., 2007)."

This orogeny resulted in extensive north-verging thrusting occurred in the Lhasa block during this temporal interval. Denudation of this orogen formed a thick sequence of Jurassic turbidites and molassetype sediments on the northern Lhasa block. (2) Middle Cretaceous (135–100 Ma) postorogenic, strongly peraluminous to calc-alkaline, bimodal magmatism is widespread over the Lhasa block. This, along with extensional deformation in the Lhasa block and an extensive marine transgression in Tibet, reveals that this Andean-type orogen broke down due to extension resulting from lithosphere delamination and asthenosphere upwelling. (3) 132–108 Ma-aged ophiolites rich with Middle Cretaceous radiolarians are present in central Tibet, and a wide Jurassic– Middle Cretaceous magmatic arc exists in the southern Qiangtang block. This indicates the north-dipping subduction of the Bangong Meso-tethys and its closure no earlier than the Late Cretaceous. (4) Late Cretaceous (90–78 Ma) adakites occurred in the southernmost Lhasa block, and thrusting occurred over the entire Lhasa block. Repeated flat slab subduction of the Yarlung-Zangpo Neo-tethys during the Late Cretaceous, together with the ongoing Qiangtang–Lhasa collision, could have contributed to the growth of the Tibetan plateau.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2012.06.001."
