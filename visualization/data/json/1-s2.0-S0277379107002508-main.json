The sedimentary sequence described comprises the fluvial deposits of an Early Pleistocene palaeo-Gediz river system and its tributaries prior to the onset of volcanism around Kula and the subsequent lacustrine, volcaniclastic and fluvial deposits associated with the first phase of volcanism ( 1.2Ma) in this area. Early development of an east–west drainage system in this area resulted from tectonic adjustments to north–south extension and the formation of east–west-oriented grabens. Headward erosion of drainage entering the main Alas-ehir graben led to the progressive capture of pre-existing drainage systems as eastward (headward) erosion upstream tapped drainage networks previously formed in internally draining NNE–SSW-oriented basins. Within one of these, the Selendi Basin, part of this evolutionary sequence is preserved as a buried river terrace sequence. Eleven terraces are preserved beneath alluvial fan sediments that are, in turn, capped by basaltic lava flows. Using the available geochronology these terraces are considered to represent sedimentation–incision cycles which span the period\n1.67–1.2Ma. Although progressive valley incision is a fluvial system response to regional uplift, the frequency of terrace formation within this time period suggests that the terrace formation resulted from sediment/water supply changes, a consequence of obliquitydriven climate changes. The production of sub-parallel terraces suggests that during this period the river was able to attain a quasiequilibrium longitudinal profile adjusted to the regional uplift rate. Thus, the incision rate of 0.16mma 1 during this period is believed to closely mirror the regional uplift rate.\nAfter the onset of volcanism at 1.2Ma, there is a destruction of the dynamic link between fluvial system behaviour and climate change. The repeated damming of the trunk river and its tributaries led to the construction of complex stratigraphic relationships. During the first phase of volcanism the palaeo-Gediz river was dammed on numerous occasions leading to the formation of a series of lakes upstream of the dams in the palaeo-Gediz valley. Variations in lake level forced localised base-level changes that resulted in complex fluvial system response and considerable periods of disequilibrium in profile adjustment. Furthermore, response to these baselevel changes most likely disrupted the timing of the incisional adjustment to the on-going regional uplift, thus making the use of this part of the archive for inferring regional uplift rates untenable. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus a stated aim of the project was to initiate research that would investigate these data vacuum areas (Bridgland and Maddy, 2002). One such area, identified early in the project as an area of substantial potential, was the eastern\nARTICLE IN PRESS D. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–2882 2865\nsector of the Mediterranean. With river systems unaffected by the consequences of ice-sheet incursions and extensive preservation promoted, in many cases, by moderately high uplift rates, these areas seemed ideal targets for further investigation particularly as the Mediterranean had already yielded exciting results for the later Pleistocene (Kuzucuoğlu, 1995; Macklin et al., 1995, 2002; Woodward et al., 1995; Maas et al., 1998; Rose and Meng, 1999). Furthermore, given the nature of the present vegetation in these areas and the consequent extensive natural exposure of their sedimentary record, it is no surprise that during the life of this project several studies have emerged from this area including work in Syria (Bridgland et al., 2003) and Turkey (Westaway et al., 2003; Demir et al., 2004; Westaway et al., 2004; Maddy et al., 2005, in press). Although these are preliminary studies they have yielded exciting results indicating the wealth of information waiting to be recovered from these fluvial archives. While the task of recovering valuable data from these archives will take many years, it is already clear that they contain a record that will equal, if not surpass, that of the major north–west European river systems (Bridgland, 2000).\nThe Plio–Pleistocene evolution of river basins in the Western Mediterranean has been the focus of special attention, especially within Spain (e.g. Harvey and Wells, 1987; Visera and Fernandez, 1992; Mather, 1993; Harvey et al., 1995; Mather and Harvey, 1995; Mather et al., 1995; Stokes and Mather, 2000; Garcı́a-Meléndez et al., 2003). Such areas are attractive because they record the initial phases of drainage development as uplift of in-filled\nbasins cause embryonic fluvial systems to develop. The Plio–Pleistocene evolution of these embryonic systems can then be charted with reference to the sedimentary records. These studies illustrate the interaction of tectonic and climate change affects on fluvial system behaviour. This interaction produces a sedimentary record which is complex, a situation made even more difficult to unravel due to the overprint of river capture and drainage area expansion/contraction processes (e.g. Wenzens and Wenzens, 1995; Calvache and Viseras, 1997; Wenzens and Wenzens, 1997; Stokes et al., 2002). Nonetheless the recording of the inception of a fluvial system is rare and thus these relatively complete studies of drainage evolution are particularly helpful when attempting to constrain and test theoretical models of landscape development (Pazzaglia, 2004). In this paper, we report our latest observations concerning a Plio–Pleistocene record from Western Turkey. This sequence shows many attributes of those recorded from the Western Mediterranean but the precise tectonic setting and its different climate change regime make an exact comparison unlikely. Furthermore, the study reported here records a further and important complication, the disturbance of fluvial system development by repeated damming of the rivers by the incursion of basaltic lava flows into the valley bottom. Although this situation is more complicated the presence of readily dateable materials, i.e. basalts, does provide encouragement for further investigation due to the potential outcome of quantifying process rates.\nl., 1987).

    "text": "The Gediz River is one of the principal rivers of western Turkey and it drains a catchment area of 17,000 km2 (IWMI and GDRS, 2000). The modern Gediz river rises in mountains which exceed elevations of 2000m north of the town of Gediz (Fig. 2). It drains westward to the Aegean Sea where it forms a delta north of İzmir. Along its 401 km length the Gediz crosses some of the principal tectonic structures of Western Turkey. For most of its downstream reaches the Gediz flows along the axis of one of the major grabens of western Turkey, the Alas-ehir graben (Eyidoğan and Jackson, 1985, Fig. 1). This graben is a consequence of Late Cenozoic crustal extension in the region and reflects the wider pattern of extension expressed by a series of east–west striking normal faults, which define low-lying grabens separated by footwall mountain ranges (Figs. 1 and 2) (Aksu et al., 1987; Paton, 1992; Koc-yiğit et al., 1999). Bozkurt and Sözbilir (2004) suggest the Alas-ehir graben has formed within the last 5Ma although\nA R TIC LE IN PR ES S\n2 8 6 7\nARTICLE IN PRESS D. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–28822868\nWestaway et al. (2004) suggest a slightly earlier start to graben formation at 7Ma. Whatever the age of the start of graben formation major displacement of Late Pliocene/ Early Pleistocene deposits along the main southern faults suggests that significant footwall uplift occurred during the past 1.6Ma (Sarıca, 2000; Bozkurt and Sözbilir, 2004), i.e. during the Quaternary.\nOur area of study lies north of the graben around Kula (Figs. 1–3), where the Gediz flows westwards across the uplifting footwall block prior to entering the Alas-ehir graben. The uplift of this footwall block is, in part, driven by movement on the graben bounding fault system, although the known displacement of faults along the graben margin cannot account for the total amount of known uplift and thus it has been suggested that there is a substantial element of regional uplift in this area (Westaway, 1993). Whatever the mechanism of uplift in our study area, what is clear is that the fluvial response has been a punctuated, but progressive, incision during the Plio–Pleistocene."

    "text": "The study area lies within the southern sector of the Selendi Basin (Figs. 2 and 3). The Selendi Basin is an in-filled Tertiary structure formed within the underlying basement rocks (predominantly metasediments and ophiolites) and constitutes one of four NNE–SSW aligned basins (Fig. 2) which are cut to the south by the younger E–W aligned Alas-ehir graben and thus predate that structure. These basins are of disputed origin with some authors favouring formation as normal fault-bounded grabens during an early phase of east–west extension (e.g. Seyitoğlu and Scott, 1994), while it has also been suggested that they originate through post-orogenic subsidence, i.e. without active faulting (İnci, 2002). Purvis and Robertson (2004) present a further model in which they suggest these basins relate to an early phase of north–south extension (similar to that which later formed the Alas-ehir and Sı́mav grabens (Fig. 2)) with the basement highs representing undulations of an inferred extensional detachment surface. Whatever their origins the basins are largely in-filled by upwards-fining sequences comprising basal fluvial sediments fining to lacustrine deposits towards the top (see below). During this in-filling phase the basin sequences were disrupted by the eruption of large volcanoes which led to the widespread deposition of thick volcaniclastic sequences (Fig. 2). In the Selendi Basin, age estimates ranging from 18.9 to 14.9Ma (Seyitoğlu, 1997) place these eruptions in the Early–Middle Miocene. Significantly, these in-fill sequences are deformed during the latest phase of north–south extension with the formation of numerous high-angle normal fault-bounded east–west-oriented structures (Fig. 2.).\nWithin the study area (Figs. 2 and 3) the Selendi Basin infill (up to 400m in thickness) comprises basal coarseclastic sediments of the Hacıbekir Group overlain by the İnay Group (Seyitoğlu, 1997). The İnay Group can be subdivided into a thick sequence of grey/white, fluvial/ colluvial clastic sediments (Ahmetler Formation, Ercan\net al., 1983) overlain by thinner continental carbonates of lacustrine origin (Ulubey Formation, Ercan et al., 1983), a lithostratigraphic sequence which represents the progressive in-fill of an internally draining basin (Ercan et al., 1983, Purvis and Robertson, 2004). The stratigraphic relationship of the volcanic eruptions to the Hacıbekir and İnay Groups is disputed (Purvis and Robertson, 2004) and thus the precise chronology of this sequence remains insecure."

    "heading": "2. Plio–Pleistocene drainage development: tectonics and river capture",
    "text": "The initiation of the modern east–west drainage line is a product of Plio–Pleistocene tectonic events and repeated river capture. The latest pulse of north–south extension created not only the Alas-ehir and Sı́mav grabens but also led to the formation of numerous east–west aligned minigrabens (up to 10 km wide), e.g. within the Selendi and Us-ak-Güre Basins (Purvis and Robertson, 2004, Fig. 2). Associated footwall uplift along the main grabens, together with a large component of regional uplift, led to increasing relief relative to the local graben base level. These boundary conditions fashioned the nature of early fluvial system development. The onset of footwall uplift across these basins led to the end of the widespread lacustrine sedimentation (Ulubey Formation) and the initiation of incision. The Asartepe Formation, comprising sands and gravels (Ercan et al, 1978, 1983), has been considered to represent this phase, however, these deposits are poorly defined and appear to be of different ages in each basin, i.e. all sediments which relate to the Plio–Pleistocene have been grouped under this heading and no attempt has been made to investigate these deposits further. Despite the lack of sedimentary detail for this period some conclusions can be drawn concerning the development of the palaeo-Gediz drainage system. Vigourous headward erosion by a river system at the northern boundary of the Alas-ehir graben initially led to the capture of drainage within the Demı́rcı́ basin, i.e. the Demı́rcı́ river system (Figs. 2 and 4A location C). Later headward erosion of an eastern tributary to this system cut through the area overlying the basement high which bounds the Demı́rcı́ basin to the east and captured the drainage of the Selendi Basin (Fig. 4B location D). It is probable that this erosion was aided by E–W faulting and displacement within the Ulubey Formation. This process ultimately led to the formation of the modern Selendi river system and thus drainage from this area into the Alas-ehir graben. It is not yet known how drainage in either the Demı́rcı́ or Selendi Basin was arranged prior to these captures. It is possible that the uplift and capture took place rapidly after the onset of Plio–Pleistocene graben formation, thus it is likely that both the Demı́rcı́ and Selendi Basins could still have been internally draining basins (i.e. similar to the situation during the deposition of the Ulubey Formation) prior to capture of their respective drainage systems.\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–2882 2869\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–28822870\nFollowing capture at the south-west of the Selendi Basin catchment (Fig. 4B), ultimately all drainage within the Selendi Basin would have been drawn towards this point, with the effect of capture sending a wave of erosion throughout the Selendi Basin, the result of a dramatic fall in local base level. Similar responses to capture have been noted in the Sorbas basin SE Spain (Stokes et al., 2002). This process would have been moderated only by the resistance of the basement high (separating the Selendi from the Demı́rcı́ Basins) which would have formed a local base level for erosion at its eastern (upstream) boundary once any overlying Hacıbekir/İnay Group sediments had been removed. The creation of the modern Gediz network would have been completed by headward erosion of one of the Selendi river tributaries, eastwards into the western sector of the Us-ak-Güre Basin (Fig. 2, location A). Only after this latest capture would the system tap the Gediz area (Figs. 2 and 4C location E). It is within the area of this tributary of the Selendi river that the Early Pleistocene terrace sequence (described below) is preserved. The progressive eastward headward erosion of this system continues at the present time. The modern Gediz drainage system is close to capturing the north–south drainage (i.e. Damlilar Derisi) of the eastern sector of the Us-ak-Güre Basin around Us-ak (Fig. 4C location F.)."

    "text": "Within the main study area post-depositional uplift of the İnay Group has resulted in the progressive dissection of this Tertiary basin fill. Differential erosion has led to the formation of high-level plateaux to the north of the field area (Fig. 3), formed in the resistant carbonates of the Ulubey Formation and, where the carbonates have been completely removed, to the creation of lower level extensive badlands formed within the underlying Ahmetler Formation (Figs. 3 and 5A). Where the sediments of the İnay Group have been removed by erosion, a pre-İnay landscape is being exhumed (Fig. 3.). The exhumed basement forms ridges which constitute the eastern and western watersheds of the southbank tributary drainage systems of the Söğüt and the former Kula river (Fig. 3). The Kula river has been artificially diverted into the Söğüt during the Holocene and thus this area is currently drained by a poorly developed gully system.\nEarlier work on drainage evolution in the area around Kula (Ozaner, 1992) identified important patterns of drainage changes during the Quaternary but did not pursue a detailed investigation of the sedimentary record. From beneath the high-level, lava-capped, Sarnıc- and Burgaz plateaux (Figs. 3 and 5B) Maddy et al. (2005, in press) report the discovery of a well-preserved flight of buried river terraces (Figs. 6A and B). These terraces are the result of deposition within a tributary river draining to the Selendi river (see above), referred to here as the palaeoGediz. Extensive outcrops of palaeo-Gediz gravels lie on bounding surfaces with the underlying Ahmetler\nFormation which have been shown to form a series of steps that fall in altitude from north–south. These steps are interpreted as representing former valley floors and thus\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–2882 2871\nform a flight of buried river terraces. In all, 11 terraces (I–XI, Figs. 6A and B after Maddy et al., 2005) have so far been identified. The palaeo-Gediz gravels are, in most cases, immediately overlain by limestone-rich gravels, which are believed to represent the deposits of tributary fluvial ‘fans’ (see below) fed by rivers with catchments in the limestone plateau to the north (Figs. 2 and 5C). It is probable that the drainage systems that deposited these fluvial fans were precursors of the current Hudut and Geren river systems (Fig. 3). Maddy et al. (2005) suggest that the fluvial incision necessary for the development of this terrace flight is a consequence of dynamic fluvial system response to regional uplift. Using the available geochronology of the lava flows that cap the sequence ( p1.264Ma, Westaway et al., 2004) and inference\nconcerning the onset of terrace development in response to accelerating uplift and the onset of volcanism downstream ( 1.67Ma, Richardson-Bunbury, 1996), they suggest that this terrace sequence spans the time interval 1.67–1.2Ma. Maddy et al. (2005) derive a simple linear age–height model based upon these constraints to suggest a link between terrace formation and climate change. Fig. 7 shows a plot of terrace base heights (using the linear age–height model derived from the independent age estimates) against the ODP967 d18O record from the Eastern Mediterranean Basin (Kroon et al., 1998). From this visual comparison Maddy et al. (2005) suggested that the timing of terrace formation was most likely to have been controlled by sediment/ discharge changes driven by regional climate change and thus the terraces represent sedimentation/incision cycles\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–28822872\noscillating at the 41ka obliquity-driven climate change cycle of the Early Pleistocene.\nIn a later paper Maddy et al. (in press) describe in more detail how the preservation of this terrace system is promoted by the successive burial of terraces by alluvial fan progradation. Fig. 8 shows the reconstructed landsurface prior to the onset of volcanism in this area based upon the contouring of the heights of the limestone-rich gravels contact with the overlying volcaniclastic sequence. This reconstruction is interpreted as coalescing fan systems forming an apron, or bajada, immediately south of the limestone plateau. A similar situation exists today immediately upstream of the study area where volcanism has played no direct role in landscape development. The reconstruction shows only two fans but it is acknowledged that this reconstruction is based upon the preserved sections around\nthe basalt plateaux and thus the information from the area between the plateaux is limited. It is therefore possible, even probable given the likely drainage density, that at least one additional system may have been present. Maddy et al. (in press) suggest that trunk river incision (and therefore terrace formation) and fan toe progradation are dynamically linked and tend to occur during periods of climatic amelioration, when sediment supplies are reduced due to bank and slope stabilisation by vegetation (Fig. 9A). In contrast, the palaeo-Gediz sediments, together with the bulk of the fan gravels, are considered most likely to\nARTICLE IN PRESS D. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–2882 2873\naccumulate (aggrade) during the intervening periods when sediment supply conditions are higher, a consequence of reduced vegetation cover resulting in unstable banks and slopes (Fig. 9B). These conditions were most prevalent during the colder episodes of the Early Pleistocene. The progradation of the tributary fans over the terraces protects the north bank terraces from later erosion and promotes the subsequent excavation of the more easily erodible substrate of the Ahmetler Formation to the south during the next phase of terrace formation. Thus, whatever the precise linkage between the trunk river system and its tributaries, it is clear that the progradation of fans over the terraces is a critical process in the initial preservation of this sequence.\nTypically the sediments within each terrace are 2–3m in thickness but reach 5m on terrace V. The lack of diagnostic sedimentary structures within these deposits makes the precise style of fluvial deposition difficult to determine. Fig. 10 represents an attempt to establish the possible terrace gradients. This figure plots the height of the terrace bases against an east–west axis using UTM Easting coordinates. The exact route of the palaeo-Gediz channel system is unknown and therefore the level of possible sinuosity is also indeterminate. This projection therefore represents only one possible model and the uncertainties, especially given the low number of observations at most levels and their clustered geographical distributions, are substantial. Perhaps the most appropriate level on which to assess this is terrace IV, where there are a comparatively large number of well-spaced observations. A simple linear regression through the points suggests a basal gradient of 0.97mkm 1. This is higher than the 0.49mkm 1 gradient for terrace I suggested by Maddy et al. (2005) but still represents a comparatively low-gradient system, at least compared to the gradient of the modern river which varies through the study reaches, due to a succession of knickpoints, between 5 and 10mkm 1.\nFurthermore no preserved terrace tract exceeds 500m in width. Although the progressive southward migration of the palaeo-Gediz would have led to limited preservation of each former floodplain, it is estimated that none of the former floodplains are likely to have greatly exceeded 1 km in width through these reaches. Although the evidence for channel dimensions is limited, an exposure of cemented channel gravel upturned by collapse at location 31 (Fig. 6A) suggests an individual channel width of o5m. Although this might not represent the main channel, or more than one channel may have been occupied at any one time, this evidence may suggest that the palaeochannel dimensions were relatively small compared to those of the modern river. The modern Gediz exceeds 10m in channel width throughout the study reach. The inference of a low-gradient, relatively small channel system, taken together with the comparatively small floodplain and thin depositional units (only terrace V could be interpreted as aggradational), may suggest a palaeo-Gediz system that was smaller than that of the present day. This interpretation is counter to the more extensive deposits of the northerly-derived fan systems that appear to represent more substantial catchments than their modern equivalents. These observations point to a drainage system that was still developing. It is probable that the palaeo-Gediz subsequently gained catchment area upstream, while the tributaries considered in our present field area were undergoing capture of their watershed areas by headward erosion of northwards draining rivers and thus reducing in overall catchment size. The parallel nature of the buried terraces does, however, suggest at least temporary quasi-equilibrium conditions during their formation and thus any major drainage adjustment to enlargement of the catchment must postdate this period."

    "heading": "4. Drainage system reorganisation: a response to the onset of volcanism",
    "text": "The onset of volcanism in the Kula region is thought to have begun some time after 2Ma (Richardson-Bunbury, 1996). Melt production is believed to be closely associated with the rifting and formation of the Alas-ehir graben (Ercan et al., 1983; Ercan, 1993). The lavas of the Kula volcanic province form alkali basalts with 79 necks identified by Erinc- (1970). Despite the high number of volcanic necks in the Kula area the volume of lava produced ( 2.3 km2) is comparatively small (RichardsonBunbury, 1996). The oldest age estimate currently available is 1.6770.22Ma, which was obtained from lava flows 20 km west of the current field area (Richardson-Bunbury, 1996, Fig. 2 location B). This estimate has recently been disputed by Westaway et al. (2004) who suggest that the material used in this estimation procedure was unsuitable for dating and therefore these results are unreliable. There have been a number of attempts to obtain age estimates from the lava flows within the field area (Borsi et al., 1972; Richardson-Bunbury, 1996; Westaway et al.,\nARTICLE IN PRESS D. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–28822874\n2004). It is unfortunate, however, that each attempt at obtaining age estimates using the K-Ar method has produced often significantly different results. In the following discussion we use the most recent, and therefore most technologically advanced, 1.2670.015Ma absolute age estimate taken from a lava flow emanating from the Toytepe neck (Westaway et al., 2004, sample 00YM23) as our tie-point for the stratigraphy. We then use the stratigraphic relationships between the Toytepe flows and the others to establish the relative sequence of eruptions. We acknowledge that the basalts observed represent deposition during multiple eruption events from each volcanic neck and therefore the simplified sequence used below may have to be modified as new results arise.\n4.1. Tavs-an and Toytepe eruptions (cones 58 and 73, Erinc- , 1970)\nThe Toytepe eruption (Fig. 11A) occurred through a volcanic neck situated above fan gravels that overlie the palaeo-Gediz gravels of terrace X at locations 45/46 (Fig. 6A). The first eruption products include palagonitic tuffs that indicate rapid cooling, suggesting possible contact with water. This observation led Richardson-Bunbury (1996) to conclude that this eruption took place close to the contemporary river valley floor, i.e. where the water table was high. However, the lavas from Toytepe can be traced in the field south-westwards where they overlie a thick sequence of tephras and lacustrine sediments which in turn overlie the palaeo-Gediz gravels of terrace III at location 9 (Fig. 11A).\nThe same lava overlying location 9 can be traced northeastwards where it infills a channel cut into the underlying Ahmetler Formation (Fig. 12A). The basalt basal contact is not seen but at its lowest observed point the basalt is at or below the base of exposures at location 4 (143.38m above datum), i.e. at a height equivalent to the terrace I valley level. There is no evidence to suggest that more than one lava flow is present at this location. Hence, we conclude that the contemporary river valley at the onset of volcanism in this area was no lower than the base of the terrace I level.\nThe palagonitic tuffs are considered here to result from eruption close to lake level. A pre-existing lake (L1 Fig. 11A) is indicated by exposures of laminated sediments beneath the volcaniclastic deposits. Up to 3m of laminated lacustrine sediments, which overlie palaeo-Gediz gravels of terrace III at location 9, underlie thick (up to 13m) tephra deposits and the capping basalt (Fig. 12B). Laminated lake sediments in excess of 3m in thickness, again beneath a thick tephra sequence, are also evident 100m west of location 26 suggesting the lake rises to heights in excess of 170m above the datum.\nThe origin of lake L1 must result from blockage of the palaeo-Gediz by eruption and the creation of a lava dam downstream of the Sarnıc- plateaux. The height of the lacustrine sediments indicates a downstream dam height in\nexcess of 30m above the terrace I level valley floor. The two volcanic necks on the Íbrahimağa plateau seem the only plausible source of basalts for this downstream dam (Fig. 3). The Íbrahimağa Bağtepe neck supplies lava flows which diverge around the Tavs-an neck confirming that the Tavs-an neck is older. The Tavs-an neck lies directly within the path of the palaeo-Gediz valley reconstructed using the terrace record. Despite extensive exploration no evidence for palaeo-Gediz terraces have been found beneath the Íbrahimağa plateau and therefore it is most likely that the Tavs-an neck erupted basalts which flowed into the palaeoGediz valley to the north. Fig. 13 shows a reconstruction of a schematic cross-section showing the probable relationships between the Tavs-an lava flow and the palaeo-Gediz valley. Fig. 13A shows the situation prior to eruption. The southern valley margin constructed here from the Íbrahimağa plateau shows a high-level surface cut into the Ulubey Formation limestones. This surface at ca 600m is similar to erosional benches still present on the northfacing limestone escarpment on the southern side of the Selendi river and most probably therefore is a product of differential erosion of strata within the Ulubey Formation. Remnants of this limestone surface crop out above the Íbrahimağa plateau lava flows in a number of locations and large limestone blocks can be observed close to the base of lava emanating from the Tavs-an neck. Fig. 13B shows how eruption of the Tavs-an neck would facilitate damming of the palaeo-Gediz system. Subsequent breaching of the lava dam is likely to have occurred at the lowest point adjacent to the readily erodible fan/terrace material on the northern side of the palaeo-valley. This breach is likely to have eroded all remaining remnants of the palaeoGediz terrace system north of the Íbrahimağa plateau. Indeed later incision by the palaeo-Gediz in this area has completely eroded the Tertiary basin fill, leading to exhumation of the basement surface (Fig. 3). As lake L1 did not drain prior to the onset of eruption of the Toytepe neck, it is probable that the Tavs-an eruption is not much older than 1.2Ma. It is not clear how and when lake L1 drained but there is no evidence at present to demonstrate that the Toytepe basalts were laid down in the lake. It is probable, however, that the Toytepe lava created a new lake upstream of the lava dam created by its flow into the terrace I valley floor. What is clear is that the Toytepe eruption would have necessitated a reorganisation of drainage within the former tributary fan. It is likely that this drainage would have taken the easiest route and flowed around the lavas. The suggested easterly flow around Toytepe in Fig. 11A perhaps forms part of the precursor drainage to that of the modern day Bozler river which flows between the Sarnıc- and Burgaz plateaux (Fig. 3).\n4.2. Sarnıc- bağTepe eruption (cone 74, Erinc- , 1970)\nThere are no reliable age estimates for the SarnıcBağtepe lavas. The exact areal extent of the Sarnıc- Bağtepe lavas are difficult to determine but they seem to be\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–2882 2875\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–28822876\nrestricted to a relatively narrow band around the neck (Fig. 11B). Although preservation state is an unreliable indicator of age it can be noted that the Toytepe neck is more degraded than the Sarnıc- Bağtepe neck which in turn is considerably more degraded than that of the Burgaz Bağtepe neck, perhaps suggesting progressively shorter exposure times to the forces of erosion. We thus suggest that the Sarnıc- Bağtepe eruptions are younger than those emanating from Toytepe.\nThe position of the Sarnıc- Bağtepe neck places the eruption close to the palaeo-Gediz valley axis, the result of which must have been to dam the palaeo-Gediz drainage and thus form an upstream lake (Fig. 11B). The existence of a lake (L2) is supported by the extensive outcrop of carbonate-rich lacustrine deposits at location 17 (Figs. 12C and D) above fan gravels and the palaeo-Gediz gravels of terrace V. Additional thin laminated sediments can be observed above either fan gravels or palaeo-Gediz gravels at locations 1, 2, 24 and 25. Redeposited (slumped) fan\nmaterial observed at location 12 may also indicate mass movement due to saturation of the fan toe as the lake height rose. Confirmation that the fan sediment supply continued, from the north of Burgaz, with deposition into the lake is indicated by the carbonate-rich nature of the laminated fines at location 17. The height of these lacustrine deposits, in excess of 170m above datum level, suggests that the lake required a minimum lava dam height in excess of 25m above the preeruption valley floor. This is similar in altitude to lake L1 and given the likelihood that the Toytepe eruption may also have created a dam, it is possible that the actual sequence involves the repeated damming of the river to approximately the same level (the consequences for the palaeo-Gediz will be discussed below). It is likely that any overspill, once the lake had filled to the height of the lava dam, would have routed towards the topographic low, i.e. to the south of the lava flows (Fig. 11B), excavating the more readily erodible Ahmetler Formation. It is likely that\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–2882 2877\nthe erosion of the Ahmetler Formation could have been achieved relatively quickly. An estimate of the erodibility of the Ahmetler Formation can be made with reference to the erosion phase that created the higher terraces. It is likely that the incision part of the terrace formation cycle lasted no more than a few thousand years during this period and thus if we assume an incision event lasting 2 ka and a minimum incision of 5m (i.e. between terrace III and II, Maddy et al., 2005) then this suggests a minimum incision rate of 2.5mka 1. At this rate a dam height of 25m could have been reduced, by diversion around the block, within 10 ka, although repeated lava flow into the valley may have re-established the dam level on more than one occasion.\nThe more gradual adjustment to the lava dam proposed here is in contrast to the catastrophic failure of lava dams reported elsewhere (Hamblin, 1990; Lucchitta et al., 2000). We have, as yet, been unable to identify basalt-cobble deposits that, according to Lucchitta et al. (2000, p32), would ‘‘signal the breaching of lava dams following eruptions’’.\n4.3. Burgaz Bağtepe eruption (cone 75, Erinc- , 1970)\nThe lava flows which emanate from the Burgaz Bağtepe neck cover a greater area than those from the SarnıcBağtepe neck (Fig. 11C). Extensive exposure displays a complex stratigraphy indicating the presence of multiple eruption events. The eruption of the Burgaz Bağtepe neck occurred during the life of lake(s) phase L2 (Fig. 11C).\nSoft-sediment disturbance of the lacustrine beds at location 17 by the overlying lava flow suggests that lake L2 had not drained prior to the eruption of the Burgaz Bağtepe neck (Fig. 12C). Where similar lava dams have been reported elsewhere (e.g. Hamblin, 1990) they have been shown to be relatively short-lived, i.e. of the order of a few thousand years. The relatively short-term constraint comes from either the time needed to erode the dam or its surrounding material, or indeed from the complete in-fill of the lake by sediment arriving from upstream. The relatively low sediment supply from the palaeo-Gediz indicated by the pre-eruption events suggests that dam-breach is more likely to have occured as a result of erosion around the block. At present there is no evidence to suggest fluvial incision between the lakes of phase L2. This, perhaps, indicates that the time between high lake level stands during the L2 lake phase was insufficient to allow fluvial system adjustment to the on-going regional uplift (see below). A further consequence of these eruptions, as already noted above, is the disturbance of the northerly-derived tributary drainage system. It is probable that the flow emanating from the upstream limestone catchment would have been dammed and then subsequently diverted around the edges of the Burgaz Bağtepe lava flows. Once eruptions ceased, diversion of the upstream drainage around the lava flows may have initiated the development of the modern Hudut system (to the east of the lava flow) and contributed to the initiation of the Bozler river system (to the west of the lava flow) which today drains the area between the Burgaz and Sarnıc- plateaux. It is likely also that the\nARTICLE IN PRESS D. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–28822878\neruptions of the Burgaz Bağtepe neck created a new lake further upstream in the Gediz.\nAn early phase of fluvial incision subsequent to these eruptions appears to have been preserved upstream within a palaeomeander section (M1, Fig. 14)."

    "text": "Buried gravels of typical palaeo-Gediz type composition, but containing significantly high basalt content (o10%), and up to 2m in thickness, outcrop along the eastern side of an incised gully in the Burgaz plateau (Fig. 14A, M1). A continuous outcrop, with accurate heights surveyed at four localities (1M1–4M1 Fig. 14A), indicates a consistent palaeo-Gediz gravels/Ahmetler Formation contact at 144m (range 143.50–145.39m) above the datum level. These gravels can be observed to cut across the buried terrace sequence and clearly postdate the buried terraces, their overlying fan sediment and the capping lava flows which emanate from the Burgaz Bağtepe neck. Despite the obvious younger age, the level of this gravel body is slightly above the pre-eruption terrace I valley floor which lies at 140m above the datum level.\nUnlike the buried terrace gravels these outcrops expose characteristic sedimentary structures. Lateral accretion structures at location 2M1 suggest deposition in a sinuous channel, an interpretation supported by the thick (up to 2m) preservation of fine-grained overbank sediments. Imbrication measurements on the gravels suggest flow\ntowards the north. The northward flowing river responsible for these gravel would quickly, within a few hundred metres, encounter the present gully headwall formed in the Ahmetler Formation and thus, although no return limb sediments are observed on the western side of the gully, it is reasonable to assume that this section represents a palaeomeander. There is an erosional bench at the same altitude cut into the headwall of the present gully (5M1, Fig. 14A) and this level is also represented on the western side of the current gully system by a flat erosional Ahmetler Formation contact with thick overlying slope sediment at location 6M1 (Fig. 14A). The interpretation of these outcrops as a palaeomeander is further supported by their creation of a meander core to the south, forming the outlier basalt outcrop of Kale Tepe (Figs. 2 and 14A). The fluvial sediments on the eastern limb, together with the erosional bench of the western limb, are overlain by a thick sequence (up to 10m) of basalt-rich slope sediment. The nature of this palaeochannel fill sediment denotes an unusual mode of infill but the time gap between meander cut-off and palaeochannel fill is unknown. The reason for meander cut-off is also elusive but a debris-flow deposit overlying the palaeo-Gediz sediments at 1M1 (Fig. 14B) may be a lahar, perhaps triggered by eruption of an upstream volcanic neck (e.g. the neck on Delihasan Tepe, Fig. 3). Alternatively this debris flow may have been triggered by more localised landslide activity. Whatever its origin, this material would have blocked this routeway, assuming the cut-off had not already occurred, forcing the palaeo-Gediz to the south of Kale Tepe. It is possible that the cut-off meander fill represents deposition in a lake formed behind a lava dam caused by flows emanating from the Íbrahimağa Bağtepe neck downstream."

    "heading": "5. An end to quasi-equilibrium?",
    "text": "It has been argued that the buried high-level terrace system of the palaeo-Gediz indicates a river system that attained periodic quasi-equilibrium longitudinal profiles adjusted to the long-term regional uplift. Although this condition may have been possible when the system was largely climate-controlled, could this state have been maintained after the system was so dramatically disturbed by volcanic events? Fig. 15 shows a schematic representation of the possible effects on the palaeo-Gediz longitudinal profile in response to repeated lava damming events. Effective lava dams create upstream lakes (Hamblin, 1990), disrupting sediment transport and thus requiring subsequent channel adjustment. The effect of natural dams can be estimated with reference to modern observations associated with artificial dam creation. In Fig. 15A we assume that the initial terrace I profile is a graded profile (in quasiequilibrium) adjusted to regional uplift. In Fig. 15B damming downstream creates a lake, thus raising the local base-level upstream. On the upstream end of the lake, sediment flux builds a small delta composed of the more\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nD. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–2882 2879\ncoarser sediment grades. Immediately upstream of the delta adjustments include localised aggradation and backfill leading to reduced gradients, although such changes do not progress far upstream. Often the reduced gradient in these areas may result in a change in fluvial planform and the development of a highly sinuous channel system. This is typical behaviour upstream of artificially created dam structures (Leopold and Bull, 1979). Downstream of the dam, once overspill begins, erosive power is increased due to reduced sediment load (clear water erosion) and incision is possible albeit that flood peaks may be reduced (Petts, 1979). Furthermore, migration of nickpoints from downstream stall in this area, amplifying the channel profile adjustments here with respect to those upstream of the dam. Once the lake drains (Fig. 15C) the former position of the dam occupies a nickpoint that will migrate upstream into the former lake floor area. Furthermore, degradation of the upstream delta area will begin. In Fig. 15D we assume that the next lava dam occurs upstream of that in 15B and that the adjustment of profile to the earlier lake drainage is incomplete. This time the upstream end of the lake is outside the area shown and incision is once again triggered but in the restricted area downstream of the dam.\nThe end result of this sequence is a longitudinal river profile that is still adjusting to the multiple damming events. The frequency of these events does not allow complete fluvial system adjustment, i.e. the time between events is less than the system relaxation time (Brunsdon and Thornes, 1979) and thus a quasi-equilibrium profile cannot be achieved (Fig. 15D). This situation is amplified by the probable complex response (Schumm, 1979) generated by such events. This scenario leads to complex stratigraphical relationships. Even in the simple case considered fluvial gravels of similar age could occur at a variety of different altitudes above the river. In the case of the palaeo-Gediz, the river was dammed on numerous occasions during the period under study. Although the readily erodible nature of the Ahmetler Formation may eventually allow grade to be re-attained once disruption ceases, the intervening stratigraphical sequence will be difficult to unravel without accurate age control. This situation requires particularly careful attention to be paid when attempting correlation; it is not tenable to continue with the simple altitudinal correlations that were possible on the earlier graded terrace system. Other means of correlation will be needed to establish reliable attribution. Furthermore, the complex profile\nARTICLE IN PRESS D. Maddy et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 26 (2007) 2864–28822880\nadjustments in the study reaches will have knock-on effects upstream that will result in profile adjustments that lag those in the study reach. This could be particularly problematic upstream in the palaeo-Gediz where the river flows across more resistant basement rocks. Adjustments in those reaches may considerably lag those of the study reaches. Thus a simple altitudinal correlation of fluvial deposits in far upstream reaches, based upon height above the present river, is unrealistic.\nThis observation has significance for using this sequence to establish regional uplift rates (e.g. Bunbury et al., 2001). Assuming that the river re-attains grade after the first phase of volcanism begins, it may be possible to use the pre-disruption and post-disruption levels to calculate the time-averaged incision rate and thus infer the timeaveraged uplift rate for this period. However, as the intervening levels represent dis-equilibrium conditions they cannot be used for this purpose as the incision rates do not equate with the uplift rate. As in Fig. 15D, during this period it is likely that in most reaches in the study area the incision rates will be lower than the background uplift rate. Furthermore, the lack of reliable information between graded levels may constitute a considerable time interval which could mask major changes in uplift rates and thus lead to an unreliable uplift history reconstruction. This will be particularly significant if the intention is to reconstruct localised block movements, especially where the blocks vary in erodibility and thus their ability to re-attain grade quickly. We hope to gain further understanding by attempting to model the nature of fluvial profile evolution; such an approach has yielded considerable insight in similar situations (e.g. in Germany, Veldkamp et al., 2002)."

    "heading": "6. Conclusion",
    "text": "The Plio–Pleistocene evolution of the modern Gediz river system results from the interplay of on-going tectonic controls on fluvial system behaviour together with major sediment/water supply changes resulting from river capture and climate changes. During different phases of this evolutionary sequence these controls have worked collectively, as well as independently, to shape river network development. Despite the substantial tectonic influences, the Early Pleistocene record preserves a signature of changes resulting from high-frequency climate change. Indeed the Pleistocene sequence exposed in the area north of Kula is remarkable. The fortuitous preservation of the buried Early Pleistocene terraces contains an archive of fluvial system response to sediment/water supply changes, themselves a consequence of the obliquity-driven climate changes of that period. This sequence suggests a dynamic link between fluvial system behaviour and climate change in the Early Pleistocene. This type of record has not yet been widely recorded elsewhere, perhaps as a consequence of the specific requirement for appropriate uplift conditions, high enough to allow discrete levels to form in each cycle, but low enough to allow terrace formation and\nprevent subsequent destruction of terrace fragments. In this case, initial burial by fan progradation also plays a significant role in the preservation. The destruction of this dynamic link was inevitable once volcanism began. The repeated damming of the trunk river and its tributaries led to complex stratigraphic relationships. The sequencing of eruptions disrupted the timing of the incisional adjustment to the on-going regional uplift. Although some incision appears to be evident during quiescent phases between volcanic events there is no reason to assume that the timing of these events is governed by regional climate change. For most of the time during this first phase of volcanism the river was being repeatedly dammed and its longitudinal profile adjustments would thus reflect these local base-level changes. The responses to these events upstream and downstream of the study reach are, as yet, unknown. Our study of the Gediz sequence continues. Extensive Middle and Late Pleistocene fluvial, lacustrine and volcanic sequences have already been recognised. Despite the chronology problems, the key to maximising the understanding of this system is a comprehensive age estimation programme. We are currently engaged in an extensive programme of surface exposure dating, together with further K–Ar/Ar–Ar age estimates on lavas. To this we will add luminescence and aminoacid racemisation studies for the youngest components of the record. Furthermore, we have just embarked on a new research project (sponsored by the British Institute at Ankara, BIAA) which will exploit the Early Pleistocene record for its palaeoenvironmental proxies. It is hoped that this work may allow wider biostratigraphical correlation as well as provide valuable insights into the nature of Early Pleistocene climate changes in this region. The substantial results already obtained from this area underline the potential of the Eastern Mediterranean fluvial archive. IGCP449 has played a major part in the initial attempts to unravel this record, thus demonstrating the pivotal role that IGCP can play in furthering our knowledge of fluvial system behaviour."

  "abstractText": "In this paper, we report our latest observations concerning a Pliocene and Early Pleistocene record from Western Turkey. The sedimentary sequence described comprises the fluvial deposits of an Early Pleistocene palaeo-Gediz river system and its tributaries prior to the onset of volcanism around Kula and the subsequent lacustrine, volcaniclastic and fluvial deposits associated with the first phase of volcanism ( 1.2Ma) in this area. Early development of an east–west drainage system in this area resulted from tectonic adjustments to north–south extension and the formation of east–west-oriented grabens. Headward erosion of drainage entering the main Alas-ehir graben led to the progressive capture of pre-existing drainage systems as eastward (headward) erosion upstream tapped drainage networks previously formed in internally draining NNE–SSW-oriented basins. Within one of these, the Selendi Basin, part of this evolutionary sequence is preserved as a buried river terrace sequence. Eleven terraces are preserved beneath alluvial fan sediments that are, in turn, capped by basaltic lava flows. Using the available geochronology these terraces are considered to represent sedimentation–incision cycles which span the period 1.67–1.2Ma. Although progressive valley incision is a fluvial system response to regional uplift, the frequency of terrace formation within this time period suggests that the terrace formation resulted from sediment/water supply changes, a consequence of obliquitydriven climate changes. The production of sub-parallel terraces suggests that during this period the river was able to attain a quasiequilibrium longitudinal profile adjusted to the regional uplift rate. Thus, the incision rate of 0.16mma 1 during this period is believed to closely mirror the regional uplift rate. After the onset of volcanism at 1.2Ma, there is a destruction of the dynamic link between fluvial system behaviour and climate change. The repeated damming of the trunk river and its tributaries led to the construction of complex stratigraphic relationships. During the first phase of volcanism the palaeo-Gediz river was dammed on numerous occasions leading to the formation of a series of lakes upstream of the dams in the palaeo-Gediz valley. Variations in lake level forced localised base-level changes that resulted in complex fluvial system response and considerable periods of disequilibrium in profile adjustment. Furthermore, response to these baselevel changes most likely disrupted the timing of the incisional adjustment to the on-going regional uplift, thus making the use of this part of the archive for inferring regional uplift rates untenable. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
