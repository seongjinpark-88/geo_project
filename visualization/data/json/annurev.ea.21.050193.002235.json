    "text": "Volcanoes are powerful agents of change. Sometimes the changes are broadly destructive, as in the 199 1 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in the Philippines. Sometimes they cost tens of thousands of lives, as in the tragic 1985 eruption of Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz. And sometimes they are even beneficial, as in the replenishment of nutrients by ashfall on Java's fertile fields, or the inventive use of geothermal energy by most oflceland's population. The 1980 eruption of Mount St . Helens, in the northwestern United States, heightened volcano consciousness in much of the western world, and the decade since has seen dramatic increases not only in vol canological research but also in interdisciplinary studies. Extraterrestrial volcanism has received much attention, and on this planet several narrowly averted catastrophes have energized the air transport industry to find ways of keeping modern jumbo jets away from volcanic ash clouds.\nThe main interdisciplinary interest, however, has focused on the global climatic impact of major eruptions. Aerosols formed from volcanic gases are distributed throughout the lower stratosphere after major eruptions, and act as a filter, or \"sunscreen,\" to reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. This natural agent of global change has been called upon to explain phenomena ranging from June snowfalls in New England to mass extinctions in the geologic record.\nMost studies of volcanism-from hazard reduction efforts to global\nI The US government has the right to retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license in and to any copyright covering this paper.\n427\nA nn\nu.

This paper attempts to review what we have learned, with primary emphasis on the historical record. This record is short, by geological standards, but is a rich and important source of information on the low-to-middle range of volcanism's full spectrum. It provides our best basis for extrapolating the observations and measure ments of contemporary eruptions to better understand those of both the past and the future.\nThis review draws on two Smithsonian resources: (a) our reporting of current volcanic activity around the world, and (b) our computerized, retrospective database of historic and other dated volcanism over the past 1 0,000 years (Holocene time). The first began in 1 968 as the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, but was moved, reorganized, and renamed as the Scientific Event Alert Network (SEAN) in 1975. Further concentration on volcanology led to its being renamed the Global Volcanism Network (GVN) in 1990, and it continues today with a monthly GVN Bulletin and other outlets. The database began in 197 1, was published 1 0 years later as Volcanoes of the World (Simkin et al 1 98 1 ), and a second edition will soon be in press."

    "text": "Volcanoes are not all symmetrical, snow-capped cones. They range from huge piles of lava, rising up to 10 km above the ocean floor, through small cinder cones, to tranquil lakes on flat (or even inward-dipping) landscapes. They reflect the varied processes that shaped them, and with a wide range of plumbing systems, supply rates, and magma types it is not surprising that a wide range of features results. Furthermore, volcanic processes include many that destroy and modify earlier constructions, adding to the variety of forms that fall under the name \"volcano.\"\nSubsurface magma, normally less dense than surrounding rock, rises buoyantly toward the surface and understandably exploits local fracture systems in its path upward. Where long, linear fractures are present, a \"curtain of fire\" fissure eruption may result. Alternatively, magma may follow the line of weakness formed where two vertical fracture planes intersect, resulting in a pipe-like vertical conduit feeding a symmetrical cone. Many gradations and complexities exist, even changing in the course of a single eruption. The supply of magma to the surface is commonly irregular, even sporadic, and if the supply ceases for too long the next batch will be forced to find another route to the surface because the old conduit will have cooled and hardened. Thus fields of numerous small A nn u. R\nev .

As magma nears the surface, the attendant decrease in pressure permits exsolution of dissolved gases which then drive the eruption vertically (the only direction in which it is free to expand). Both gas content and viscosity vary widely in magmas, and the more gas-rich, viscous, and lower temperature compositions com mon to continental margin magmas tend to explode violently, fragmenting the liquid into countless small particles which cool swiftly as volcanic glass. This process forms small cones of ash, layer upon layer, or (depending on the violence and longevity of the explosions) thin, widely dispersed ash layers. In contrast, gas separates more easily from the less viscous, hotter, and less gas-rich magmas of the oceanic islands, and lava flows smoothly from vents to form gentle slopes as on Hawaii. All gradations of products exist-from gentle flows, through spatter vents, to scoria, cinder, and ash-with resulting volcanic shapes depending on the gas content and its manner of departing the magma. Often the most violent explosive erup tions are followed by slow, \"toothpaste tube\"-like extrusions of viscous, degassed magma to form steep-sided domes in the summit vent.\nThe wide variety of initial constructional shapes is further expanded by additional processes during a volcano's lifetime. For example, lateral shift in the plumbing system of a simple strata-volcano turns it into an asym metric compound volcano. Destructional processes such as major slope failure (as at Mt. St. Helens in 1980) or caldera collapse (as at Crater Lake, 6,800 years ago) may dramatically change a volcano's shape, and erosion is a relentless modifier in most parts of the world. Such varied processes lead inevitably to the enormous diversity of volcanic forms on the planet (Williams & McBirney 1 979, Wilson et aI 1 987)."

Some are scattered, but most are concentrated in linear belts. These belts number about 20 and have accounted for >94% of known historic eruptions. The belts total 32,000 km in length and (assuming a generous 100 km belt width) cover less than 0.6% of the Earth's surface.

The left half of the inset in F igure 1 shows the small proportion of the world's historically documented eruptions that have taken place in the ocean r ift environment (and in the intraplate environment). It is possible, however, to use relative plate motions to calculate the budget of new lava reaching the Earth's surface each year. This approach was pioneered by the late Kazuaki Nakamura ( 1974) and has been carried on by Joy Crisp ( 1 984) whose data are shown in the right half of the inset in F igure 1 . Clearly mid-oceanic ridge volcanism dominates the planet and, although most of it poses no threat to humans, this dominance must be remembered for global perspective."

    "heading": "Number of Volcanoes",
    "text": "How many activc volcanoes are there in the world? This common question can only be answered by knowing which are considered \"active.\" At least 15 volcanoes are almost certainly erupting as this is being written (on going eruptions can last tens to thousands of years, e.g. Stromboli); 62 erupted in 199 1 , 165 in the decade 1 980- 1 989, 538 have had historically doc umented eruptions; over 1 300 have erupted in the past 10,000 years , and some estimates of seafloor volcanoes exceed a million. Take your pick! But remember that the dormant intervals between major eruptions at a single volcano may be thousands of years long and the historic record very short.\nAlthough the recency of activity required to define \"active\" is important in answering the number question, so is the definition of \"volcano.\" The broad definition used in our compilations allows the record of a single large plumbing system to be viewed as a whole, but requires careful work in field and lab to establish the integrity of the group's common magmatic link. The problem is particularly difficult in Iceland, where eruptions separated by many tens of kilometers along a single rift may share the same magmatic system. Perhaps the most honest answer to the number question is that we do not really know, but that there are at least a thousand identified magma systems-on land alone-likely to erupt in the future."

Because of their explosive nature, these erup tions are also most likely to affect our climate.\nAs an oceanic plate descends into the hotter, higher pressure interior , it is dehydrated and fluids from it rise into the overlying mantle wedge. In this complex region of shear and melting, new magma is born and rises in buoyant diapirs, but this rise is not steady. There may be many stops along the way, with early-crystallizing minerals separating from the magma, and melting of surrounding rocks further changing its composition by contamination. This slow, complex, and varied route to the surface results, not surprisingly, in the eruption of complexly varied materials at different times and places. These products are reviewed in Gill ( 1 981) and Grove & Kinzler ( 1 986); aspects of the process are discussed b y Tatsumi & others (1983, 199 1 ), Plank & Langmuir (1988), Hildreth & Moorbath ( 1 988), and Morris ( 1 99 1 ).\nIn addition to compositional diversity and varied supply rates, a wide variation in the physical nature of subduction further contributes to the broad range of subduction-zone volcanism observed. Segmentation of volcanic chains into discrete linear belts 100-300 km long, commonly offset by zones of more intense seismicity, has been recognized in Central America (Stoiber & Carr 1 973, Carr 1984), the Cascades (Hughes et al 1980, Guffanti & Weaver 1988), the Aleutians (Kay et al 1982), and the Andes (Hall & Wood 1 985). The geometry of subduction greatly influences the resulting volcanism. In the Andes, for example, volcanism is weak or absent above downgoing slabs that are inclined at only a gentle angle to the horizontal (Barazangi & Isacks 1 976, Sacks 1984). Simkin & Siebert ( 1 984) attempted to quantify the volcanic vigor of arc segments around the world, in a contribution to what Uyeda ( 1 98 1 ) has called \"comparative subductology.\" We found that relatively weak volcanism also correlated with thin overriding plates, with young downgoing slabs, with decreased angle between the direction of the downgoing slab and the bearing of the arc itself, and with low aseismic slip rates (where great earthquakes indicate strong coupling between converging plates).\nMID-OCEANIC RIDGES The eruptions that we normally do not see are those along the 70,000-km oceanic rift system. Here magma is relatively homogeneous basalt, originating in the uppermost mantle (Yoder 1 976, 1 979) and arriving at the surface in relatively primitive condition. I ts extrusion is generally under 1-4 km of water, both shielding it from view and inhibiting volatile release. The result is gentle, effusive eruptions.\nThe Neo-Volcanic Zone is narrow (often only 1-2 km wide) and vol canoes range, with decreasing spreading rate, from flat fissure eruptions,\nA nn\nu.

Symmetrical central volcanoes are also found outside the rift itself, particularly near large offsets in the ridge system and near topographic highs of the faster spreading ridges; they outnumber subduction-zone and hotspot volcanoes by several orders of magnitude (Batiza 1989, Smith 1991). Hints of the behavior of ocean-rift volcanoes can be found in Iceland, one of the few places where the world's rift system emerges above sea level (Steinthorsson 1989). Here the historic record suggests that, although crustal spreading is probably steady, the rift zone's response to it is episodic: rift eruptions (and intrusions) over several years cause a few meters of separation at intervals of perhaps a hundred years, rather than a regular few centimeters of separation every year.\nHOTSPOTS AND FLOOD BASALTS Hotspot volcanoes are believed to be formed by long-lived plumes, anchored deep in the mantle and feeding magma to the surface through the overlying plate. Hawaii is the best known example of hotspot volcanism, and the variable volumes of the progressively older volcanoes to the northwest testify to the cor respondingly variable magma supply as they have been carried in that direction by the Pacific plate during the last 70 million years. Steady feeding of relatively consistent basaltic magma to irregular, shallow cham bers yields a delicately balanced system ready to erupt over long time periods and therefore vulnerable to triggering influences such as earth quakes and fortnightly tides . Careful study of historical eruptions on Hawaii shows them to be largely random phenomena, although large volume eruptions tend to be followed by longer reposes (Klein 1982). Distinctive stages in the long-term development of Hawaiian volcanoes have been recognized, the last of which takes place several million years after the volcano has been separated by plate motion from the feeding plume (Wright 1989).\nStages in the development of the plume itself are believed by many to begin with the first batch of magma rising buoyantly through the mantle to reach the surface as a giant outpouring of flood basalts (Sleep 1992). Flood basalt provinces, such as India's Deccan platea u (60-65 Ma) and the Columbia plateau in the northwestern U.S. (around 15 Ma), have produced hundreds of thousands of km3 of lava and individual flows that covered thousands of km2 in just a few days. Such catastrophic episodes arc fortunately rare in the planet's history.\nINTRACONTINENTAL This setting has much in common with the two described above in that some intracontinental volcanoes result from rifting and others from hotspots.

Because of the complexities of the thick, siliceous continental crust that is inevitably involved in these eruptions, they are the most violent and least well understood forms of volcanism on the planet. Smith & Luedke ( 1984) discuss nonsubduction volcanism in the western U. S., emphasizing the relatively long life of these centers (perhaps 5 million years, or ten times the active life of many subduction-zone volcanoes). Pulses of plate motion are thought to trigger magma formation and rise into the complex, extensional environment of the western U.S., and 60 loci are identified as potential eruption sites in the future. Another regional review of intraplate volcanism covers eastern Australia and New Zealand (Johnson 1 989a, 1 989b), where the overall eruption rate has been slow but apparently continuous throughout the past 95 million years."

    "text": "Looking at the distribution of volcanism through time again raises ques tions of definition: Is an individual explosion an \"eruption\"? or should the word be used (as we tend to use it) for clearly linked events that may be separated by hours, days, or even months of surface quiet? Arrival of volcanic products at the Earth's surface is normally termed an eruption, but the historical record is often unclear. Steam venting is commonly only a byproduct of subsurface heat, and is rarely dignified by the word \"eruption,\" but steam may be all that was seen by a sea captain reporting an \"erupting\" volcano 200 years ago. Volcanic heat is also the prime source of \"phreatic,\" or \"steam-blast,\" explosions in which heat and water combine to fragment preexisting volcanic materials and hurl the resulting ash into the sky. These events can be quite violent, however, and are rightfully called eruptions, even without the direct involvement of new magma (since few volcanologists are willing to tell a citizen that it is not really an eruption because the ash raining down on him contains no fresh volcanic glass).\nGas is an unequivocal volcanic product, but the gentle, continuous emission of fumarolic gases-common to most volcanoes-is not con sidered an \"eruption.\" Occasionally, though, large quantities of gas are suddenly vented-as in the fatal eruption of the Dieng volcano complex on Java in 1 979. In 1 984 and 1 986, the African nation of Cameroon suffered catastrophic expulsions of CO2 resulting in many fatalities by suffocation. The origin of these events is controversial , but the evidence suggests that they resulted not from an eruption, but from the sudden overturn of crater lake water, with catastrophic exsolution of volcanic gas\nA nn\nu.

The physical processes involved have been reviewed in this series by Wilson et al (1987) and individual eruption types are described in more detail in texts such as Williams & McBirney (1979), Fisher & Schmincke (1984, for explosive eruptions), and Macdonald (1972, for effusive eruptions). Walker (1980) has discussed the various measures of \"bigness\" of eruptions; volume of products is the most widely used by volcanologists. Eruptions of equal volume, however, may release quite different amounts of gas, with com parably different effects on climate. The larger eruptions inevitably receive the greatest share of scientific (and media) attention, but the steady pulse of smaller events, such as those that make up most of the 1O-year global record of McClelland et al (1989), add up to significant contributions. In assessments of annual volcanic S02 production, for example, the steady, unspectacular contributions of the world's fumaroles and small, ongoing eruptions are found to outweigh those of the less frequent larger eruptions (Stoiber et al 1987). In any case, the range of eruption types is large, and there are many that, in Scrope's words of 130 years ago (Scrope 1862, p. 14), \"exhibit an infinite variety of phases intermediate between the extremes of vivacity and sluggishness.\""

The frequency of these events has remained impressively constant for more than a century, and contrasts strongly with the apparent increase of smaller eruptions with time."

    "text": "The bulk of the record described above has come from contemporary monitoring, the sifting of historical records, and the terribly important but unglamorous (and increasingly unfunded) combination of careful field work and radiocarbon or other Quaternary dating methods. In recent decades, however, a number of promising new techniques have appeared.\nStudy of deep ice cores has shown that some annual layers contain easily measured acidity concentrations (H2S04 and HCl), and sometimes even particulate matter from major volcanic eruptions. Records of volcanism have been established in cores from Greenland (Hammer et a1 1980, Ham mer 1 984, Lyons et aI 1 990), Antarctica (Legrande & Delmas 1 987, Palais et al 1990, Delmas et al 1992), and both (Langway et al 1988). Relatively small eruptions from high latitudes leave strong records in nearby polar ice cores, but 95% of the world's known Holocene volcanoes lie more than 30° from the poles, and ice cores clearly show vcry large events from low latitudes. An example of the technique'S value is a major eruption in 1259 AD: it has not been found in the historical record, but its effects are clearly shown in ice cores from both polar regions.\nTree-ring dating has also been effectively used to refine dates for major eruptions (e.g. LaMarche & Hirschboeck 1 984, Baillie 1991), although only climatic impact is dated and other evidence must be found to tie such an impact to volcanism. Tree-ring study close to a specific volcano, however, can yield valuable information on its history (e.g. Yamaguchi 1 985).\nStatistical techniques, despite problems of incompleteness in the volcanic record, have been increasingly used in attempts to learn from that record. Wickman ( 1966, 1976) applied stochastic principles to the histories of 29 volcanoes, and found 5 that showed simple Poisson distributions but more that did not. This approach has been extended by De la Cruz-Reyna (1991). The most careful recent work has been by Stothers, who used time series analysis on the Smithsonian data set to show that no month-to month seasonal variation could be found on a global basis (Stothers 1989a), but that two weak periodicities, at around 11 and 80 years, are probably statistically significant (Stothers 1989b).

Using the same data set, Zemtsov & Tron ( 1 985) found a 22-year cycle significant, while Guttorp & Thompson ( 1 99 1 ) found only a 40-year cycle in the record of Icelandic volcanoes. Gudmundsson & Saemundsson ( 1 980), however, found no statistically significant temporal patterns in the history of Icelandic eruptions. Fractal analysis has recently been applied to the record of four basaltic volcanoes (Dubois & Cheminee 1991) and pattern recognition to one (Mulargia et al 1991). Statistical analysis is being applied to the much longer geologic record of the proposed nuclear waste repository in Nevada (Ho et aI 1 99 1 ).\nSatellite technology has aided subaerial volcanology in recent decades, with images which allow mapping of remote, difficult areas such as the central Andes (de Silva & Francis 1 99 1 ). The satellites also monitor vol canic activity in real time. For more than a decade, weather satellites have routinely provided valuable information on the timing, size, and direction of volcanic plumes (Matson 1 984, Holasek & Rose 1 99 1 , Casadevall 1 993), but perhaps the most exciting application has been Arlin Kreuger's use of the TOMS instrument (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) on the polar orbiting Nimbus 7 satellite to provide quantitative mapping of S02 dis persal from erupting volcanoes. This instrument, launched in 1 978, has provided valuable data on major eruptions over an important vol canological period, showing that El Chich6n in 1 982, although producing magma volumes quite similar to Mount St. Helens in 1 980, vented dra matically more S02 to the stratosphere and had a comparably larger impact on global climate. TOMS measurements of Pinatubo in 1 99 1 show 3 times as much S02 production as EI Chich6n, and emphasize its import ance as a natural experiment in the climatic effect of volcanism (Bluth et al 1992). Tracking of the Pinatubo aerosol by satellite and other instruments (McCormick 1 992) clearly demonstrates the value of modern technology in understanding the volcano-climate relationship.\nAdditional monitoring, prompted apparently by national defense pur poses, has also been very beneficial to volcanology. An airborne strato spheric sampling program in 1 98 1- 1 99 1 gathered valuable sulfate measure ments of eruptions (Sedlacek et al 1 983), a heat-sensing satellite allowed precise minute-by-minute timing of the development of Mount St. Helens' eruptive cloud in 1 980 (Moore & Rice 1 984), and submarine acoustic networks have provided some of the only historical data available on the deep-ocean volcanism that dominates Earth's magma budget (Norris & Johnson 1 969, Talandier 1 989). These examples have been uncommon openings for scientists into largely classified defense monitoring. However, previously classified listening arrays, such as SOSUS, are now being used to locate submarine volcanism, and aircraft-deployed sonobuoys have also been pressed into service (Vogt et al 1 990).

    "text": "In the global historical record, the most active year known was 1 974, when 5 of 7 western Papua New Guinean volcanoes erupted (Cooke et aI1976). Similar temporal concentrations of volcanism around a single plate margin are known from 1 902 (Caribbean plate, noted above) and 1 835 [when Darwin (1840) observed an unusual number of Andean volcanoes active around the time of the famous Concepcion earthquake] . These may well result from irregularities in local plate motion, but we see no global periodicity or episodicity that rises above the socio-economic effects on reporting discussed above. As in 1 835, regional tectonic earthquakes, and perhaps aseismic plate lurches, appear to have triggered synchronous eruptions . A necessary precondition for tectonic triggering of eruptions is the length of time involved in the cooling and crystallization of large magma chambers. During this time, volatile concentration increases inexorably, and it is reasonable to expect that many of the world's thousand or more chambers are poised and ready to erupt at any given time. As \"the straw that broke the camel's back,\" even earth tides are enough to trigger eruptions.\nThe search for order in individual volcanic histories-with obvious significance to forecasting new eruptions-has been part of most field/ petrologic studies of active volcanoes . Many have revealed only daunting complexity, but others, particularly vigorous volcanoes with centuries long historical records, have shown clear cycles. Baratta (1897) and Alfano & Friedlaender (1929) recognized cycles in the long and richly detailed record of Vesuvius. At Mayon, Newhall (1979) observed that basaltic magma is apparently added periodically to shallow reservoirs where frac tional crystallization produces successively more andesitic lavas (and more volatile, explosive eruptions), over 75-100-year periods. At Colima, Luhr & Carmichael (1990) showed that large ashflow eruptions usher in a new cycle that begins with crater dome building for 50 or more years and continues with an equal period of intermittent eruptions of andesitic block lava before terminating in another Pelean-type eruption. Luhr & Carmichael point out, however, that many different styles and in tensities of eruption are involved, and stochastic modeling (assum ing independent, homogeneous phenomena) cannot be realistically applied to Colima.\nStudy of the more siliceous, longer lived, continental volcanoes has been more difficult .

Rates of magma supply and production, repose intervals, and individual eruption volumes are clearly related. \"Eruption occurs when the input rate of primitive magma, over and above rates of leakage of primitive and fractionated magma, is sufficient to generate a fractionated volume capable of sustaining ash-flow eruptions when, at the same time, conditions of extensional fracture are met\" (Shaw 1985, p. 11,277). These relationships are shown graphically in\nFigure 12 of Smith (1979). Mafic magma is supplied at a rate of about 106 m3/year, and a variety of magmas are produced from the tops of differentiating chambers at a rate of about 106 m3/year, resulting (if other influences are small or balance each other) in a volume of accumulated magma that is roughly proportional to the time interval since the last eruption.\nAlthough such relationships illuminate the periodicity of individual volcanic systems, they imply no synchroneity of eruptions from multiple volcanoes . They do, however, bring home the point that magma chambers spend substantial portions of their lives in near-eruptive states and are thus vulnerable to external triggering influences such as major earthquakes, landslides, or earth t ides . Dzurisin (1980) has shown a weak but significant correlation between fortnightly earth tides and the historic eruptions of Kilauea (but none with neighboring Mauna Loa), and earthquakes have triggered eruptions from Kilauea (1974) to Mount St. Helens (1980). Even the crustal flexure of rapid deglaciation has been invoked as an eruption trigger (Grove 1976, Wallmann et a1 1988, Bogaard & Schmincke 1990)."

An example is regional study of explosive vol canism over several million years (e.g . Machida 1990). Another is bathy metric study of the Hawaiian hotspot trace, shown by Shaw et al (1980) to have produced major edifices (most which are now seamounts) during episodic vigorous phases separated by less vigorous phases as the Pacific plate has moved relentlessly to the northwest. However, any such studies inevitably confront the twin problems of inadequate mapping in many parts of the world and increasing uncertainty as we go back in time .\nGilluly (1969, p. 2303) summarizes well the geologic problems of inter preting the older record: \"As with optical perspective, it is clear that a\nA nn\nu.

The Cascades are was established in its present location by 35 Ma and has \"remained a persistent magmatic feature for the rest of Cenozoic time\" (Armstrong & Ward 1991). In the past 10 Ma its magmatic front has migrated eastward in central Oregon and jumped westward in British Columbia. Additional aspects of episodic volcanism in this well-studied region are discussed in Armstrong & Ward (1991), in McBirney (1978), and in a volume edited by Lipman & Glanzer (1991).\nWhile the extended continental record of volcanism is complicated (and often lost) by erosion, orogeny, glaciation, and more, the deep-sea floor offers the hope of a relatively continuous record. Cores of deep sea sedi ments contain far-traveled tephra from numerous explosive eruptions, and their study (Kennett et aI1977; Kennett 1981, 1989) has provided evidence of episodicity in many regions. Past changes in wind patterns or plate motions cause complications, as do both diagenesis and bioturbation, but study of many Pacific cores indicates episodes of intense volcanism (e.g. past 2 Ma, 17-14 Ma) separated by long quiescent periods (e.g. Late Miocene). There is strong evidence for widespread synchronism of these episodes over large areas of the Pacific and similarities with both mean spreading rate and global climate change. Vogt (1979, 1986) believes that both hotspot and island arc volcanism exhibit some episodic behavior on scales of 1-10 Ma and that this behavior is to an extent globally synchron ous. He closes his 1986 paper, however, with the caution that \"If hotspots, plate speed, island arc volcanism, and mountain building all sing in the same global chorus, it will be difficult to isolate from the geologic record the environmental impact of volcanism alone.\" A nn u.

    "heading": "Magnitude and Frequency of Volcanism",
    "text": "How much do eruptions vary in size? Like earthquakes, the frequency of eruptions decreases with increasing size: There are a lot of small ones, fewer medium-sized ones, and not so many large ones. We have borrowed from the seismologists' magnitude-frequency plots, using as our best mea sure of magnitude the VEl (Volcanic Explosivity Index) of Newhall & Self ( 1982). This closely parallels the volume of erupted tephra, which increases by an order of magnitude with each VEl larger integer. In Figure 4, the number of eruptions at and above each VEl increment is shown for various time intervals in the recent past: 30, 200, 1 000, and 2 million years. We have used longer time intervals for data from successively larger VEl groups because the smaller events have been adequately reported only in recent decades whereas the larger events, being rarer, need a longer time interval for representative counts. This is a somewhat subjective process, but the intervals are chosen in the hope that they are long enough to be representative yet short enough to have reasonably accurate reporting. As discussed with Figure 3, larger eruptions are more likely to have been accurately reported over longer periods. on a global basis, than smaller eruptions.\nAnother way of interpreting this plot is that subaerial eruptions pro ducing at least 1 06 m3 of tephra (VEl 2) take place at an average rate of once every few weeks somewhere on Earth. Those producing � 1 07 m3, like the VEl 3 Ruiz event that generated such fatal mudflows in 1985, take place several times a year. Eruptions the size of St. Helens in 1980 ( 109 m3, or 1 km3 and VEl 5) occur perhaps once a decade, and those like Krakatau 1 883 (> 1 0 km3) on the order of once a century. Thc historic record, however, fails to prepare us for the much larger eruptions of the past. The Toba eruption, only 74,000 years ago in Indonesia, produced nearly 1 0,000 times more magma (2800 km3, Chesner & Rose 199 1 ) than the St. Helens eruption. Even larger eruptions are known from the older geologic record.\nSimple extrapolation of the Holocene record in Figure 4 is not warranted above VEl 7, however, and that value, we must remember, is based on a single data point. The shape of the magnitude-frequency relationship at this end is unclear, but Decker ( 1990) has attempted to improve it by plotting data from Newhall & Dzurisin's ( 1 988) compilation of caldera unrest during the last 2 million years. The data set is incomplete, as the authors themselves are quick to acknowledge, and Decker is forced to make some large assumptions, but his extension is probably closer to the truth than extrapolation of the historical data. Decker's calculations suggest 22 VEl 7 events every 1 0,000 years and 2 VEl 8 events (Yellow stone-sized) every 1 00,000 years. A nn u. R\nev .

Considerable interest attends these questions, though, not only because of the likelihood of their recurrence in the future but also because of their impact on prehistoric climate and biota (Rampino et a1 1 988, Simarski 1992). An eruption at Yellowstone the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff-about 2 million years ago produced 2500 km3 of magma that cooled as a single unit (Christiansen 1984). Volcanic ash from this eruption was distributed over at least a 1 6-state area (includ ing Los Angeles, Tucson, EI Paso, and Des Moines) with compacted thicknesses of 0.2 m at distances of 1500 km from the source (lzett & Wilcox 1982). Its impact must have been profound. A much more recent eruption from Yellowstone, 0.66 Ma, was nearly as large, and numerous Oligocene eruptions in the western U . S. were even larger (G. A.

Alteration and erosion of distant ash layers makes older records even more difficult to interpret, but individual eruption volumes of lO4 km> have not been recognized.\nIt may, however, be useful to look at the known effect of large historic eruptions in the context of Figure 4. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens (VEl 5, or l/decade) was a local catastrophe with devastation over hundreds of square kilometers. The 1883 eruption of Krakatau (VEl 6, or l/century) was a regional catastrophe, with 36,000 dead, some as far as India. Another order of magnitude larger, the 18 15 eruption of Tambora (VEl 7, or l/milennia) caused global cooling, with summer snowstorms and crop failures on the opposite side of the globe (Stommel & Stommel 1983). A New England farmer in 1816 would have been justified in calling it a global catastrophe. The effects of a VEl 8 event, such as Yellowstone (2 Ma), must have been global by any definition. These effects deserve more attention. Although unlikely as a cause for the planet's largest mass extinctions, explosive volcanism has surely caused smaller catastrophes and may have contributed-through the triggering effect of impact shock waves on poised magma chambers-to larger catastrophes. It is worth remembering how little was known of impacts 25 years ago, and reminding ourselves that there is much yet to learn about huge eruptions."

Human popu lations grow dramatically while volcanism shows no sign of slowing down, ensuring that volcanic hazard will be a continuing problem for the future.\nOne of the certain contrib utors to large volcanic death tolls is the fact that the repose interval between eruptions is very much longer than the historic records in many parts of the world. Figure 6 shows the relationship between eruption interval and the proportion of historic eruptions in each VEl class. Most eruptions of low explosivity follow repose intervals of only 1 to lO years, but with increasing time intervals the explosivity increases significantly.

They may be the most dangerous of all."

    "text": "This paper is an outgrowth of a symposium held at the 28th International Geological Congress in 1 989.\nLindsay McClelland and Lee Siebert have worked with me for nearly 20 years, and their able efforts in gathering contemporary and older eruption information (respectively) have been essential to the data and ideas pre sented here. Roland Pool translated jumbled numbers into crisp computer graphics, and Jim Luhr, Lee Siebert, Bob Smith, Chris Newhall, and Peter V ogt helped improve the text. All are warmly thanked (and absolved of any blame). Smithsonian funding of the Global Volcanism Program and NASA grant 1438-VCIP-1675 are also gratefully acknowledged.\nLiterature Cited\nAlfano, G.

  "abstractText": "Volcanoes are powerful agents of change. Sometimes the changes are broadly destructive, as in the 199 1 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, in the Philippines. Sometimes they cost tens of thousands of lives, as in the tragic 1985 eruption of Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz. And sometimes they are even beneficial, as in the replenishment of nutrients by ashfall on Java's fertile fields, or the inventive use of geothermal energy by most oflceland's population. The 1980 eruption of Mount St . Helens, in the northwestern United States, heightened volcano consciousness in much of the western world, and the decade since has seen dramatic increases not only in vol­ canological research but also in interdisciplinary studies. Extraterrestrial volcanism has received much attention, and on this planet several narrowly averted catastrophes have energized the air transport industry to find ways of keeping modern jumbo jets away from volcanic ash clouds. The main interdisciplinary interest, however, has focused on the global climatic impact of major eruptions. Aerosols formed from volcanic gases are distributed throughout the lower stratosphere after major eruptions, and act as a filter, or \"sunscreen,\" to reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. This natural agent of global change has been called upon to explain phenomena ranging from June snowfalls in New England to mass extinctions in the geologic record. Most studies of volcanism-from hazard reduction efforts to global",
