    "text": "128 samples from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1143 in the southern South China Sea were analyzed for grain size, clay minerals, biogenic opal content and quartz in order to reconstruct changes in East Asian monsoon climate since 8.5 Ma. An abrupt change of terrigenous mass accumulation rate (MAR), clay mineral assemblage, median grain size and biogenic opal MAR about 5.2 Ma suggests that between 8.5–5.2 Ma the source of terrigenous sediment was mainly in the region of surface uplift and basaltic volcanism in southern Vietnam. A simple model of East Asian summer monsoon evolution was based on the clay/feldspar ratio, kaolinite/chlorite ratio and biogenic opal MAR. The summer monsoon has two periods of maximum strength at 8.5–7.6 Ma and 7.1–6.2 Ma. Subsequently, there was a relatively stable period at 6.2–3.5 Ma, continued intensification about 3.5–2.5 Ma, and gradually weakening after 2.5 Ma. Since 1 Ma the monsoon has intensified, with remarkable high-frequency and amplitude variability. Simultaneous increase in sedimentation rates at ODP Sites 1143, 1146 and 1148, as well as in MAR of terrigenous materials, quartz, feldspar and clay minerals at ODP Site 1143 at 3.5–2.5 Ma, may be the erosional response to both global climatic deterioration and the strengthening of the East Asian summer monsoon after about 3–4 Ma. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The Asian monsoon system is a major component of both regional and global climate (Webster et al., 1998). Past fluctuations of the East Asian summer and winter monsoons over long time scales (>1 m.y.) have been studied using the loess– paleosol sequences in the Chinese loess plateau (Porter et al., 1992; Ding et al., 1994, 1999; Vandenberghe et al., 1997; Liu and Ding, 1998; An, 2000; An et al., 2001; Qiang et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2002; Sun and An, 2002). By comparison, similar studies of deep-sea sediments from the South China Sea, which is the main sediment sink for fluvial materials from East Asia and\n140 S. Wan et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\nan ideal location for recording the erosional response to both winter and summer monsoons were hampered by the lack of long sediment cores in the region until six sites were drilled in two areas of the South China Sea during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 184 (P.X. Wang et al., 2000).\nUntil now, most of the paleoclimatic studies which permit the reconstruction of long-term evolution of the East Asian paleo-monsoon from the sediment in the South China Sea are mainly based on record of radiolarians (Chen et al., 2003), planktonic and benthic foraminifera (Zheng et al., 2004; Hess and Kuhnt, 2005), stable isotope (Jia et al., 2003; Jian et al., 2003; Tian et al., 2004) and element geochemistry (Wehausen and Brumsack, 2002; Wehausen et al., 2003). However, evidence of the commonly accepted enhancement of the East Asian monsoon at the Late Miocene (∼8 Ma) and mid-Pliocene (∼3 Ma; An et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005) (Zheng et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005) from mineralogy and sedimentology of sediment in the South China Sea remains absent.\nODP Site 1143, the only site drilled in the southern South China Sea during Leg 184, is expected not only to record the summer and winter monsoon evolution but also to capture terrigenous flux from the Mekong River system, which drains a large area of southeastern Asia and portions of the Tibetan Plateau. Therefore, the pattern of Neogene terrigenous accumulation rates at this site should provide a new record of sediment erosion, weathering, and transport related to Himalayan–Tibetan uplift and this record may then be compared with relevant records from the Bengal Fan (ODP Leg 116; Burbank et al., 1993) and Arabian Sea (Leg 117; Clift and Gaedicke, 2002).\nIn this paper we use a series of independent proxies for paleoclimate from the terrigenous minerals and biogenic silicon sediments recovered from ODP Site 1143 in order to (1) reconstruct the development of the East Asian summer monsoon since 8.5 Ma by comparing marine and terrestrial records, (2) establish a longterm record of sediment accumulation rates and lithologic variability associated with the Mekong River system, and (3) to document the terrigenous sedimentary record of the erosional response to regional and global climate change at about 3.5 Ma.\nFig. 1.

    "text": "ODP Site 1143 is located in a water depth of 2772 m in the southern South China Sea (Fig. 1A,B). Three holes were cored to a meters composite depth (mcd) of 515 mcd (P.X. Wang et al., 2000). For this study, we only focus on the upper part of ODP Site 1143 and a total of 128 samples were sampled continuously over an interval from ODP Holes 1143A (0–410.71 mcd) and 1143C (394.87–414.15 mcd) without obvious slumps or turbidites. The lithology of the recovered section at ODP Site 1143 is quite homogeneous and dominated by hemipelagic fine-grained terrigenous materials and pelagic nannofossil carbonate ooze. Terrigenous materials primarily comprise quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals, accounting for up to 99% or more of the clastic fraction. Carbonate contents range from 15% to 55% throughout the drilled section (P.X. Wang et al., 2000). Other minor lithologies include low concentrations of sponge spicules and diatoms (average ∼2%), observed by microscope.\nThe chronological framework for the upper part (0– 190.77 mcd) of ODP Site 1143 uses the astronomically tuned age model of Tian et al. (2002) and the lower part (190.77–410.71 mcd) was established on the basis of newly revised biostratigraphy (Li et al., 2004, 2005). ODP Site 1143 is characterized by moderate accumulation rates (average ∼5.4 cm/kyr), but which become relatively high (average ∼6.4 cm/kyr) during Late Miocene. The overall sediment sequences span across approximately the last 8.5 Ma with a sample resolution of about 66 kyr."

Subsequently, the mass accumulation rate (MAR) was calculated and grain-size measurements were performed on the extracted terrigenous minerals.\nuth China Sea and the Tibetan Plateau region, QA-1 loess sequences at orthern Indian Ocean mentioned in this paper (A).

Wan et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\nWe have modified simple quartz isolation procedures (Kiely and Jackson, 1965; Syers et al., 1968; Dauphin, 1980; Xiao et al., 1995; Sun, 2001), by adding a pretreatment procedure based on an existing deep-sea eolian extraction procedure (Rea and Janecek, 1981) to our extraction steps (Appendix A). This was done in order to obtain terrigenous grain size and contents in bulk samples, as well as to determine the relative weight percents of quartz, feldspar and clay minerals in terrigenous materials. Opal was removed using the methods of Mortlock and Froelich (1989) and Muller and Schneider (1993). More detailed explanation of our experimental procedures can be found in Appendix A and in Wan et al. (2003).\nIn the chemical procedure, we avoided two samples, which contained volcanic debris and glass. Examination of the isolated quartz minerals by microscope and X-ray diffraction indicated that the purity of quartz is up to 98%, with very minor Fe and Mn oxides, feldspar, and heavy minerals. However, minor volumes of sponge spicules, which have suffered crystallization in samples older than 6 Ma, were not dissolved in the procedure. Fortunately this was not significant for our analysis because of the very low proportion of crystalline spicules in the total sediment. Replicate analyses showed the precision in quartz content is 2.37%. Grain-size measurements and scanning electron microscope observations suggest that most of the quartz dissolution in chemical reagents occurs in the less than 0.8 μm fraction (Wan et al., 2003).\nFollowing analysis the weight percent of total terrigenous materials, feldspar, quartz, and clay minerals in bulk samples were determined. The total MAR (g/cm2/kyr) was calculated according to the method of Rea and Janecek (1981) as follows:\nMAR ¼ LSR4DBD;\nwhere LSR=linear sedimentation rates (cm/kyr), and DBD=dry bulk density (g/cm3).\nThe latter is calculated by interposition of the DBD data at this site (P.X. Wang et al., 2000) and the data of LSR are obtained with the age model recently realized by Tian et al. (2002) and Li et al. (2004). Then the total MAR values were calculated, and in turn the MAR of terrigenous materials, quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals was determined by multiplying the total MAR by the weight percent value of the individual compounds.\nGrain-size distribution measurements on the extracted terrigenous materials were carried out on a CILAS 940L apparatus in the laboratory of the Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS),\nQingdao. CILAS Particle Size Analyzers account for grains in the 0.3 to 2000 μm range. The measurement repeatability of the instrument is 0.5%, and the reproducibility is better than 2%.\nBiogenic silica (BSi) was determined using the alkaline extraction method of Mortlock and Froelich (1989) (extraction of silica in 2 M Na2CO3 at 85 °C for 5 h), followed by measurement by molibdate-blue spectrometry. The values reported here as opal content are calculated as % opal=2.4×% Siopal (Mortlock and Froelich, 1989). Microscope examination confirmed that this procedure effectively extracted the biogenic silica. Duplicate analyses suggest that the precision of this extraction procedure is better than ±5%.\nClay mineral studies were carried out on a <2 μm fraction of the sediment, which was separated based on Stoke's settling velocity principle after removal of carbonate and organic matter by treatment with 10% hydrogen peroxide and 0.5 N HCl, respectively. The analysis was performed on oriented mounts with a D8 ADVANCE diffractometer using CuKa radiation (40 kV, 25 mA) in the laboratory of IOCAS. Each sample was measured three times: (1) under dry air conditions (scanning from 3 to 30° 2θ, step size of 0.02°); (2) after ethylene glycol solvation at 100 °C for 1 h. (3–30° 2θ, 0.02° steps); (3) after ethylene glycol solvation at 100 °C for 1 h. (24–26° 2θ, 0.01°) (Lamy et al., 1999; Thamban et al., 2002). The latter was run as a slow scan in order to distinguish the 3.54/3.58 Å kaolinite/chlorite double peak. X-ray diffraction identified smectite, illite, kaolinite, chlorite and complex mixed-layer clays. These mixed layers were mainly assigned to randomly mixed illite–smectite species and will be referred to as “smectite” hereafter. Relative percentages of the four main clay mineral groups were estimated by weighting integrated peak areas of characteristic basal reflections in the glycolated state with the empirical factors of Biscaye (1965). The empirical factors were as follows: smectite, intensity area of the 17 Å peak multiplied by 1; illite, intensity area of the characteristic peak at 10 Å multiplied by 4; kaolinite plus chlorite, intensity area of the overlapping peaks around 7 Å multiplied by 2."

The weight percent of terrigenous materials in bulk samples ranges from 30% to 82% and is approximately the reverse of the carbonate content (Fig. 3) (P.X. Wang et al., 2000). The long-term variations of weight percents of total terrigenous materials, quartz, feldspar and clay minerals in bulk samples since 8.5 Ma (Fig. 3) are basically similar and can be subdivided into three distinct periods: a period of decreasing contents between 8.5–6.86 Ma (6.86 Ma is marked by an abrupt change of carbonate content); a period of increasing terrigenous content between 6.86– 1.0 Ma; and finally decreasing contents since 1.0 Ma, despite continued increase in quartz."

    "heading": "4.1. Sediment sources",
    "text": "The modern southern South China Sea is a semienclosed basin bordered by the Indochina peninsula, Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo (Fig. 1B). The most important single sediment source for the southern South China Sea is the Mekong River and its drainage area is 810,000 km2, delivering 160 million tons of sediment per year (Milliman and Meade, 1983). The Mekong River rises at the foot of Tanggula Mountain in eastern Tibet and downstream flows through a large area of Indochina peninsula before draining into the\nsouthern margin of South China Sea (He et al., 2000) (Fig. 1A). In contrast to a significant eolian (loess) influence of sediments from ODP Site 1145 (Fig. 1B) from the northern margin of the South China Sea (Wehausen and Brumsack, 2002), sediments from ODP Site 1143 are characterized by relatively low TiO2/ Al2O3 ratios, relatively close to the average value for Mekong River suspended matter (Wehausen et al., 2003). Other river inputs to the southwest South China Sea include the Baram River from northwest Borneo and the Chao Phraya River from western Indochina, with a combined annual sediment discharge of 23×106 tons (Fig. 1B) (Milliman and Syvitski, 1992; Hiscott, 2001). The Chao Phraya is not likely a major contributor of sediment because the Gulf of Thailand acts as the principle depocenter of materials from this river, which in any case lies far from our study area. Terrigenous material may not be transported to ODP Site 1143 by current from Borneo because the NE–SW extending Borneo Trough, with a water depth >2750 m and width of 50 km, acts as an effective sediment barrier (Hiscott, 2001). The Paleo-Sunda River or Molengraaff River may have been another possible sediment source (Fig. 1B), but this can only\n146 S. Wan et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\nhave been effective during periods of lower sea level (Molengraaff and Weber, 1920). In summary, the Mekong River probably supplied most of the terrigenous material found at our study site. However, because the drainage area of Mekong River is very large and geologically complex, the influence of different source regions within that basin deserves further examination.\nA striking feature of the geography of central and southern Vietnam is its anomalously high altitude given its passive margin setting. The high plateaus have an average altitude of 1000 m and are covered by voluminous basaltic lava flows, which were emplaced in the Middle–Late Miocene and correspond with a general uplift of the area (Rangin et al., 1995). Moreover, apatite fission track analysis shows an evident increase in Late Miocene denudation from early Miocene rates of ∼34 m/my to between 390 and 500 m/my (Carter et al., 2000). Unfortunately, we have no geochemical data available to confirm whether sediment was derived from the Vietnamese Highlands or from further upstream in the Tibetan Plateau. However, there are four indirect lines of evidence that suggest a variation of terrigenous source. (1) The older sediments (8.5–5.2 Ma) at ODP Site 1143 show a mass accumulation rate up to 8.0 g/cm2/kyr, which is significantly greater than seen since 5.2 Ma (Fig. 5); (2) There is an abrupt change to finer grain size at ODP Site 1143 after about 5.2 Ma (Fig. 2). The average median grain size is about 3.9 μm since that time. In contrast, grain size averaged about 5.4 μm in the period 8.5–5.2 Ma; (3) The clay minerals assemblage changed distinctly around 5.2 Ma (Fig. 4). The smectite content rapidly decreased from about 37% to 8%, and the relative percents of illite, kaolinite and chlorite all sharply increased at about 5.2 Ma. The high content of smectite between 8.5–5.2 Ma and its abrupt decrease after 5.2 Ma possibly resulted from the change of terrigenous source, driven by the regional uplift of crust and basaltic magmatism in Vietnam between 8.5– 5.2 Ma. As we know, smectite readily derives from the chemical weathering of basaltic rocks (Chamley, 1989; Fagel et al., 2001); (4) The mass accumulation rate and content of biogenic opal at ODP Site 1143 are distinct between 8.5–5.2 Ma and the last 5.2 Ma (Figs. 3 and 5). The biogenic silica mass accumulation rate reached a maximum of 0.45 g/cm2/kyr and averaged 0.26 g/cm2/kyr prior to 5.2 Ma, but has been very stable and low since 5.2 Ma, with an average of only 0.11 g/ cm2/kyr. The 8.5–5.2 Ma period of higher biogenic silica production corresponds with a period of higher terrigenous MAR and coarser grain size.\nThe supply of terrigenous materials has had a great influence on the primary production of biogenic opal. Changes in biogenic production of striking amplitude can be interpreted as reflecting changes in sediment sources. Sundaland, which is formed by the Sunda Shelf and the land areas of peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and the northwestern part of Kalimantan (Tjia, 1980), has probably been a tectonically stable craton since the midTertiary (Stauffer, 1973; Tjia and Liew, 1996). Therefore, the evidence of an abrupt change in sediment source about 5.2 Ma suggests that the source of terrigenous detritus between 8.5–5.2 Ma may have been strongly influenced by the regional uplift of crust and basaltic magmatism in Vietnam at that time. In contrast, since 5.2 Ma, the tectonic activity has ceased in Vietnam and we suggest that the terrigenous sediment reaching ODP Site 1143 has been increasingly dominated by erosion in the Mekong headwaters within the Tibetan Plateau. Noticeably, the clay composition from ODP Site 1143 since about 5.2 Ma (Fig. 4) is in consistent with the surface distribution of clay minerals in the Mekong River estuary (average illite 47%, chlorite 23%, kaolinite 20% and smectite 10%) (Liu et al., 2003). The proposed strong influence of the Vietnamese Highlands on sedimentation at ODP Site 1143 is also supported by recent analysis of a number of regional geophysical profiles through the marginal seas of East Asia (Clift et al., 2004). This work shows that the Late Miocene (5–11 Ma) was a time of reduced sedimentation in all basins except in the Mekong area, which alone increases sharply, probably influenced by exhumation of the Vietnamese Central Highlands (Clift et al., 2004)."

    "heading": "4.2. Implication of the proxies",
    "text": "The circulation patterns of the Asian summer and winter monsoons dominate the seasonal patterns of winds, precipitation and run-off, and determine, in part, the character of land vegetation over southern and eastern Asia (Lau and Yang, 1997; Webster et al., 1998; P.X. Wang et al., 2000). Quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals constitute most of the terrigenous detrital material found at ODP Site 1143. Pyroxene and hornblende are scarce, suggesting that the terrigenous minerals have undergone significant weathering and sorting. We select the clay/feldspar ratio as an indicator of intensity of chemical weathering. Quartz is very stable under all kinds of physical and chemical conditions (Kolla et al., 1979). Clay minerals are secondary minerals formed by the alteration of feldspar, pyroxene, hornblende, and mica (Chamley, 1989). Thus\n147S. Wan et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\nan increased weight percent of clay minerals relative to feldspar should indicate a strengthening of chemical weathering, which in turn may correspond to an intensified East Asian summer monsoon and thus an increase in rainfall. Therefore, we use the ratio of clay/ feldspar as a proxy of intensity of East Asian summer monsoon.\nThe clay minerals carried by the rivers into the South China Sea are controlled partially by provenance, but also by the weathering regimes in the drainage basin (Thiry, 2000; Liu et al., 2003). Thus clay mineral assemblages in marine sediments change through time because of climate modifications onshore (Bouquillon et al., 1990; Clift et al., 2002). Specifically, smectite and kaolinite are produced under high hydrolysis regimes in soils, whereas illite and chlorite are produced by physical erosion of igneous and other rocks (Trentesaux et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2003). Because of the dilution effect between different sources regions and different clay minerals paleoclimate is best tracked using the ratio of two clay minerals instead of the content of single clay minerals (Gingele et al., 1998). In this paper, we choose the ratio of kaolinite/chlorite as a proxy for East Asian summer monsoon intensity.\nIn addition, the possible effect of oceanic transport and the tectonic activity at 8.5–5.2 Ma on the ratios of clay/feldspar and kaolinite/chlorite should also be considered. Although our above analysis suggests that Mekong River is the most important sediment source for ODP Site 1143, oceanic transport of sediment is possibly also an effective way of other source contribution. Clay composition of the Indonesian islands and the Sunda Shelf are characteristic of high contents of smectite and kaolinite (Gingele et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2003). So enhanced summer monsoon (southwesterly) currents (Fig. 1B) should be expected to transport more smectite and kaolinite from the Sunda Shelf to our investigated area. Then the increased kaolinite/chlorite value at ODP Site 1143 should always indicate the signal of enhanced summer monsoon whatever the increased value result from intensified chemical weathering in Mekong River drainage area or enhanced summer monsoon currents. In comparison with clay minerals, quartz and feldspar are not readily transported by currents in the ocean over long distance for their nature (Kolla et al., 1979). Therefore, the increased clay/ feldspar ratio due to more clay minerals transported by enhanced summer monsoon currents from the Sunda Shelf should also suggest the enhanced summer monsoon intensity. Otherwise, intuitively strengthened tectonic activity might be expected to increase physical erosion and in turn decrease chemical weathering\n(Zhang et al., 2001) and thus reduce the ratios of clay/ feldspar and kaolinite/chlorite. Because of the contrary effect of tectonic activity and summer monsoon intensity on the two ratios the increased ratios of clay/ feldspar and kaolinite/chlorite should certainly indicate strengthened summer monsoon intensity.\nThe mass accumulation rate of terrigenous materials offshore should be a reflection of continental erosion rate. Studies show that two general processes govern the rates of regional erosion and associated rates of terrigenous sedimentation: crustal deformation and climate (e.g., Zhang et al., 2001). Intuitively an increase in rainfall might be expected to increase run-off and erosion (Clift et al., 2002). However, studies of the accumulation rates in the Indian foreland, as well as Indus and Bengal Fans (Burbank et al., 1993; Clift and Gaedicke, 2002) have suggested reduced erosion there following the generally accepted age of monsoonal strengthening at 8.5 Ma (Kroon et al., 1991; Prell et al., 1992). Flourishing vegetation induced by a humid climate has been proposed to reduce soil erosion and thus clastic flux to the ocean. However, while there seems little doubt that the climate did change at 8 Ma it is not clear that this reflects a stronger summer monsoon with heavier rains. Dettman et al. (2001) provide evidence for a drying of the climate in South Asia after 8 Ma, which would be consistent with the slower clastic sedimentation seen offshore. Gupta et al. (2004) argue that 8 Ma is a time of climate change and stronger winds, but that this is not monsoonal in character, instead reflecting global cooling. Zhang et al. (2001) suggested that disequilibrium states of frequent and abrupt changes in temperature, precipitation and vegetation should be effective in causing erosion, but only after 4–3 Ma, as global climate deteriorated. Consequently the climate cannot be constrained based only on variation of terrigenous MAR, even if the tectonic factor can be excluded. Tectonic activity and surface uplift might be expected to increase erosion because crustal deformation creates regionally elevated terrain that provides potential energy to rivers and glaciers, which are the main agents of erosion. Moreover, increasing exposed fresh surface of rocks in the air also strengthens its erosion.\nA high abundance of biogenic opal in marine sediments generally indicates high productivity of diatoms and other siliceous species in the overlying waters (Lin et al., 1999). As a result the biogenic opal content and MAR have been suggested as proxies for surface productivity (Sarnthein et al., 1988; Koning et al., 1997), which is mainly controlled by the supply of\n148 S. Wan et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\nnutrients such as N, P, and Si. Most nutrients are delivered in the ocean in one of two ways: (1) terrigenous input-fluvial input. Studies show that surface chlorophyll plumes indicating high surface production extend along the coast and around large river mouths (e.g., Higginson et al., 2003), and (2) upwelling. Large amounts of nutrients are brought to the surface when deep water upwells, stimulating rapid growth of radiolarians (e.g., Prell et al., 1992). Variations in radiolarian abundance have been regarded as an important proxy of monsoon-driven upwelling (Heusser and Morley, 1997), at least in some areas. Radiolarian flux and species at ODP Site 1143 have been closely related to monsoonal activity in the SE Asian region since the Late Miocene (Chen et al., 2003).\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the ratio of clay/feldspar, which indicates the intensity of the summer monsoon, reached two high peaks about 8.5–7.6 Ma and 7.1–6.2 Ma respectively. Except for a period of relatively strong summer monsoon activity at 5.6–5.3 Ma there was a little change in the intensity of the summer monsoon in the period 6.2–3.5 Ma. Subsequently the ratio gradually increased from 3.5 Ma to 2.5 Ma and again decreased from 2.5 Ma to 1.0 Ma. In the past 1.0 Ma, it has gradually increased again while also showing much higher-amplitude variability. It is noteworthy that the variation of kaolinite/chlorite ratio since 8.5 Ma is strikingly similar to that of the ratio of clay/feldspar, consistent with our model that they are both indicators of climate change (Fig. 6).\nAlthough the terrigenous input seems to have had a great influence on the primary production of biogenic opal at 8.5–5.2 Ma, this flux may have only caused a high background value. Primary production biogenic opal may have been more sensitive to monsoon-driven upwelling, since in the two intervals of maximum summer monsoon strength the primary production, as reconstructed from the biogenic silica MAR, also reached a maximum. In contrast, terrigenous MAR was very low or decreased at the time (Fig. 6).\nAt 3.5–2.5 Ma both the terrigenous MAR and terrigenous/carbonate ratio increased remarkably, which suggests an increased terrigenous input at the time. In this period of summer monsoon strengthening the primary production of biogenic opal showed only a relatively weak increase. From about 2.5 Ma to 1.0 Ma, the biogenic silica MAR was very stable, although the terrigenous MAR gradually declined. If our inference that the East Asian summer monsoon weakened about 2.5–1.0 Ma ago is correct, there must have been an intensified winter monsoon to drive upwelling at the same time. Since 1.0 Ma both the biogenic silica MAR\nand thus the summer monsoon strengthened but also became more variable. In contrast, the terrigenous MAR decreased until about 0.3 Ma."

    "text": "Based on the above discussion of the East Asian summer monsoon we propose a simple model for its evolution (Fig. 6). We emphasize that this is schematic reconstruction which only outlines several principal stages and neglects the details. While introducing our preferred reconstruction we briefly review the history of research on the evolution of East Asian monsoon.\nThe timing of initiation of East Asian monsoon remains a topic of major disagreement because different lines of evidence have suggested different onset timing. New basal dates from the eolian Red Clay sediments in the Chinese Loess Plateau indicate onset of eolian dust accumulation at about 7.6 to 8.3 Ma (An et al., 2001; Qiang et al., 2001), consistent with the 8 Ma intensification favored from paleoceanographic data in the Arabian Sea (Kroon et al., 1991). However loess ages as early as 22 Ma have also been reported (Fig. 1a, Guo et al., 2002), matching proposed monsoon strengthening ∼20 Ma based on carbon isotope work from detrital organic matter in the South China Sea (Jia et al., 2003). A recent study shows that the broad scale climatic and botanical zones of China appear to be relatively stable since the Oligocene–Miocene boundary, implying a much earlier monsoon than previously thought (Sun and Wang, 2005). Nonetheless, 8 Ma was clearly a time of climatic change. A change from mixed needle-leaf and broad-leaf forests to grassland vegetation along the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau about 8.5 Ma ago (Ma et al., 1998), increased biogenic productivity (Gupta et al., 2004), and a major dust peak about 8–7 Ma recorded in North Pacific ODP Sites 885 and 886 (Figs. 1A, 8, Rea et al., 1998) imply an enhanced aridity in the Asian interior by about 8 Ma. Dettman et al. (2001) also indicate a drying of the climate in the Indian foreland basin starting at 8 Ma. In contrast, Rea (1992) did suggest a pulse of sedimentation at that time, but in a completely different reconstruction Burbank et al. (1993) concluded that the monsoon actually reduced erosion in the Himalayas after 8 Ma. A change in clay mineralogy from a smectite dominated to an illite-dominated sequence before ∼15 Ma, roughly synchronous with increased sedimentation rates, recorded in ODP Site 1148 in the northern South China Sea, is inferred to be mostly related to increased regional precipitation (Clift et al., 2002). In contrast, radiolarian evidence from ODP Site 1143 was\n149 S. W an et al. / P alaeogeography, P alaeoclim atology, P alaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\n150 S. Wan et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\nused to infer that the East Asian summer monsoon first strengthened at ∼12–11 Ma and intensified to its maximum strength at 8.24 Ma (Chen et al., 2003). Predating that event a long δ18O record from the Linxia Basin of Western China shows a persistent shift to more arid conditions at 12 Ma (Dettman et al., 2003).\nIn a summary, it appears that the East Asian monsoon possibly initiated at about 12 Ma or even as early as 22 Ma, and intensified until about 8 Ma. Our new data now indicate that the East Asian summer monsoon had two maximum strength periods at 8.5–7.6 Ma and 7.1– 6.2 Ma respectively, which are also consistent with biogenic silica MAR and radiolarians data from the same drill site (Chen et al., 2003).\nAn et al. (2001) have suggested three intervals of the evolution of Asian monsoon in the period of 6–2 Ma: (1) considerable variability of monsoon strength but relatively little coherent trend at 6.0–3.6 Ma, (2) simultaneous intensification of both summer and winter monsoon about 3.6–2.6 Ma, and (3) increased variability and possible weakening of the summer monsoon together with continued strengthening of winter monsoon since about 2.6 Ma. Similarly, our model of summer monsoon evolution (Fig. 6), which is based on the variation of clay/feldspar, kaolinite/chlorite and biogenic silica MAR, predicts a relatively stable period between 6.0 Ma and 3.5 Ma, a gradually strengthening period between 3.5 Ma and 2.5 Ma and a gradually\nFig. 7.

However, we also reconstruct renewed intensification and higher-frequency and amplitude variability during the last 1.0 Ma, which was not shown by An et al. (2001). An intensified East Asian monsoon at 3.5–2.5 Ma has been suggested by many studies from the loess–paleosol sequences in the Chinese Loess Plateau with magnetic susceptibility, Fe2O3 and Rr/Sr ratio as the summer monsoon proxies, and grain size and Al fluxes as winter monsoon proxies (Porter et al., 1992; Ding et al., 1994, 1999, 2001; Vandenberghe et al., 1997; Sun et al., 1998; An et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2002). Recent work at the same drill site by Hess and Kuhnt (2005) also suggests that the benthic foraminiferal diversity decreases and the abundance of high carbon flux indicators increase around 3.3 Ma, which probably was caused by increased vertical mixing of the upper water column by increased monsoonal wind. Other proxies from terrestrial or marine sediments also reveal changes in monsoon strength during the past ∼1 Ma. For example, the Fe2O3 ratio, which is a good proxy of summer monsoon evolution, shows high values during the interglacial periods since 0.8 Ma, suggesting increased summer monsoon intensity over that interval (Ding et al., 2001). Distinct changes in the radiolarian/foraminifera ratio, the coarse fraction of the bulk samples and the radiolarian assemblages around 0.9 Ma recognized in the northern Nansha islands area of the South China Sea\nand 1148 in the South China Sea since 5 Ma. The simultaneous increase sts the erosional response to both global climatic deterioration and the\n151S. Wan et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 241 (2006) 139–159\n(R.J. Wang et al., 2000) and at ODP Site 1143 (Yang et al., 2002) have been interpreted to reflect stronger upwelling and nutrient supply induced by the intensified East Asian monsoon circulation after the “Mid-Pleistocene Transition”."

    "text": "It is noticeable that all the linear sedimentation rates at ODP Sites 1143, 1146, and 1148 increase abruptly at ∼4 Ma (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the mass accumula-\ntion rates for total terrigenous materials, quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals of ODP Site 1143 show a sustained increase in the period from about 4 to 2.5 Ma (Fig. 5). Similarly, the dust accumulation rates on the Loess Plateau (Guo et al., 2002), mass accumulation rate of eolian dust at ODP Sites 885 and 886 in the North Pacific (Rea et al., 1998), normalized mean terrigenous sediment flux to the northern Indian Ocean (Rea, 1992), and normalized accumulation rates of Himalayan-derived material in the crust of manganese nodules in the southern Indian\ndust accumulation rates of QA-I at Qinan of China (Guo et al., 2002),\normalized mean terrigenous sediment flux to the northern Indian Ocean\nthe SS663-crust (Banakar et al., 2003) simultaneously increase since\nlobal climatic deterioration and the strengthening of the Asian monsoon\n152 S.

The great agreement in the timing of these intensified rates of terrigenous sedimentation is unlikely to be a coincidence and indicate faster erosion starting at that time. Zhang et al. (2001) have interpreted it as a global event caused by a climate shift, from a relatively unvarying climate to an oscillated one. There is a common consensus in the Chinese scientific circles that intense tectonic uplift of Tibetan Plateau started about 3.5 Ma, at least along its northern and eastern margin (Li, 1991; Liu et al., 1996; Li and Fang, 1999; An et al., 1999, 2001; Pan, 1999; Shi et al., 1999; Zheng et al., 2000; Song et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2004). However, many of these studies are based on records of enhanced erosion and while consistent with surface uplift do not prove that this occurred. However, Pliocene uplift of at least NE Tibet (Meyer et al., 1998) was also proposed by Tapponnier et al. (2001) as the final stage in his model of a plateau growing northward through time in three major steps following Eocene India–Asia collision. Progressive growth towards the north would also be predicted by alternative models form plateau growth, such as that of Clark and Royden (2000), which invoked a flow of lower crustal material north and east from the plateau center.\nNumerical climate modeling supports a coupled relationship between the Asian monsoon evolution and the Himalayan–Tibetan Plateau uplift (Prell and Kutzbach, 1992; Liu and Yin, 2002; An et al., 2001). It is now widely accepted that the East Asian monsoon strengthened at ∼3.6–2.5 Ma on the basis of independent paleoclimatic evidences (Qiang et al., 2001; An et al., 2001; Wehausen and Brumsack, 2002; Tian et al., 2004; Hess and Kuhnt, 2005), and this is further supported by the proxy records presented here. However it is also recognized that the strength of the monsoon is coupled to the intensity of North Hemispheric glaciation (e.g., P.X. Wang et al., 2000) making it unclear whether it is Tibetan altitude or global climate change that is triggering the strong monsoon we see at 3–4 Ma. It is possible that additional uplift of Tibet at 3–4 Ma may have strengthened the monsoon and driven glaciation, though until an independent record of Tibetan altitude is derived we can only state that our data are only consistent with, not unique to such a model. Nonetheless, the coincidence of increasing amplitude of global climate variations with periods of ∼20, 40 and 100 ky since 3–4 Ma (Zhang et al., 2001) and the strengthening of the East Asian monsoon at the same\ntime results in rapid regional erosion, associated with increased terrigenous sedimentation rate in Asian basins since about 4 Ma."

    "text": "A newly constructed quartz isolation procedure, determination of biogenic opal, identification of clay minerals by X-ray diffraction and grain sizes measurements of extracted terrigenous materials have been carried out on sediments from ODP Site 1143 in the southern South China Sea in order to obtain proxy records of past changes in East Asian monsoon climate during the last 8.5 Ma. From this study, we draw the following conclusions:\n(1) An abrupt change of terrigenous MAR, median grain size, clay mineral assemblage and biogenic opal MAR and content about 5.2 Ma indicates that the terrigenous source to the area was dominated by local sources at 8.5–5.2 Ma, largely from regions of crustal uplift and basaltic eruption in Vietnam. However, since ∼5.2 Ma, the sediment reaching ODP Site 1143 has been dominated by flux from sources within the Mekong River drainage, especially the gorges that incise the edge of the Tibetan Plateau. (2) A simple model of the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon based on the clay/feldspar ratio, kaolinite/chlorite ratio and biogenic opal MAR has been constructed. We show two maximum strength periods of the summer monsoon at 8.5– 7.6 Ma and 7.1–6.2 Ma respectively. Subsequently there was a relatively stable period between 6.2–3.5 Ma, continued intensification about 3.5–2.5 Ma; and last, a gradual weakening since 2.5 Ma. The monsoon has intensified again and shows remarkably higher-frequency variability since 1.0 Ma. (3) The simultaneous increase of linear sedimentation rates at ODP Sites 1143, 1146 and 1148, as well as mass accumulation rates of total terrigenous materials, quartz, feldspar and clay minerals at ODP Site 1143 at 3.5–2.5 Ma, represents the erosional response to both global climatic deterioration and the strengthening of the East Asian summer monsoon since about 3.5 Ma. Whether this strengthening is linked to Tibetan uplift or an independent strengthening of the monsoon remains unclear at the present time.\n153S.

  "abstractText": "128 samples from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1143 in the southern South China Sea were analyzed for grain size, clay minerals, biogenic opal content and quartz in order to reconstruct changes in East Asian monsoon climate since 8.5 Ma. An abrupt change of terrigenous mass accumulation rate (MAR), clay mineral assemblage, median grain size and biogenic opal MAR about 5.2 Ma suggests that between 8.5–5.2 Ma the source of terrigenous sediment was mainly in the region of surface uplift and basaltic volcanism in southern Vietnam. A simple model of East Asian summer monsoon evolution was based on the clay/feldspar ratio, kaolinite/chlorite ratio and biogenic opal MAR. The summer monsoon has two periods of maximum strength at 8.5–7.6 Ma and 7.1–6.2 Ma. Subsequently, there was a relatively stable period at 6.2–3.5 Ma, continued intensification about 3.5–2.5 Ma, and gradually weakening after 2.5 Ma. Since 1 Ma the monsoon has intensified, with remarkable high-frequency and amplitude variability. Simultaneous increase in sedimentation rates at ODP Sites 1143, 1146 and 1148, as well as in MAR of terrigenous materials, quartz, feldspar and clay minerals at ODP Site 1143 at 3.5–2.5 Ma, may be the erosional response to both global climatic deterioration and the strengthening of the East Asian summer monsoon after about 3–4 Ma. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
