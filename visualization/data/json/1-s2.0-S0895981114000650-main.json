This part of the Brazilian Atlantic margin is morphologically characterized by inland and coastal plateaus surrounding a wide low-lying inland region, the Sertaneja Depression. The apatite fission track ages and mean track lengths vary from 39 ± 4 to 350 ± 57 Ma and from 10.0 ± 0.3 to 14.2 ± 0.2 mm, respectively, implying a protracted history of spatially variable denudation since the Permian at relatively low rates (<50 m My 1). The Sertaneja Depression and inland plateaus record Permian-Early Jurassic (300e180 Ma) denudation that precedes rifting of the margin by > 60 Myrs. In contrast, the coastal regions record up to 2.5 km of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (150e120 Ma) denudation, coeval with rifting of the margin. The samples from elevated coastal regions, the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range, record cooling from temperatures above 120 C since the Late Cretaceous extending to the Cenozoic. We interpret this denudation as related to post-rift uplift of these parts of the margin, possibly resulting from compressional stresses transmitted from the Andes and/or magmatism at that time. Several samples from these areas also record accelerated Neogene (<30 Ma) cooling, which may record landscape response to a change from a tropical to a more erosive semi-arid climate during this time. The inferred denudation history is consistent with the offshore sedimentary record, but not with evolutionary scenarios inferred from the recognition of “planation surfaces” on the margin. The denudation history of the northeastern Brazilian margin implies a control of pre-, synand post-rift tectonic and climatic events on landscape evolution.\n© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our basic understanding of rifted-margin escarpment evolution has\nUniversidade Federal do Rio orto Alegre 91501-970, Brazil.\nritterjelinek@hotmail.com\ngreatly improved over the last two decades as extensive datasets on their long-term denudation became available. Such datasets were collated using primarily apatite fission-track (AFT) thermochronology (e.g., Dumitru et al., 1991; Gallagher et al., 1994; Brown et al., 2002; Gunnell et al., 2003). At the same time, numerical models of landscape evolution led to the recognition that rifted-margin escarpments are long-lived erosional features associated with kmscale long-wavelength uplift of the margin and its continental interior (e.g., Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Kooi and Beaumont, 1994; Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; van der Beek and Braun, 1999; Sacek et al., 2012); this prediction was shown to be consistent with available AFT datasets (van der Beek et al., 1999, 2002). However,\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 159\nthe mechanisms of the uplift remain disputed: magmatic underplating associated with extensive syn-break-up magmatism (Lister et al., 1991; Gallagher et al., 1994), isostatic support by buoyant hot mantle (Nyblade and Sleep, 2003; Hasterok and Chapman, 2007), dynamic support by mantle flow (Lithgow-Bertelloni and Silver, 1998; Braun, 2010), and transmission of plate-boundary forces (Cobbold et al., 2007; Cloetingh et al., 2008) have all been proposed as viable mechanisms. Similarly, the timing of uplift has been variably interpreted as pre-, syn- or post-break-up; although the denudation record of some rifted-margin escarpments can be explained without invoking post-rift uplift (e.g., Brown et al., 2002; van der Beek et al., 1999, 2002), post-rift reactivation of major crustal shear-zones leading to localized uplift and denudation has been recognized on several margins (Harman et al., 1998; Raab et al., 2002; Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012). Other researchers have interpreted the geomorphic record of high-elevation riftedmargins in terms of significant and widespread post-rift uplift (e.g., Japsen et al., 2009, 2012a and references therein). Finally, the flexural isostatic response to onshore denudation and offshore sedimentation may also have contributed to the history of vertical motions at rifted continental margins (Pazzaglia and Gardner, 1994).\nThe margins surrounding the South Atlantic have been the focus of considerable attention in the debate on the origin and evolution of rifted-margin escarpments (e.g., Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Gallagher and Brown, 1999; Brown et al., 2000). The South Atlantic margins are characterized by voluminous igneous activity coincident with the break-up between South America and Africa (Hawkesworth et al., 1992), but also by more localized magmatism at 80 and 50e40 Ma (Misuzaki et al., 1992, 2002). Several authors have explored the links between this magmatism, the uplift and denudation history of the onshore continental margin, and the sedimentary record of the adjacent passive-margin basins (e.g., Chang et al., 1992). The patterns of uplift and denudation along the South Atlantic margins also appear to be controlled by syn- and post-rift reactivation of major pre-existing structures formed during a long Proterozoic history of plate assembly (Gallagher et al., 1994; Harman et al., 1998; Gallagher and Brown, 1999; Raab et al., 2002; Cobbold et al., 2007; Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012).\nOn the South American margin of the South Atlantic, most thermochronology studies have focused on southeastern Brazil (Gallagher et al., 1994, 1995; Gallagher and Brown, 1999; Jelinek et al., 2003; Tello et al., 2003; Hackspacher et al., 2007; Hiruma et al., 2010; Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012), where the rifted-margin escarpment is most clearly expressed. In contrast, the uplift and denudation history of the margin further to the north (Figs. 1 and 2) have not been studied in much detail until recently. Harman et al. (1998) used AFT data to constrain denudation in the cratonic interior and margin of northeastern Brazil. Cupertino (2000; see also Magnavita et al., 2012) presented a thermochronological study of the Recôncavo and Camamu Basins and the adjacent host rocks, but mostly focused on the implications for petroleum prospects in these basins. Turner et al. (2008) andMorais Neto et al. (2009) have worked on the Sergipe-Alagoas continental margin and Borborema Province, respectively. However, these studies have focused on relatively restricted areas and only the latter two studies explicitly linked the denudational history inferred from thermochronology data to rifted-margin development. In a recent paper, Japsen et al. (2012b) present new AFT data from the northeastern Brazilian margin and infer a complex post-rift history of repeated burial and exhumation. In contrast to the margins of southeastern Brazil and southwestern Africa, neither the northeastern Brazilian margin nor its African conjugate in Gabon and Congo is characterized by awelldeveloped escarpment. These peculiarities make this part of the Brazilian margin of interest for the study of long-term landscape evolution and its potential links with rifted-margin development.\nHere we present an extensive AFT database that constrains the morphotectonic evolution of the northern East-Brazilian margin. We use inverse modeling of AFT ages and track-length distributions to establish the timing and magnitude of major cooling events and quantify the associated denudation. The data density is sufficient to develop a synoptic view of denudation patterns through space and time on the margin. We discuss the results in terms of the mechanisms responsible for the present-day topography and their relation to Pangaea break-up. Our data indicate a protracted history of landscape development on the northern East-Brazilian margin, on which pre- and post-rift events had at least as much influence as syn-rift uplift and denudation."

    "text": "The study area covers the northern half of the East-Brazilian margin, between 8 and 21 S (Fig. 1). Toward the south, the study area encompasses the Mantiqueira Range, which is characterized by high topographic relief (elevations reaching up to 2000 m) located close to the coastline, with the drainage divide and the mountain front running sub-parallel to the present-day coastline.\nThe continental margin in northeastern Brazil does not exhibit such high elevations near the coastline, but is characterized by two coastal plateaus, the Borborema Plateau to the northeast and the Conquista-Jequitinhonha Plateau to the southwest, which rise from the coastal plain to elevations of ~1200 m and 400e800 m, respectively (Fig. 1). A third plateau, the Diamantina Plateau, is located inland and is characterized by a low-relief summit surface at elevations of ~1500e2000 m. The Diamantina Plateau is bordered to the east by a conspicuously straight, north-south oriented escarpment located 300e400 km inland and incised by the headwaters of the Itapicuru and the Jacuípe-Paraguaçu rivers (Fig. 1). These three plateaus surround a widespread low-lying area known as the Sertaneja Depression. Although the escarpments are locally developed on more resistant lithologies, there is no direct relationship between the bedrock geology (cf. next section) and the occurrence of the plateaus as they cut across rocks of different ages (mainly Proterozoic). The plateau surfaces have been interpreted as uplifted “peneplains” (sensu King, 1967), which would have recorded extensive Cenozoic uplift (e.g., Peulvast et al., 2008; Japsen et al., 2012b).\nThe drainage system of northeast Brazil consists mainly of WNW-ESE flowing rivers. The largest catchment is that of the S~ao Francisco River, which drains the Diamantina Plateau and a large part of the S~ao Francisco Craton (cf. below) before crossing the Sertaneja Depression on a southeasterly course to the Atlantic. The S~ao Francisco is a long-lived river system, which has evolved since mid-Cretaceous times (Potter, 1997); its present-day course has been suggested to result from Early Cenozoic capture of the northeast-flowing Parnaíba River (cf. Karner and Driscoll, 1999). Other major rivers present in the study areawith a similar trend are the Jequitinhonha, Doce, Almada, Contas, Paraguaçu, Jacuípe, Itapicuru, Vaza-Barris, and Sergipe Rivers (Fig. 1). Similar to the plateaus, the structural control on the river systems is variable; for instance, rivers cut across the Mesozoic Recôncavo-Tucano-Jatob a rift system (cf. Section 2.3) in the Sertaneja Depression, although the S~ao Francisco, Vaza-Barris, and Itapicuru partly follow the segment boundaries in this rift system. Similarly, some rivers (Jequitinhonha, Contas, Paraguaçu) cut into the Diamantina and Conquista-Jequitinhonha plateaus, whereas the larger Doce and S~ao Francisco flow around the Mantiqueira Range and Diamantina Plateau, respectively.\nA.R.

    "text": "The geology of northeastern Brazil is dominated by the S~ao Francisco craton (Fig. 2), which was contiguous with the northwestern part of the Congo craton in West Africa prior to the Pangaea break-up (e.g., Neves, 2003). The S~ao Francisco craton (Almeida, 1977; Barbosa et al., 2003) is made up of variably deformed and metamorphosed Archean to Paleoproterozoic rocks that are overlain by flat-lying Meso- and Neoproterozoic platform sediments of the Espinhaço and S~ao Francisco supergroups, respectively.\nThe S~ao Francisco craton is surrounded by the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano (600e580 Ma) fold-belts developed during several\ncollisional orogenies that had led to the assembly of Gondwana. In northeastern Brazil, the Sergipano belt separates the S~ao Francisco Craton from the Mesoproterozoic Borborema Province (Fig. 2) (Santos, 1999), which was repeatedly reactivated during late Proterozoic times (Neves, 2003).\nGeologically, the Diamantina Plateau is part of the Espinhaço Massif (Almeida-Abreu and Pflug, 1994) and is underlain by the Espinhaço Supergroup, which was mildly deformed during the Mesoproterozoic and Brasiliano orogenies. Marginal faults have developed throughout the post-Paleozoic history; these have been held responsible for the NeS alignment of prominent scarps on the western and eastern edge of the Diamantina Plateau (Pedreira and Rocha, 2002). The coastal Conquista and Borborema plateaus, in\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 161\ncontrast, developed on the Archean-Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic crystalline basement rocks of the S~ao Francisco and the Borborema provinces, respectively.\nThe Mantiqueira Range mainly exposes units of the Araçuaí Belt, together with reworked Paleoproterozoic to Archean crustal blocks and late Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic intracratonic sedimentary rocks (Alkmin et al., 2006; Noce et al., 2007; Chemale Jr. et al., 2012). The Araçuaí Belt consists of Neoproterozoic, riftrelated, passive margin type and foreland sedimentary deposits, Neoproterozoic to Cambrian pre-, syn- and post-kinematic granites, and immature volcano-sedimentary and sedimentary rocks, which were interpreted as deposited in arc-related and intramontane basins (Pedrosa-Soares and Wiedemann-Leonardos, 2000).\nThe low-lying coastal areas south of 15 S are covered by recent coastal sediments that include beach and deltaic deposits."

    "text": "The Mesozoic break-up of Pangaea is recorded in eastern and northeastern Brazil by the development of the SergipeeAlagoas, Jacuípe, Camamu-Almada, Jequitinhonha, Cumuruxatiba, Mucuri, and Espírito Santo basins on the rifted continental margin, as well as the Recôncavo-Tucano-Jatob a (RTJ) rift basins within the continental interior (Figs. 1 and 2) (Chang et al., 1992; Blaich et al., 2008). The conjugate basins to the Sergipe-Alagoas, Jacuípe-CamamuAlmada and Cumuruxatiba-Mucuri-Espírito Santo segments of the Brazilian margin are the Rio Muni, Gabon and Congo Basins,\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181162\nrespectively, on theWest African margin (Mohriak et al., 2008). The oldest known (early-) rift sediments in northeastern Brazil are of latest Jurassic age (<150 Ma) (Kuchle et al., 2011). Continental breakup and seafloor spreading along this segment of the Atlantic commenced in the Aptian to Albian (~115 Ma) (Chang et al., 1992; Mohriak et al., 2008). The northeastern Brazilian margin is located at the intersection between the southern and central branches of the Atlantic rift system. The study area evolved as a classical divergent rifted margin, which evolves to a transform margin ~300 km further north, along the equatorial margin of Brazil. Physiographically, the studied segment consists of a continental shelf and slope that vary considerably in width and steepness along the strike of the margin (Blaich et al., 2008) (Fig. 1).\nThe onshore RTJ rift is an Early Cretaceous system of continental half-grabens separated by basement highs and connected to the eastern Brazilian margin. Developed across the boundary between two major provinces of the Brazilian Shield, the S~ao Francisco Craton and the Borborema Province (Almeida et al., 1981), the RTJ rift evolved as a failed rift arm during the break-up of Pangaea and the opening of the South Atlantic (Szatmari et al., 1985,1987;Milani et al., 1988; Szatmari and Milani, 1999). The RTJ rift consists of a series of five asymmetric grabens e Recôncavo, South Tucano, Central Tucano, North Tucano, and Jatob a e and is segmented by several NW-oriented transfer zones, which reactivate Proterozoic shear zones in the basement (Milani and Davison, 1988) and partly guide the modern drainage (cf. Section 2.1). Post-rift sediments are conspicuously poorly developed in the RTJ rift; they are restricted to the relatively widespread late Aptian (“Alagoas stage”) fluviallacustrine Marizal Formation (maximum thickness ~240 m; Magnavita et al., 1994, 2012), and minor occurrences of Neogene sediments in the southern Recôncavo basin. The anomalously high levels of compaction and hydrocarbon maturation within the synrift sediments, considering their present burial depth, imply significant late syn-rift or post-rift erosion, which has been variably explained by asymmetric crustal-lithospheric extension (Karner et al., 1992), local rift-flank uplift combined with magmatic underplating (Magnavita et al., 1994) or late-stage post-rift uplift (Japsen et al., 2012b).\nThe offshore Sergipe-Alagoas basin is divided into two subbasins by a basement high near the S~ao Francisco River. This basin contains the most complete stratigraphic succession in which four mega-sequences are recognized: pre-rift, syn-rift, transitional and post-rift (Mohriak, 2003). Rifting of this segment of the continental margin is interpreted to have been initially oblique, in response to left-lateral shear (Milani et al., 1988; Szatmari and Milani, 1999). A series of NeS oriented grabens developed in an en- echelon pattern along the general SWeNE strike of the basin and were filled by Valanginian-early Aptian (~140e120 Ma) sediments. A second, purely extensional phase occurred during the Aptian, with movement concentrated along a normal-fault system of regional SWeNE extension, which approximately coincides with the present coastline and separates the offshore and onshore portions of the basin (Milani et al., 2000).\nThe Jacuípe basin is limited to the north by the Sergipe-Alagoas basin and to the south by the Camamu-Almada basin. Its onshore limit with the Recôncavo basin is the Barra fault (Netto et al., 1994). The stratigraphic framework of the basin includes two megasequences: a continental syn-rift phase of Berriasian-Barremian age and a marine post-rift phase (Milani, 2007). The sedimentary section of the basin can reach up to 7000 m thickness (Mohriak, 2003).\nThe Camamu-Almada, Jequitinhonha, Cumuruxatiba, Mucuri and Espírito Santo basins also exhibit significant sedimentary thicknesses, which reach 8000 m in the depocenters. Four megasequences have been identified in the stratigraphy of these\nbasins: pre-rift, syn-rift, transitional and post-rift (Mohriak, 2003). Wells on the northern shelf of the Camamu basin, close to the RTJ rift, provide evidence for significant post-rift erosion (Japsen et al., 2012b).\nA conspicuous feature of the stratigraphic record of all the offshore basins is the building out of clastic wedges during the late post-rift phase, implying renewed or increased erosion of the continental interior (Chang et al., 1992; Mohriak, 2003), although this renewed clastic input has been explained by expansion of the S~ao Francisco drainage in the case of the Sergipe-Alagoas basin (Karner and Driscoll, 1999). A post-rift clastic wedge started building out since the Campanian (~80 Ma) in the Sergipe-Alagoas basin, since the Eocene (~40e50 Ma) in the more southward Jequitinhonha, Cumuruxatiba, Mucuri and Espírito Santo basins, but only since the Oligocene (~25e30 Ma) in Jacuípe and CamamuAlmada basins.\nIn contrast to the basins of southern Brazil, extension and breakup in northeastern Brazil was essentially non-magmatic (Chang et al., 1992; Blaich et al., 2008), although a potential magmatic underplate has recently been recognized on the conjugate Gabon margin (Dupr e et al., 2011). Some syn-rift magmatism is also recognized along the equatorial Brazilian margin in the northern Borborema province (Mizusaki et al., 2002). Post-rift magmatism occurred between 60 and 40 Ma both to the south (centered on the Abrolhos and Royal Charlotte banks) and north (northern Borborema province) of the northeastern Brazilian margin, which has been related to themovement of the South American plate over one or several hot spots (Chang et al., 1992; Mizusaki et al., 2002)."

    "heading": "3. Existing thermochronology data",
    "text": "Five published AFT thermochronology studies have been performed in the region over the last 15 years (Fig. 1). Harman et al. (1998) studied the continental interior of northeastern Brazil and furnished 20 AFT ages from the S~ao Francisco Craton that range from 76 ± 4 to 260 ± 59 Ma. The data were interpreted in terms of two phases of denudation: the first at ~130 Ma, which the authors relate to the initial stages of continental break-up; and the second ~80e60 Ma, which they relate to intracontinental deformation, with reactivation of the Proterozoic shear zones due to variations in the relative plate motions between the South American, African and Antarctic plates.\nCupertino (2000; see also Magnavita et al., 2012) performed AFT analysis on basement and sedimentary samples of the Camamu Basin and the RTJ rift. He concluded that the western margin of the RTJ rift system, from Pernambuco to the Camamu basin, cooled from temperatures of >120 C since 145 Ma (i.e. shortly after deposition), whereas the eastern margin presents younger ages. The eastern margin of the rift system also shows southward younging ages, suggesting a southward propagation of exhumation in the rift. Rocks adjacent to the Camamu basin record four main cooling events in the Late Jurassic e Early Cretaceous, Late Cretaceous, Paleogene and Miocene, respectively.\nTurner et al. (2008) reported AFT data from the Sergipe-Alagoas section of the northeastern Brazilian margin as well as from the RTJ rift sediments. The AFT ages for 8 samples from the Precambrian basement are between 81 ± 7 and 284 ± 20Ma, while the ages for 6 detrital samples from the RTJ rift are between 152 ± 8 and 328 ± 42 Ma. The data suggest two main cooling episodes during the intervals 110e100 Ma and 40e10 Ma, respectively, which contrast with the intervals suggested earlier by Harman et al. (1998). Turner et al. (2008) interpreted the first cooling phase to be related to continental break-up, as its timing coincides with the offshore development of a major break-up unconformity. The second cooling/exhumation episode was interpreted as being\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 163\ntriggered by climate change, in particular rapid global cooling at the EoceneeOligocene transition.\nMorais Neto et al. (2009) studied a region somewhat to the north in the Borborema Province and reported 15 AFT ages ranging between 71 ± 6 and 173 ± 24 Ma. The AFT data show evidence for two regional cooling events during the Late Cretaceous (~100e90 Ma), and the Neogene (<20 Ma). Similar to Turner et al. (2008), they interpreted the Late Cretaceous event as being related to continental break-up and the Neogene event as resulting from climate change.\nA recent study on NE margin of Brazil by Japsen et al. (2012b) reported a large AFT dataset that partially overlaps our sampling area (Fig. 1) and includes data from seven boreholes in the RTJ rift and Camamu Basin. Combining their AFT data with compaction (sonic velocity) trends in wells and the interpretation of two widespread erosional surfaces, these authors infer a four-stage post-rift history for the margin. After break-up, the margin is suggested to have undergone burial beneath an initial sedimentary cover, which would have been completely removed by uplift and erosion episodes during the Campanian and Eocene. Consequently, the upper erosion surface would have been deeply weathered and reburied during the Oligocene-Miocene transition. Finally, Miocene uplift and erosion is interpreted to have produced the lower-level peneplain by incision of the uplifted and re-exposed Paleogene peneplain.\nFrom the above studies, four potential phases of rapid cooling and exhumation emerge. All studies report cooling during the Early Cretaceous (broadly between ~130 and 90 Ma), which is generally suggested to be related to rifted-margin denudation driven by continental breakup (possibly in association with a relaxing geothermal gradient; Turner et al., 2008). A Late Cretaceous e Earliest Tertiary (~80e60 Ma) event was reported by Harman et al. (1998) and Japsen et al. (2012b), while the latter authors also argue for a separate Eocene (~45 Ma) event. Finally, all studies except Harman et al. (1998) found evidence for Neogene cooling but no consensus exists on the driving mechanism for the more recent event(s).\n4. New apatite fission-track data"

    "heading": "4.1. Sampling and analytical methods",
    "text": "One hundred and twenty-two outcrop samples were collected from the northern East-Brazilian continental margin for AFT analysis (Figs. 1 and 2). The samples comprised 118 igneous rocks from the Precambrian basement and 4 sedimentary rocks from the Central Tucano Basin. The latter were collected at a depth interval of ~150 m and sampled Tithonian to Barremian stratigraphic levels. The sampling followed eight approximately WNW-ESE oriented profiles across the margin between the Doce River to the south and the S~ao Francisco River to the north, with additional sampling between the profiles to improve the spatial coverage.\nThe samples were processed and dated at the thermochronology facility of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, using the external-detector method (Hurford, 1990). Samples were crushed, sieved and dried at temperatures <40 C. Apatite grains were concentrated by conventional magnetic, heavy-liquid and hand-picking techniques and mounted in epoxy resin. The mounts were polished using diamond paste to expose internal surfaces, and they were etched for 25 s in 5 M HNO3 at 21 C to reveal the spontaneous fission tracks. The apatite mounts, U-doped glass dosimeters (CN5 and CN1) and age standards (Durango) were covered with low-U mica sheets as external detectors and dispatched for neutron irradiation at the well thermalized Orph ee reactor, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, and the IPEN Reactor, S~ao Paulo,\nBrazil. After irradiation, the mica detectors were etched for 18 min in 48% HF to reveal the induced fission tracks. Track counting and track-length measurements were performed at 1000 magnification using a Zeiss Axioplan™ Microscope fitted with an Autoscan™ scanning/counting system. Fission-track ages were calculated using the zeta-calibration method (Hurford and Green, 1983) and reported as central ages (Galbraith and Laslett, 1993). The calibrations were performed as recommended by Hurford (1990), deriving an empirical zeta factor from analyses on Durango apatite standards. The ages calculated for Durango apatite samples irradiatedwith the samples from this study are provided in Table S1 (cf. Supplementary data). Statistical treatment of the data was performed using the Trackkey software (Dunkl, 2002).\nIn order to control potential compositional effects on AFT annealing kinetics (Green et al., 1986; Carlson et al., 1999; Barbarand et al., 2003), the chemical composition (in particular the Cl concentration) was measured in representative samples for the different rock types that were sampled. Microprobe analysis was carried out in the Institute of Mineralogy and Crystal Chemistry, University of Stuttgart, Germany using a CAMECA SX100 Electron Microprobe.\nBased on the distribution of AFT single-grain ages, confined track lengths, chemical composition and independent geological constraints, the temperature-time (T e t) path for each sample was modeled using the HeFTy program (Ketcham, 2005) and the multikinetic annealing algorithm of Ketcham et al. (2007). The synoptic maps of AFT ages, mean track lengths and the paleotemperatures and denudation rates for the different time intervals inferred from themodelingwere created by interpolating the data using ArcGIS™ and Move™ software."

    "text": "The AFT analytical data for samples from the different geomorphic domains defined earlier are reported in Tables 1e5. The spatial distribution of AFT ages and mean track lengths (MTL) are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. We aimed to date 20 grains and to measure 100 horizontal confined track lengths per sample. Many samples do not meet these criteria (Tables 1e5); we decided to retain them nonetheless, because their ages and MTL broadly agree with the nearby samples that do have good-quality measurements. The samples yielded central AFT ages that vary between 39 ± 4 (sample ES-22) and 350 ± 57 (sample BA-65A) Ma (Fig. 3a). All samples except PTAM-11 pass the c2 test with P (c2) well over 5%, which indicates that the distribution of single-grain ages is consistent with a single age population in each sample. All AFT ages are much younger than the Brasiliano/Pan African orogeny that last affected the basement rocks before 500 Ma. We therefore interpret the ages as representing cooling ages, which could represent regional denudation events. The possible ages of these events span a range from preceding rifting and break-up by > 200 Ma to post-rift.\nThe confined track-length distributions are both unimodal and bimodal, with MTL ranging from 10.0 ± 0.3 mm (sample BA-108; N ¼ 11) to 14.2 ± 0.2 mm (sample PTAM-2; N ¼ 41). The large majority of MTL lie in the 11e13.5 mm range (Fig. 3b). The Cl contents of 34 selected samples range between 0.006 (sample PTAM-6) and 0.674 wt. % (Table S2, cf. Supplementary Data).\nThe spatial variation in the AFT ages and mean track lengths appear to broadly correlate with the geomorphic and geologic domains that were discussed in Section 2 (Figs. 1 and 3). The oldest AFT ages (between 180 ± 19 and 350 ± 57 Ma, with one outlier at 142 ± 11 Ma) were obtained from samples in the S~ao Francisco Craton, both from the Sertaneja Depression and the coastal strip adjacent to the Camamu-Almada basin (Table 1).

Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 165\nsamples are characterized by relatively lowMTL (between 10.3 and 13.5 mm).\nThe samples from the Conquista Plateau and adjacent areas, also part of the S~ao Francisco Craton, yielded ages between 118 ± 14 and 211 ± 31 Ma. These samples are also characterized by somewhat longer MTL, which vary between 10.9 and 14.0 mm (Table 2). The samples from the Sergipano Belt in the northeastern coastal area present a wide spread of ages between 91 ± 9 and 309 ± 61 Ma (Table 3) with older ages concentrated in the western part of the area, close to the S~ao Francisco Craton. Except for these samples with ages >200 Ma, MTL are relatively long, between 12.0 and 14.0 mm. AFT ages from the Mantiqueira Range compose the youngest group (between 39 ± 4 and 171 ± 43 Ma) and are associated with variable MTL between 10.3 and 14.0 mm (Table 4).\nSamples from the Tucano Basin and adjacent areas also have young ages, between 63 ± 5 and 120 ± 40 Ma (Table 5). Two samples from the Tucano Basin sediments (PTAM-16 and PTAM-34) have AFT ages of 119 ± 15 and 119 ± 18 Ma respectively, and are significantly younger than their Tithonian-Berriasian (151e140Ma) depositional age; these findings are indicative of cooling through the apatite partial annealing zone after high levels of postdepositional annealing. A third sample (PTAM-10) has an AFT age of 150 ± 21Ma, overlapping its depositional age, but also suggestive of significant annealing. These three samples are all sandstones from the western flank of the basin. The samples pass the c2 test and have unimodal track-length distributions with MTL between 12.7 ± 0.2 (PTAM-10; N¼ 85) and 13.5 ± 0.2 (PTAM-16; N¼ 81) mm, which is consistent with the AFT age representing cooling from temperatures above the partial annealing zone. We note that PTAM-10 has the lowest P(c2) and MTL values of the three samples. Finally, sample PTAM-15 from the center of the basin has a central age of 175 ± 26 Ma, which is older than the depositional age, indicating that this sample records much less burial heating than the others.\nAs expected for such a large area of relatively subdued relief, the collective AFT dataset does not show any systematic correlation between AFT age and elevation. The large majority of the samples were collected from elevations <500 m, although a few samples from higher elevations (600e1000 m) were collected from the summit surfaces of the Conquista and Borborema plateaus; they show intermediate AFT ages of ~100e170 Ma. Three samples were collected at more than 1000 m elevation in the Mantiqueira Range and present ages from 80 to 171 Ma.\nIn contrast to several other rifted continental margins (e.g., Dumitru et al., 1991; Brown et al., 2002; Gunnell et al., 2003), the thermochronological ages do not show a systematic pattern of younging from the interior toward the coastline. However, certain patterns are observed when the data are plotted along transects. Fig. 4 shows nine different transects (see locations in Fig. 2), one oriented SWeNE parallel to the coast (Fig. 4A) and eight oriented approximately WNW-ESE orthogonal to the coastline (Fig. 4B). Transects BB’, CC’ and DD’ (Fig. 4B) reveal a general trend of increasing AFT ages with distance from the coast and with elevation, although the ages also increase close to the coastline, in particular for transect DD’. These transects show a transition from ages of ~100e150 Ma to >200 Ma within or just west of the Tucano and Recôncavo rifts. In contrast, transect EE’ (Fig. 4B) shows a reversed trend of AFT ages decreasing with distance from the coast andwith elevation, with the youngest age (123Ma) encountered on the Conquista Plateau. Transects FF’, GG’, and HH’ (Fig. 4B) show ages that vary from 39 to 171 Ma without systematic correlation between the AFT age and elevation or distance from the coast.\nFig. 5 shows the AFT ages plotted against mean track length (MTL), which allows identification of cooling phases from the trends in the data (e.g., Brown et al., 2000).

(2) Samples with AFT ages between ~100 and 200Ma show a negative correlation of AFT age and MTL; MTL peaks at ~14 mm for samples with AFT ages approximately 100 Ma. (3) Finally, samples with AFT ages < 100 Ma again show a positive correlation between AFT age and MTL. There is no simple relationship between the apatite chemistry (Cl content) and the different age groups, although the older samples with short MTL tend to have relatively higher Cl contents (>0.1 wt. %; Fig. 5); this finding suggests that these samples, which anneal more slowly (Green et al., 1986; Carlson et al., 1999), record a longer cooling history than the other samples.\nSimilar plots of AFT age versus MTL are presented for different subareas in Fig. 6, combining our new data with those published by Harman et al. (1998), Turner et al. (2008), and Japsen et al. (2012b). Although the trends are not as clear as for the combined dataset (Fig. 5), these plots allow us to evaluate the data in a spatial context. Fig. 6a shows that the samples from the Sertaneja depression span the entire age and MTL range, although the majority belongs to group (1) defined above. Ages reported by Harman et al. (1998) appear younger than those from Japsen et al. (2012b), which correspond well with our sample ages. However, Harman et al. (1998) concentrated their sampling on reactivated Proterozoic shear zones that are characterized by younger AFT ages than their surroundings. The samples from the Conquista Plateau and the adjacent areas (Fig. 6b) belong to groups (2) and, for some samples, (3). The samples from the Sergipano Belt, Borborema Plateau and adjoining coastal area (Fig. 6c) also span close to the entire range of AFT ages and MTL, but belong mostly to groups (2) and (3). There is an excellent agreement between our data and those of Turner et al. (2008) and Japsen et al. (2012b). Finally, samples from the Mantiqueira Range and adjacent areas (Fig. 6d) belong mostly to group (3)."

    "text": "In order to further constrain the thermal and denudation history of the northern East-Brazilian continental margin, timeetemperature histories have beenmodeled for 98 selected samples for which sufficient track-lengthmeasurements were available. The model inversion is based on the AFT single-grain ages and tracklength distributions and uses the HeFTy program of Ketcham (2005) with the multi-kinetic annealing model of Ketcham et al. (2007). We used the Cl content as the kinetic parameter to calibrate our thermal modeling. Cl contents have not beenmeasured in all modeled samples but are available for all representative lithologic/tectonic groups; the samples have a restricted range of Cl contents between 0.006 and 0.6 wt. % (Tables 1e5 and Table S2; cf. Supplementary Data). The samples for which no Cl data were available were modeled taking into account the minimum, average and maximum Cl contents measured. The three model results do not differ strongly from each other (Fig. S1; cf. Supplementary Data). The inversions were runwith 10,000 randomly chosen timetemperature histories for each sample, such that sufficient model paths were available to clearly differentiate between “good fit” and “acceptable fit” solutions (cf. Ketcham et al., 2000 for details and definitions of “good” and “acceptable” fits). As all but four of the modeled samples are from Archean-Proterozoic basement rocks with AFT ages much younger than the last tectono-thermal event,\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 169\nwe initially allow the model to explore a large time-temperature space and only iteratively set some constraints on the timetemperature paths in order to increase the number of fits to the data. For the four modeled samples from the Tucano Basin sediments, thermal histories were required to pass through the surface temperature at the time of deposition. All the inversions converged well, and the optimal models provide good fits to the data (Fig. S2; cf. Supplementary Data).\nThe modeled histories for the studied area converge on Tet solutions that showageneral patternof regionally recognizable cooling intervals. For the following discussion, we have compiled all the thermal models for each morphological region, in order to extract a characteristic cooling history (Fig. 7). The cooling histories presented in Fig. 7 are the average of the “good-fit” solutions; Fig. S2 (cf. Supplementary Data) shows individual inversions for all samples.\nSamples from the Sertaneja Depression (Fig. 7a) record the oldest cooling episode in the studied area, during Permian-Early Jurassic times (~300e180 Ma). This cooling episode brought the samples from paleotemperatures well above the AFT partial annealing zone (PAZ; >120 C) to the upper part of the PAZ (60e70 C), where they appear to have resided since ~180 Ma. It is difficult to define precisely the maximum paleotemperature\nassociated with the first cooling event. Several samples show accelerated cooling during the Late Cretaceous (~100e60 Ma) and some show rapid final cooling to surface temperatures in the Neogene (since ~30 Ma).\nThe samples from the Conquista Plateau (Fig. 7b) and the adjacent areas record later initial cooling into the PAZ, sometime between 230 and 180 Ma (Late Triassic e Early Jurassic). Many of these samples record relatively rapid cooling through the AFT PAZ between ~180 and 120 Ma (Mid Jurassic e Early Cretaceous), after which cooling rates appear to decrease; several samples show accelerated final cooling to surface temperatures in the last 20 Ma.\nThe samples from the Borborema Plateau and adjacent coastal area (Fig. 7c) show a similar cooling pattern, with an initial cooling from temperatures above the AFT PAZ between ~240 and 140 Ma. Many samples from this area record rapid cooling in the Early Cretaceous (~140e90 Ma), and several show accelerated final cooling from temperatures of 60e70 C (top of the PAZ) in the last 20e40 Ma.\nThe samples from basement rocks adjacent to the Tucano Basin initially cooled from maximum paleotemperatures above 120 C at around 180 Ma and subsequently cooled rapidly to the upper levels of the AFT PAZ during Early Cretaceous times (~140e100 Ma;\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181170\nFig. 7d). The samples from the Tucano Basin sediments, which have a Tithonian-Berriasian depositional age (~145 Ma) show different amounts of post-depositional burial, corresponding to temperature increases of 20e50 C, as well as different timings of final\nexhumation: sample PTAM-15 shows very limited postdepositional burial heating, consistent with the fact that it has not been significantly reset; PTAM-16 and PTAM-34 show burial heating until 80 Ma, when they start being slowly exhumed, while\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 171\nPTAM-10 only starts being exhumed at ~40 Ma. Overall, these histories suggest burial of the samples beneath syn-rift sediments as well as the post-rift Marizal Formation, before final exhumation in Late Cretaceous e Cenozoic times, consistent with AFT data from boreholes that suggest an onset of exhumation at ~75 Ma (Japsen et al., 2012b).\nThe samples from the Mantiqueira Range and the adjacent areas (Fig. 7e) in majority record rapid cooling through the PAZ between 140 and 80 Ma (i.e. spanning most of the Cretaceous), with subsequently slower cooling rates. Many of the samples from this region also record accelerated recent cooling, since ~20 Ma, from temperatures of ~50e70 C. Samples that cooled from temperatures >60 C in the Neogene were at paleotemperatures above 120 C at ~80 Ma and therefore only record the latter part of the cooling history of this region."

    "text": "In order to provide a more synoptic view of the cooling and denudation patterns, we have combined the time-temperature\nhistories for individual samples, inferred from the thermal modeling discussed above, into spatially interpolated maps of paleotemperature and denudation at specific times in the past (Figs. 8 and 9). The paleotemperature maps were constructed by extracting the average of the “good-fit” temperature histories for all the modeled samples at specific time windows and interpolating usingArcGIS™andMove™ software (Fig. 8). Taking the temperature difference between two time slices and dividing by the geothermal gradient allows imaging the spatial pattern of denudation during a specific time interval (Fig. 9). Present-day geothermal gradients in the S~ao Francisco Craton and adjacent areas range from 18 to 26 C km 1 (Alexandrino and Hamza, 2008); on the continental margin of Brazil the geothermal gradient ranges from ~20 to 30 C km 1 (Hamza et al., 2005). Since insufficient measurements are available to assess the spatial variation in geothermal gradient, we assumed an average value of 25 C km 1. Furthermore we assumed the geothermal gradient to be constant during the time period for which we reconstructed the denudation histories.\nThis interpolation is associated with significant uncertainties, which derive from (1) the uncertainty in the inversion-derived\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181172\nthermal histories (paleotemperatures) for individual samples and (2) the uncertainty in geothermal gradient and its potential spatial and temporal variation. In order to quantify (1), Figure S3 (c.f. Supplementary Data) shows, for each time slice, the interpolated uncertainty in paleotemperature as well as maximum and minimum paleotemperatures allowable by the data (i.e. the limits to the “good fit” envelope of thermal histories for individual data points). Uncertainty (2) is much harder to quantify in the absence of data; there is, however, a very simple relationship between amount of cooling (DT), amount of denudation (Dz) and geothermal gradient (G): Dz ¼ DT/G. Thus, the uncertainty in geothermal gradient will propagate inverse-linearly into the uncertainty in the amount of denudation. Finally, we note that because the interpolation is based only on samples for which both AFT ages and track lengths were measured, it may provide an incomplete view of the denudation history. In particular, several samples in the Borborema Plateau with relatively young ages did not contain sufficient confined tracks for meaningful track-length measurements and are therefore excluded from the analysis below.\nSimilar to the AFT age patterns, the inferred denudation patterns tend to be broadly correlated with the various physiographic zones (see Figs. 1 and 2). The samples from the Sertaneja Depression cooled to below the AFT closure temperature earliest, before Late Jurassic times (~160 Ma; Fig. 8a). Samples from the western flank of the central Tucano Basin cooled rapidly between 160 and 120 Ma (Fig. 9b, c). The samples from the Borborema Plateau, Mantiqueira Range and the adjacent areas along the coastline record significant cooling during the Early Cretaceous (140e120 Ma; Fig. 8b, c); these results imply denudation of up to ~1.3 km (Fig. 9b) at a maximum time-averaged rates of ~30 m My 1. This denudation signal is conspicuously absent from the coastline along the Camamu-Almada basin, which only records limited cooling and denudation during the Early Cretaceous (140e110 Ma; Fig. 8b, c, d and 9b, c). During the Late Cretaceous to Eocene (110e40 Ma; Fig. 8d, e and 9d), the Borborema Plateau, Mantiqueira Range and adjacent areas may record up to 1.6e2.9 km of denudation, respectively. Numerous samples from the Mantiqueira Range, as well as some from the Conquista Plateau and coastal regions, remained at temperatures 60 C until Eocene times (40 Ma; Fig. 8e). The Post-Eocene denudation of the margin varies between ~300 and ~2000 m (i.e. at average rates between 7.5 and 50 m My 1), with the highest values\nencountered in the Mantiqueira Range and the coastal strip adjacent to the Jacuípe and Jequitinhonha Basins (Fig. 9e)."

    "text": "Our AFT data reveal four regionally significant phases of accelerated cooling and denudation, which variably affected different parts of the margin. Permian e Early Jurassic (~300e180 Ma) cooling is constrained by thermal models of samples situated in the Sertaneja Depression of the continental interior, west of the RTJ rift, as well as some samples from the Conquista Plateau. Widespread Early Cretaceous (~140e90Ma) cooling is observed in samples from the coastal region, spanning the S~ao Francisco Craton, Sergipano Belt and RTJ rift flanks, as well as from the Conquista Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range. Late Cretaceous (~100e60 Ma) cooling is recorded by samples from the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range. Finally, scattered samples from throughout the study region record Neogene (<30 Ma) cooling, which is most clearly indicated by samples from the coastal area and the Mantiqueira Range. Before interpreting the inferred spatial and temporal patterns of exhumation on the northern East-Brazilian margin, we first compare the inferred record of denudation with that inferred by previous thermochronological studies, by the sedimentary record in the offshore passive-margin basins and by geomorphological studies.\nThe phases of accelerated cooling and denudation recorded by our data are consistent with those inferred in previous thermochronology studies: Japsen et al. (2012) recognized several Paleozoic and Early Cenozoic cooling events, Harman et al. (1998), Cupertino (2000) and Japsen et al. (2012b) described widespread Early Cretaceous cooling, and all previous studies (Harman et al., 1998; Cupertino, 2000; Turner et al., 2008; Morais Neto et al., 2009; Japsen et al., 2012b) discussed Late Cretaceous cooling and exhumation. The latter three studies also described accelerated Neogene cooling, although the timing of onset varies between authors (40e10 Ma for Turner et al. (2008); <20 Ma for Morais Neto et al. (2009); 18e15 Ma for Japsen et al. (2012b)). The only previously described cooling phase for which we do not find evidence is the Eocene (~45 Ma) cooling discussed by Japsen et al. (2012b)."

    "heading": "6.2. Comparison with the offshore sedimentary record",
    "text": "The offshore sedimentary basins adjacent to our study area can be separated into two major groups, based on the maximum thickness of the sedimentary succession. The Espírito Santo and Mucuri basins and Sergipe and Alagoas basins, in the south and north of the studied area, respectively, present a sedimentary infill with a cumulative thickness of >10 km (Fig. 10) (Milani, 2007). The basins situated in the central region (Curumuxatiba, Jequitinhonha, Almada, Camamu and Jacuípe) contain a thinner sedimentary succession (cumulative thickness 5e7 km; Fig. 10). This is due in particular to a thinner post-rift sequence, suggesting either lower post-rift sedimentation rates or erosion of part of the post-rift sedimentary section due to Cenozoic uplift, as suggested by Japsen et al. (2012b).\nThe offshore sedimentary succession of the East-Brazilian margin is generally divided into 5 main phases (e.g. Mohriak, 2003; Milani, 2007; Mohriak et al., 2008): the pre-rift or earlyrift, syn-rift, transitional and two post-rift (or drift) phases. Below, we discuss the erosional history of the margin with respect to these different phases, by comparing the range of erosion rates for different onshore regions (calculated from the synoptic denudation histories in Fig. 9) with the offshore sedimentary fill (Fig.10).\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 173\nDuring the pre-rift phase (160e140 Ma), denudation rates are generally <20 m My 1, except locally on the ConquistaJequitinhonha Plateau and the flanks of the Tucano rift (Fig. 9a). Pre-rift (or early rift) sedimentation is recorded in the CamamuAlmada, Recôncavo, and Sergipe-Alagoas basins (Fig. 10). Kuchle et al. (2011) showed that the main transport direction for pre-rift sediments of the Almada and Camamu basins was northward. Based on paleo-current measurements, sedimentary petrography and UePb and Lu-Hf isotope analyses, Bertotti et al. (2014) confirm the northward sediment transport for the pre-rift sections of the Camamu and Alamada Basins and identify the Araçuaí Belt (Fig. 2), which composes the bedrock of theMantiqueira Range, as themain source for these sediments.\nAn important phase of denudation coincides with rifting of the margin at 140e120 Ma in both the southern (Mantiqueira Range, Conquista Plateau and adjacent areas) and northern (Borborema Plateau) regions (Fig. 9b), with denudation rates up to 30e40 m My 1 (Fig. 10). Major erosion of the southern regions can be correlated with the significant thickness (>3 km) of the rift section in the Espírito Santo and Mucuri basins (Fig. 10), which would have been supplied through the Doce River and related eastflowing rivers in the region. Similarly, the rift sections of the Jequitinhonha, Almada, and Recôncavo basins are very thick due to\nthe detrital contribution from the adjacent elevated continental margin. A main contribution from the north supplied the rift sections of the Alagoas and Sergipe basins, with estimated onshore erosion of 500e1100 m (Fig. 9b), through the S~ao Francisco River and other smaller river systems in the region. Interestingly, the Camamu basin, adjacent to the section of the margin that does not record syn-rift exhumation (Fig. 9b), does contain a 6-km thick synrift sedimentary succession, which should thus have been derived frommore distal sources. As the basin is currently supplied only by rivers draining the Conquista Plateau, this would suggest drainage rearrangement and capture during the post-rift phase.\nSignificant offshore sedimentation took place during the transitional phase (120e110 Ma; Fig. 10) while onshore erosion rates remained high in most regions with rates reaching 40e75 m My 1, except for the Sertaneja Depression (Fig. 9c). However, a significant fraction of the sediment flux during this phase consists of nondetrital (evaporitic and calcareous) sediments.\nThe post-rift I (110e40 Ma) sedimentary succession is > 5 km thick in the southern Espírito Santo andMucuri basins, as well as in the northern Sergipe basin (Fig.10). These basins are adjacent to the Mantiqueira Range and Borborema Plateau regions, respectively, which record up to 2.9 and 1.6 km, respectively, of denudation during this time period (Fig. 9d), suggesting continuous erosion of\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181174\nthe margin topography and transport of sediments through existing pathways. Japsen et al. (2012b) recorded significant Campanian erosion in the onshore Tucano and Recôncavo basins as well as in the proximal shelf area of the offshore Camamu basin. In our data as well, denudation rates are highest (10e30 m My 1) in the Tucano Basin and adjacent areas during this time.\nA similar pattern dominates the post-rift phase II (40e0 Ma), although offshore sedimentation rates are generally lower than during the preceding phase. This final sedimentary succession is thinner in the central Jequitinhonha, Almada, Camamu, and Jacuípe basins (Fig. 10), consistent with limited onshore erosion during this time. Again, both erosion and sedimentation rates appear higher in the northern (Borborema Plateau) and southern (Mantiqueira Range) regions and adjacent sedimentary basins (Sergipe-Alagoas, Mucuri, Espírito Santo), respectively. Maximum denudation rates increased in all regions (up to ~40 m My 1) except for the Tucano Basin and adjacent areas, consistent with the building out of clastic wedges in all offshore basins, suggesting increased detrital input during this time."

    "heading": "6.3. Comparison with inferences from geomorphology",
    "text": "Several previous studies have used geomorphic observations, in particular inferred regionally correlative paleo-surfaces, to construct the history of landscape evolution on the northeastern Brazilian margin (e.g., Peulvast et al., 2008), or have combined such observations with thermochronology data (e.g., Japsen et al., 2012b). Such paleo-surfaces are hypothesized to have formed close to a regional base level (generally considered to be sea-level) and thus to indicate regional uplift since their formation. This approach has been criticized previously both in general terms (e.g., Summerfield, 2000) and in the context of the evolution of the South African margin (van der Beek et al., 2002).\nFor the northeastern Brazilian margin, given the evidence for widespread and spatially variable Cenozoic denudation, varying from ~300 to ~2000m, we see few prospects for the preservation of widespread Early Cenozoic or even Cretaceous erosion surfaces, as inferred by Peulvast et al. (2008). Japsen et al. (2012b) reconcile the inferred existence of paleo-surfaces with their thermochronology data by suggesting that the northeast Brazilian margin has been repeatedly covered below a thick sedimentary succession since rifting and break-up. In more detail, they suggest that after riftrelated exhumation in the Early Cretaceous, Cretaceous sediments (of which the Marizal Formation would be a remnant) covered the margin and were removed during a first exhumation period in the Campanian (~80 Ma). Subsequent Paleogene sedimentation, erosion and uplift led to the establishment of an upper “planation surface” of inferred Oligocene age, represented by the Diamantina, Conquista and Borborema Plateaus. A final cycle of sedimentation and erosion during the Neogene would have created a lower surface of supposedly Miocene age, represented by the Sertaneja Depression, which would have been uplifted recently to its present elevation of a few hundred meters.\nAlthough the timing of the main exhumation events in the above scenario, based mainly on the thermochronology data, is consistent with that inferred here (and indeed the two AFT datasets are consistent), the intervening periods of widespread sedimentation are, in our view, not required by the data. They are based on three lines of reasoning (Japsen et al., 2012b): first, Japsen et al. (2012b) model their AFT data in terms of thermal histories that contain several heating and cooling events. Although these are consistent with the data, the inversion of thermochronological data in terms of thermal history models is notoriously non-unique (e.g., Gleadow and Brown, 2000). We therefore favor a parsimonious approach in which the simplest model that is consistent with both the AFT data and independent geological evidence is considered\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 175\nthe optimal model (e.g., Gallagher, 1995, 2012). Second, Japsen et al. (2012b) appeal to the existence of sediments that have since been eroded. There is, however, no evidence for the existence of a regionally extensive sedimentary cover; its inference is based on the occurrence of patchy outcrops of Neogene sediments close to the coastline andmore extensive Aptian-Albian sediments (Marizal Formation) within the RTJ rift. However, the Japsen et al. (2012b) model hinges on the extrapolation of these relatively restricted sedimentary outcrops over the entire Northeast Brazilian margin.\nInstead, we infer that most material eroded from the margin consisted of basement rocks rather than such a hypothetical widespread sedimentary cover. Third, the evolutionary history advocated by Japsen et al. (2012b) is based on the inferred existence of two regionally extensive paleo-surfaces, as outlined above. However, it appears that this inference is at odds with the AFT data: specifically, the Diamantina, Conquista and Borborema Plateaus, which are considered to form the once continuous upper surface, clearly record different exhumation histories. Moreover, the\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181176\nsupposedly younger Sertaneja surface is associated with older AFT ages than those encountered on the higher-elevation Conquista and Borborema Plateaus that were inferred to have been exhumed earlier.\nFinally, we are reluctant to interpret the inferred phases of exhumation directly in terms of uplift, as Japsen et al. (2012b) do. Since we question the existence of intervening phases of sedimentation, we see even less reason to appeal to transient phases of subsidence of the onshore margin. Below, we discuss the possible geodynamic mechanisms driving our inferred exhumation history."

    "heading": "6.4.2. Early Cretaceous cooling",
    "text": "This event affected the coastal region as well as the flanks of the RTJ rift, the Conquista and Borborema Plateaus, and the Mantiqueira Range. The inferred thermal histories imply substantial differences in the amount of denudation between the coastal plain and the elevated Plateaus and Mantiqueira Range during this period. The amount of denudation ranges from a minimum of ~200 m along the coast to a maximum of up to 2.5 km in the elevated regions, which yields an average long-term denudation rate estimated at 30e45 m My 1. The spatial extent of this denudational episode, as well as its timing, which coincides with the rifting stage, is consistent with the erosion of an uplifted rift shoulder. In the absence of an elevated continental interior, such erosion would lead to rapid destruction of the rift-related topography without the development of a long-lived escarpment system (e.g., Tucker and Slingerland, 1994; van Balen et al., 1995; van der Beek and Braun, 1999; Sacek et al., 2012). We suggest that this denudation event is also responsible for the initial transition from syn-rift deposition to erosion in the RTJ rift basins (e.g., Magnavita et al., 1994). This denudation event is conspicuously absent in the record of samples from the coastal region adjacent to the CamamuAlmada basin; this finding suggests the absence of an uplifted rift shoulder along this segment and, therefore, significant along-strike structural segmentation of the margin."

    "heading": "6.4.3. Late Cretaceous-Paleogene cooling",
    "text": "Several samples from the Borborema Plateau, the Tucano Basin and the Mantiqueira Range record a Late Cretaceous-Paleogene onset of cooling, or accelerated cooling during this time (Fig. 7). These samples have the youngest AFT ages in the dataset (~60e110 Ma) and although many of the samples from Borborema Plateau lack thermal history models due to the relatively low numbers of track lengths measured, their AFT ages imply cooling from temperatures above the AFT closure temperature since the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene. This timing is consistent with the offshore sedimentary record, wherein a large clastic wedge started forming in the northeastern Sergipe-Alagoas basin since the Campanian (~80 Ma), but such wedges developed only during the Oligocene (~25e30 Ma) in the other basins. Although Karner and Driscoll (1999) suggested the Campanian clastic wedge in the Sergipe-Alagoas basins records drainage reorganization and extension of the S~ao Francisco River catchment, the AFT data suggest it could also be at least partly related to increased onshore denudation of the margin.\nIt is not easy to identify a causal mechanism for the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene denudation episode. Japsen et al. (2012a, 2012b) have argued for significant post-rift uplift of the margin based on the recognition of paleo-surfaces and correlation of the sedimentary record (cf. above). In particular, Albian marine limestones in the Araripe basin (located at ~7 S, approximately 300 km to the north of the current study area) at present-day elevations of ~700e800 m, imply Late Cretaceous or Cenozoic uplift of 500e600m of that region, taking into account variations in eustatic sea level (Morais Neto et al., 2009 and references therein).\nMagnavita et al. (1994) correlated the Albian lacustrine limestones in the Jatob a basin to the marine deposits of the Araripe basin and argued that this post-rift uplift must have extended to the entire RTJ rift. We note, however, that this (widely cited; e.g., Peulvast et al., 2008; Morais Neto et al., 2009; Japsen et al., 2012a, 2012b) inference depends on the correlation and the assumedly similar initial elevation of two sparsely outcropping deposits separated by a distance of >300 km.\nNevertheless, given the evidence for post-rift uplift of the northern Brazilianmargin discussed above, it appears reasonable to relate the Late Cretaceous e Paleogene denudation of the Borborema Plateau and theMantiqueira Range to tectonic uplift. The onset of this event is not well constrained, but the offshore record in the Sergipe e Alagoas basin suggests that it started in the Campanian (~80 Ma). This timing roughly corresponds to a major reorganization in plate motions (Harman et al., 1998 and references therein) and the onset of compressional deformation in the Andes (e.g., Cobbold et al., 2007; Ramos, 2009). Local reactivation of crustalscale shear-zones may be a response to changes in stress regimes, as suggested by Harman et al. (1998), Raab et al. (2002) and Cogn e et al. (2011, 2012). However, rheological considerations imply that it is difficult to induce widespread deformation of the onshore part of a rifted margin without developing major inversion structures within the basins (e.g., Cloetingh et al., 2008) and these are not described in most of the basins offshore northeastern Brazil (except for the Camamu Basin). The inferred uplift and denudation event also roughly coincides with basic magmatism dated at 90 Ma and more extensive Early Cenozoic (~50 Ma) alkaline volcanism along the northeastern coast of Brazil (Mizusaki et al., 2002; Thomaz Filho et al., 2008), which have been associated with a hot-spot track. Ussami et al. (1999) demonstrated the existence of a geoid anomaly underlying the Borborema province and suggested the existence of density variations in the deep mantle that are most likely linked to the post-rift magmatic events in the region. Thus, the post-rift uplift of the Borborema Plateau and Mantiqueira Range may be due to isostatic effects, possibly aided by magmatic underplating (Morais Neto et al., 2009). The thermal weakening by mantle heating andmagmatismmay also have rendered this region more susceptible to compressional stresses transferred from the Andean orogeny (Cloetingh et al., 2008; Burov and Cloetingh, 2009), as has been argued for the southeastern Brazilian margin (Cobbold et al., 2001; Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012).\n6.4.4. Neogene final cooling Numerous samples from throughout the study area, in particular from the Conquista and Borborema Plateaus as well as the Mantiqueira Range, show conspicuous recent cooling (since 30e20 Ma) from temperatures of ~60e70 C to surface conditions (see Fig. 7). Such recent cooling events are well known to arise as artifacts of the numerical inversion of track-length data, in particular when using the “traditional” Laslett et al. (1987) annealing algorithm (e.g., Corrigan, 1993; Ketcham et al., 1999; Gunnell et al., 2003; Stephenson et al., 2006). Although we are well aware of this pitfall, we do place some trust in the inferred cooling histories for two reasons: first, they were predicted using the Ketcham (2005) annealing model, which was specifically designed to reduce the “recent-cooling” artifact, and used the Cl content as a constraint on the annealing kinetics of the modeled samples; second, accelerated Neogene denudation of the margin is consistent with building out of thick clastic wedges in the offshore basins.\nThe widespread Neogene cooling recorded in both this study and byMorais Neto et al. (2009) and Japsen et al. (2012b) requires a regional mechanism. Bezerra et al. (2006) review evidence for seismic activity and coastal uplift in northeastern Brazil. Uplifted marine terraces have been mapped along the Equatorial margin of\nA.R. Jelinek et al. / Journal of South American Earth Sciences 54 (2014) 158e181 179\nBrazil to the north of the study area, but not within the study region itself, and record coastal uplift rates of around 100 m My 1 during the Late Quaternary (Bezerra et al., 2006). However, we have difficulty in identifying a physically plausible mechanism for latestage uplift of the margin, as has been suggested by Japsen et al. (2012a, 2012b). Following earlier work in the Northern Atlantic (Cloetingh et al., 1990), inferred late Cenozoic uplift of the Brazilian margin has been related to transmission of intraplate stresses from the Andes (Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012; Japsen et al., 2012b), but the somewhat random spatial pattern of exhumation and the absence of offshore deformation or excess subsidence are not in favor of such a mechanism, as explained above. Shephard et al. (2010) have suggested that variations in dynamic topography have controlled the evolution of the Amazon basin during the Neogene, but the predictedmagnitudes of uplift for northeastern Brazil are limited to <100 m in their models.\nOther authors have favored a climatic origin for Neogene accelerated erosion of the northeastern Brazilian margin (Turner et al., 2008; Morais Neto et al., 2009) and elsewhere (Lavier et al., 2001; Nielsen et al., 2009). In the case of northeastern Brazil, renewed erosion could have been triggered by a transition from a tropical to a semi-arid climate in response to global Neogene climatic cooling (e.g. Zachos et al., 2001). In the Minas Gerais region, to the south of our study area, deep weathering ceased during the Late Miocene (Vasconcelos et al., 1992; Spier et al., 2006); this finding, according to these authors, reflects the transition from a tropical to a semi-arid climate and the onset of clastic deposition at the margin. Deeply weathered horizons are currently being eroded on the Diamantina Plateau surface (Japsen et al., 2012b), which suggests a similar transition from widespread in-situ chemical weathering to erosion and transport. Nevertheless, Quaternary erosion rates on the Diamantina Plateau, as measured by cosmogenic 10Be concentrations in alluvial sediments are conspicuously low (~5 m My 1; Barreto et al., 2013). Thus, the upland low-relief surfaces can be interpreted as “relict landscapes” that predate the transition fromwidespread chemical weathering to more localized erosion and relief generation and have not yet responded to the changing climate. Their different elevations do not have any chronologic significance in such an interpretation."

    "text": "From the study of the AFT, geological, and geomorphological data, it is evident that the continental margin of northeastern and eastern Brazil underwent a protracted and spatially variable history of denudation, which is only in part related to continental rifting.\nThe AFT data and models allow us to determine the timing and relative importance of four cooling/denudation episodes: Permiane Early Jurassic denudation is recorded in the samples from the S~ao Francisco Craton and the Sertaneja Depression to thewest of the RTJ rift system, followed by a second episode of cooling in the Early Cretaceous, recorded by the samples from along the coastline, the flanks of the RTJ rift, the Conquista Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range. Samples from the Borborema Plateau, theMantiqueira Range and the adjacent areas record cooling from temperatures above 120 C since the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene, whereas Neogene cooling from temperatures ~60e70 C is recorded by a subgroup of samples from throughout the study region, in particular in the Mantiqueira Range, Borborema Plateau and coastal region. Although such a late-stage cooling event is a well-known artifact of thermal historymodeling usingAFT length data, both themodeling approach used in the study and the evidence from the offshore sedimentary record provide us with confidence in this model outcome.\nThe timing of these various cooling and denudation events are broadly consistent with those inferred in and around the study area\nusing the same method by Harman et al. (1998), Turner et al. (2008), Morais Neto et al. (2009) and Japsen et al. (2012b). We associate the Permian-Early Jurassic denudation to erosion of topography that was built during the final stages of the Gondwanides orogeny, Early Cretaceous denudation to rift-shoulder erosion during the rifting and break-up of the South Atlantic, Late Cretaceous-Paleogene denudation to possible thermal-isostatic uplift and magmatic underplating of the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range, and final Neogene denudation to a transition to a more erosive semi-arid climate. Overall, the landscape evolved at a slow pace and denudation rates did not exceed ~75 m My 1 since the Mesozoic anywhere in the study area. The inferred denudation history of the margin is consistent with the sedimentary record preserved in the offshore basins. It appears, however, at odds with the inferences from geomorphologic studies based on the interpretation of regionally correlative paleo-surfaces. We interpret these upland low-relief surfaces as relict landscapes predating the Neogene transition to localized erosion of the landscape.\nOur results imply that the present-day elevated Diamantina Plateau and its escarpment were not formed during opening of the South Atlantic but instead developed well before the onset of rifting. Obtaining thermochronological data from the elevated plateau surface would be useful to better define the age of landscape evolution and scarp retreat of the Diamantina Plateau. In contrast, the onset of denudation of the coastal region, the Conquista and Borborema Plateaus, and the Mantiqueira Range appears to be controlled by rift-shoulder uplift, whereas the pattern of denudation suggests significant segmentation of the margin.\nLandscape evolution of the Brazilian continental margin is considerably more complex than predicted by simple models of continental-margin development and exhibits evidence for pre, syn- and post-rift tectonic and climatic controls. Further thermochronological studies are required to better constrain the spatial and temporal variation in the onshore denudation and the nature and rate of sediment supply to the offshore basins; future studies should also refine themodel of landscape evolution in this segment of the Brazilian continental margin. Particular emphasis should be placed on extending the dataset for the northern and eastern continental margin of Brazil to lower temperatures by the application of apatite (UeTh)/He thermochronology (e.g., Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012), combined with quantitative geomorphological tools and advanced numerical surface-process models."

  "abstractText": "We reconstruct the history of denudation and landscape evolution of the northern EastBrazilian continental margin using apatite fission-track thermochronology and thermal history modeling. This part of the Brazilian Atlantic margin is morphologically characterized by inland and coastal plateaus surrounding a wide low-lying inland region, the Sertaneja Depression. The apatite fission track ages and mean track lengths vary from 39 ± 4 to 350 ± 57 Ma and from 10.0 ± 0.3 to 14.2 ± 0.2 mm, respectively, implying a protracted history of spatially variable denudation since the Permian at relatively low rates (<50 m My 1). The Sertaneja Depression and inland plateaus record Permian-Early Jurassic (300e180 Ma) denudation that precedes rifting of the margin by > 60 Myrs. In contrast, the coastal regions record up to 2.5 km of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (150e120 Ma) denudation, coeval with rifting of the margin. The samples from elevated coastal regions, the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range, record cooling from temperatures above 120 C since the Late Cretaceous extending to the Cenozoic. We interpret this denudation as related to post-rift uplift of these parts of the margin, possibly resulting from compressional stresses transmitted from the Andes and/or magmatism at that time. Several samples from these areas also record accelerated Neogene (<30 Ma) cooling, which may record landscape response to a change from a tropical to a more erosive semi-arid climate during this time. The inferred denudation history is consistent with the offshore sedimentary record, but not with evolutionary scenarios inferred from the recognition of “planation surfaces” on the margin. The denudation history of the northeastern Brazilian margin implies a control of pre-, synand post-rift tectonic and climatic events on landscape evolution. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
