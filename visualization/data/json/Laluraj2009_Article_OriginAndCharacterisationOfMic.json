    "text": "Polar ice cores are important natural archives of paleoclimatic changes, as they indicate large variations in atmospheric dust load in association with the past climatic changes. The changing wind pattern accompanied by seasonality in circulation and biogeochemistry leads to varied depositions in the polar snow. This deposition acts as fingerprints of significant geological events such as glacial weathering, volcanic eruptions, cyclones and tsunamis (Petit et al. 1999; Laluraj et al. 2006). Some of these dust particles are exclusively of aeolian origin, where wind blows across long distance from the continents. Among them, the Vostok ice core revealed that the dust input to Antarctica was high during pleniglacial periods and low during stadials and interstadials (Petit et al. 1999). Large volcanic eruptions may also be detected in polar ice cores by the associated ash and cryptotephra particles (de Angelis et al. 1985; Palais et al. 1990; Silva and Zielinski 1998; Zielinski et al. 1997; Davis et al. 2004). Records of several past volcanic eruptions in the tropical, temperate and polar regions have been deduced from acidity and ionic measurements in ice cores from the polar regions (Zielinski et al. 1996; Clausen et al. 1997). However, the biogenic components of the aeolian particles have\nC. M. Laluraj (*) :K. P. Krishnan :M. Thamban : R. Mohan : S. S. Naik :W. D’Souza :R.

Chaturvedi Geological Survey of India (Antarctica Division), Faridabad, India\nreceived little attention, despite its known role in microbial transport (Griffin et al. 2003). The occurrence of biological material in the ice cores are of special interest because the biosphere interacts more vigorously with variations in the temperature and other environmental parameters.\nSeveral studies using Antarctic ice cores have demonstrated the ability of ice cores as an archive of random historical volcanic eruption records (Robock 2000; Zielinski et al. 1997; Zielinski 2000; Narcisi et al. 2001). Volcanic emissions lead to fallout of both gaseous aerosols and solid (tephra) components, which can travel great distances. For example, the tephra from the 1259 AD eruption of El Chichòn, Mexico was found preserved in the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps (Palais et al. 1992). Studies on tephra layers in ice cores have significantly improved our understanding of the volcanic impact on climate and their effective usage as a chronological tool. There are no detailed studies regarding the nature and chemistry of dust particles from the Central Dronning Maud Land (CDML) region of the East Antarctica. Therefore, the present attempt is to classify the different microparticles accreted in an ice core from CDML region based on their elemental composition and morphology. This information would benefit studies undertaken to resolve the origin of microparticles and their transport mechanisms involved for their distribution in the Southern Hemisphere and subsequent burial in Antarctic region."

    "text": "A 62.2 m long core (IND-22/B4) was collected from the continental ice sheet at 70°51.3′S and 11°32.2′ E, near the Tallaksenvarden nunatak of CDML region during the 22nd Indian Antarctic Expedition (Fig. 1). The drilling was carried out using an electromechanical drill system (core diameter ~10 cm) during the austral summer (February–March), 2003. The cores were sealed in frozen conditions (−20°C) to avoid physical changes as well as chemical and biological contamination. The cores were then transported to the ice core laboratory at the National Centre for Antartic and Ocean Research, Goa, India. Subsequently the cores were processed and sub-sampled at −15°C facility. As a precaution to avoid contamination, we collected only the inner part of ice core samples,\nwhich were melted in a class 100 clean room before chemical and biological analysis. Major soluble ions such as sulphate (SO2 4 ) and sodium (Na\n+) were measured from the thawed samples using ion chromatographic techniques. The chromatographic analysis was carried out in Dionex™ ICS-2500 system equipped with automated EG50 Eluent Generator Module and a CD25 conductivity detector. Detailed analytical setup, procedures and the analytical precision are provided in Thamban et al. (2006). Chronology of the core was obtained by volcanic stratigraphy using the non-sea-salt sulphate records (Thamban et al. 2006).\nBased on the chronology constructed for the core, samples were selected from five discrete depth intervals, representing volcanic events. The selected samples from 0.5, 2.5, 9.4, 19.5 and 41.7 m revealed signatures of major volcanic events during 1991, 1963, 1883, 1815 and 1600 A.D (Thamban et al. 2006). Among these, two intervals of recent and well known volcanic eruptions of Agung (1963) and Karkatau (1883) were studied in detail to decipher the microbial cells attached to volcanic particles. About 50 ml of the melted samples were filtered in a Class 100 clean room at room temperature using 0.22 μm track-etched membrane filter paper, following the clean procedures. Thereafter, a small portion of the filter was dried and platinum-coated for 30–40 s in a\nJEOL JFC-100 auto fine sputter coater. The shorter periods were selected to minimize the induction of ‘bacteria-looking’ artifacts (Folk and Lynch 1997). The SEM was tuned to get optimal resolution as high as 43000X. The JEOL JSM –6360LV microscope was used at a closer working distance (~10 mm) with voltage range between 10–25 kV. The preliminary\nsemi-quantitative major elemental analysis (area average) was carried out using energy dispersive spectroscopy (OXFORD INCA 200), attached to the JEOL 6360 LV SEM."

    "text": "The sulphate concentration in the ice core depends on the deposition from sea spray or crustal sources (Maupetit and Delmas 1992; Cole-Dai et al. 2000), atmospheric oxidation of dimethyl-sulphide (DMS) emitted by the marine phytoplanktons (Saltzman 1995; Prospero et al. 1991) and volcanic eruptions emitting millions of tons of sulphur compounds into the atmosphere (Legrand and Mayewski 1997). The nonsea-salt sulphate in the ice core was estimated using the formula nssSO2 4 ¼ SO2 4 0:252 Naþð Þ. The maximum biogenic sulphate background for the core was estimated at 125 ppb, considering all the possible sources (Thamban et al. 2006; Fig. 2). The present study has focused on the evaluation of different particles that were deposited at the selected volcanic horizons identified within the ice core and their possible provenance. These microparticles which included siliceous, carbonaceous and certain biological forms are either attached or dropped on the surface of siliceous particles. The detailed study of the particles present on the ice core is given below.\nSiliceous particles\nThe silica-rich particles (>50% SiO2) are grouped in this category. The SEM observations indicate that samples are composed of morphologically distinct particles that have either smooth or rough surfaces (Fig. 3). The smooth particles resembled glass shards with sharp features, whereas the rough particles\nappear to have undergone weathering during their transport. The major elemental chemistry by EDS is given at Table 1. The mean percentage composition (major elements) of smooth particle (SiO2 61.7, Al2O3 18.1, FeO 2.3, Na2O 7.4, K2O 0.25 and CaO 3.5) is different from the one with that of rough surface (SiO2 56.3, Al2O3 20.1, FeO 0.9, Na2O 4.2, K2O 0.4 and CaO 7.9). This variability could be due to an intrinsic feature derived from their provenance or reworking during transport. The chemical composition and morphology revealed that the smoothsurfaced particles are homogeneous as compared to the rough-surfaced particles and their formation may be attributed to fragmentation of quenched magma as a result of quick chilling during hydration (Heiken 1972). The particles containing high silica and resembling glass shards could be the primary fallout of volcanic eruptions (Bjorck et al. 1991; Narcisi et al. 2005; Pattan et al. 2002), where as the particles having rough surface indicates signatures of weathering and transport from the continental dust. This is further substantiated by a ternary plot of smooth and rough particles with CaO, FeO and K2O as end members showing a distinct difference in composition, thereby suggesting its difference in provenance through volcanic and continental dust (Fig. 4). The volcanic particles (tephra) at the site are stratospherically transported, whereas the crustal dust particles could be wind transported. The dust records in an ice core from the Antarctic Peninsula revealed that the\ncrustal dust had doubled during in 20th century compared to the previous century and related it to the enhanced desertification of the Patagonia and northern Argentina (McConnell et al. 2007). Considering, the proximity of Antarctic Peninsula and the prevailing wind pattern, it is practical to arrive at such conclusion. However, no such increased input of the dust material was found at the ice core site during the past few hundred years. It is therefore opined that the micro dust particles observed here might have a local source in the ice-free areas of Schumacher Oasis and the Tallaksenvarden nunatak.\nThe SEM images of the siliceous particles from at 2.5 and 9.4 m depth of the ice core showed the presence of certain microbial cells (clusters as well as isolated) of different shapes (cocci and rods) and sizes\n(micron and sub micron) adhered onto the volcanic particles (Fig. 5a). The chronological constraints obtained from this core revealed that the depths of 2.5 and 9.4 m represent periods of eruptions from the\nAgung Volcano in 1963 and the Karkatau Volcano in 1883, respectively (Fig. 2). Extremely small size of coocoid cells (~180 nm) and rods of microbial cells (~70×250 nm) were also seen adhered to the volcanic\ndust (tephra) trapped in accreted ice (Fig. 5b and c). Microbial attachments to surface of substratum is a well-established mechanism for survival and sustainability of life in the frozen environments since these dusts have an important role in changing ecosystems by feeding, sheltering and limiting biological activities (Fung et al. 2000; Deming and Baross 2000; Carpenter et al. 2000; Rothchild and Mancinelli 2001). Nano-scale objects are hypothesized as fossilized microbes, both in terrestrial and extra-terrestrial rocks, including Martian meteorite ALH84001 (McKay et al. 1996) and Tataouine meteorite (Benzerara et al. 2003). The occurrence of nano bacteria (Fig. 5b) in conjunction with microbes (Fig. 5d) in our samples suggests that the former may not be a fossilized form; rather it is a unique group with their morphologies bearing relationship to the extreme environments. It is also possible that these nanobes and microbes got adhered to the volcanic dust during their transport within the atmosphere or while deposition of particles. Nanobes are documented for their role in altering the geochemistry of volcanic particles (Folk and Rasbury 2002). These tiny living entities together with the particles on which they are adhered, could provide a significant micro-niche in accreted ice, hitherto thought.\nCarbonaceous particles\nThe EDS analysis showing particles rich in carbon are represented as carbonaceous particles. These particles are further classified into two groups; one enriched in both carbon and calcium (Fig. 6a) and the other containing 100% carbon (purely organic; Fig. 6b and c). Several of these forms found in this study clearly resembled the anomalous form reported by NASA scientists from Vostok ice cores (http://science.msfc. nasa.gov), although a detailed analysis is required to identify their origin and implications. These bodies do not represent any individual microbes, but might have been derived from organic detritus or pieces of larger multi-cellular organisms. Some of the strange forms resembling cotton balls or coiled coir do not represent a new organism, instead their age and habit might have resulted in their unusual shapes. The ice core may represent biological forms such as fungi, Bacteria, algae or diatoms. More detailed investigations could throw light into the importance of environmental changes in the distribution of these particles."

    "text": "The SEM–EDS studies of micro-particles and presence of anomalous sulphate in the ice core supports their origin from volcanic eruptions and could be useful as a stratigraphic marker horizons. The continental dust particles observed in the ice core at certain intervals could suggest local inputs from icefree areas and nunatak related to the prevailing wind pattern. The characterisation of the accreted particles in the ice by morphological and chemical means provide preliminary information on the origin and mechanism by which these particles are transported to Antarctica. We report here that tephra related to Agung (1963) and Karkatau (1883) volcanic eruptions harbor microbial cells (both cocci and rods). It appears that a plethora of microscopic and sub microscopic living entities with peculiar adaptive strategies are often entrapped in the ice. The geochemical signature revealed by volcanic and continental dust particles could be extended to minor and major elements, thereby allowing more accurate evaluation of their provenance.\nAcknowledgement We thank the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India for the financial support.

The morphology and major element chemistry of the particles suggest their origin from either volcanic eruptions or continental dust. The EDS analysis revealed that the volcanic particles are enriched in silica (average SiO2 62%), compared to the continental dust particle (average SiO2 56%).
