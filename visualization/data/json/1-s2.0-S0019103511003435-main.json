[2001]. Icarus 150, 19–37) to study the interaction between interior dynamics and atmosphere thermal evolution. The coupling between atmosphere and interior occurs through mantle degassing and the effect of varying concentrations of the greenhouse gas H2O on the surface temperature. Exospheric loss of hydrogen to space is accounted for as a H2O sink. The surface temperature enters the mantle convection model as a boundary condition.\nOur results suggest a self-consistent feedback mechanism between the interior and the atmosphere resulting in spatial–temporal surface renewal. Greenhouse warming of the atmosphere results in an increase in the surface temperature. Whenever the surface temperature reaches a critical value, the viscosity difference across the lithosphere becomes smaller than about 105 and the surface becomes locally mobile. The critical surface temperature depends on the activation energy for mantle creep, the stress exponent in the non-Newtonian mantle rheology law, and the mantle temperature. Surface renewal together with surface lava flow may explain why the surface of Venus is young on average, i.e. not older than a few hundred million years.\nThe mobilization of the near-surface lithosphere increases the rate of heat removal from the mantle and thereby the interior cooling rate. The enhanced cooling results in a reduction of the water outgassing rates. As a consequence of decreasing water concentrations in the atmosphere, the surface temperature decreases. Our model calculations suggest that Venus should have been geologically active until recently. This is in agreement with several lines of observational evidence from thermal emissivity measurements and crater distribution analyses.\n2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n1. Introduction time as greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere by vol-\nThe thermal evolution of a terrestrial planet involves heat transfer from the interior by convection (Schubert et al., 2002; Turcotte and Schubert, 2002), volcanism, and chemical differentiation. On one-plate planets like Mars, convection takes place below a stagnant upper layer and most of the heat is transported via conduction through this layer. On Earth, convection incorporates the surface layers through plate tectonics which results in the interior being cooled more efficiently than in the case of stagnant lid convection (e.g. Schubert et al., 2002). Plate tectonics can be regarded as a specific form of mobile lid convection where the mobile lid being mechanically stiff moves across the surface of the mantle as (several, distinct) plates. The climatic evolution of a planet is mainly controlled by the solar flux and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The latter may change significantly over\nll rights reserved.\ncanic outgassing, leading to an increase in surface temperature. High surface temperatures may reduce the plate-like behaviour of the lithosphere – by making it more ductile – as was suggested for Venus by Lenardic et al. (2008), which in turn influences the climate since plate tectonics can recycle atmospheric CO2 into the mantle. Higher surface temperatures may also result in an increase in mantle temperature and a corresponding increase in partialmelting and outgassing rates.\nPhillips et al. (2001) investigated the coupling effect of the surface temperature on mantle dynamics for Venus by using simple parameterized convection models. They considered the outgassing of the greenhouse gas H2O using a gray atmosphere model (Wildt, 1966; Sagan, 1969). Their model revealed a positive feedback mechanism: an increase in surface temperature leads to an increase in partial melting and hence an increase in atmospheric density and surface temperature. This triggers a positive runaway effect, which destabilizes the climate of the planet. The mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nParameterized models are limited by their inability to adapt the convective regime (e.g. stagnant lid, mobile lid, plate tectonics) to changing boundary conditions such as the surface temperature, and because there is no lateral variation e.g. in lid thickness or convective stress. Whereas average lid thickness is self-consistently calculated during a parameterized thermal evolution calculation as long as the surface is in a stagnant-lid regime, transitions from a stagnant-lid to a locally mobile regime cannot be simulated. This limitation does not exist in 2D or 3D interior models which simulate fully convective mantle behaviour, so that the feedback mechanism might be different than illustrated in Fig. 1.\nFor the work presented in this paper we use the spherical convection simulation code GAIA (Hüttig and Stemmer, 2008) to which we added an atmosphere module that uses the digitized average surface temperature from Bullock and Grinspoon (2001) (their Fig. 6) as a function of the water vapour concentration in the atmosphere. We modify these surface temperatures for varying solar luminosities following Gough (1981). It is widely accepted that the solar luminosity has increased by about 40% in the past 4.5 Gyr. The concentration of water in the atmosphere is calculated from the mantle outgassing rate while employing observed exospheric loss rates. The influence of mantle outgassing on the atmosphere as well as the feedback effect on the interior through the surface temperature can then be calculated self-consistently.\nVenus is a particularly good candidate to which to apply such a model. Venus today has a surface temperature of about 740 K, which is too high for liquid water to exist on the surface. The temperature is caused mainly by the greenhouse gases CO2 and H2O (Lewis, 2004; Grinspoon, 1993; Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001) of which H2O is particularly effective with relatively small variations in concentrations having significant effects on the temperature as\ndemonstrated by the models of Pollack (1969), Pollack et al. (1980) and Bullock and Grinspoon (2001).\nAnother singular characteristic of Venus is the age of its surface, which is 300 Myr to 1 Gyr on average (McKinnon et al., 1997; Schaber et al., 1992; Strom et al., 1994). Romeo and Turcotte (2010) investigated the number and distribution of impact craters as well as the proportion of modified craters, concluding that these might indicate a catastrophic resurfacing event. In their model they assumed a gradual decrease in volcanic activity, so that about 40% of the surface would have been resurfaced in the last 750 Myr. Other studies (Schaber et al., 1992; Strom et al., 1994) identify a catastrophic resurfacing event, followed by much-reduced resurfacing activity.\nFor such a (possibly episodic) catastrophic global resurfacing event, several geodynamical explanations have been proposed so far. The event could have been exclusively magmatic (Reese et al., 1999), or caused by lithosphere thickening leading to episodic subduction and mantle overturn (Schubert et al., 1997; Fowler and O’Brian, 1996; Turcotte et al., 1999; Turcotte, 1993), or by a depleted layer on top of the mantle sinking down due to negative thermal buoyancy (Parmentier and Hess, 1992). Another explanation considers phase transitions in the mantle, which might lead to prolonged layered convection. At some point, however, a transition from layered to whole-mantle convection might occur, giving rise to a catastrophic resurfacing event (Steinbach et al., 1993). Further potential explanations include a cessation of plate tectonics 500 Myr ago (Schubert et al., 1997, 2002) or even episodic brittle mobilization due to a higher friction coefficient compared to Earth (Moresi and Solomatov, 1998; Stein et al., 2010). Basilevsky and Head (1998) explain geological features at the surface by compression and tension caused by variations in surface temperature over several hundred Myr but do not entirely rule out plate tectonics to be the cause of these features at an earlier stage of evolution.\nEven on Earth, where plate tectonics is active, a large proportion of the surface – the continental crust – is several billion years old. We know from Magellan data that on Venus, too, some surface features (tessera terrains (Ivanov and Head, 1996)) seem to be much older than the mean values mentioned above (e.g. Hansen and López, 2010) and may even be comparable in age to Earth’s continental crust. These investigations support another resurfacing history in which small patches are resurfaced at different times (Phillips et al., 1992; Phillips and Hansen, 1998; Guest and Stofan, 1999); features like coronae and plains basins seem to be much younger than the crustal plateaus. Consequently, catastrophic resurfacing seems less likely but cannot be ruled out. However, as these areas are quite small it is not possible to estimate their age reasonably by the crater counting method (Hauck et al., 1998; Hansen, 2000).\nSmrekar et al. (2010) interpreted VIRTIS emissivity data as indicating recent volcanism on Venus and argued for gradual resurfacing. Recent volcanism in the last tens of Myr is also needed to explain the high concentration of SO2 in the atmosphere (Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001). Stofan et al. (2005) conclude in their study that two thirds of the venusian surface is covered by volcanic material (e.g. coronae or large volcanoes) while one third has no identifiable source. These plains are interpreted as having a volcanic source but might as well be of different (unknown) origin.\nToday, a highly sluggish or stagnant-lid regime is thought to prevail on Venus (Schubert et al., 1997; Nimmo and McKenzie, 1998). When surface temperatures were much higher in the past, Venus might have had a mobile surface, however. Reese et al. (1999) estimated that surface temperatures must exceed a critical value of about 1000 K to allow a transformation from a stagnantlid to a global mobile regime. Higher surface temperatures than today – in the range of 850–1000 K – have been suggested by Phillips and Hansen (1998) and Ruiz (2007) to explain the formation of\nribbon terrains, assuming a dry diabase rheology. It should be mentioned, however, that results may be different when assuming a more felsic composition instead (Mueller et al., 2008). When trying to understand the thermal evolution of Venus it is hence crucial to adapt models of the interior dynamics to varying surface temperatures.\nInstead of using fixed surface temperatures for our 2D and 3D spherical mantle convection model, we varied the surface temperature using the results of Bullock and Grinspoon (2001) adapted for varying values of the solar luminosity (Gough, 1981). We thus selfconsistently obtain local resurfacing events (including the recycling of surface material back into the interior due to a local mobile regime) caused by elevated surface temperatures during Venus’ evolution. This is a possible explanation of the young average age of the surface, which is also supported by the recent observations of Venus Express (Smrekar et al., 2010). We obtain widespread resurfacing by volcanism and local surface mobilization and decreasing gradual resurfacing after that. Furthermore, we obtain small patches of the surface older than 1 Gyr (up to more than 3 Gyr) as suggested by Hansen and López (2010) and recent resurfacing as suggested by Smrekar et al. (2010). The average surface age is up to some hundreds of million years in our models but greatly depends on the parameter set used. Enhanced mantle cooling by surface mobilization causes a gradual decrease of volcanism while Venus’ mantle has been partially depleted of volatiles. Hence, present day volcanism could still act as an H2O source which would explain the high amount of water vapour (and other greenhouse gases) in the present-day atmosphere, see also Taylor and Grinspoon (2009). The present paper provides an explanation why resurfacing due to volcanism and mobilization decreases gradually over time and acts locally."

    "text": "Mantle dynamics is treated by simulating convection in a spherical shell, where we assume an olivine-dominated rheology and an iron-rich core thermally coupled to the mantle shell. We use a 2D/ 3D spherical simulation code that includes partial melting (Plesa and Breuer, 2010) to model mantle degassing; the formation of a chemically distinct crust is, however, neglected.\nHeat produced in the mantle by radioactive decay and primordial heat stored in the interior is transported to the surface by convection. Rising mantle material melts in the upper mantle by decompression melting. This melt is enriched with H2O volatiles. Once it has risen to the surface, the greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, causing increases in density, partial pressures, and surface temperatures. No recycling of volatiles is considered in the model. The calculation of the amount of partial melt and of volatiles released into the atmosphere is described in Section 2.2.\nWe compare two model setups after Phillips et al. (2001), a coupled version and an uncoupled model. In the coupled model (see also Noack, 2009), the surface temperature from the atmosphere model is used as a thermal boundary condition for the mantle convection model. In the uncoupled model, atmospheric surface temperatures are derived but the surface temperature in the mantle convection model is taken constant at 737 K. Thereby, it can be investigated how changes in the atmosphere temperature affect interior dynamics and vice versa."

The dissipation number depends on thermal expansivity am, gravity acceleration g, mantle thickness D, and heat capacity of the mantle Cp,m, and is assumed to be constant in the mantle.\nWe use the standard non-dimensionalization factors and Rayleigh numbers employed in mantle convection simulations (e.g. Christensen, 1984):\nT 0 ¼ T T0 DT ; T 00 ¼ T0 DT ; z0 ¼ z D ; v 0 ¼ v jm=D ; t0 ¼ t D2=jm ; p0 ¼ p gref jm=D 2 ; g 0 ¼ g gref ; Ra ¼ qmgamDTD 3\njmgref ; RaQ ðtÞ ¼\nqmgamHðtÞD 5\nkmjmgref ð4Þ\nwhere DT is the temperature contrast across the mantle, z the depth, jm the thermal diffusivity in the mantle, and qm the mantle density. km represents thermal conductivity and H the volumetric rate of heat generation by radioactive decay (see Eq.

(5)). The non-dimensional parameters for viscosity are:\nE0 ¼ E RDT ; V 0 ¼ VqmgD RDT ; _e0ref ¼ _eref jm=D2 ð7Þ\nWe define a reference viscosity of 1021 Pa s at a reference temperature of 1600 K and a reference depth of 100 km (Karato and Wu, 1993). We assume a constant reference strain rate of 10 16 1/s to be used in Eq. (5) and for the definition of our reference viscosity.\nThe thermal evolution of Venus is simulated for 4.5 Gyr, during which the heat production rate decays over time, depending on the decay constant k (Schubert et al., 2002),\nHðtÞ ¼ H0 expð ktÞ ð8Þ\nThe core cools depending on the average heat flux qCMB at the CMB,\n@TCMB @t ¼ qCMBAc qcCp;cVc ; qCMB ¼ km @T @z\nCMB\n: ð9Þ\nHere, Ac is the surface area and Vc the volume of the core; qc is the core density and Cp,c the specific heat capacity of the core. The average core heat flux qCMB is calculated by laterally averaging the local heat flux into the mantle at the core–mantle boundary.\nWe use free-slip boundary conditions at the core–mantle boundary and at the surface. The initial temperature profile is defined on the basis of the initial mantle temperature Tm,ini, see Table 2, and two boundary layers (Buske, 2006). The surface temperature of the initial profile (non-dimensional T0 = 0) depends on solar luminosity and initial concentration of water in the atmosphere. The initial temperature profile increases in the upper 20% of the mantle to the initial mantle temperature in a sine function. In the lowermost 30% of the mantle, the temperature increases further, again in a sine function, until the core–mantle temperature of initially 4000 K (T0 = 1) is reached. In our 3D model we use a radial resolution of 32 shells with 1024 points per shell; the 2D model uses 64 shells of 584 points each.\nWe define the surface as locally mobilized if convective heat transport from the mantle to the surface is more efficient than heat conduction. We use the Peclet number, Pe, defined as the ratio between the energy transported by convection and diffusion,\nPe :¼ vD j j ~v rTj jjr2Tj\nð10Þ\nIf the Peclet number is greater than one, local mobilization of the surface occurs. For Venus, a Peclet number of one corresponds to a convective velocity of only 10 5 m/yr. For Peclet numbers around one the flow is highly sluggish. To distinguish between the sluggish and the mobile regime, we assume for our investigations the transition to occur at a Peclet number of 100 (corresponding to 1 mm/yr).\nTo determine the effectiveness of surface recycling, we trace surface mobilization using a double-diffusive solver. We consider a near-surface layer with a thickness of 50 km and assign it a virtual composition of 1.0, whereas the initial mantle composition is 0.0. We then solve for the concentration field but do not consider any feedback to temperature or convective velocity, i.e. tracking the virtual composition is a post-processing step. During the thermal evolution, mobilization of the surface can lead to mixing with the mantle and a change of the virtual composition of the mantle. (Note that the surface layer concentration is always set to 1.) The effectiveness of recycling can be measured with the surface recycling factor defined as srf ¼ jCj jC0 jjC0 j , where |C0| is the initial volume-averaged concentration and |C| is the volume-averaged concentration after 4.5 Gyr. For instance, a value of srf = 1 suggests that the entirety of one surface layer volume has been recycled with the mantle during 4.5 Gyr. Large srf factors do not necessarily imply global and large scale resurfacing as multiple local recycling can occur at the same location but at different times. Furthermore, as a consequence of the double diffusive approach to trace the surface layer, small non-zero srf-values have always to be expected due to numerical virtual diffusion of the compositional field."

    "text": "The surface temperature of Venus is obtained using the results of Bullock and Grinspoon (2001). Their model considers the variation of H2O in the atmosphere, including associated albedo changes and cloud effects, and uses the present-day concentrations of CO2 and SO2 as well as the present-day luminosity. Note, that the\nmodel by Bullock and Grinspoon (2001) also calculates variations in SO2 for constant H2O. We consider the effect of H2O, only.\nFor the determination of the surface temperature, Bullock and Grinspoon (2001) used a nongray radiative-convective atmosphere model. In the lower, convective layer the temperature decreases with height along an adiabat. The upper, radiative temperature profile depends amongst others on the effective temperature Te, i.e. the temperature at which the planet would uniformly radiate as a black body. The effective temperature relates to the solar flux S0 according to\nTe ¼ 1 A\n4r S0\n1=4\nð11Þ\nwhere r is the Stefan–Boltzman constant and A the mean albedo of the planet’s surface (e.g. Marshall and Plumb, 2008). Considering the variation in the luminosity of the Sun, which increased over the last 4.5 Gyr by about 40% (Gough, 1981), we obtain the surface temperature as a function of time and water concentration aH2O using the relation\nT0ðt;aH2OÞ ¼ T0ð4:5 Gyr;aH2OÞ TeðtÞ\nTeð4:5 GyrÞ\n¼ T0ð4:5 Gyr;aH2OÞ S0ðtÞ\nS0ð4:5 GyrÞ\n1=4 ð12Þ\nThe surface temperature at time t is therefore calculated from the present-day surface temperature T0 (4.5 Gyr, aH2O) taken from Bullock and Grinspoon multiplied by the ratio between the effective temperature at time t and at present. This simplified relation implies that albedo changes and cloud effects do not directly depend on luminosity. We assume a linear increase of the luminosity over time in the present study but we have verified that a more complicated functional representation of the general trend using exponential or hyperbolical functions would not affect the results in significant ways.\nThe surface temperature for present-day Venus by Bullock and Grinspoon (2001) depending on the atmospheric water concentration is shown in Fig. 2. It should be noted that the maximum present-day surface temperature of Venus following Bullock and Grinspoon (2001) is about 920 K (considering only variations in H2O). According to Eq. (12), the maximum surface temperature\nfor early Venus would have been smaller than this value due to the lower luminosity back in time.\nIn addition to the outgassing from the planet interior as a source of the greenhouse gas H2O, atmospheric loss must be considered. The exospheric escape of hydrogen is due to an electric-field flow of ions and solar wind, chemical processes like the charge exchange between hot H+ ions and neutral hydrogen, and the collision of neutral H atoms with hot O atoms (Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001; Lewis, 2004). It can be modelled as an exponentially decreasing function of time with a characteristic lifetime sH2O. The present-day lifetime of water sH2O in the venusian atmosphere has been estimated between 15 and 170 Myr (Lewis, 2004; Grinspoon, 1993; Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001; Taylor and Grinspoon, 2009). However, the lifetime may have been much shorter in the early evolution of Venus due to the smaller solar luminosity (Lammer et al., 2006). For simplicity, we assume a constant lifetime of water but vary its value (15 Myr, 50 Myr and 95 Myr) to account for uncertainties.\nThe following equations show how the concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere is calculated over time. The time steps as well as the characteristic lifetime of water are non-dimensionalized and scaled like time in the convection model; see Eq. (4). The concentration of water at time step n (and hence its partial pressure in the atmosphere) can be calculated from the mass of water vapour DQ nH2O (in kg) released by extrusive volcanism in every time step k.\naH2Oðt0nÞ ¼ aH2O;ini exp tn\ns0H2O ! þ Xn k¼1 DQ kH2O Matm exp t 0n t0k s0H2O ! :\nð13Þ\nHere, aH2O;ini stands for the initial water concentration in the atmosphere and Matm for atmospheric mass. Eq. (13) differs from Phillips et al. (2001) inasmuch as it considers additions to the atmospheric water inventory from all time steps. To calculate the concentration at time step n we add up additions from every prior time step multiplied by the exospheric loss function.\nFor very small exospheric escape times like that of water, numerical problems may arise when Eq. (13) is used for aH2O(t0\nn). To avoid that problem, we solve Eq. (13) recursively:\naH2Oðt0nÞ ¼ aH2Oðt0n 1Þ exp t0n 1 t0n\ns0H2O\n! þ\nDQ nH2O Matm : ð14Þ\nTo obtain DQ nH2O, the non-dimensional mass of partial melt in the mantle is calculated from the mantle temperature at every grid point T 0i. It is widely accepted that when partial melting occurs, 1– 3 wt.% of the melt are retained in the mantle (e.g. Fraeman and Korenaga, 2010); we use a value of 1 wt.% here. The remainder of the melt is immediately removed from the mantle (see also e.g. Xie and Tackley, 2004). The melt fraction is taken to increase linearly between the solidus Tsolidus and liquidus Tliquidus and is calculated at every grid point i:\nF 0ni;melt ¼ max T 0i T 0 i;solidus\nT 0i;liquidus T 0 i;solidus\n0:01;0 ( ) : ð15Þ\nWhen the melt is removed, the solidus is increased to the current temperature in the cell volume under consideration.\nThe chosen solidus and liquidus curves are Earth-like and depend on pressure p. In the upper mantle (where p < 15 GPa), the curves are taken from de Smet (1999),\nTsolidus ¼ 1409:15 Kþ 134:2 K GPa p 6:581 K GPa2 p2\nþ 0:1054 K GPa3 p3\nTliquidus ¼ 2035:15 Kþ 57:46 K GPa p 3:487 K GPa2 p2\nþ 0:0769 K GPa3 p3\nð16Þ\nIn the lower mantle (i.e. p > 15 GPa), we use a second-order fit of the solidus curve obtained by laboratory experiments (Zerr et al., 1998), where the solidus temperature was estimated to be about 2300 K at a pressure of 15 GPa, 3500 K at 60 GPa, and 4300 K at the CMB of the Earth. The liquidus curve is taken to be solidus-like with a temperature increased by 75 K, which corresponds to the temperature difference at 15 GPa (de Smet, 1999),\nTsolidus ¼ 1775:74 Kþ 36:769 K GPa p 0:134 K GPa2 p2 Tliquidus ¼ 1850:74 Kþ 36:769 K\nGPa p 0:134 K GPa2 p2\nð17Þ\nThe amount of partial melt is now determined by totalling the cell volumes V 0i of the grid points i, where the solidus curve is exceeded, multiplied by the melt fraction F 0ni;melt .\nThe non-dimensional quantity of water removed from the mantle at time step n is\nDQ 0nH2O ¼ C 0n H2O C0extr X\ni\nV 0iðt0nÞvi;Fmelt ð18Þ\nwhere vi;Fmelt is one if melt occurred in grid cell i (i.e. if F 0n i;melt > 0) and zero otherwise. The following assumptions have been made to derive Eq. (18): (1) Only extrusive volcanism can contribute to the release of volatiles. The amount of extrusive volcanism is assumed to be C0extr ¼ 10% (Crisp, 1984; Bullock and Grinspoon, 1996; Reese et al., 2007). (2) The partition coefficient of water and carbon dioxide between silicate and melt is zero, i.e. all volatiles in a partially molten cell volume are enriched in the melt. (3) The amount of water in the mantle C0nH2O decreases over time due to continuous water depletion by degassing.\nAs a consequence of the water depletion in the mantle, dehydration can lead to an increase of the mantle viscosity. To consider the effect of dehydration stiffening, we use the formulation by Fraeman and Korenaga (2010) and assume a viscosity increase of 100 between wet and dry mantle material. The mantle is homogeneously mixed instead of considering a depleted upper mantle (Solomatov and Zharkov, 1990). The amount of water in the mantle can then be calculated from\nC0nH2O :¼ C 0n 1 H2O 1 C 0extr X\ni\nV 0iðt0nÞvi;Fmelt ! =V 0mantle \" # ð19Þ\nwhere V 0mantle denotes the non-dimensional volume of the entire mantle.\nTo obtain the surface temperature, the total amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is needed. For the 2D runs, the mass of outgassed water obtained from a 2D mantle convection model has to be scaled with\nDQ3D;nH2O ¼ DQ 2D;n H2O 4ðr03p r3c Þ 3ðr02p r02c Þ\nð20Þ\nwhile for the 3D models the calculated mass of outgassed water per time step can be directly used. After applying Eq. (14), the surface temperature can be obtained from Eq. (12)."

    "text": "The parameters used for reference simulations of both setups, i.e. the coupled and the uncoupled model, are summarized in Table 1. Earth-like parameters have mostly been used to model the interior dynamics (Davies, 1999; Karato and Wu, 1993; Breuer, 2009), and Venus-like parameters were used in the atmosphere model (Phillips et al., 2001). Parameters that are unknown and/or influence the results significantly have been varied (see Table 2) and we performed in total 32 runs, i.e. we calculated 16 coupled and 16 uncoupled cases. In most runs, i.e. 26, we used 2D geometry and for 6 runs 3D geometry.\nAmong the varied parameters is the initial mantle temperature after accretion and core formation, which is not known, and the reference viscosity. The initial mantle temperature has been varied between 1400, 1700 and 2000 K and the reference viscosity, which depends on the mantle composition, between 1021 and 1022 Pa s. In some of the cases dehydration of the mantle has been considered, leading to higher reference viscosities with time, see Section 2.2. The initial amount of volatiles in the atmosphere has been varied as well; it is either zero or the present-day level in the venusian atmosphere of 30 ppmw (de Bergh et al., 1995; Phillips et al., 2001; Taylor and Grinspoon, 2009). We also varied the initial concentration of H2O in the mantle from a moderate value of 50 ppmw H2O (Morgan and Anders, 1980) to a reduced value of 20 ppmw H2O and an increased value of 100 ppmw H2O. The lifetime of water sH2O has been varied as well between 15, 50 and 95 Myr (Lewis, 2004; Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001; Taylor and Grinspoon, 2009).\nThe key output parameters of our calculations are listed in Table 3 for all models. These are the maximum surface velocities and surface temperatures during the entire evolution, the present-day values of the maximum surface velocity, surface temperature, the mean mantle temperature, the concentration of water in the atmosphere, the amount of water left in the mantle in ppmw and per cent, the surface recycling factor, as well as the maximal and mean surface age."

    "text": "The coupled interior and atmosphere model shows that an increase in surface temperature leads not only to an increase of partial melt in the mantle; it also strongly influences the style of mantle convection and the surface tectonic regime. In Figs. 3 and 4 we compare the coupled and uncoupled model in our reference 2D calculation (see Table 1; Case 1 in Table 2) at 2.2 Gyr. When the surface temperature reaches a critical value (which is not a constant value (Reese et al., 1999) but depends on the mantle rheology and temperature and will be discussed below) in the coupled model, convection turns from a stagnant-lid into a mobile-lid-like regime. The transition can be explained by the fact that the viscosity contrast over the upper mantle (gsurf/gmantle) is locally reduced to a value smaller than about 105 – the viscosity contrast required for stagnant-lid convection to occur (Solomatov and Moresi, 1996). In Fig. 3b, which shows the velocity slice for the coupled model, convection cells reach the surface and mobilize it. In Fig. 4, viscosity and velocity profiles are compared for two cuts through the mantle that are indicated by white lines (A and B) in Fig. 3b. Profile A, where no mobilization of the surface occurs, shows a viscosity contrast between the smallest viscosity value to the surface value of 1.1 105. In profile B the contrast is only 4.2 104. As this does not satisfy the criterion for a stagnant-lid regime, mobilization takes place at the surface. This effect cannot be observed when the surface temperature is uncoupled from the mantle convection model, i.e. when a constant surface temperature of 737 K is applied during the evolution (Fig. 3a). The smallest viscosity contrast for the uncoupled model at 2.2 Gyr is 3.2 105, hence the flow remains in the stagnant-lid regime at all times and surface velocities are zero or at least very small.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the thermal evolution of Venus in terms of surface and mean mantle temperature, surface velocity, heat flux, and water concentration in the atmosphere and the mantle. To\nbetter understand the effect of the mobilized surface on mantle dynamics, we compare this model to the uncoupled version. After 600 Myr, partial melting first occurs and the surface temperature increases in both models (Fig. 5a). In the coupled model, the increased surface temperature insulates the mantle and results in a\ndecrease of the heat flux (Fig. 5d). During the subsequent 1.4 Gyr an increased volcanic outgassing rate follows for both models. This fits in with the idea of the positive feedback mechanism by Phillips et al. (2001) sketched in Fig. 1. However, after 1.3 Gyr a critical surface temperature is reached for the coupled model and the surface\nbecomes locally mobilized. The maximum surface velocity increases continuously to about 7.5 mm/yr (Fig. 5c). As a result of the associated efficient cooling of the mantle, partial melting is reduced and the surface temperature decreases after about 3.5 Gyr, resulting also in a declining surface mobilization at that time. After 4.5 Gyr, the mantle is cooler in the coupled model (Fig. 5e), even though for most of the time surface temperatures have been higher than in the uncoupled model, where we assume a constant surface temperature of 737 K. The overall outgassing rate is smaller in the coupled model, so that after 4.5 Gyr less water is degassed from the mantle than in the uncoupled model (Fig. 5f).\nSmall fluctuations can be seen in the surface temperature during the thermal evolution (Fig. 5a). This is due to the melting model we used. If the temperature in a cell volume is higher than the solidus, partial melting occurs. The solidus increases accordingly, and the temperature has to increase further for more partial melting, which may take some time, so that there is no outgassing and surface temperature increase in certain intervals.\nIn the following, we show that the general findings are independent of the chosen geometry. Using 3D geometry and the same parameters as in the 2D reference case shows similar results (Fig. 6). In fact the surface mobilization as well as the cooling of the mantle is more pronounced for the coupled 3D case (Case 14 in Table 2) than for the 2D case (Case 1). For instance, at the time of mobilization the surface velocity increases more rapidly for the 3D case (Case 14-c) whereas an adjustment time of about 800 Myr has been identified for the 2D case (compare Figs. 5c and 6c). Nevertheless, the efficiency of resurfacing for the 3D case with srf equal to 3.94 is similar compared to the 2D reference case with a value of 3.37, see Table 3. Strong variations in the surface temperature can be observed after about 3 Gyr in the 3D case. This variation, however, is not the consequence of the 3D geometry but rather of the atmosphere model by Bullock and Grinspoon (2001). At around 1000–2000 ppmw water vapour in the atmosphere the surface temperature is very sensible to changes in the amount of atmospheric water (compare Fig. 2).\nThe surface of Venus is very young on average but may also contain some older parts like crustal plateaus (Phillips and Hansen, 1998). For comparison, we show the surface age obtained from our simulation with a 3D model (Case 14-c) in Fig. 7a. The age of every grid point is defined by the time at which the last partial melting occurred underneath the lithosphere. We assume that partially molten material is immediately extracted and assign its age\nto the surface directly above. This way we underestimate the surface age as we do not consider that a substantial amount of this melt will likely not reach the surface but remain in the crust as intrusive material. Surface age might also be altered by surface mobilization and resurfacing due to subduction-like processes but these effects on the age determination are neglected here as well. Maximum and averaged surface ages are listed in Table 3. For all cases, the averaged surface is as expected younger than the observed average venusian surface with an age of approximately 500 Myr. However, it is interesting to note that even if our averaged surface ages are smaller than the observed presentday surface age of Venus, areas can be locally quite old. These strong variations in surface age also have been observed for Venus (Hansen and López, 2010).\nThe surface heat flux and the surface velocity of the 3D run at 3Gyr are presented in Fig. 7b and c. Both parameters show again that mobilization is a local effect. Mantle upwellings reach the surface and increase the heat flux at these spots to 132 mW/m2. The original surface material is shifted away from the site of the upwelling.\nTo demonstrate the robustness of our approach, we varied key model parameters such as reference viscosity, initial mantle temperature, exospheric loss rate for hydrogen, and initial volatile concentrations in the mantle in different simulations in 2D and 3D. Independent of the parameters used, the effects described above occurred in all cases where surface temperatures were high enough for a short time. But the critical temperature for resurfacing depends on the value of these parameters.\nIn Fig. 8, we show an example of how the critical surface temperature for resurfacing depends on viscosity. We used 2D simulations with the parameters given in Table 1. In all cases, the activation energy was 540 kJ/mol and the viscosity stress exponent 3.5. No partial melting or atmospheric evolution was considered in these runs, and we used fixed surface temperatures. Depending on the Peclet number, we defined four different regimes: stagnant (Pe < 1), highly sluggish (1 6 Pe > 10), sluggish (10 6 Pe < 100), and mobile (Pe P 100). In Fig. 8a, we compare the critical surface temperatures for the different regimes obtained for varying reference viscosities and a fixed activation volume of 10 cm3/mol. Smaller reference viscosities lead to more vigorous convection in the mantle and lower critical temperatures. In Fig. 8b, we varied the activation volume for a fixed reference viscosity of 1022 Pa s and determined the dependence of the critical surface temperature on pressure effects.\nWe used an activation volume ranging from a small value of 2.5 cm3/mol up to 20 cm3/mol – the latter value is assumed for non-Newtonian fluids in the upper mantle (Karato and Wu, 1993). At high activation volumes the lower mantle becomes more sluggish and super-plumes form at the CMB. They reach the uppermost mantle and, being of greater force (due to convective stresses) than smaller plumes, they can mobilize the surface more easily. In general it can be stated that the critical surface temperature greatly\ndepends on convective stresses and the vigour of mantle convection, which together have the effect of decreasing the viscosity contrast in the upper mantle to less than 105, initiating mobilization. Depending on the parameters used, critical surface temperatures range between 750 K and 1000 K.\nFig. 9 shows the theoretical dependence of the mantle temperature and rheology on the critical surface temperature, assuming that a viscosity contrast from surface to mantle lower than 105\n(gsurf =gmantle 6 10 5) is required for surface mobilization. In this approach the mantle temperature is assumed to be the temperature below the upper thermal boundary layer, and the activation volume is neglected. Three main tendencies can be observed. First, the critical surface temperature decreases with decreasing mantle temperature. Second, the critical surface temperature is lower for a non-Newtonian than for a Newtonian rheology; and third, the\ncritical surface temperature is lower in a wet mantle. The result of the analytical solution agrees with the results shown in Fig. 8a. At smaller reference viscosities, mantle cooling is more efficient, and mantle temperatures decrease, leading to lower critical surface temperatures (cf. Figs. 8a and 9). The conclusion is that a wet and non-Newtonian mantle is more susceptible to surface mobilization. Results further indicate that the suggested surface\nmobilization on Venus seems to be unlikely for a Newtonian mantle rheology because this would call for surface temperatures of more than 1000 K or, alternatively, a very cool mantle.\nWe have shown that the critical surface temperature and, therefore, the ability to mobilize the surface depend strongly on the rheology and temperature of the mantle. Table 2 lists the simulations\nin which we varied these parameters as well as the initial concentrations and exospheric loss time of the greenhouse gas H2O. We compare the coupled and uncoupled model, show how the mobilization of the surface influences interior dynamics in most of the cases investigated, and discuss the influence of different parameters on thermal evolution.\nIn most of the cases, the coupled model produced less outgassing: at the end of the evolution, a greater amount of volatiles remains in the mantle in the coupled (e.g. 62% in Case 1-c) than in the uncoupled model (e.g. 57% in Case 1-u). The lower average outgassing rates can be explained by surface mobilization and its cooling effect. The influence of initial mantle temperatures on the thermal evolution of Venus has been compared in Cases 5-c (1400 K), 3-c (1700 K), and 4-c (2000 K). The higher the initial mantle temperature the more efficient the degassing of the planetary interior. At Tm,ini = 2000 K, only 40% of the initial volatile content of the mantle is left after 4.5 Gyr; at Tm,ini = 1400 K, a larger proportion (76%) remains in the mantle. The maximum local surface velocity to occur during the thermal evolution decreases as initial temperatures increase – as expected (compare Fig. 9). It is 2 mm/yr at Tm,ini = 1400 K, 0.9 mm/yr at Tm,ini = 1700 K, and only 0.2 mm/yr at Tm,ini = 2000 K. This can be explained due to the fact that the decoupling of the mantle from the lithosphere becomes more pronounced as convection becomes more vigorous. At the highest initial mantle temperature investigated, 2000 K, the mean mantle temperature of the coupled model is still more than 360 K higher after 4.5 Gyr than in Case 5-c, and more than 180 K higher than in Case 3-c. High mantle temperatures lead to small mantle viscosities and hence larger viscosity contrasts to the surface than for cooler mantles. Hence the critical surface temperature to overcome is higher for the hot-mantle case than for the other two cases (see also Fig. 9).\nThe two extreme cases, a cold initial mantle of 1400 K (Case 5-c) and a hot initial mantle of 2000 K (Case 4-c), are compared in Fig. 10. In the hot-mantle case, extensive partial melting occurs almost from the beginning. In the cold-mantle case, almost no partial melting occurs in the first 2.5 Gyr of thermal evolution. In the hotmantle case, already more than 40% of volatiles in the mantle have been outgassed after 2.5 Gyr compared to about 5% in the coldmantle case at the same time. A sudden but effective volcanic event occurs shortly after the 2.5 Gyr point, releasing more volatiles than in the hot-mantle case since the mantle was not depleted\nof incompatible volatiles before. Surface temperatures are 20 K higher than the maximal surface temperature in the hot-mantle case, and together with the reduced viscosity contrast explained above this leads to more intense mobilization of the surface material. The hot initial mantle leads to earlier but much weaker mobilization events.\nWe observe the same tendency for the 3D geometry, where we compare two cases with initial mantle temperatures of 1700 K (Case 14) and 1400 K (Case 16). The latter case has a strongly reduced outgassing rate compared to the hot-mantle case. As could already be seen in the 2D investigations, a cooler mantle leads to higher maximal surface temperatures and surface velocities.\nIn our reference case we treated dehydration of the mantle material following Fraeman and Korenaga (2010). To investigate the effect of dehydration on our model we compare the reference case with Case 8, where no dehydration was considered. In this simulation the results are similar to the run (Case 1) shown in Fig. 5, however, after 4.5 Gyr, surface temperatures and outgassing rates are higher for the reference case. This can be explained by the stiffening of the mantle material, which leads to less effective heat transport to the surface, a warmer mantle and thus higher outgassing rates and surface temperatures. The resurfacing is more efficient in Case 8-c (with srf = 6.31) compared to the reference case (with srf = 3.37), see Table 3.\nThe same effect of dehydration can be observed in 3D geometry. In Case 14 the material was dehydrated during the thermal evolution, leading to high mantle viscosities after 4.5 Gyr. This case is compared to Case 15, where stiffer material was used right from the beginning of the evolution instead of considering dehydration effects. As expected, resurfacing is again less efficient for the case where stiffer material is used (with srf = 1.34) compared to Case 14 (srf = 3.94).\nStiffening of the material due to dehydration leads to reduced surface velocities and less effective surface recycling. The same tendency can be observed when using a higher reference viscosity during the whole evolution, compare Case 7 and Case 8. In both cases no dehydration of the mantle material was considered. An increase of the reference viscosity by a factor of 10 leads to more sluggish convection and hence less effective resurfacing with srf = 0.1 (Case 7-c) compared to srf = 6.31 (Case 8-c). The consequences of varying the reference viscosity have been indicated also in Fig. 8a, where the surface mobilization occurs at lower surface temperatures and is more effective when using smaller reference viscosities. Considering that smaller reference viscosities of 1019– 1020 Pa s are possible for Venus if sufficient water is in the mantle (e.g. Karato and Wu, 1993), larger surface velocities and more effective recycling than in our investigated cases (see Table 2) are possible. However, for numerical reasons we used high reference viscosities in the thermal evolution models with mantle degassing.\nHence in all simulations, maximum local surface velocities are small when compared to mantle velocities or Earth’s plate velocities. The highest surface velocity in our study is 13 mm/yr in Case 8-c. The high velocities that appear in Cases 1, 6, 8, 13 and 14 were obtained because a long exospheric escape time of H2O was assumed, leading to higher surface temperatures and velocities during the evolution. At shorter exospheric escape times (Cases 2 and 3 compared to Case 1 as well as Cases 8, 9 and 10), the amount of H2O in the atmosphere is smaller since the loss of H2O into space happens at a higher rate. This automatically leads to lower surface temperatures and, consequently, lower surface velocities and srf values.\nIn the following, we examine the influence of the initial concentration of volatiles in the mantle on the evolution of the atmosphere. In Cases 11 and 12 we use the same parameters as in Case 3 except initial volatile concentration vary from 20 ppmw to 100 ppmw of H2O, respectively. Surface temperatures and velocities are smallest during the entire evolution in Case 11 with the lowest volatile content in the mantle. The surface temperature never reaches present-day temperatures, but has a maximum value of 720 K. Hence no resurfacing takes place. Surface temperatures, velocities and surface-recycling factor increase with\nincreasing initial volatile concentration. Averaged surface ages increase with increasing volatile amount in the mantle as the mantle temperature decreases due to surface mobilization leading to less partial melt. The initial concentration of water seems to have only a minor influence on the surface temperature after 4.5 Gyr if the initial mantle water concentration is above 20 ppmw.\nAn initial water concentration in the atmosphere of 30 ppmw (Case 13) has almost no influence on the atmospheric evolution (compared to Case 1). Even though the initial surface temperature is higher for Case 13, the initial amount of water is rapidly lost to space."

    "heading": "4. Discussion",
    "text": "We have shown that resurfacing on Venus (which creates patches of young surface material) can be explained by a mobilization process on a planet subject to high surface temperatures. As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, surface temperature critically depends on the rheology and the mantle temperature. We find that the surface will become locally mobilized where the viscosity contrast in the mantle, i.e. the contrast between the surface and the convecting interior, falls below 105. At that viscosity contrast, a change from stagnant-lid convection to a transitional regime was observed in previous numerical studies (e.g. Solomatov and Moresi, 1996). Mobilization results in cooling of the upper mantle, thereby reducing degassing and tending to stop mobilization as the viscosity contrast increases again to values larger than 105. Note that our investigations have been done for non-Newtonian rheology parameters but with constant prefactors. First investigations involving a non-Newtonian rheology with varying strain rates show that this approximation is acceptable; viscosities at the surface can even be lower than in our approach, enhancing surface mobilization.\nIn the evolution models presented above, the present-day concentration of H2O in the atmosphere is in most cases found to be higher than what is actually observed on Venus. This suggests that our present-day degassing rates are too high and would argue for even more cooling and surface recycling and thus lower outgassing rates in the recent past. One might object that exospheric loss rates may have been substantially larger than assumed during the early evolution of Venus (Lammer et al., 2006). However, since water can be seen as a short-lived greenhouse gas, the remembrance of the present-day model atmosphere for early loss rates is small to insignificant. It is possible that the venusian mantle is drier than we have assumed, possibly also due to an enrichment of volatiles in the crust.\nIn this work we used a simple melt model, which assumes that the solidus temperature is equal to the mantle temperature after melting. To produce new partial melting at a later stage of the thermal evolution, the mantle temperature must be increased further. This might lead to lower surface temperatures in our approach, since our melt amount might be an underestimate. On the other hand, we assumed a homogenously mixed mantle with respect to its water content. If partial melting occurs, residual water volatiles will again be extracted 100% from specific locations in the mantle, independently of previous melting. This assumption might have caused us to overestimate our outgassing rates. Overall, the two effects might compensate each other. The effect of local mantle dehydration and depletion on outgassing rates will be investigated in a future study.\nIn our model we did not consider that partial melting produces a buoyant crust and possibly also a buoyant depleted mantle (harzburgite) layer. These layers – if sufficiently thick – may hamper the described surface mobilization on Venus. It has been suggested for instance for early Earth that the formation of a thick basaltic oceanic crust may have had inhibited early plate tectonics (e.g.\nOxburgh and Parmentier, 1977). However, this effect can be compensated by the transition from basalt to eclogite in the lower crust for a crustal thickness of 30–70 km. This transition might enhance surface recycling, since it would lead to more dense material and a negative buoyancy of the crust (Nimmo and McKenzie, 1998). A study of these competing effects on the surface mobilization of Venus needs further consideration and is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nIn the present study, we used the surface temperatures derived by a model by Bullock and Grinspoon (2001) that depends on the effect of cloud layers and the resultant albedo changes. In this model they vary either H2O or SO2 and assume present-day concentrations of the other major greenhouse gases in the venusian atmosphere. A more realistic approximation of the venusian surface temperature with time requires the consideration of a variation in H2O together with carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide variations in the atmosphere. For instance, including SO2 might lead to even higher surface temperatures as used in our model. Solomon et al. (1999) modelled a volcanic eruption with Earth-like outgassing of SO2 and H2O leading to a water concentration of 50 ppmw in the atmosphere and obtained an increase of surface temperature by 60 K mostly due to SO2. Furthermore, we did not include a complete CO2 cycle in our coupled atmosphere–mantle convection model. Such a cycle would imply carbon recycling through surface mobilization. It is not entirely clear, however, how a carbon cycle would work on Venus without abundant liquid water on the surface and without precipitation. Possibly, the cycle on Venus also includes some weathering of lava flows (Fegley et al., 1992; Zolotov and Volkov, 1992).\nThe main goal of this paper is, first, to show how important the feedback effects of a varying surface temperature are for the planet’s interior dynamics, and second, that a change from a stagnant to a mobile-lid regime – and thus local resurfacing – may even occur at surface temperatures ranging from 750 K to 1000 K, strongly depending on rheological parameters. Since mobilization is largely\nindependent of the atmospheric parameters chosen (see Figs. 8 and 9) it is expected that it will appear in a more realistic atmosphere model as well."
  }, {
    "heading": "5. Conclusion",
    "text": "Our model indicates that the young surface of Venus may be explained by an increase in surface temperature by up to 150 K (relative to the present-day value). High degassing rates and the greenhouse effect cause this increase in the surface temperature and the associated surface mobilization (not plate tectonics, which would call for a cold and stiff crust), thus bringing new material to the surface. Resurfacing events appear (and disappear) self-consistently when the thermal evolution of Venus is coupled with an atmosphere model.\nLocal surface mobilization does not only lead to resurfacing events that may explain the surface structure and age distribution observed on Venus, it also causes an extensive decrease in mantle temperature. This is due to the lack of insulation in the lid. The amount of partial melting decreases too, leading to weaker (but still ongoing) volcanism and outgassing rates. This negative feedback mechanism regulates surface temperatures (Fig. 11) once a critical temperature is reached that can range from 750 K to 1000 K depending on rheological parameters.\nThe model presented in this paper shows that atmospheric changes caused by outgassing and exospheric loss processes are key elements to consider when modelling the interior of planets like Venus. These planets have the potential to reach high surface temperatures either because of their dense atmosphere or because of a high solar flux, as may be the case in most of the rocky exoplanets that have been detected so far."

  "abstractText": "We calculated 2D and 3D mantle convection models for Venus using digitized atmosphere temperatures from the model of Bullock and Grinspoon (Bullock, M.A., Grinspoon, D.H. [2001]. Icarus 150, 19–37) to study the interaction between interior dynamics and atmosphere thermal evolution. The coupling between atmosphere and interior occurs through mantle degassing and the effect of varying concentrations of the greenhouse gas H2O on the surface temperature. Exospheric loss of hydrogen to space is accounted for as a H2O sink. The surface temperature enters the mantle convection model as a boundary condition. Our results suggest a self-consistent feedback mechanism between the interior and the atmosphere resulting in spatial–temporal surface renewal. Greenhouse warming of the atmosphere results in an increase in the surface temperature. Whenever the surface temperature reaches a critical value, the viscosity difference across the lithosphere becomes smaller than about 10 and the surface becomes locally mobile. The critical surface temperature depends on the activation energy for mantle creep, the stress exponent in the non-Newtonian mantle rheology law, and the mantle temperature. Surface renewal together with surface lava flow may explain why the surface of Venus is young on average, i.e. not older than a few hundred million years. The mobilization of the near-surface lithosphere increases the rate of heat removal from the mantle and thereby the interior cooling rate. The enhanced cooling results in a reduction of the water outgassing rates. As a consequence of decreasing water concentrations in the atmosphere, the surface temperature decreases. Our model calculations suggest that Venus should have been geologically active until recently. This is in agreement with several lines of observational evidence from thermal emissivity measurements and crater distribution analyses. 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
