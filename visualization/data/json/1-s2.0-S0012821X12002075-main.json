Volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) has been proposed as the main trigger, but direct evidence for this linkage is scarce. To help constrain scenarios for the ETE and other Triassic–\nfrom the Kendlbachgraben section in the Northern Calcareous Alps in Austria. The section belongs to the same paleogeographic unit (Eiberg Basin) and share similar stratigraphy with the recently selected base Jurassic Global Stratotype Section and Point at Kuhjoch.\nMicromineralogic study of the topmost bed of the Rhaetian Kössen Formation revealed pseudomorphs of altered, euhedral pyroxene and amphibole crystals. Their well-faceted morphology is consistent with their origin from distal mafic volcanic ash fallout. Spherical grains were also observed in the same bed, likely representing clay-altered volcanic glass. Clay minerals of this bed include lowto medium-charged smectite and Mg-vermiculite, both typical alteration products of mafic rocks. The same bed yielded a rare earth element pattern that differs from all other levels in an enrichment of heavy REEs, hinting at some minor contribution from mafic magmatic material. These features from a layer that was deposited very near to the TJB are interpreted as direct evidence of CAMP volcanism, coeval or immediately preceding the ETE and the initial negative carbon isotope anomaly.\nThe kaolinite-dominated clay mineral spectrum of the overlying boundary mudstone records intensive weathering under hot and humid greenhouse conditions. Redox-sensitive minor and trace elements do not support the development of widespread anoxia in the studied section. Although pyrite is common in several layers, framboid size indicates formation within a reductive zone, below the sediment/water interface, rather than in an anoxic water column.\nOur data provide a direct link between uppermost Triassic marine strata and CAMP-derived material. They support scenarios where CAMP volcanism induced climate and other environmental change, which in turn triggered the ETE and that is also reflected in the carbon isotope anomalies.\n& 2012 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The Triassic–Jurassic boundary (TJB) is preceded by one of the five largest Phanerozoic biotic crises, the end-Triassic extinction (ETE) (Alroy, 2008; Raup and Sepkoski, 1982), which in turn was associated with and likely triggered by rapid and severe\nAll rights reserved.\nand Applied Geology, Eötvös H-1117, Hungary.\nenvironmental change (Hesselbo et al., 2007). The biotic change is manifest in a pronounced loss of global diversity (Sepkoski, 1981, 1993), major turnover in several marine and terrestrial groups (Carter and Hori, 2005; Flügel, 2002; Kiessling et al., 2007; McElwain and Punyasena, 2007; Olsen et al., 1987) and ecologic reorganization (McElwain et al., 2007; McGhee et al., 2004). A major perturbation of the global carbon cycle likely reflects environmental disturbances and is recorded by carbon isotope anomalies in the TJB interval, documented at numerous localities worldwide (Galli et al., 2007; Guex et al., 2004; Hesselbo et al., 2002; Pálfy et al., 2001; Ruhl et al., 2009; Ward et al., 2001). Volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) has\nbeen proposed to be synchronous with and therefore considered as the trigger for concomitant environmental and biotic change (Marzoli et al., 1999, 2004; Pálfy, 2003). The ETE and TJB events have been in the focus of much recent research effort, yet several questions about the trajectory and causal chain of events remain open to debate (Hesselbo et al., 2007). Significantly, the key role of CAMP volcanism in triggering the extinction has been doubted (Whiteside et al., 2007) and alternative scenarios invoking a putative extraterrestrial impact event (Olsen et al., 2002), rapid sea level changes (Hallam and Wignall, 1999) or widespread marine anoxia (Hallam, 1995) have been proposed. Other possible proximate causes of the extinction include climate change, notably extreme greenhouse warming (McElwain et al., 1999; Schaller et al. 2011; Steinthorsdottir et al., 2011) and a marine biocalcification crisis (Hautmann, 2004; Hautmann et al., 2008). To further test these competing models of the TJB events, we obtained a temporally highly resolved, multidisciplinary dataset from the Kendlbachgraben section in Austria.\nThe Northern Calcareous Alps is a classical area of TJB studies and the section at Kendlbachgraben is the one with longest history of research (Golebiowski and Braunstein, 1988; Hallam, 1990; Suess and Mojsisovics, 1868). The search for a Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the system boundary generated much renewed interest in the TJB in general, and in the Austrian sections in particular. The newly selected base Jurassic GSSP at Kuhjoch (Hillebrandt et al., 2007) and the Kendlbachgraben section are both located within the Eiberg Basin (Fig. 1), now separated by 130 km, and share similar stratigraphies. Thus our results reported herein have both regional and global relevance in constraining models for the ETE and TJB events.\nThe Kendlbachgraben section preserves a marine succession across the TJB which, together with the other well-correlated sections in the Eiberg Basin (Fig. 2), provide an excellent record of both the biotic turnover in various fossil groups and the significant changes in sedimentation (Golebiowski, 1990; Krystyn et al., 2005). The evolution of carbon isotope composition yielded a useful proxy record of environmental change (Ruhl et al., 2009).\nHere we further explore the geochemistry and mineralogy of this section, in order to answer some of the remaining questions about the ETE and TJB events. Key issues addressed in this contribution concern climate change around the TJB in the source area of terrigenous sediment input, the redox conditions of local sedimentary environments, and detection of any volcanically derived material in the section that might allow direct correlation with CAMP volcanic activity. Changes in humidity are inferred from major element chemistry reflecting detrital input, variations in clay mineralogy and enrichment in immature terrigenous components.

    "text": "The Kendlbachgraben section is located about 30 km southeast of Salzburg and 8 km southwest of Wolfgangsee in the Osterhorn Range in Salzkammergut, Austria. Access is via a forest road in the Zinkenbach valley. The studied section is exposed on the steep hillside immediately above the forest road (coordinates 471 41’ 21‘‘N, 131 21’ 37‘‘E), only 300 m NW from the point where the road crosses the gully which exposes the classical, long-known Kendlbachgraben section. The stratigraphic significance of this locality for the Triassic–Jurassic boundary was first recognized by Suess and Mojsisovics (1868). Modern studies focussed on palynostratigraphy (Morbey, 1975), changes in facies and macrofauna (Golebiowski and Braunstein, 1988; Golebiowski, 1990), and carbon isotope stratigraphy (Hallam and Goodfellow, 1990; Morante and Hallam, 1996; Ruhl et al., 2009).\nThe Kendlbachgraben section is located within the Eiberg Basin, an elongated, Late Triassic–Early Jurassic intraplatform basin on the shelf of the western Neotethys. Correlative, stratigraphically closely similar, and well studied sections elsewhere in the presently east–west trending, 200 km long and 20 km wide Eiberg Basin include the nearby Tiefengraben (Kürschner et al., 2007), the base Jurassic GSSP at Kuhjoch (Fig. 2) and its sister section at Hochalplgraben (Hillebrandt et al., 2007; Hillebrandt and Krystyn, 2009; Bonis et al., 2009). The Kendlbachgraben section is situated in the eastern segment of the Eiberg Basin, structurally within the Osterhorn syncline, which in turn belongs to the Stauffen–Höllengebirge nappe of the northern Tirolicum unit of the Northern Calcareous Alps (Linzer et al., 1995). The Kuhjoch GSSP locality is located in the western Eiberg basin, now preserved within the Karwendel syncline. Both sections are thought to represent proximal basin facies, sandwiched between the extensive Dachstein platform and its platform margin reefs (preserved as the ‘‘Oberrhätkalk’’) (Krystyn et al., 2005).\nAt Kendlbachgraben, the base of the section is represented by the uppermost Triassic Eiberg Member of the Kössen Formation, a dark colored, pure limestone of bioclastic wackestone texture. Our XRD measurements reveal a 98–99% calcite content, and only the remaining 1–2% is of detrital and organic origin. The topmost Rhaetian conodont Misikella posthernsteini is reported from the highest limestone bed (Golebiowski and Braunstein, 1988).\nA U S T R I A\nNorthern C alcares so\nuAlp\neast ern\nEibe rg B\nasin\nKendlbachgraben\nf this study) and Kuhjoch (Global Stratotype Section and Point, GSSP) within the\ndified from Hillebrandt and Krystyn (2009)).\nThe transition at the formation boundary is represented by a 5 cm thick marlstone layer, overlain by 5 cm of brown claystone, yielding bivalves (e.g. Cardinia, Chlamys) (Golebiowski and Braunstein, 1988) and fish scales. The initial negative carbon isotope anomaly was detected at this level (Ruhl et al., 2009). The basal part of the overlying Kendlbach Formation is the 2.5 m thick clay-rich boundary mudstone (‘‘Grenzmergel’’ in the traditional terminology) which forms the basal part of the Tiefengraben Member. Early claims of a broad negative carbon isotope anomaly in this unit (Hallam and Goodfellow, 1990) were withdrawn on the basis of diagenetic overprint (Morante and Hallam, 1996). Higher upsection the Tiefengraben Member is composed of intercalated beds of marl and impure limestone, in turn overlain by the carbonate-dominated Breitenberg Member. Stable carbon isotope stratigraphy, in agreement with lithostratigraphy, permits good correlation with the GSSP section at Kuhjoch and suggests\nplacement of the TJB in the middle of the Tiefengraben Member, where the main negative carbon isotope anomaly starts at 3 m above the formation boundary (Ruhl et al., 2009)."

    "text": "A suite of 59 samples was collected from the section for whole rock major and trace element analyses. The topmost layer of the Kössen Formation was sampled in duplicate (KBL-0 and KB-1) at different times and analyzed in different batches. Samples KB-2 and KB-3 originate from the first two layers immediately overlying the Kössen Formation, whereas 11 closely spaced samples represent the ‘‘Grenzmergel’’, the boundary mudstone. One sample was taken from each of the 5–40 cm thick individual layers of the overlying 9.5 m of alternating shale-marlstone and limestone\nlithologies of the Kendlbach Formation, except for the thickest (80 cm) marlstone interlayer which provided samples KB-31 and KB-32. From this part of the section, a total of 30 samples are from limestone beds (sample numbers prefixed KBL), whereas 28 samples are from shale or marlstone (prefixed KB). A subset of selected samples was further subjected to mineralogical analyses.\nChemical analyses were carried out at the Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd., Vancouver, Canada. Total abundance of major oxides and several minor elements (Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Mn, Ti, P, Cr) is reported on the basis of 0.2 g samples analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES) following a lithium-metaborate/tetraborate fusion and dilute nitric acid digestion. Loss on ignition (LOI) was determined by weight difference after ignition at 1000 1C. Total carbon and sulphur analysis were done on a Leco instrument. Rare earth (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) and refractory elements (Ba, Be, Co, Cs, Gd, Hf, Nb, Rb, Sc, Sn, Sr, Ta, Th, U, V, W, Y, Zr) were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) following lithium-metaborate/tetraborate fusion and nitric acid digestion of a 0.2 g sample (using the same decomposition as for major oxides). In addition, a separate 0.5 g split was digested in aqua-regia and analyzed by ICP-MS to report the precious (Ag, Au, Cu) and base metals (As, Bi, Cd, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Tl, Zn).\nFrom the analyzed elements the following were under the detection limit (given in parentheses): Ag (0.1 ppm), Au (0.5 ppb), Hg (0.1 ppm), Se (0.5 ppm) and Tl (0.1 ppm). Concentrations of Be (1 ppm), Bi (0.1 ppm), Cd (0.1 ppm), Mn (100 ppm) and Sn (1 ppm) were near their detection limit.\nREE were normalized to the C1 chondrite (Anders and Grevesse, 1989). The cerium anomaly was quantified using the following equation: Ce/Cen¼CeN/(LaN PrN)0.5, where subscript N indicates the C1 chondrite normalized value (Anders and Grevesse, 1989). To detect if any La enrichment occurred which may have caused an artefact in the Ce curve, we calculated the Pr/Prn ratios, where Pr/Prn¼PrN/(0.5CeNþ0.5NdN) (Bau and Dulski, 1996).\nScanning electron microscopy (both energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and backscattered electron microscopy (BSE)) was carried out in polished sections from six limestone samples, using a JEOL JXA-8600 Superprobe electron microscope (15 kV, 15 nA) at the Institute of Mineralogy and Geology, University of Miskolc.\nMicromineralogy studies focused on sample KB-1. After dissolving the carbonate with 5 wt% acetic acid, the 445 mm fraction was sieved and the grains were inspected and picked under a stereo-microscope. To investigate the altered pyroxenes, amphiboles and clay spherules of the sample, scanning electron microscopy and EDS measurements were done in two laboratories. Secondary electron (SE) images were captured on a Hitachi S-4800 electron microscope (20 kV, 10 mA) at BAY-NANO (Miskolc). EDS and BSE images were obtained at the Department of Metallurgy, University of Miskolc, using an AMRAY-1860 T6 instrument (25 kV, 1–2 nA).\nWhole rock mineral composition was determined and clay mineral investigations, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurements were done at the Institute of Mineralogy and Geology, University of Miskolc. The analyses were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer (Bragg–Brentano geometry, Cu tube at 40 kV and 40 mA, 21–651 (2y), 0.041 step scanning, 2 s/step counting time, secondary graphite monocromator, fixed slit system of 0.6 mm primary-, 0.6 mm secondary- and 0.2 mm detector-slits, horizontal sample position, rotating sample holder), analyzed with EVA data handling program of the Bruker DiffracPlus evaluation software package, full profile fitting, and a semi-quantitative method. Mineral species were identified based on the PDF2 (2005) database, except for clay\nminerals. Semi-quantitative evaluation was performed only after the identification of clay minerals by diagnostic procedures (Zajzon et al., 2012)."

    "text": "Changes in the ratio of terrigenous siliciclastic components are traceable through the analysis of Si, Al and CO3 (Table 1). The two dominant detrital phases are quartz and clay minerals. The sum of SiO2þAl2O3 is taken to represent the quantity of the siliciclastics, whereas the amount of clay minerals is tracked by Al2O3. Changes in the ratio of clay minerals and detrital quartz are thus reflected in the SiO2 vs. Al2O3 curve (Fig. 3).\nAbove the limestone beds of Kössen Formation, in the boundary mudstone, the detrital component increases abruptly and significantly, and reaches a maximum in sample KB-4. From here its amount gradually decreases upsection. The clay content is also highest in the boundary mudstone, and higher up quartz becomes more abundant among the detrital components.\nThe iron content is the lowest (0.07 wt% Fe2O3) in the pure limestones of the Kössen Formation. The other limestone interbeds higher in the section contain around 0.5 wt% Fe2O3. Much higher Fe content, typically between 3 and 4 wt%, is registered in the boundary mudstone (with peak values of 5.29 and 5.78 wt% in samples KB-4 and KB-8, respectively). The Jurassic marl interbeds usually contain 2–3 wt% Fe2O3.\nThe sulfur content in the section is low, except for the lower part of boundary mudstone and two other marl layers which contain more than 0.5 wt%. The sulfur content and partly also the iron in the samples is hosted by the pyrite and gypsum phases."

To filter out the dilution effect of the carbonate fraction on the signal, the measured values were normalized to Th, which is regarded as an element of the terrigenous component not controlled by the redox state of the depositional environment. Concentration of the redox-sensitive elements remain low throughout the section (Table 1, Fig. 4). Enrichment in these elements occurs only in the lowermost 10 cm of the boundary mudstone (samples KB-1, 2 and 3)."

    "text": "Although uranium and thorium are similar elements, their behavior is different in reducing and oxidative environments. Thorium is not sensitive to the redox conditions, whereas uranium is precipitated and concentrated only in reducing regimes. Oxidative bottom waters cause U to remain dissolved, hence the sediment would become depleted with respect to U. The PAAS (‘‘Post-Archean Australian Shale’’ standard, thought to represent the upper continental crust) has a U/Th value of 0.26 (McLennan, 1989), whereas that of the C1 chondrite is 0.27 (Anders and Grevesse, 1989). Generally, a U/Th ratio40.5 is taken to signal anoxic environment (Adams and Weaver, 1958; Fisher and Wignall, 2001; Myers and Wignall, 1987). The U/Th ratio remains low in most of the studied section, except between the samples KBL-K2 and KB-3, where it increases up to 8.5.

    "text": "Several studies demonstrated that the redox sensitivity of Ce is a useful indicator of paleoceanographic conditions (DeBaar\net al., 1985, 1988; Elderfield, 1988; German et al., 1995; Hu et al., 1988; Sholkovitz and Schneider, 1991; Schijf and DeBaar, 1995; Dolenec et al., 2001). The abundance of Ce of the carbonate phase in carbonate rocks directly reflects the Ce concentration of the seawater, which in turn is a good indicator of the redox state of the environment. Cerium enters the ocean in its soluble, trivalent state but under oxic bottom water conditions, Ce becomes relatively depleted, as its oxidized\nform, Ce(IV) is quickly precipitated from the water (Elderfield, 1988; Dolenec et al., 2001), causing a negative Ce anomaly in the REE pattern of the marine carbonates (Dolenec et al., 2001; Hu et al., 1988). However, under anoxic conditions, the behavior of Ce will be similar to other trivalent REE. Thus in the REE pattern of the carbonate phase no pronounced negative Ce anomaly will be visible, resulting a largely flat REE pattern (Dolenec et al., 2001). This can be represented with the Ce/ Cen ratio.\nIn the studied section the Ce/Cen curve shows an opposite redox signal to the minor redox sensitive elements (Fig. 4). REE measurements could only be performed in the whole-rock samples, not in the separated carbonate fractions. In this case the terrigenous REE content is more dominant in the signal than the carbonate REE, which can be seen in the three-four times higher P REE of the marls, compared to the carbonates. The Ce-depletion is explained by the dissolution of Ce from the terrigenous component, and staying in the anoxic sea-water, causing an opposite pattern to that seen in the carbonate fraction.\nThe Ce/Cen is around 0.9 in the marls and 0.75 in the limestone beds. The difference between them is coming from the different terrigenous/carbonate ratio. The carbonate fraction contains a more depleted value, which suggests oxygenated bottom water in the section. Samples from the Kössen Formation yielded more depleted values (0.5) than the Kendlbach Formation limestones, which is explained by the higher carbonate content, and also reflects oxygenated water. The only samples which deviate from this trend are KB-1, 2 and 3. Even though they have lower carbonate content than KBL-K3 and 2, they have more depleted Ce/Cen values (0.33–0.36).\nTo check if the Ce/Cen value is not an artifact of positive La enrichment, the Pr/Prn value was calculated (Bau and Dulski, 1996). The values do not show La enrichment."

    "text": "The normalized REE patterns of most samples are remarkably similar to each other and resemble a presumed typical continental source rock (Table 3, Fig. 5). Three features of the REE patterns warrant further discussion: the occasional presence of a Ceanomaly, HREE enrichment in two samples, and the systematically lower REE content of the limestone samples as compared with the marls. The majority of the observed anomalies are confined to the basal part of the section.\nThe two stratigraphically lowermost samples (KBL-K2 and KBL-K3) from the upper part of the Kössen Formation have the lowest amount of REE, but their overall pattern is similar to that of the others. These samples are from the purest limestone with the lowest amount of terrigenous material.\nThe next layer is the topmost limestone bed of the Kössen Formation (represented by duplicate samples KBL-0 and KB-1, yielding the same results), which shows a significant HREE enrichment.\nSample KB-2 was obtained from the 5 cm thick marl layer directly overlying the Kössen Limestone. The abundance of REE in this sample is comparable to most others and some HREE enrichment is also present here but less pronounced than in the underlying layer.\nSample KB-3 is from a brown, marly layer that contains scattered fish remains (scales and bone fragments). This is reflected in the high apatite content, determined by XRPD as 4 wt%, and the high concentration of P2O5, determined by wholerock chemistry as 2.72 wt% (Tables 2 and 3). The presence of apatite might explain the unusual abundance of REE in this sample, 1.5–3 times higher than in most of the other marl\nsamples, making this sample the richest in REE in the entire studied section. However, there is no HREE enrichment in this sample, contrary to samples KB-1 and KB-2.\nStarting from sample KB-4, the REE content and REE pattern of the samples are remarkably similar to each other. The only significant difference is that the marly samples contain approximately three times\nmore REE than the limestones. This observation agrees well with the three-to-four times higher amount of detrital terrigenous material in the marls, as calculated from the carbonate content of the samples."

    "text": "Mineral phases were identified in 22 samples from the section using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Nine samples were further investigated for an in-depth characterization of their clay mineral content, the details of which are beyond the scope of this paper and are presented elsewhere (Zajzon et al., 2012). The results are summarized here in Table 3 and Fig. 3.\nThe three main components of the samples are calcite, quartz and clay minerals, beside some less abundant phases such as pyrite, feldspar, apatite, aragonite, gypsum and dolomite. The purest limestone occurs in the Kössen Formation. In the overlying boundary mudstone, the carbonate content drops to 10 wt%. Quartz, clay minerals, feldspars and pyrite appear here as phases not encountered lower in the section. The highest clay mineral content, recorded in sample KB-8, is 45 wt%.\nThe occurrence of pyrite is characteristic for the boundary mudstone, although it is also found at other levels higher in the section. The FeO content of the samples correlates well with the pyrite and goethite phases. The majority of the pyrite is framboidal, as revealed by SEM, indicative of bacterial origin (see below in Section 4.4.3.). The oxidation of pyrite led to formation of gypsum. The alteration may have occurred either in the outcrop or later, after sample collection. Sample KB-2 contains 4 wt% fluorapatite, which is bound to the unusually abundant fish remains (bones, teeth, scales) in this layer. Sample KB-3 contains 8.4 wt% of aragonite, which likely represents the original shell material of bivalves and foraminifera.\nThe feldspar phases present are albite, sanidine and microcline. The highest amount is registered in the middle to upper part of the boundary mudstone, reaching up to 16 wt%. Sanidine occurs only in the upper part of the boundary mudstone. Dolomite appears in only two samples, accompanied in both by sanidine."

    "text": "In the majority of samples, illite and kaolinite are registered as the main clay minerals with subordinate smectite, and their ratios were monitored to allow environmental and paleoclimatic\ninferences. Sample KB-1, however, shows a peculiar clay mineral composition very different from the other samples, because it is dominated by low- to medium-charged smectite and also contains vermiculite. These clay minerals commonly represent the alteration products of mafic and/or ultramafic rocks. Upsection, in the boundary mudstone, the clay mineral distribution is characterized by kaoliniteZ illiteþmuscovite * smectite. In the higher part of the section a distinctive change in the clay mineral pattern results in illiteþmuscovite*kaolinite*smectite ratios. For more detail, see Zajzon et al. (2012)."

    "text": "Six polished samples (KB-1, KBL-K3, 1, 8, 15, 26) were selected for investigation by SEM. All of these samples contain a varying amount of pyrite, which is dominantly framboidal. In some of the samples only goethite pseudomorphs were observed, but their shape clearly identifies them as alteration products from pyrite. In many instances the shell of a fossil or part of a microbial mat is recognizable as the locus of pyrite formation. Pyrite also frequently occurs together with apatite. Beside the framboidal form, euhedral pyrite is also common in the samples and both varieties may occur in distinct layers. The framboids are commonly large (0.1–0.2 mm in diameter), and form structures such as mats and spheres, indicative of their formation in the sediment rather than in the water column (Wignall and Newton, 1998; Wilkin et al., 1996). Barite was also found in some layers (e.g. sample KBL-26)."

The grain size of this micritic limestone is very fine, not more than a few wt% is above 45 mm of the insoluble part. Possible alteration products of volcanic material were indeed detected in this sample, in the form of goethite pseudomorphs after euhedral crystals of pyroxene and amphibole, and pale-green clay spherules that may represent altered glass (Fig. 6).\nNo fresh magmatic minerals were observed, only their alteration products.

These elongated grains are 0.1–0.2 mm in length, and the original crystal shape, the edges and facets are perfectly preserved (Fig. 6d–h). They are easily identifiable as three-dimensional grains in the acid insoluble residue. These pseudomorphs were also observed in the polished samples, where their recognition is more difficult because the shape of their cross-section is less distinctive and often similar to pseudomorphs after pyrite crystals.\nPale green, opaque or slightly transparent grains are also present in the sample. Their shapes vary, some of them are perfectly spherical whereas others are subangular (Fig. 6a–c). Their composition, as revealed by EDS, is illite/aluminoceladonite.

    "heading": "5.1. Recorders of contemporaneous volcanism",
    "text": "Causal relationship of the ETE and coeval carbon cycle perturbation with CAMP volcanism has been proposed by many authors (e.g. Marzoli et al., 1999; Pálfy, 2003; Hesselbo et al., 2007). Support for this hypothesis is primarily provided by dating studies which have established with increasing precision and accuracy the synchrony between CAMP flood basalts (Marzoli et al., 1999, 2004; Nomade et al., 2007) and the Triassic–Jurassic boundary (Pálfy et al., 2000; Schaltegger et al., 2008; Schoene et al., 2010). However, direct stratigraphic evidence for CAMPderived volcanic material in marine sections has been meager. Where CAMP flows or pyroclastics occur with marine sedimentary rocks, e.g. in France and Morocco, precise biostratigraphic dating is hampered by a lack of age-diagnostic fossils (Olsen et al., 2003). Recent studies in terrestrial sections using palynostratigraphy (Cirilli et al., 2009) and conchostracan biostratigraphy (Kozur and Weems, 2010) demonstrate that CAMP volcanism began in the latest Triassic. Available circumstantial evidence for the onset of volcanism include the presence of potentially volcanically derived organic molecules, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, from TJB sediments (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2009) and increase in pCO2 detected both in pedogenic carbonates (Schaller et al., 2011) and by fossil leaf stomatal density (McElwain et al., 1999; Steinthorsdottir et al., 2011).\nIn the Kendlbachgraben section, both the pyroxene and amphibole pseudomorphs and the altered glass spherules found in the topmost Kössen Formation (sample KB-1) are interpreted as volcanic eruption products, most likely representing a distal record of CAMP eruptions. The size and the well preserved rounded original shape of the altered glass spherules suggest airborne origin and transportation. The pyroxene and amphibole crystals fall into the fine ash size range, capable of entering the upper atmosphere within the eruption plume. The well preserved crystal facets and edges rule out the possibility of even short terrestrial transportation that would have caused wear and damage of the grains. The presence of all these ‘‘exotic’’ grains in the pure micritic limestone are best explained as air-fall fine ash particles directly deposited in the marine sedimentary basin.\nIn agreement with the above interpretation, the clay mineral pattern of this layer is also quite different from the other samples. It contains dominantly low- to medium-charged smectite as well as Mg-dominated vermiculite. Typically, these clay minerals occur as alteration products of mafic and ultramafic rocks (Velde and Meunier, 2008; see also Zajzon et al., 2012).\nA third line of evidence is provided by the REE distribution patterns. The same sample (KB-1) from the topmost layer of Kössen Formation differs from all other samples by a distinctive enrichment of heavy REE. Only the overlying layer (sample KB-2) shows a similar, albeit more subdued HREE enrichment. Such trace element signature, characterized by a V-shaped pattern, may be best interpreted as a mixed signal where the light REEs are derived from the sedimentary component and the enrichement in HREE is sourced from magmatic material. HREE enrichment is characteristic for mantle sources and is known to occur, e.g. in N-MORB (Klein, 2003) and ultrabasic rocks (Bodinier and Godard, 2007), where it is carried by mineral phases such as garnets, pyroxenes and amphiboles. Pseudomorphs of the latter two minerals occur in the micromineralogical spectrum of the same sample.\nThe range of REE variation in CAMP extrusives have been reported in several studies and HREE enrichment is clearly documented by Marzoli et al. (2011) in the Preakness and Hook Mt. basalts in the Newark Basin, Sander basalt in the Culpeper basin, and the recurrent basalts in Morocco. The stratigraphic significance of this geochemical similarity to the late rather than early CAMP flows remains to be clarified.\nTo assess the feasibility of CAMP as a source of material preserved at Kendlbachgraben section, it is informative that paleogeographic reconstructions suggest an approximate distance of 2000–2500 km between northeastern CAMP eruptive centers and the marine Eiberg Basin in the western Tethys (Golonka, 2007). Volcanic particulates from eruption plumes are known to travel significant distances in downwind direction (Durant et al., 2010), as recently shown by widespread distribution of ash from the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, clearly detected in the Alps, more than 2700 km from Iceland (Flentje et al., 2010). Climate modeling results suggest that the Eiberg basin was downwind of the CAMP at least seasonally during Pangean summers in the Triassic (Wang, 2009). Therefore emplacement of CAMP-derived\nparticles in sediments preserved at the Kendlbachgraben section appears plausible. The generally assumed quiet outpouring of flood basalts contradicts the here inferred explosive eruption, capable to produce a high eruption column necessary for long distance particle dispersal. We speculate that at least some of the CAMP volcanism may have been phreatomagmatic, where eruption fissures intersected lakes in the rift basin, thus resulting in unusually explosive eruptions. Because CAMP erupted in multiple pulses, further search for volcanic signatures, perhaps below the topmost Kössen Formation, is warranted to corroborate the evidence presented herein."

    "heading": "5.2. Climate-driven changes in detrital input and clay mineralogy",
    "text": "A first-order change in depositional regimes in the Kendlbachgraben section is manifest in the lithostratigraphic boundary between the intraplatform basinal carbonates of the Kössen Formation and clay-rich, fine silicilastics of the boundary mudstone of the Kendlbach Formation. The abrupt change from carbonate-dominated to siliciclastic-dominated sedimentation during the latest Rhaetian may be the stratigraphic expression of several factors. These include (i) a change in weathering regime, i.e. increased influx of terrigenous material and clay under hot and humid conditions, (ii) a biocalcification crisis that triggered a shutdown of the carbonate factory due to CO2 saturation (Hautmann et al., 2008), (iii) loss of carbonate production due to eutrophication, (iv) rapid sea level rise manifested within a regression–transgression couplet (Hallam and Wignall, 1999), or (v) some combination of these factors.\nOur major element and mineral phase distribution data allow quantification of these processes. The major drop in calcite content at the Kössen/Kendlbach formation boundary is clearly shown by XRD data (Table 3) and CaO and total C concentration (Table 1). The boundary mudstone has the highest ratio of clay minerals vs. other detrital components (mainly quartz), as expressed by the Si/Al ratio (Fig. 3) and XRD data (Table 3). Therefore, the initial increase of detrital components was accompanied by peak abundance of clay minerals, marking a significant climatic signal. Sudden climate change to hot and humid conditions leading to intensification of weathering may well explain the terrestrial influx. Co-occurrence of dolomite and feldspar in two samples in the boundary mudstone (KB-6 and 13) suggests further episodic increases in terrestrial input, whereby immature detrital components could reach the depocenter. The amount of the siliciclastic detritus decreases upsection, reflecting either a decrease in humidity and/or transgression and increasing distance from terrigenous source areas.\nClay minerals are well-known indicators of climate. In the boundary mudstone the clay mineral composition is kaoliniteZ illiteþmuscovitebsmectite4chlorite. The predominance of kaolinite is commonly interpreted to suggest humid climate and intensive terrigenous input. Similar data are known from other TJB sections. Ahlberg et al. (2003) report a kaoliniteE illiteb chlorite and smectite (I/S) clay pattern from Rhaetian–Hettangian terrestrial sedimentary successions, and kaoliniteE illite4variable smectitebchlorite pattern from shallow marine deposits (Höganäs Formation) in southern Sweden. These authors concluded that the original detrital composition was better preserved in the shallow marine settings and infer warm, humid conditions and intense weathering. High amounts of kaolinite are also reported from the topmost Triassic Triletes beds in Germany, interpreted to reflect strongly leached soils that become enriched in aluminum (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2009). A pronounced increase in kaolinite also characterizes the TJB in sections of the Tatra Mts. (Slovakia), where a climatic driver was similarly invoked (Michalı́k et al., 2010).\nHigher up in the Kendlbachgraben section, above the boundary mudstone, the clay mineral pattern changes to illiteþmuscoviteb kaolinitebsmectite, which corresponds to a less humid and less hot climate. Therefore our results suggest that the extreme greenhouse conditions around the TJB were initially forced by volcanic CO2 degassing but had a limited temporal extent, which nevertheless coincided with the ETE and the onset of both the initial and main negative carbon anomalies."

    "heading": "5.3. Changes in redox conditions",
    "text": "Marine anoxia often accompanies greenhouse climate maxima due to reduced ocean circulation, and plays a role in extinction events. Specifically, oxygen-depleted facies across the TJB were noted from northwest Europe (Hallam, 1995). Although no longer a favoured scenario, this possible cause is still often considered for the end-Triassic extinction (Hallam and Wignall, 1997). However, in sections in Britain, anoxic sediments were shown to occur only above the main end-Triassic extinction horizon and initial carbon isotope excursion (Wignall and Bond, 2008). Within our dataset, the occurrence of pyrite, distribution of redox-sensitive elements, and relative abundance of Ce among the other REE permit evaluation if dysoxic or anoxic conditions developed around the TJB in the Kendlbachgraben section.\nPeak values of Fe and S within the boundary mudstone (see 4.1.) are tied to the occurrence of pyrite, as evidenced by XRD data (Table 3). SEM analyses reveal that framboidal pyrite of large size (up to 0.1–0.2 mm in diameter) is predominant, that suggests formation within the sediment under reducing conditions (Wignall et al., 2005), but it does not require the presence of anoxic bottom water.\nWater column oxygenation is suggested by the redox-sensitive elements, whose concentration remains low throughout the section (Fig. 4). Enrichment of these elements is most pronounced in the lowermost 10 cm of the boundary mudstone (samples KB-1, 2 and 3), which are therefore permissive of reducing environment above the sediment/water interface. However, this observation contradicts the presence of benthic bivalves, but is compatible with the abundance of fish remains and phosphate in KB-3. A second interval with a somewhat elevated concentration of redox-sensitive elements is encountered near the top of the studied section, in the early Hettangian.\nAs an independent redox indicator, the U/Th ratio remains low in most of the studied section, except between the samples KBLK2 and KB-3, where it goes up to as high as 8.5, possibly indicating oxygen-depleted conditions during deposition of the topmost Kössen Formation and the lowermost part of the boundary mudstone. This signal is comparable to that obtained by McRoberts et al. (1997) from another section in western Austria. Alternatively, the U/Th ratio at this level may also be influenced by volcanic input.\nInterpretation of changes in Ce abundance in the section is not straightforward. As analyses were carried out on bulk samples, the Ce signal of marine carbonate is mixed with that of the detrital component. Higher carbonate content is correlated with negative shifts in Ce concentration, suggesting that the marine carbonate is depleted in Ce, which in turn points to oxidative water favoring precipitation of trivalent Ce. Anoxic bottom waters are not indicated by the Ce signal.\nIn summary, widespread anoxia near the TJB is not compatible with our data; oxygen-depleted bottom water may only characterized brief intervals during the earliest phase of boundary mudstone deposition, coinciding with the temperature maximum inferred from the clay mineral climate proxy. Several other sections in the Eiberg Basin contain the red Schattwald beds immediately below the TJB; this hematite-bearing unit\nis a regional stratigraphic indicator of oxidized facies (Krystyn et al., 2005)."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "Our study has focused on a Triassic–Jurassic boundary (TJB) section at Kendlbachgraben in the Northern Calcareous Alps, within the same intraplatform basin as the recently selected base Jurassic Global Stratotype Section and Point. The much debated causation of the end-Triassic mass extinction (ETE) and broadly synchronous major carbon isotope excursions instigated our research. In particular, the aim of our multi-approach study was to search for stratigraphic evidence in this marine section for\ndistant volcanism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), widely regarded as a trigger of interrelated global climatic, environmental and biotic changes. The key findings of our study are the following:\n1. The topmost bed of the otherwise pure micritic limestone of the Rhaetian Kössen Formation contains goethite pseudomorphs of euhedral pyroxene and amphibole crystals. Such grains in this depositional environment are thought to represent distal fallout of a volcanic ash cloud. 2.\nThe same bed also yielded rounded or spherical grains of illite/ aluminoceladonite composition, interpreted as alteration products of airborne volcanic glass particles. Additional clay minerals restricted to this bed are low- to medium-charged\nsmectite and Mg-vermiculite, commonly formed by alteration of mafic volcanic material.\n3. Another characteristic feature of this bed is its enrichment in heavy rare earth elements, a pattern noted from some mantlederived mafic volcanics and documented from several flow units of the CAMP. This set of observed features is best explained by mafic volcanic material admixed to the carbonate from distal ash fallout, likely related to a CAMP eruption. 4.\nAfter the deposition of this layer, carbonate sedimentation of the Kössen Formation abruptly gave way to clay-rich, terrigenous sedimentation of the boundary mudstone and the overlying alternating mudstone, marl and marly limestone beds (topmost Rhaetian to lower Hettangian Tiefengraben Member of the Kendlbach Formation). Previous authors also noted the disappearance of Triassic ammonoid and conodont faunas and the onset of the initial carbon isotope excursion at this level. Thus this local facies change is best regarded as the record of far-reaching global changes immediately preceding the TJB, at the time of the ETE.\n5. Elemental geochemistry and clay mineralogy helped quantify the increase in terrigenous and clay mineral input at the expense of carbonate production. The lowermost 2 m of the boundary mudstone is particularly rich in kaolinite, signifying a sudden change in weathering regime possibly related to transient extreme greenhouse climate in the hinterland. 6.\nAbundant framboidal pyrite is present in the TJB interval, but its size suggests formation within the sediment rather than in an anoxic water column. Redox-sensitive minor elements and Ce also fail to support widespread oxygen-depleted conditions in the marine basin. Thus anoxia does not appear to play a fundamental role in the extinction.\nIn summary, independent geochemical, micromineralogical and clay mineralogical lines of evidence provide as yet the best direct link between end-Triassic volcanism and the marine stratigraphic record, where extinction and the carbon isotope anomaly are also present. The new data provide further support for a scenario where CAMP volcanism induced climate and other environmental change which in turn triggered the ETE and is also reflected in the TJB carbon isotope anomalies."

  "abstractText": "The end-Triassic extinction (ETE), one of the five largest Phanerozoic mass extinctions, is associated with rapid and severe environmental change, but existing data permit alternative models of causation. Volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) has been proposed as the main trigger, but direct evidence for this linkage is scarce. To help constrain scenarios for the ETE and other Triassic– from the Kendlbachgraben section in the Northern Calcareous Alps in Austria. The section belongs to the same paleogeographic unit (Eiberg Basin) and share similar stratigraphy with the recently selected base Jurassic Global Stratotype Section and Point at Kuhjoch. Micromineralogic study of the topmost bed of the Rhaetian Kössen Formation revealed pseudomorphs of altered, euhedral pyroxene and amphibole crystals. Their well-faceted morphology is consistent with their origin from distal mafic volcanic ash fallout. Spherical grains were also observed in the same bed, likely representing clay-altered volcanic glass. Clay minerals of this bed include lowto medium-charged smectite and Mg-vermiculite, both typical alteration products of mafic rocks. The same bed yielded a rare earth element pattern that differs from all other levels in an enrichment of heavy REEs, hinting at some minor contribution from mafic magmatic material. These features from a layer that was deposited very near to the TJB are interpreted as direct evidence of CAMP volcanism, coeval or immediately preceding the ETE and the initial negative carbon isotope anomaly. The kaolinite-dominated clay mineral spectrum of the overlying boundary mudstone records intensive weathering under hot and humid greenhouse conditions. Redox-sensitive minor and trace elements do not support the development of widespread anoxia in the studied section. Although pyrite is common in several layers, framboid size indicates formation within a reductive zone, below the sediment/water interface, rather than in an anoxic water column. Our data provide a direct link between uppermost Triassic marine strata and CAMP-derived material. They support scenarios where CAMP volcanism induced climate and other environmental change, which in turn triggered the ETE and that is also reflected in the carbon isotope anomalies. & 2012 Elsevier B.V.
