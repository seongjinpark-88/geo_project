B\nNeogene vicariance during the Miocene and Pliocene and Quaternary climate change have synergistically driven diversification in Mexican highland taxa. We investigated the impacts of these processes on genetic diversification in the widely distributed bunchgrass lizards in the Sceloporus scalaris group. We searched for correlations between timing in diversification and timing of (1) a period of marked volcanism across the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in central Mexico 3–7.5 million years ago (Ma) and (2) a transition to larger glacial–interglacial cycles during the mid-Pleistocene. From our phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA we identified two major clades that contained 13 strongly supported lineages. One clade contained lineages from the two northern sierras of Mexico, and the other clade included lineages associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Central Mexican Plateau. Results provided support for Neogene divergences within the S. scalaris group in response to uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a pattern observed in several co-distributed taxa, and suggested that Quaternary climate change likely had little effect on diversification between lineages. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during specific time periods appears to have strongly impacted diversification in Mexican highland taxa.\n2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

    "text": "Emerging patterns of historical diversification in the Mexican highlands suggest mixed responses in co-distributed taxa to past geological and climatic events despite a presumed shared history in the same region (Sullivan et al., 2000; León-Paniagua and Morrone, 2009; Bryson et al., 2011a). Neogene vicariance in the Miocene and Pliocene heavily influenced lineage divergences in some taxa (e.g., Castoe et al., 2009), while Quaternary climate change triggered increased diversification in others (e.g., Bryson et al., 2011b). The synergistic effects of Earth history and glacial– interglacial cycles, coupled with the complex topography of Mexico, appear to have produced a myriad of species-specific responses. Reconciling a common pattern of lineage diversification in Mexican highland taxa has proven difficult (Flores-Villela and Martínez-Salazar, 2009).\nAncient development over 30 million years ago (Ma) of most of the major mountains in Mexico (Ferrusquía-Villafranca and González-Guzmán, 2005) probably pre-dates diversification of the extant highland-adapted species. Neogene formation of the\nll rights reserved.\niences, University of Nevada, 154-4004, USA. ryson Jr.).\nTrans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TVB), however, undoubtedly affected both the timing and tempo of diversification in many montane species. This volcanic chain of mountains is one of the predominant geographical features of Mexico, and its geological development has been posited as a primary contributor to the biogeographical histories of numerous taxa (Mulcahy et al., 2006; Bryson et al., 2011c). Uplift of the TVB created new geographical barriers and montane habitats, but also linked previously isolated highland biotas (Anducho-Reyes et al., 2008). The complex geological history of this mountain range (Ferrusquía-Villafranca, 1993; Gómez-Tuena et al., 2007) unfortunately makes accurate dating of vicariant events presumably responsible for divergences among co-distributed taxa difficult. A recent revision on the past two decades of research on the origin of the TVB (Gómez-Tuena et al., 2007) suggests four major volcanic episodes during the Neogene formed most of the range. Two of these episodes (Fig. 1), one around 10–19 Ma and one about 3–7.5 Ma, resulted in major mountain formations that almost completely subdivided Mexico. Estimated mean divergence dates in several taxa distributed on or near this region are largely congruent with these two periods (Table 1). In particular, numerous divergences are remarkably similar at around 4–7 Ma. These dates suggest that the marked period of uplift around 3– 7.5 Ma may have had a comparatively stronger effect on lineage diversification than other periods of uplift.\nIn addition to Neogene vicariant events, Pleistocene climate change is expected to have an effect on biotic diversification across the Mexican highlands. Highland biotas were repeatedly fragmented during warm interglacial periods as pine–oak woodlands retracted to higher, cooler elevations (McDonald, 1993; Metcalfe et al., 2000; Gugger et al., 2011). Diversification in several highland taxa appears linked to Pleistocene climate change (León-Paniagua et al., 2007; Ruiz et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011b). The signal of Pleistocene divergence is likely to be particularly evident as amplitude and duration of glacial cycles increased during the mid-Pleistocene pluvial–interpluvial period beginning 0.9 Ma (Webb and Bartlein, 1992; Hewitt, 2000). Globally, these glacial processes im-\npacted diversification in a number of organisms (Hewitt, 1996, 2000).\nBunchgrass lizards in the Sceloporus scalaris group provide an attractive study system to assess influences of Neogene vicariance and Pleistocene climate change on the timing and tempo of lineage diversification across the Mexican highlands. Members of the S. scalaris group are widely distributed across montane grasslands associated with mixed pine–oak forests along the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, and TVB (Smith et al., 1993, 1996; Watkins-Colwell et al., 2006; Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S1). They occur on all sides of the TVB, so a diversification hypothesis invoking the uplift of this range can be tested. The S. scalaris group includes six monotypic species, S. slevini, S. samcolemani, S. chaneyi, S. goldmani, and S. bicanthalis, and two polytypic species, S. scalaris (S. s. scalaris, S. s. unicanthalis, S. s. brownorum) and S. aeneus (S. a. aeneus, S. a. subniger) (Smith et al., 1993; Watkins-Colwell et al., 2006).\nIn this study, we investigated the relative roles of Neogene vicariance and Quaternary climate change on lineage diversification in the S. scalaris group. We combined extensive range-wide sampling and mixed-model phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to formulate a robust hypothesis of matrilineal relationships. Concerns regarding the use of mtDNA gene estimates in analyses have been raised (e.g., Edwards and Bensch, 2009), yet this marker appears useful for detecting recent geographic patterns (Moore, 1995; Hudson and Coyne, 2002; Zink and Barrowclough, 2008; Barrowclough and Zink, 2009) and can lead to significant biogeographic discoveries (e.g., Upton and Murphy, 1997; Riddle et al., 2000). Molecular dating using mtDNA gene trees is also of concern since gene trees may overestimate divergence times (Jennings and Edwards, 2005; Burbrink and Pyron, 2011; Kubatko et al., 2011). However, overestimation may become less of an issue at deeper time scales (Edwards and Beerli, 2000), and some gene splits may better reflect the history of initial divergences (McCormack et al., 2008). To provide a temporal component to our matrilineal phylogeny of the S. scalaris group, we estimated dates of lineage divergences based on a relaxed molecular clock. We then searched for correlations between timing in diversification and timing of a period of TVB uplifting 3–7.5 Ma. We also investigated the impact of mid-Pleistocene climate oscillations on diversification within the S. scalaris group. Results provided insight into the emerging evolution of Mexican highland biota and the impacts of Neogene vicariance and climate change on lineage diversification."

    "text": "We obtained tissues from 72 S. scalaris group species (Table 2) from across their distributions (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S1). Taxonomic designations were made on the basis of male coloration, parity mode, and distribution maps (Smith et al., 1993, 1996; Watkins-Colwell et al., 2006). Sceloporus a. aeneus and S. a. subniger have recently been considered subspecies (Smith et al., 1993), full species (i.e., S. aeneus and S. subniger) (Wiens and Reeder, 1997; Wiens et al., 2010), or a single species (S. aeneus) (Benabib et al., 1997). We conservatively treated each as subspecies. We sampled three known localities of S. goldmani in Coahuila (Lemos-Espinal and Smith, 2007), but failed to find this species. At two localities (Sierra La Concordia and west of San Antonio de las Alazanas), we found only S. samcolemani. The third site near Gómez Farías was severely degraded desert grassland, and no S. scalaris group lizards were seen. Sceloporus goldmani may be extinct at lower elevations (Sinervo et al., 2010). We also failed to find S. a. subniger in northwestern Guanajuato. It has been suggested that this species\nhas been locally extirpated in this region (Mendoza-Quijano et al., 2001). We added partial gene sequences for 3 samples from GenBank to fill in sampling gaps (Table 2). We used S. graciosus and S. undulatus as outgroups based on previous phylogenetic studies (Wiens and Reeder, 1997; Wiens et al., 2010).\nWe sequenced two mtDNA gene regions, including NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 and flanking tRNAs (ND4) and ATPase subunits 8 and 6 (ATPase 8, ATPase 6). These gene regions have been previously shown to be informative at different levels of divergence within lizards (Leaché and Mulcahy, 2007; Lindell et al., 2008). Total genomic DNA was extracted from liver or tail clips using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s recommendations. All gene regions were amplified via PCR in a mix containing 6.25 ll Takara ExTaq Polymerase Premix (Takara Mirus Bio Inc., Madison, WI, USA), 4.25 ll double-distilled water, 0.5 ll each primer (10 ll), and 1.0 ll of template DNA. Primer sequences for ND4 are given in Arévelo et al. (1994), and for ATPase were specifically designed for this project (C2LF, 50-ATCTGCGGGTCAAACCACAG-30; C3LR, 50- GCGTGTGYTTGGTGGGTCAT-30). DNA was denatured initially at 95 C for 2.5 min; 35–40 cycles of amplification were then performed under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 C for 1 min, annealing at 56 C for 1 min, and extension at 72 C for 1 min; this was followed by a final 10 min elongation at 72 C. Double-stranded PCR amplified products were checked by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, purified using exonuclease and shrimp phosphatase, and directly sequenced in both directions with the amplification primers using a Big Dye Terminator v. 3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The completed sequencing reactions were cleaned of excess dyes using CentriSep spin columns (Princeton Separations, Inc.,\nAdelphia, NJ), and sequences were visualized on an ABI Prism 3130 capillary autosequencer. Forward and reverse sequences for each individual were edited and manually aligned using Sequencher 4.2 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI)."

    "heading": "2.2. Phylogenetic analyses",
    "text": "We analyzed our sequence data using Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic methods. Bayesian inference analyses were conducted using MrBayes 3.1 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) on the combined mtDNA dataset, implementing separate models for each gene region (ND4, tRNAs, ATPase 8, ATPase 6). For the three GenBank samples (Table 2), only available ND4 and associated tRNAs sequence data were included in analyses. MrModeltest 2.1 (Nylander, 2004) was used to select a best-fit model of evolution, based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), for each partition. Bayesian settings included random starting trees, a variable rate prior, a mean branch length exponential prior of 100, and heating temperature of 0.04. Analyses consisted of four runs (nruns = 4) conducted each with three heated and one cold Markov chain sampling every 100 generations for 4 million generations. Output parameters were visualized using the program TRACER v1.4 (Rambaut and Drummond, 2007) to ascertain stationarity and whether the duplicated runs had converged on the same mean likelihood. Convergence was further assessed by evaluating posterior probability clade-support values post burn-in using AWTY (Nylander et al., 2008). After determining chain convergence, which occurred during the first 500,000 generations of each run, we conservatively discarded all samples obtained during the first 1 million (25%) generations as burn-in. A 50% majority-rule consensus phylogram with nodal\nposterior probability support was estimated from the combination of the four runs post burn-in. Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted using RAxML 7.0.3 (Stamatakis, 2006) with the same partitioning scheme used for the BI analyses. The GTRGAMMA model was used, and 1000 nonparametric bootstrap replicates were performed to assess nodal support. We considered those nodes with P95% Bayesian posterior probability and P70% bootstrap support as strongly supported (Hillis and Bull, 1993; Felsenstein, 2004)."

    "heading": "2.3. Divergence dating",
    "text": "Divergence dates were estimated using a Bayesian molecular clock framework implemented in the program BEAST v1.6.1 (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007). Two different methods for estimating divergence times were used. Because of potential problems associated with model parameter variance across heterogeneous datasets (Ho, 2005; Guiher and Burbrink, 2008), divergence estimates were inferred for a reduced dataset, which included one individual from each geographically structured lineage. The first method utilized a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal clock and node constraints obtained from the fossil record. To calibrate the tree, we included sequences from several outgroups (Table 3). The second method employed a substitution rate calibration and based on a likelihood ratio test that rejected the null hypothesis of clock-like evolution (likelihood ratio test statistic 30.55, df = 15, P > 0.05), we used a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal clock. We used a mtDNA rate calibration previously calculated from a similar sized lizard (Macey et al., 1999). This substitution rate, here corrected to 8.05 10 3 substitutions/site/million year using a more complex GTR + G model, has been used in a number of studies to date divergences in lizards (e.g., Morando et al., 2004; Tennessen and Zamudio, 2008; Luxbacher and Knouft, 2009). For both datasets, best-fit models of evolution were re-estimated using MrModeltest, and unlinked across partitions.\nFor each method, analyses consisted of two independent runs each of 40 million generations, with samples retained every 1000 generations, and with a Yule tree prior. Results were displayed in TRACER to confirm acceptable mixing and likelihood stationarity, appropriate burn-in, and adequate effective sample sizes above 200 for all estimated parameters. After discarding the first 4 million generations (10%) as burn-in, the trees and parameter estimates from the two runs were combined using LogCombiner v1.6.1 (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007). The parameter values of the samples from the posterior distribution were summarized on\nthe maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAnnotator v1.6.1 (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007), with the posterior probability limit set to zero and mean node heights summarized.\nFor calibrated analyses, three fossil constraints taken from the paleoherpetological literature were used: (1) the oldest known fossils referable to Sceloporus from the Early Miocene (Arikareean North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA); Robinson and Van Devender, 1973; Yatkola, 1976; Holman, 1970, 1995), (2) the oldest known fossils referable to S. jarrovii from the Middle Miocene (Hemingfordian NALMA; Yatkola, 1976; Estes, 1983), and (3) the oldest known fossil of S. undulatus from the Pliocene (Blancan NALMA; Rogers, 1976; Estes, 1983). The stem of Sceloporus was constrained with a zero offset (hard lower bound) of 20 Ma, a lognormal mean of 0.7, and a lognormal standard deviation of 1.0. This produced a median age of 22 Ma and a 95% prior credible interval (PCI) extending to the end of the Arikareean 30 Ma. The stem of the S. jarrovii clade (Table 3) was constrained with a zero offset of 16 Ma representing the end of the Hemingfordian, a lognormal mean of 0.7, and a lognormal standard deviation of 0.5. This produced a median age of 18 Ma and a 95% PCI extending to the end of the Hemingfordian 20 Ma. The node representing the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the S. undulatus clade (Table 3) was constrained with a zero offset of 1.8 Ma (the end of the Blancan), a lognormal mean of 0.1, and a lognormal standard deviation of 0.65. This produced a median age of 3 Ma and a 95% prior credible interval (PCI) extending to the end of the Blancan 5 Ma. These lognormal distributions with hard lower bounds best reflect the prediction, based on the high likelihood of fossil non-preservation, that any true divergence date will probably be older than the oldest known fossil, rather than younger (Ho and Phillips, 2009; Kelly et al., 2009)."

    "text": "We employed two methodological approaches to test for differential diversification rates across the S. scalaris group mtDNA phylogeny. The first method compared inferred topological distribution to a stochastic distribution to determine if diversification rate shifted across the tree. Our second approach compared the temporal distribution of inferred divergence events to a randomly created distribution to test when and where shifts in diversification took place along our phylogeny. If Neogene uplifting of the TVB affected diversification rates in the S. scalaris group, then diversification rates should shift near the root of the clade or clades containing TVB species (S. aeneus, S. bicanthalis). If rate shifts are associated with one of the major volcanic episodes that occurred 3–7.5 Ma, then most divergences should have happened during this time period. Likewise, if mid-Pleistocene climate change affected diversification rates, then rates should shift near the tips of the phylogeny during the start of extreme glacial periods 0.9 Ma.\nThe program SymmeTREE v1.1 (Chan and Moore, 2005) and was used to test the general hypothesis of variation in diversification rates across the S. scalaris group mtDNA phylogeny. The batch processing option was applied using the posterior probability distribution of 1000 post burn-in trees generated from the rate-calibrated BEAST analyses. Trees from the posterior distribution of our fossil-calibrated BEAST analyses were not selected since we lacked complete sampling of the entire Sceloporus species tree (Wiens et al., 2010), which could bias results (Moore and Chan, 2007). We used a taxon-size sensitive (TSS) equal-rates Markov (ERM) branching model to resolve polytomies. Equalrates Markov models assume that each terminal in an expanding tree has an equal and independent probability of splitting and uses a random taxon-addition approach to resolve polytomies. The number of random resolutions was set to 10,000 whole trees.\nTo calculate P-values for the tree statistics implemented in SymmeTREE, we generated a null distribution of 1 million simulated trees with the same number of species as the observed trees under the ERM model. Likelihood ratio-based delta statistics were estimated to locate diversification rate shifts in certain areas of the phylogeny, if present. SymmeTREE does not provide a batch-summary block for the shift statistics, so P-value ranges were visually inspected in output blocks.\nWe analyzed temporal shifts in diversification rates using MLbased diversification-rate analysis (Rabosky, 2006a). Divergence dates estimated from both calibration methods in BEAST were used. The fit of different birth–death models implementing two constant rates (pure-birth and birth–death) and four variable rates (exponential and logistic density-dependent, and two-rate and three-rate pure-birth) was computed with laser 2.3 (Rabosky, 2006b). Model fit was measured using AIC scores. Significance of the change in AIC scores (DAICrc) between the best rate-constant and best rate-variable model was determined by creating a null distribution for DAICrc. This was done by simulating 1000 trees using yuleSim in laser with the same number of nodes and the same speciation rate as that estimated under the pure-birth model. We additionally generated a lineage-through-time (LTT) plot using the plotLtt function in laser to visualize the pattern of accumulation of log-lineages over time."

Models of sequence evolution selected for the partitions were GTR + I + G (ND4, ATPase 8, ATPase 6), and HKY + I + G (tRNA). All sequences were deposited in GenBank (JN985597–JN985737).\nWithin the S. scalaris group, we identified two major mtDNA clades that contained 13 strongly supported, geographically structured lineages (Figs. 4 and 5). One clade contained samples from the two major sierras of northern Mexico (‘northern clade’). Samples geographically proximate to the TVB grouped together with samples from the Central Mexican Plateau in a ‘southern clade’. Four lineages within these clades corresponded to the species S. chaneyi, S. samcolemani, S. slevini, and S. bicanthalis. Three lineages represented the subspecies S. s. scalaris, S. s. unicanthalis, and S. s. brownorum. The species S. aeneus appeared to be a composite of four distinct lineages, none of which uniquely encompassed the two subspecies S. a. aeneus and S. a. subniger. These four lineages were geographically structured, and labeled ‘aeneus West’, ‘aeneus Central’, ‘aeneus East’, and ‘aeneus South’. Two lineages represented undescribed taxa, one previously assigned to S. s. brownorum from Aguascalientes (Smith et al., 1997), and one previously considered\nS. s. scalaris from Tapalpa, Jalisco (Watkins-Colwell et al., 1996). Additional geographic structure was present within S. slevini, S. samcolemani, and S. bicanthalis (Fig. 3).\nRelationships among lineages within the southern clade were in general difficult to infer. Collapsing the weakly supported S. bicanthalis + aeneus West sister relationship formed a large basal polytomy of four lineages and two smaller clades (aeneus South + aeneus Central/S. s. scalaris, and Aguascalientes + S. s. unicanthalis). In the northern clade, the two Sierra Madre Oriental lineages S. chaneyi and S. samcolemani were sister, and the two Sierra Madre Occidental lineages S. slevini and S. s. brownorum were sister. Together these two mountains formed a strongly supported sister relationship."

Estimated dates of divergences using both methods of clock calibration differed (Fig. 5). Based on the fossil-calibrated analyses, mean substitution rate within the S. scalaris group more closely approached 1.2 10 2 substitutions/ site/million year (2.4% between lineages per million years), which is faster than the rate we used for rate-calibrated analyses (1.61% between lineages per million years). Additionally, the branching order in each maximum clade credibility tree (Fig. 5) differed as a result of rearrangements of several weakly supported nodes. Despite these differences, the majority of divergences between lineages estimated by both methods appear to predate the pluvial–interpluvial period of the mid-Pleistocene (Fig. 5). In the southern clade, mean divergence dates fell largely within an episode of TVB volcanism 3–7.5 Ma."

Examination of delta statistics for individual trees, however, reveal numerous significant (P = 0.05) diversification rate shifts along the branch leading to the southern clade of the S. scalaris group. This clade contains all lineages associated with the TVB.\nBirth–death likelihood analyses rejected the null hypothesis of rate-constancy for both datasets (P = 0.001 fossil-calibrated, P = 0.005 rate-calibrated). The rate-variable model that best fit each dataset differed (Table 4). For the fossil-calibrated dataset, the logistic density-dependent (DDL) model provided a better fit. Under this model, diversification rate in the S. scalaris group has gradually decreased through time, with diversification rate estimated at 0.73 divergences per million years. The three-rate birth-death (Yule3) model provided the best fit to the rate-calibrated dataset. According to the scenario suggested by this model (Fig. 5), net diversification rate in the S. scalaris group increased dramatically at 6.8 Ma from 0.1 to 0.42 divergences per million years, then decreased at 4 Ma to 0.03. These shifts correspond well with predicted diversification rate changes associated with uplifting of the TVB 3–7.5 Ma.\nIt is worth noting that alternative rate-variable models may also be a good fit to the data (Table 4). For the fossil-calibrated dataset, the best-fit DDL model differs in AIC from the next best-fit ratevariable model, Yule3, by a value of only 0.98. Here, net diversification rate increased at about 5.5 Ma and decreased at 2.8 Ma (Fig. 5). Much of this period falls within the predicted range of TVB uplifting. Diversification rate was initially 0.08 divergences per million years, increased to 0.5, then declined to 0.04.

    "text": "Neogene vicariance appears to be the primary driver of diversification between lineages in the S. scalaris group. Divergences were temporally and geographically congruent with distinct periods of uplift across the TVB. The earliest divergence between the northern and southern clades around the Middle to Late Miocene (Fig. 5) coincide with the first major TVB volcanic episode 10–19 Ma (Gómez-Tuena et al., 2007). Diversification rate appears to have then shifted around 4–7 Ma. This time period is largely coincidental with a second marked period of volcanism along the TVB 3– 7.5 Ma (Rosas-Elguera et al., 2003; Gómez-Tuena et al., 2007; Fig. 1). Diversification rate changes may have been driven by rapid divergences between lineages along the TVB, as indicated by our topological analyses.\nAccumulating evidence posits uplifting of the TVB as a strong driver of diversification in highland taxa. Despite the complex nature of orogenesis (Ferrusquía-Villafranca, 1993; Gómez-Tuena et al., 2007), most mean lineage divergence dates in the S. scalaris group and co-distributed taxa associated with the TVB fall within 4–7 Ma. Exceptions among lowland taxa at the western edge of\nthe TVB that split around 8–16 Ma (Mateos et al., 2002), 9.6 Ma (Devitt, 2006), and 13 Ma (Bryson et al., 2010) paired with our estimated basal split in the S. scalaris group during this same time frame suggest the initial volcanic episode across the TVB approximately 10–19 Ma may also be an important driver of lineage diversification. Future studies of highland Mexican taxa with distributions spanning the TVB should test for a causative link between diversification and uplift of the TVB. Two main episodes of volcanic uplift, in particular one that occurred about 3–7.5 Ma, appear to have strong roles in driving lineage diversification across the TVB."

    "heading": "4.2. Neogene diversification in northern Mexico",
    "text": "While diversification in the S. scalaris group was centered around the TVB, several other Neogene divergences appeared to have occurred in northern Mexico. Most notable is an inferred Middle to Late Miocene divergence between Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental lineages (Fig. 5). While a close biotic relationship has been inferred between these two mountain ranges (Marshall and Liebherr, 2000), our estimated dates of divergence far predate the Pleistocene when the highland biota of the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental were probably connected by a continuous corridor of montane vegetation (Gugger et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011b). Rather, our estimated divergence dates more closely approximate inferred Neogene splits in other taxa (Mexican jays, McCormack et al., 2008, 2011; alligator lizards, Zaldívar-Riverón et al., 2005).\nSeveral geographically structured maternal groups are embedded within the Sierra Madre Occidental and northern Sierra Madre Oriental (Fig. 4). Interestingly, several co-distributed highland species show similar fine-scale geographic subdivisions within these mountain ranges (Gugger et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011b,c). However, estimated dates of divergences between embedded lineages in these studies vary, and range from Miocene to Pleistocene. This suggests that deep canyons that bisect these mountains and low elevation xeric habitats (Fig. 2) may be acting as overlooked filter barriers that promote diversification through time (Wiens, 2004)."

    "heading": "4.3. Quaternary impacts on lineage diversification",
    "text": "Quaternary climate change appears to have had little effect on diversification between lineages in the S. scalaris group. Nearly all divergences within the group predate the major pluvial–interpluvial cycles beginning around 0.9 Ma in the mid-Pleistocene (Fig. 5). Depending on the method of molecular clock calibration we used, few mean estimated divergences fell within the Pleistocene (Fig. 5). This finding suggests most lineages in the S. scalaris group might be the products of pre-Quaternary fragmentation. Diversification may have occurred in concert with Neogene orogeny and the expansion of C4 grasslands (Neiswenter and Riddle, 2010), and Pleistocene connectivity of previously fragmented highland biotas (Gugger et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011b) did not erase Neogene genetic footprints. The S. scalaris group may thus be unique among similar co-distributed highland taxa with widespread distributions in Mexico that show varying degrees of Pleistocene diversification between lineages (Zaldívar-Riverón et al., 2005; Moreno-Letelier and Piñero, 2009; Gugger et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011a,b,c; McCormack et al., 2011).\nRecent studies (Burbrink and Pyron, 2011; Kubatko et al., 2011; McCormack et al., 2011) have provided evidence that divergence times can be significantly overestimated using gene-tree based approaches such as ours that do not correct for genetic divergences that predate speciation. Multilocus species-tree approaches that incorporate coalescent stochasticity generally estimate more recent times of divergences. If this is true, then many of the relatively\nancient inferred divergences in the S. scalaris group may actually be much younger, placing more divergences within the Pleistocene. However, mtDNA might better reflect the history of initial divergence, especially if nuclear gene flow across lineage boundaries erases or obscures nuclear gene divergences (McCormack et al., 2011). Future studies should incorporate multilocus data and coalescent species-tree models to re-evaluate our divergence estimates. Comparisons of divergence dates in co-distributed taxa across shared biogeographic barriers should then be made based on species tree estimates rather than gene tree estimates."

    "heading": "5. Conclusion",
    "text": "The S. scalaris group has proven useful for studying the impacts of Neogene vicariance and Quaternary climate change on diversification in a wide-ranging highland organism. Our results have broad implications for understanding impacts of shared historical events on co-distributed species. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is a strong driver of lineage diversification. At least one episode of widespread volcanism in the Late Miocene and Pliocene heavily impacted highland taxa. Extreme climatic oscillations in the Pleistocene, a key driver of diversification between lineages in some taxa (León-Paniagua et al., 2007; Ruiz et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011b), did not substantially affect diversification rates in all Mexican highland species.\nThe Mexican highlands are considered one of the world’s great biodiversity hotspots (Mittermeier et al., 2005), yet our understanding of the evolutionary drivers generating this diversity remains fragmentary (McCormack et al., 2008; Bryson et al., 2011c). Diversification in the S. scalaris group is a good example of how the complex dynamics between past geological and climatic events work together to shape biodiversity. The addition of future studies linking genetic diversity of Mexican highland taxa with their paleohistories will provide further insight into the historical processes responsible for diversification in this complex system."

B Neogene vicariance during the Miocene and Pliocene and Quaternary climate change have synergistically driven diversification in Mexican highland taxa. We investigated the impacts of these processes on genetic diversification in the widely distributed bunchgrass lizards in the Sceloporus scalaris group. We searched for correlations between timing in diversification and timing of (1) a period of marked volcanism across the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in central Mexico 3–7.5 million years ago (Ma) and (2) a transition to larger glacial–interglacial cycles during the mid-Pleistocene. From our phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA we identified two major clades that contained 13 strongly supported lineages. One clade contained lineages from the two northern sierras of Mexico, and the other clade included lineages associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Central Mexican Plateau. Results provided support for Neogene divergences within the S. scalaris group in response to uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a pattern observed in several co-distributed taxa, and suggested that Quaternary climate change likely had little effect on diversification between lineages. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during specific time periods appears to have strongly impacted diversification in Mexican highland taxa. 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
