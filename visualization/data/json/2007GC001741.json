Bergantz Department of Earth and Space Science, University of Washington, Box 351310, Seattle, Washington, 98195, USA (bergantz@u.washington.edu)\n[1] The explosive eruption of voluminous silicic magmas often produces widespread and massive deposits formed from pyroclastic density currents. While these punctuated events dramatically alter the landscape and have potential climate-altering impact, our understanding of the internal structure and transport dynamics of these eruptions is hampered by a lack of direct observations. We utilize the natural boundary conditions encountered by the eruption of the Kos Plateau Tuff to probe its internal structure as well as constrain the neotectonic activity in the region and eruption duration of this moderate to large (>60 km3) event. At the time of the eruption, 161 ka, the lower sea level in the Mediterranean may have resulted in flows that traversed mostly land to the north of the eruptive vent, while flows to the south may have encountered an expanse of water. Steep topography and overwater transport can impede the transport of the dense basal portions of the flow where particles make multiple or sustained contact with the bed. We use an Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian computational approach coupled with overwater and overland boundary conditions, including topography, to determine the role of bed load versus suspended load in the transport of these flows. We find that a ring vent structure and eruptive fluxes greater than 2 106 m3/s are required for the spatial distribution of the KPT. The maximum grain size and deposit locations of the first voluminous ignimbrite unit (D) can be explained by suspended flow to the south, consistent with overwater transport, and bed load and suspended load transport to the north, consistent with overland transport. However, the maximum lithic size for the largest and last ignimbrite unit (E) requires some bed load transport in all directions. We propose that the boundary conditions were significantly altered during the course of the eruption, through either the in-filling of a shallow sea to the south or the development of a thick pumice raft to aid saltation. On the basis of the inferred eruptive flux, we estimate that the duration of the eruption climax, in which most of the material was erupted, likely only lasted from a few hours to a day.\nComponents: 9324 words, 13 figures, 2 tables.\nKeywords: pyroclastic flow; eruption dynamics; Aegean volcanism; bed load; suspended load; caldera-forming eruption.\nIndex Terms: 8428 Volcanology: Explosive volcanism; 8404 Volcanology: Volcanoclastic deposits; 8440 Volcanology: Calderas.\nReceived 2 July 2007; Revised 18 September 2007; Accepted 12 October 2007; Published 21 December 2007.\nG3GeochemistryGeophysicsGeosystems Published by AGU and the Geochemical Society AN ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF THE EARTH SCIENCES\nArticle\nVolume 8, Number 12\n21 December 2007\nQ12007, doi:10.1029/2007GC001741\nISSN: 1525-2027\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union 1 of 18\nDufek, J., and G.

    "text": "[2] The largest known eruption of the south Aegean Arc produced the Kos Plateau Tuff (161 ka) with over 60 km3 of rhyolitic material, DRE [Allen, 2001]. Similar to other moderate to large volume eruptive deposits, the Kos Plateau Tuff is dominated by voluminous ignimbrites, inferred to be emplaced by pyroclastic flows formed during eruptive column collapse [Allen, 2001; Allen and Cas, 2001]. While voluminous ignimbrites are relatively abundant in the geologic record, many aspects of the transport and emplacement mechanisms responsible for their origin remain poorly constrained [Branney and Kokelaar, 2002; Wilson and Hildreth, 2003]. It is apparent that these ground-hugging flows are sensitive to topographic features [Fisher et al., 1993]; however, the way in which the spatiotemporal variability in flow concentration as well as the runout distance reacts to variable bed conditions is a source of uncertainty in conceptual and numerical models of pyroclastic flow transport [Branney and Kokelaar, 2002; Dobran et al., 1994; Fisher et al., 1993; Valentine and Wohletz, 1989].The Kos Plateau Tuff eruption may have been the site of both overwater and overland transport of pyroclastic flows, providing the opportunity to distinguish different transport mechanisms from a single eruption [Allen and Cas, 2001].\n[3] During eruption, pyroclastic flows are likely vertically graded in particle volume fraction (highest concentration near the bed) due to gravitational settling and entrainment of ambient atmosphere [Branney and Kokelaar, 1997; Valentine, 1987]. Enhanced particle-concentration near the bed (bed load) exceeding values from gravitational settling alone, can develop when transport conditions favor saltation (multiple particle-bed collisions) and frictional contact between particles and the bed, often in high shear-stress conditions [Cagnoli and Manga, 2004]. This results in much greater particle concentration and momentum flux near the bed compared to flows maintained only by turbulent suspension (suspended load) [Dufek and Bergantz, 2007]. As the particle volume fraction and momentum flux ultimately determine the destructive force of these flows, a better understanding of pyroclastic flow-bed coupling is necessary for\nmore accurate hazard assessments as well as interpreting deposits of previous eruptions.\n[4] The transport of pyroclastic flows over bodies of water may provide a way to better understand the portion of a pyroclastic flow that comes in contact with the bed versus that which is primarily suspended before deposition. The abundance of volcanoes near bodies of water has resulted in numerous historic and preserved eruptions that have traversed large bodies of water [Allen and Cas, 2001; Burgisser, 2004; Carey et al., 1996; Druitt and Francavigilia, 1992; Fisher et al., 1993; LaCroix, 1904; Miller and Smith, 1977; Robin et al., 1994]. Many other overwater eruptions have likely occurred, but remain obscured due to lack of substantial subaerial deposit exposure. A number of interactions may occur at a pyroclastic flowwater interface as revealed by analog experiments [Freundt, 2003] and numerical simulations [Dufek and Bergantz, 2007; Dufek et al., 2007], including phase change at the water surface and loss of mass and momentum of pyroclastic particles that settle through the water surface. Tsunami, primarily generated from water displacement as pyroclastic flows enter the ocean, are one example of a momentum transfer mechanism with far-reaching consequences [Carey et al., 1996; Mattioli et al., 2007; Watts and Waythomas, 2003]. Steam explosions, or littoral blasts, can be generated when pyroclastic flows first enter the water provided the grain size distribution is fine enough that energy transfer from particle to water is rapid [Dufek et al., 2007; Edmonds and Herd, 2005; Mastin and Witter, 2000; Zimanowski et al., 1997]. In the far field, the loss of particles through the water surface, i.e., a leaky boundary, can also significantly impact the concentration and runout distance of a pyroclastic flow [Dufek and Bergantz, 2007].\n[5] We perform a series of numerical simulations of the Kos Plateau Tuff eruption to better understand the role of bed load and suspended load in large ignimbrite forming eruptions as well as to provide an additional constraint to the ongoing discussion of the neotectonic and sea level history of the eastern Aegean. We consider the effect of both leaky (overwater) and saltation (overland) boundaries on the dynamics and deposit distribu-\n2 of 18\ntions of these flows. The present deposits of the Kos Plateau Tuff, especially distal deposits, are primarily valley-ponded and influenced substantially by regional topography. To provide comparison between the observed deposits and the numerical simulations we performed a suite of two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations to assess the role of both topography and overwater/overland conditions on the transport of these flows. In section 2 we review the stratigraphic framework of the Kos Plateau Tuff deposits, focusing on the voluminous unit D and E ignimbrites. We then develop an Eulerian-EulerianLagrangian numerical model in section 3. We apply this approach in two-dimensions over a broad range of parameters in section 4 to constrain the effect of vent parameters and compare the simulations with known depositional patterns. In section 5 we extend this approach to three-dimensions for a more detailed assessment of deposit distribution, flow dynamics and the dispersal of lithic clasts. These results constrain the eruptive flux, duration of the eruption and the nature of the boundary conditions\nover which flows were transported as discussed in sections 6 and 7."

    "text": "[6] Sea level reconstructions suggest that the Kos Plateau Tuff eruption may have produced pyroclastic flows that traversed both land and water during a single eruptive episode [Allen and Cas, 2001]. The Mediterranean sea level 161 ka was likely 60–80 m lower than current conditions and the shallow sea to the north of the island of Kos and extending to Kalymnos (Figure 1) was likely subaerially exposed [Allen and Cas, 2001]. On the basis of this reconstruction, Allen and Cas [2001] also inferred that flows to the south and deposited on the island of Tilos and the Turkish peninsula of Datca traveled primarily over open water.\n[7] To help clarify the neotectonic and sea level history a seismic reflection experiment was conducted by Pe-Piper et al. [2005]. Seismic reflection profiles in the West Kos Basin (between Kos and Nisyros) indicate offset of acoustically incoherent deposits interpreted to be the Kos Plateau Tuff that Pe-Piper et al. [2005] have hypothesized is a result of neotectonic subsidence along a series of eastwest faults. However, it is difficult to discern how much subsidence in this area is a result of caldera collapse or post-eruptive neotectonic subsidence. On the basis of this offset, Pe-Piper et al. [2005] suggest much of the area between Kos and Tilos was either a shallow marine environment or subaerially exposed, in contrast with the Allen and Cas [2001] interpretation.\n[8] The stratigraphy and grain size characteristics of the Kos Plateau Tuff have been described in detail by Allen and co-workers [Allen, 2001; Allen and Cas, 2001; Allen et al., 1999]. The KPT is best preserved on Kos, but also occurs on the neighboring Greek islands of Tilos, Kalymnos, Pachia, as well as on the Turkish peninsula of Bodrum and Datca (Figure 1). Isopach, isopleth and transport direction data indicate that the vent areas for the KPT were situated in the bay on the southwest part of Kos (west Kos Basin). The eruption formed a caldera at least 6–11 km in diameter. Subsequent activity such as the Nisyros composite volcano, the Yali pumice cone and rhyolitic lavas, the Pleistocene-recent Strongyle basaltic andesite cone, and several submarine volcanoes in the area of Yali and Nisyros all indicate that the Kos system remains magmatically active.\n3 of 18\n[9] Six main units define the stratigraphy of the KPT [Allen, 2001]. Ignimbrite units D and E dominate, with thicknesses that range from 5 to greater than 15 m, and overlay a fall unit (A) and low-angle cross-stratified units (B and C). Unit D is about 10 km3 (DRE) and consists of three ignimbrites, which extend 39 km from the source. Unit E is more voluminous with a volume of >30 km3 (DRE), is composed of two ignimbrites and is interpreted as the eruption climax. The eruption began and ended with phreato-plinian activity, but the even more explosive and calderaforming phases (D and E) were likely a result of ‘‘dry’’ fragmentation based on the observation of clean (non-adhering ash) finely vesiculated tube pumices [Allen et al., 1999]. The distal portions of the KPT on the Datca Peninsula, Tilos, Bodrum\nand Kalymnos were deposited at similar elevations and distance from the source. Thus variations in the nature of the pyroclastic deposits can be used as a means of comparing and contrasting the mechanics and deposits to help distinguish whether flows have traveled over land or water.\n[10] The distribution of lithic fragments provides a constraint on the dynamics of the large ignimbriteproducing flows (Figure 2). Most (>80%) of the lithic fragments in the KPT are andesite clasts. Since most of the exposed ‘‘bedrock’’ on Kos (and neighboring islands) are soft sediments and limestone, these lithics are likely derived from near the original vent (either a pre-eruptive edifice or the eruptive conduit) and are not likely picked up during transport. The maximum lithic size from\n4 of 18\nunit D are significantly smaller in flows that have traversed to the south, potentially as a result of lithic loss through a water boundary. Likewise the deposit thickness is much less in sections where the flow has thought to have crossed water, which may indicate that a significant amount of dense lower portion of the flow was lost during transport. This stands in contrast to the more voluminous and coarser E flows that have a fairly uniform thickness up to 40 km from the source, and have no distinguishable maximum lithic size variations between flows that have been hypothesized to cross water compared to those thought to have crossed land."

    "text": "[11] We conducted a suite of two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations of the Kos eruption to better understand the role of the basal boundary condition on pyroclastic flow transport during moderate to large eruptive events. We incorporated both leaky and saltation boundary conditions into continuum multiphase numerical simulations, based on the MFIX (multiphase flow with interface\nexchanges) approach adapted for volcanic flows [Dufek and Bergantz, 2005; Gera et al., 2004; Syamlal et al., 1993]. Both the boundary condition approach and the numerical method were validated by Dufek and Bergantz [2007] for particle-laden gravity currents, by comparing the results to direct numerical simulations and experimental results. For a detailed discussion of the continuum multiphase approach used in these simulations we refer the reader to Dufek and Bergantz [2007] that used the same approach. Similar to other continuum multiphase numerical approaches applied to volcanic conditions [Clarke et al., 2002; Dartevelle et al., 2004; Dufek and Bergantz, 2005; Neri et al., 2002; Todesco et al., 2006], separate continua (gas and particle) equations for mass, momentum and energy conservation are used to describe the physical system. We summarize the continua equations below. The gas and particle continuity equations are given as\n@ @t gagrð Þ þ @ @xi gagrgU ið Þ ¼ 0; ð1Þ\nand\n@ @t sasrð Þ þ @\n@xi\nsasrsU ið Þ ¼ 0; ð2Þ\nrespectively.

Constitutive relations required to close the momentum and\n5 of 18\nthermal energy equations are described in detail by Dufek and Bergantz [2007]. For collisional transfer of momentum, the constitutive relation for the particle phase is provided by kinetic theory similar to that used in the estimation of gas viscosities from molecular collisions [Dufek and Bergantz, 2005; Lun et al., 1984]. This constitutive relation assumes binary, inelastic particle collisions. The collision rate and stress in the granular material depends on the fluctuating particle velocity. A separate transport equation for pseudo-thermal energy is solved in order to determine the granular temperature (variance of the velocity distribution) and close the granular stress in dilute conditions. Pseudo-thermal energy is assumed to be advected by the mean flow and diffuses along gradients in the granular temperature. Locally pseudo-thermal energy is produced by shear and by the relative velocity between the particle and gas phases [Agrawal et al., 2001] and is dissipated by inelastic collisions and by viscous damping by the carrier fluid. The production of fluctuating motions by gas-particle slip and dissipation by viscous forces ensures that the granular pseudo-thermal energy equation is coupled to the carrier fluid. At higher particle volume fractions, protracted frictional interaction of particles occurs and the frictional and collisional stresses are assumed to be additive [Savage, 1998; Syamlal, 1987]. The frictional stress is developed using the postulate of a yield\nfunction and an associated flow-rule to relate stress and strain rate, and has been adopted from theories of soil mechanics. The solids pressure in the frictional regime allows the solid phases to have some compressibility, but provides a resisting force to prevent unphysical void fractions. In the limit of volume fractions approaching the minimum void fraction both the frictional pressure and granular shear viscosity approach infinity, which prevents further circulation of material. A modified k-e turbulence model is used to predict Reynolds stresses produced by fluctuating fluid motion. This approach accounts for production and dissipation of turbulent energy due to the presence of a dispersed phase [Peirano and Leckner, 1998].\n[13] The boundary conditions for both the saltation and the leaky (or overwater) boundaries were derived by Dufek and Bergantz [2007]. The saltation boundary is maintained by imposing a velocity gradient across the boundary using a ghost cell technique. The velocity gradient relation is adapted from Johnson and Jackson [1987] given as\n@u @y ¼ sag0 3qð Þ:5fpsrUslip 6 sa0ð Þgm ; ð7Þ\nwhere f is the specularity coefficient (here we specify a constant value of 0.02 based on the experimental comparison of Benyahia et al. [2005]) and Uslip is the slip velocity at the boundary. We note that natural boundaries likely display a range of roughness and corresponding specularity. The leaky boundary is derived by integrating the velocity probability distribution function of the particle phase over the time step, to determine the volume fraction of particles lost. This is given as\ng ¼ sa 2 1þ erf vleak vffiffiffiffiffi 2q p ; ð8Þ\nwhere g is the volume fraction loss rate over the computational time step, q is the granular temperature, vleak is the velocity sufficient to remove a particle from a given height in the flow during a time interval (vleak = l\nDt ), v is the average vertical\nvelocity, and erf is the error function.\n[14] We simulated two continua (gas and particles) and in sub-set of numerical models we also explicitly included particle-tracking (Lagrangian particles) with initial size distributions determined from a compilation of the grain size distributions for units D and E of the KPT (Figure 3). While the\n6 of 18\ninstantaneous lithic size distribution from the vent likely varies from this distribution, the maximum grain size versus distance from the vent is relatively insensitive to the precise distribution provided that the dominant grain sizes are represented, although predicted distributions in the deposit are sensitive to the source distribution. The small diameter particles represented in the continuum portions of the simulations had a diameter of 250 mm.\n[15] The Lagrangian particles are coupled with the gas and particle continua through drag terms using an approach proposed by Fan et al. [2000]. In this Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian (EEL) approach the Lagrangian particles are one-way coupled to both the particulate (solid) continua and the gas continua, which is appropriate for the distinctive, but volumetrically minor lithic clasts of the KPT. In the following set of equations (and in the prior continua relations) the superscript ‘‘p’’ refers to Lagrangian particles, ‘‘s’’ refers to the solid particle continua, and ‘‘g’’ refers to the gas continua.\n[16] The Lagrangian equation of motion is given as\n@pui @t ¼ 1 rp @gP @xi 1 rp @sP @xi þ gpFd mp þ spFd mp þ g; ð9Þ\nwhere mp is the mass of the Lagrangian particle, pui is the particle velocity, is the rp particle density, gP and sP are the pressures of the gas and solid continua, respectively, and gpFd and\nspFd are the drag forces between the Lagrangian particle and the gas and solid continua, respectively. As the particle density is much greater than the gas density, the pressure gradient terms have minor influence on the particle path relative to the drag forces and gravity [Fan et al., 2000]. The gasparticle drag force is given as\ngpFd ¼ bf gui p ui½ sah ; ð10Þ\nwhere the drag coefficient is given as\nbf ¼ 0:75 Cd sa 1 s að Þgr gui s uij jsa 2:65 sd ; ð11Þ\nand\nCd ¼ 24 1þ 0:15 Re0:68p h i Rep ; Rep < 1000\n0:44; Rep 1000\n: 8>< >: ð12Þ\nThe solid continua-particle drag is given as\nspFd ¼ mp sui p ui½ g0 d ; ð13Þ\nwhere g0 is the dimensionless radial distribution function and d is the mean inter-particle collision time given as\nd ¼ 0:0904dp sag0 ffiffiffiffi sq p : ð14Þ\nThe radial distribution function approaches large values as the solid volume fraction approaches close packing. In situations with either high granular temperature or as close packing is approached, the mean inter-particle collision time decreases; this intuitively results in very large values of the particle-solid drag force, so that the Lagrangian particles accelerate rapidly to match the solid continua velocity in these situations. This ultimately results in the deposition of the Lagrangian particles in regions of the flow that reach close packing and have zero solid continua velocity.\n[17] The two-dimensional simulations have topography sampled from the dashed lines in Figure 1, for both simulation sections 1 (north toward Kalymnos) and 2 (south toward Tilos). Threedimensional simulations were conducted in cylindrical coordinates in the arcs demarked on Figure 1. Vertical resolution was refined near the boundary going from 10 m near the boundary to 100 m near the top of the simulations. Horizontal resolution was refined near areas of topography with minimum and maximum resolution of 20 m and 100 m. The top and side boundary conditions were outflow boundaries. The ambient atmosphere was taken as the U.S. standard atmosphere [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 1976] with the tropopause at 11 km."

We surveyed the sensitivity of vent geometries and vent particle flux using two-dimensional simulations as summarized in Table 2. Central vent radii of 100 m, 200 m and 400 m were considered, as was a ring vent structure with a radius of 5 km, similar to the inferred radius of the Kos Plateau Tuff caldera. Vent velocities were determined using a choked flow constraint [Papale and Dobran, 1994]; i.e., if vent geometry is static the speed achieved at the opening of the conduit will be the speed of sound of the particle-laden gas. We considered both pressurebalanced and overpressure conditions at the vent. We approximate the speed of sound of the mixture\ncoming out of the vent by assuming the mixture is initially isothermal [Dobran, 2001]. By imposing choked flow, the highest flux of particles occurs at lower exit velocities (but greater particle volume fraction). We stress that these simulations were intended to test the sensitivity of the resulting pyroclastic flows on vent conditions and topography, and due to the necessary simplifications in vent geometry and the choked flow assumption we are more interested in the general and robust trends rather than detailed comparison.\n[19] The two-dimensional simulations can be broadly grouped into three categories: (1) boilingover regime, (2) collapsing column regime, and (3) plinian column regime.

The ring vent simulations were conducted at a radius of 5 km, and were 200 m wide. Simulation numbers with the suffix ‘‘_P1’’ refer to a vent overpressure of 106 Pa, those with ‘‘_P2’’ refer to an overpressure of 5 106 Pa, and those with ‘‘_P3’’ refer to an overpressure of 107 Pa. Simulation numbers without the ‘‘_P’’ suffix are pressure-balanced.\n9 of 18\neruptive styles are shown in Figure 4. The boilingover regime is characterized by very high volume flux out of the vent, but low eruptive velocities. The boiling-over events are really a type of column collapse event where the columns are dense enough that the initial column heights are small (<10% the tropopause height) and form dense, ground-hugging gravity currents. The height of the initial column of material is typically restricted to less than a few kilometers, and rapid deposition generates thick and poorly sorted deposits within 10–20 km from the vent. The rapid loss of material to deposition typically generates buoyant secondary columns (typically referred to as phoenix columns or co-ignimbrite clouds) as shown in Figure 4a [Giordano and Dobran, 1994]. While these simulated flows easily surmounted the lowlying topography of Kos, even for the ring vent structure (which maximizes vent area) the boilingover events failed to have long enough runout to reach or surmount topography at Kalymnos as observed for the Vathi Valley deposits in northeastern Kalymnos.\n[20] By comparison the collapsing column events have lower flux than the boiling-over counterparts, but have much greater vent velocities. However, even with these higher vent velocities, the collapsing column regime produced from a central vent failed to reach and surmount topography at Kalymnos. Only the larger ring fracture collapsing column events (as shown in Figure 4b) reached and surmounted some of the topography at Kalymnos. Secondary buoyant columns are generated as material is deposited. Where flows encounter steep topography, with subsequent rapid deposition, the phoenix columns are strongly correlated with topographic roughness.\n[21] At still greater vent velocities (and more dilute flow), buoyant plinian columns are generated, both from central vents and ring vents. The majority of the particulate material is carried upward to the stratosphere where it spreads forming large plumes that eventually exceed the range of the simulated domain (>50 km).\n[22] Figure 5 summarizes the results of the twodimensional simulations. The black (filled-in) symbols denote simulations with column collapse, and the open symbols denote stable plinian events. The central vent and caldera (ring fracture) fields are separated by the gap in Figure 5, with ring fracture events having much greater total vent area. A further field is shown (dark gray) where the simulations produced pyroclastic flows that reach the valleys of Kalymnos as is observed in deposits of the KPT. The overpressurized vent conditions extend the range of collapsing columns and flow run-out distances that reach Kalymnos to higher particle volume flux (Table 2 and Figure 5). We primarily focus the three-dimensional investigation on the eruptive conditions that reach Kalymnos to further assess the topographically controlled behavior of the pyroclastic flows generated by these conditions as well as the influence of overwater transit."

    "text": "[23] The sensitivity of pyroclastic flows to boundary conditions is assessed in detail with three-dimensional simulations. We extend these calculations to threedimensions primarily because the deposits of the KPT are controlled by topography, and in many cases are valley-fill deposits. (This is particularly true in the Vathi deposits on the island of Kalymnos,\n10 of 18\nFigure 1). However, while both leaky/saltation and topographic boundary effects contribute to the spatial variability in particle concentration, there are three-dimensional instabilities, independent of conditions at the boundary that produce spatiotemporal variability. The unsteadiness of threedimensional eruptive columns results in regions of preferential downwelling, and variability in the particle concentration at similar radial distances from the vent as measured 100 m above the surface (Figure 6). The location of preferential downwelling migrates radially during the course of the simulated eruption.\n[24] After the collapse of the eruptive column, the particle-laden gravity currents initially have similar particle concentrations compared to the twodimensional simulations with the same eruptive conditions. However, flows that traverse leaky boundaries become significantly more dilute and fail to produce a concentrated bed load region. This ultimately results in the earlier production of secondary columns (Figures 7, 8, 9, and 10). For flux conditions near 1.9 106 m3/s from a ring vent structure, the dominant secondary plumes are\nlocated between 20–25 km from the vent, or about 5–10 km offshore from the island of Tilos. A series of smaller buoyant plumes are produced when the pyroclastic flow heads interact with topography at Tilos. Interestingly, bed load conditions (albeit at lower particle concentrations than their entirely overland counterparts) reform as the flows pass from leaky to saltation boundaries [Dufek and Bergantz, 2007]. Again, the eruptive fluxes less than 1.9 106 m3/s, due to smaller vent area, fail to produce flows that completely traverse the leaky boundary to reach Tilos. Flows with between 1.9 106 to 3.58 106 m3/s eruptive flux reach Tilos, but are approximately 10% the concentration of their counterparts that traveled over saltation boundaries to reach Kalymnos, with typical pyroclastic head volume fractions at 100 m above the surface of less than 1.0 10 4 volume fraction (Figure 6).\n[25] The three-dimensional simulations illustrate the control of topography on the pyroclastic flow concentration and deposition, as well as the location of secondary plumes (Animation 1). The most dramatic instance of this is in the case of flows that\n11 of 18\npond in the Vathi Valley on Kalymnos (Figure 1). In this instance, a narrow valley at nearly right angles to the flow deflects a portion of the flow, which proceeds up the valley reaching 200 m elevation. A smaller, more dilute, fraction of erupted material also reaches the valley due to recirculating currents caused by a phoenix column that is generated as the pyroclastic flows encounter the steep ridges on Kalymnos (Figure 7). This is just one example where three-dimensional topography produces multiple flow types converging at single location for overlapping periods of time."

    "text": "[26] The simulations indicate that suspensiondriven flows with a volume flux of particles of approximately 2 106 m3/s from a ring vent\nconfiguration could reach the island of Tilos from a caldera near Kos, even if they were separated by a large body of water. However, the ability to cross this expanse of water does not necessarily imply that the overriding current could support the large lithic clasts found even in the distal KPT on Tilos, particularly in unit E. In order to evaluate the carrying capacity of these flows for larger and denser particles we used a Lagrangian approach to track individual particles (Figure 11). Particles were seeded into the flow at the vent, consistent with a conduit origin for the dominantly andesitic lithic clasts found in the KPT, and the size distribution was governed by the compilation of grain sizes in Figure 3. An example of such a simulation, shown in Figure 11, displays the particles being dominantly concentrated in the recirculating zone near the ring vent and in the inter-caldera region. A smaller population of particles travels with the propagating pyroclastic density current, with a\n12 of 18\ngreater volume of particles (and larger particles) concentrated at the base of the flow.\n[27] From the Lagrangian simulations a synthetic maximum lithic distribution can be produced and compared to grain size data from the KPT deposit [Allen and Cas, 2001; Savage, 1998]. Figure 12b shows the synthetic maximum andesite lithic clasts for an eruptive flux of 1.89 106 m3/s from a ring vent configuration as described earlier. For comparison a map of the maximum lithic size distribution for unit E is shown in Figure 12a. Figure 12c shows the mean maximum lithic size versus distance from the vent (solid line) compared to maximum lithic size in both unit D and E versus distance from vent. The lithic size data are shown with 5 km error bars as the precise location of the vent/vents where these lithics were introduced into the flow is poorly constrained.\n[28] The saltation (overland) simulations are able to reproduce most of the broad features of the maximum lithic size for flows that traveled to the north of the vent within error of vent uncertainty.\nLarger lithics are transported in these flows in dense bed load regions where particle-particle interaction dominates momentum transfer, and particles can make multiple contacts with the bed. While the much smaller maximum lithic size distribution of unit D is similar to the leaky (overwater) simulations, these same simulations fail to account for some of the larger maximum lithic clasts found in the later unit E on the island on Tilos, even with uncertainty in vent location.\n[29] The simulations indicate that in the limit of only suspension-driven transport, including drag from particle-particle collisions, pyroclastic density currents cannot transport the largest of the lithics observed in unit E on Tilos. While eruptive flux could be increased by assuming greater vent area (as for instance might occur if the caldera collapse was piecemeal), the choked flow constraint places a significant limit on lithic velocity exiting the vent, and ballistic trajectories cannot account for the transport over 30 km. A similar result also applies to increasing the ring vent radius. However,\n13 of 18\nthe decay of maximum particle size with distance from the vent in unit D does approach that which would be predicted from suspension-driven gravity currents including particle-particle momentum transfer.\n[30] One explanation for the large lithics being transported in unit E is that the pyroclastic density current traveled mostly above a land surface that permitted saltation as suggested as one implication of the neotectonics reconstruction of Pe-Piper and coworkers [Pe-Piper et al., 2005]. However, this does not explain the decay of maximum lithics from the source as seen in unit D. This decay suggests that at the start of ignimbrite producing sequence, the boundary was leaky and some depth of water was present. In the simulations we were also assuming the end-member condition of perfectly leaky boundaries; e.g., any particle that reaches the water surface is removed from the flow. One possibility is that particles can bounce to some degree across the water surface. While this\nprocess is likely to occur, partially skipping lithics still does not explain the contrast between unit D and E (i.e., if the flows crossed water during the entirety of the eruption one would expect bouncing particles in D and E to behave similarly, and not generate the observable differences).\n[31] Another alternative is that the sea was shallow and that the eruption of the preceding units of the KPT essentially filled in the depression so that the boundary evolved from leaky to saltation dominated. A similar behavior may occur as a pumice raft develops on the water surface [Allen and Cas, 2001; Carey et al., 1996]. Most of the KPT pumice are at or less than the density of water, and when cooled to less than 200 C would be expected to remain at the water surface for days to weeks [Dufek et al., 2007; Whitham and Sparks, 1986] At the time of the eruption of unit E, much of water surface could have been covered with a pumice raft (from unit D) in excess of several meters which\n14 of 18\nmay have served as saltation surface, which is a hypothesis that we are continuing to investigate."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions and Implications",
    "text": "[32] Eruption from ring vents with an eruptive flux between 1.8 106 m3/s to 3.6 106 m3/s most closely matches the implied mobility of KPT flows from the depositional distribution. Increasing the eruptive flux by increasing the vent area can explain similar mobility; however, increasing the flux through greater particle density coming out of the vent fails to produce pyroclastic density currents that reach the known deposit distribution of the KPT. Likewise smaller flux conditions and central vent configurations fail to produce flows that match the distribution of the KPT.\n[33] These flux conditions permit an estimation of the eruptive duration of this moderate volume eruption (Figure 13). Using the 60 km3 volume estimate and an eruption flux of around 2 106 m3/s yields eruptive durations of around 0.35 days. Using the range of fluxes that produced similar\ncoverage as the KPT deposits gives minimum eruption duration from several hours to a couple of days. As vent overpressure is increased the apparent eruption duration timescale becomes even\n15 of 18\nshorter. Certainly, if there were pauses between portions of the eruption, this would increase this timescale. But the volume and deposit distribution limitations require only around a day or less during the peak activity of this moderate to large volume eruption. The climate implications for such a short duration burst of particle-laden eruptive activity may be dramatic [Timmreck and Graf, 2006] and warrants further consideration.\n[34] The lithic size distribution coupled with the distribution of finer material suggest that at the initiation of the large ignimbrite producing part of the eruption, the area north of Kos can be explained by saltation over a solid surface, while much of the area to the south was leaky and had a more rapid decay of maximum lithics from the vent. However, by the end of the ignimbrite producing phase (Unit E) the basal boundaries to the south are most consistent with saltation. This transition from leaky to saltation boundary condition suggests that there was some water present in the depression south of Kos, between the present-\n16 of 18\nday island of Nisyros and Tilos, at the start of the eruption. Yet, this sea was either shallow and overcome by the preceding eruptive units, or a thick pumice raft developed during the course of the eruption that permitted much greater saltation efficiency toward the end of the eruption. While this coupled deposit-simulation approach cannot discern the depth of the water before the eruption, it does place the constraint that some water was likely present at the initiation of the eruption and this may help refine estimates of neotectonic subsidence in the area."

  "abstractText": "[1] The explosive eruption of voluminous silicic magmas often produces widespread and massive deposits formed from pyroclastic density currents. While these punctuated events dramatically alter the landscape and have potential climate-altering impact, our understanding of the internal structure and transport dynamics of these eruptions is hampered by a lack of direct observations. We utilize the natural boundary conditions encountered by the eruption of the Kos Plateau Tuff to probe its internal structure as well as constrain the neotectonic activity in the region and eruption duration of this moderate to large (>60 km) event. At the time of the eruption, 161 ka, the lower sea level in the Mediterranean may have resulted in flows that traversed mostly land to the north of the eruptive vent, while flows to the south may have encountered an expanse of water. Steep topography and overwater transport can impede the transport of the dense basal portions of the flow where particles make multiple or sustained contact with the bed. We use an Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian computational approach coupled with overwater and overland boundary conditions, including topography, to determine the role of bed load versus suspended load in the transport of these flows. We find that a ring vent structure and eruptive fluxes greater than 2 10 m/s are required for the spatial distribution of the KPT. The maximum grain size and deposit locations of the first voluminous ignimbrite unit (D) can be explained by suspended flow to the south, consistent with overwater transport, and bed load and suspended load transport to the north, consistent with overland transport. However, the maximum lithic size for the largest and last ignimbrite unit (E) requires some bed load transport in all directions. We propose that the boundary conditions were significantly altered during the course of the eruption, through either the in-filling of a shallow sea to the south or the development of a thick pumice raft to aid saltation. On the basis of the inferred eruptive flux, we estimate that the duration of the eruption climax, in which most of the material was erupted, likely only lasted from a few hours to a day.",
