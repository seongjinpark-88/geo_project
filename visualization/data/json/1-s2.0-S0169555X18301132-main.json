The temporal resolution and length of the Manawatu record reflects accommodation space for fluvial deposits, channel dynamics and mobility, and high sediment supply.

    "text": "Palaeoflood research in New Zealand to date has largely focused on volcanogenic break-out floods associated with the ca. 180 CE Taupo eruption (Manville et al., 1999, 2005), 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption from the same caldera (Manville and Wilson, 2004), and lahars generated within the Taupo Volcanic Zone (Manville, 2004; Graettinger et al., 2010; Manville and Hodgson, 2011). Little attention has been given to palaeofloods beyond New Zealand's volcanic terrain, and yet stormgenerated flooding is the most frequent natural hazard in New Zealand, with over 1000 serious events in the last 100 years (Willis, 2014). Assessing flood risk is, however, presently constrained by short (generally b60 year) gauged river flow records that poorly represent the distribution of hydrological extremes (Fuller et al., 2016). The peak discharges of early twentieth century floods have been estimated on the basis of historical records (e.g., Cowie, 1957), but human recording of floods in New Zealand is limited by its very recent colonisation, and there is a paucity of documentary evidence. Recent work using meta-analysis of a radiocarbon database developed from New Zealand Holocene alluvial records (Macklin et al., 2012; Richardson et al., 2013; Fuller et al., 2015) has produced centennial-scale records of flooding in New Zealand as a whole. While this approach has been able to identify flood-rich and flood-poor episodes throughout\nthe Holocene, and relate these events to broad-scale synoptic forcing (Richardson et al., 2013), it does not enable event-scale, stormgenerated palaeoflood reconstruction.\nRecent studies of lowland alluvial river systems have demonstrated that the grain size of individual flood beds, contained in the infill of abandonedmeanders, can be used to reconstruct (palaeo)flood series (Munoz et al., 2015; Toonen et al., 2015). These records provide a tool to place recorded extreme events in a framework of long-term flooding variability. Moreover, longer flood series allow detection of distinctive phases and episodes of flooding in addition to individual events (Toonen et al., 2017), which allows comparison with other regional hydroclimatic and biological records (e.g. Norton et al., 1989; Richardson et al., 2013; Fuller et al., 2015). Furthermore, a longer flood series makes it possible to identify underlying forcing, such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for the Pacific region (Ely, 1997; Kiem et al., 2003) including New Zealand, where the Antarctic Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is also important (Macklin et al., 2012; Richardson et al., 2013); and NAO/AMO (North Atlantic Oscillation/Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) for the Atlantic (Foulds and Macklin, 2016; Toonen et al., 2016).\nIn this we paper we explore the gap in palaeoflood research in New Zealand by providing the first reconstruction of discrete stormgenerated floods using analysis of the fluvial sedimentary archive, extending over the past ~3000 years. The catchment in which this work is situated lies beyond the volcanic terrain of the central North Island, removing the possibility of volcanogenic floods. The nature of topography in theManawatumeans that landslide dams in trunk rivers\nare rare, although significant elsewhere in NewZealand alpine terrain in association with coseismic events and/or rainfall (e.g. Korup 2002; Hancox et al., 2005). The flood record presented here is, we believe, truly storm-generated."

    "heading": "2.1. Manawatu catchment",
    "text": "The Manawatu River drains a 5885 km2 catchment situated in southern North Island of New Zealand (Fig. 1). The catchment straddles the greywacke North Island axial ranges (Tararua and Ruahine) and comprises six primary tributaries, four of which rise on the east of these ranges (Fig. 1B). The study reach, adjacent to Palmerston North, is situated in the lower part of the catchment. Mean annual discharge for the Manawatu River is ca. 110 m3 s−1 with the most significant contributions derived from the upper Manawatu (ca. 27 m3 s−1), Mangatainoka (ca. 18 m3 s−1), Pohangina (ca. 17 m3 s−1), Tiraumea (ca. 16 m3 s−1), Mangahao (ca. 15 m3 s−1), and Oroua (ca. 13 m3 s−1) (figures derived from Henderson and Diettrich, 2007). The catchment was extensively cleared of native forest in a period spanning the late 1800s and early 1900s to make way for mostly pastoral agriculture (Fig. 1C). Native forest remains on the greywacke ranges, which rise to 1695 m and 1505 m in the northernmost and southernmost parts of the catchment respectively. The Manawatu River crosses the axial range through the Manawatu Gorge, which is the only locality for significant dambreak floods in the trunk river and primary tributaries. However, the evidence is not clear (geological, documentary, or Maori oral tradition) of the river having been completely dammed by landslides here in the late Holocene, although the presence of large boulders in the channel floor of the Gorge indicates significant local, off-slope delivery. With the exception of the uplifted greywacke fault block,\nmost of the catchment is underlain by soft sedimentary rock, notably mudstones and sandstones (Fig. 1D). Erosion of this terrain generates a suspended sediment yield from the Manawatu to the ocean of ca. 3.74 Mt y−1 (Hicks et al., 2011). While this volume of sediment discharge has no doubt been enhanced by land clearance (Hicks et al., 2011), the underlying soft-rock terrain is likely a naturally high sediment generator. Clement et al. (2017) recorded a rapid infilling of the Manawatu estuary within ca. 2700 years of the mid-Holocene sea level high-stand (7240–6500 cal. YBP). Tectonic uplift in the catchment is ca. 1–4 mm y−1 in the greywacke ranges (Wellman, 1972; Pillans, 1986; Whitehouse and Pearce, 1992), and river terraces generated by downcutting in response to this uplift are prominent landscape features in the upper and middle reaches of the primary valleys."

    "heading": "2.2. Climate",
    "text": "Climate in the region is humid temperate; mean annual rainfall in Palmerston North is ~980 mm, rising to N2000 mm in the Tararua and Ruahine ranges (NIWA, 2017). Most rain in the catchment is brought by mid-latitude frontal systems approaching from the west, although subtropical depressions in late summer-autumn and southerly polar outbreaks (throughout the year) can bring easterly-quarter rain. Temperatures are mild: the mean temperature in the coldest month (July) is 8 °C, rising to 18 °C in the warmest month (February). Snow at sea level is extremely rare (~30-year recurrence interval), although snowpacks above the tree line (~1000 m) can develop during sustained cold periods."

    "text": "In the lowerManawatu valley in the vicinity of Palmerston North, the valleyfloorwidens and becomes unconfined as the river emerges into the\nion of Palmerston North (the focus of this study), (C) catchment land use, (D) catchment\nTaonui basin (cf. Fig. 2). Here, a sequence of palaeochannels, abandoned by natural neck and chute cutoffs, has been well preserved on the floodplain (Fig. 2). Upstream of Palmerston North, the floodplain is bound by\nearly Holocene and late Pleistocene river terraces, while a last interglacial marine terrace forms a higher (100m) surface to the south of the floodplain (cf. Fig. 2 and Clement et al., 2010). River management has\nstraightened the channel through much of this reach (Page and Heerdegen, 1985), and the river is now largely disconnected from its floodplain by the Lower Manawatu Flood Protection Scheme, providing flood protection for the city of Palmerston North and for the high value dairy agriculture of the lower valley. The river gradient flattens significantlywithin this reach from0.0012 upstreamof the city to 0.0002 downstream of the 10-m contour (Fig. 2) (Page and Heerdegen, 1985). The sequence of palaeochannels in the lower Manawatu was first described by Page and Heerdegen (1985), noting that they were already defunct at the time of a previous survey in 1859. Page and Heerdegen (1985) describe partial infilling of these palaeochannels with up to 8 m of finegrained sediments overlaying gravels of the original channel bed, and their interpretation suggested that some of these channels were abandoned around 200 years prior to the 1859 survey because the depth of soil formation and amount of infilling, which was only a little greater than that of other dated cutoffs (1888 and 1937). If that interpretation was correct, these palaeochannels would yield records of past floods spanning ~350 years. However, we should also note that Page and Heerdegen's mapping of the palaeochannel sequence is somewhat incomplete. Terrain surfaces generated from airborne LiDAR acquired by the Horizons Regional Council in 2006 have revealed several more distal and evidently older palaeochannels in the Manawatu. The full suite of palaeochannels is described by LoRe et al. (2018)."

    "heading": "3. Methods and data",
    "text": "Cores of selected palaeochannels were recovered using a hydraulic percussion coring system in distal palaeochannels containing consolidated sequences and a Livingston piston corer in wetter palaeochannels with a soft sediment fill proximal to the current river. Cores were split, with one-half being shipped for ITRAX™ X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning and grain-size analysis at Aberystwyth University (UK), while the remainder was sampled for palynological analysis and radiocarbon dating.\n3.1. Grain-size analysis and identification of flood units\nFlood units are identifiable as sandy layers in the silt-dominated cores (see Figs. 6 and 7). A Malvern 2000 laser diffraction device was used to measure grain-size distribution of 1-cm-thick samples, taken at 5–10 cm intervals. Samples were pretreated with Na4P2O7.10H2O and sonic disaggregation to disperse grains in order to prevent flocculation. In total, 402 samples were collected from the cores. Previous studies indicate that grain-size information of flood deposits can relate to flood magnitudes (Jones et al., 2012; Munoz et al., 2015; Toonen et al., 2015; Leigh, 2017). However, continuous study of flood laminae at a high-resolution (mm scale) is inefficient and costly. Jones et al. (2012) demonstrated that the Zr/Rb ratio provides a robust geochemical proxy for the grain size of flood deposits in low-gradient Welsh river systems. The element Zr is found principally in the resistant mineral zircon, while Rb is found in a range of minerals including clay minerals. Zirconium tends to become concentrated in fine sand to coarse silt, while Rb concentrates in fine silt and clay during sediment transport, whichmeans an increasing Zr/Rb ratio can be associatedwith an increase in grain size (Jones et al., 2012). The ITRAX™XRF core scanningwas used to measure core geochemistry at a 1-mm resolution.\nTo test the relation between direct measurement of grain size using laser diffraction and the Zr/Rb geochemical proxy grain size, sampling targeted (i) visually recognisable coarse-grained flood layers and finegrained background sedimentation (originating from more common events) and (ii) specific intervals of high or low (peak and troughs) Zr/Rb ratios. This approach ensures that the Zr/Rb grain-size proxy is validated for the full range of sediments that occurs in the channel fill sequences.\nThe Zr/Rb count ratio was normalised for each single measurement using the sum of coherent and incoherent scatter (dependent upon\norganic and water content). Measurements were averaged over an 11-mm interval to fit with the sample size used for laser diffraction grain-size analysis. A comparison was made with the D50 and D90 parameters (Fig. 3A). The data are presented as a bulk ensemble for all sites because all sites are located in the same river reach and share a common stratigraphy, lithology, and catchment. The relation between D50 and D90 appears consistent between all sites and is significant (n = 400, r = 0.89, p b 0.001), cf. Fig. 3. A statistically significant relationship exists between the grain size and the Zr/Rb ratio: D50 vs. Zr/Rb (r = 0.68, p b 0.001; Fig. 3B) and D90 vs. Zr/Rb (r = 0.49, p b 0.001). Both correlations are significant at n = 360 (excluding the grain-size samples that do not overlap with geochemistry measurements e.g. near gaps and sections unsuitable for scanning). However, the Zr/Rb ratio is more strongly correlated with the D50 than the D90. A divergence in the relationship between grain size and Zr/Rb ratio occurs above ~0.8, and this corresponds to the greater proportion of medium sand deposited before the cutoffs were finally separated from the main flow (Fig. 3B). Because the D50/D90 ratio is stable and significant, we can infer the use of D50 would equally represent flood magnitude variability as well as of D90 at these sites. This test thus confirms that peaks in the Zr/Rb ratio correspond with flood units and that the Zr/Rb ratio provides a robust grain-size proxy (Turner et al., 2015). The ITRAX™ XRF core scanning, calibrated on laser diffraction grain-size samples, was thus deployed as a grain-size proxy to provide a detailed flood sedimentology from the Manawatu cores.\nGeneral trends in grain sizemay result from changes in proximity to the river channel or the progressive buildup of levees, limiting sediment dispersion across the floodplain (Toonen et al., 2015; Leigh, 2017). Following Jones et al. (2012), in order to account for these geomorphological effects, a 10-cm running filter was used to detrend the data. The detrended data were converted into Z-scores to present alongside the Zr/Rb ratio to identify flood units in the cores.\nAs part of ITRAX™ XRF core scanning, contaminant metal levels were also measured. These show consistent trends, and Cu and Zn can be used to identify twentieth century floodplain contamination associated with urban and industrial growth (Appendix)."

    "text": "Flood chronologies were constrained using a combination of instrumental flow records, documentary sources, and geochemical markers associated with pollution, palynology, and radiocarbon dating. Exploratory use of 210Pb and 137Cs was deployed on the Hamilton 1 core in order to better constrain the timing of floods recorded in this sedimentary archive with gauged floods. Channel cutoff of Hamilton 1 occurred in 1937 CE. Fig. 4 provides a record of the largest gauged and documented floods in the Manawatu River in each year, as measured at the gauging station in Palmerston North. The Manawatu River has the longest continuous gauging record in New Zealand, extending to 1923, with estimates of flows prior to this madewith reference to observation of river levels (Page, 1994). Fig. 4 is a synthesised flow record from observations and gauged data that were measured at three sites in close proximity (Fitzherbert 1923–1971, Ruahine Street 1971–1987, and Teachers College 1987–present). The three gauging sites can be regarded as a continuous series (Henderson and Diettrich, 2007). Flood depths at each palaeochannel have been modelled by Horizons Regional Council (Table 1; J. Bell, pers. comm. 2017). Although not modelled, a flow of 4512m3 s−1 is estimated to have an annual recurrence interval (ARI) of 500 years, and a flowof 5345 m3 s−1 is estimated to have an ARI of 2500 years at Teachers College (J. Bell pers. comm. 2017). The modelled ARI of flood depths at each site was used to infer the minimum flood magnitudes needed to produce flood units for each individual sites. Estimation of sediment accumulation rates was feasible where cutoff dates were known or reasonably well constrained by indirect dating (14C and palynology; see below).\nThe largest documented flood in 1857 was estimated to have a peak discharge of 4010m3 s−1 (Page, 1994). Observations indicate that this flood was generated by an extensive whole-catchment rain event\nFig. 4. Documented floods (largest annual daily maximum) in the Manawatu\n(Page, 1994), possibly in early December, based on a newspaper report of severe flooding in the Turakina catchment ~20 km to the northwest of the Manawatu watershed (Wellington Independent, 9 December\nRiver at Palmerston North. Data supplied by Horizons Regional Council.\n1857), but no definitive date is available. Six additional floods exceeding 3000 m3 s−1 have been documented since 1857, these occurred in March 1880, April 1897, June 1902, July 1906, January 1953, and February 2004, indicating that large floods are not related to any particular season."

    "heading": "3.3. Linking documented floods with the sedimentary record",
    "text": "Documented floods were linked to the flood sedimentary record by first determining date of cutoff, which provides a secure age for the onset of flood sedimentation in the abandoned channel. At Hamilton 1 exploratory 210Pb and 137Cs analysis was used to identify peak deposition of 137Cs at ca. 1965, with no deposition prior to 1952. Ten-gram samples were taken at 10-cm intervals downcore and indicate that at least the upper 3.0 m of sediment was deposited post-1952 (Table 2). Analysis was undertaken under contract by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd, Christchurch. Samples were counted on HPGe (high-purity germanium) detectors with counting time\nFig. 5. Summarypollen diagrams forHamilton 1, Napier Road, Palmy Park, and theRocket andOp pollen, which includes trees, shrubs, and herbs (natives and exotics) but excludes ferns.\nranging from 48 to 68 h. For those palaeochannels beyond the stopbanks (embankments providing flood protection) on the inactive floodplain, the last recorded flood is generally 1953. Inferred ages of flood units observed in the cores can reasonably be inferred by comparison with the documented record, taking into account the likelihood of sufficient inundation (cf. Table 1) for the given flood magnitude. Effectively a counting down from the top of the core, and/or up from known date of cutoff, provides a means of assigning flood units to specific documented flood events. This was most straightforward for the few largest events, whichwere presumed tomatch rarely occurring coarse flood units. Elevated concentrations of heavy metals in palaeochannel cores reflect pollution associated with the urban growth of Palmerston North from the early twentieth century. Pollen evidence and radiocarbon dating were also used to secure age control."
  }, {
    "heading": "3.4. Palynology",
    "text": "Sediments from fluvial depositional settings are seldom selected for use as palaeovegetation archives given the potential for reworking, the episodic nature of deposition, and the typically large pollen source area. Thus, they are generally of little value for providing detailed reconstructions of local-scale vegetation and climate change. However, they can still provide qualitative indications of broad scale changes in the vegetation of the catchment, such as evidence for periods of major vegetation clearance and the introduction of exotic species, both of which are driven by human activities. Because the timing of Polynesian and European colonisations in New Zealand are well constrained, pollen indicators of these events can therefore provide a rough chronology for deposits in which they occur.\nSamples for pollen analysis were taken from unoxidised sediments from cores from five of the study sites, as oxidation in the remainder precluded pollen preservation. For all cores, this excluded the upper 50–100 cm approximately. Samples were processed according to the standardmethodology documented inMoore et al. (1991), with residue mounted in silicone oil and examined at 400× magnification under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope.\nIn New Zealand pollen records, Polynesian and European phases of colonisation are represented by distinctive signals (e.g. Wilmshurst, 1997; McGlone and Wilmshurst, 1999). Polynesian arrival is marked by a decline in native forest pollen and concurrent rise in successional species. European colonisation is marked by further decline in native forest pollen, and the appearance of exotic species introduced for agricultural and horticultural purposes.\nWe have used the appearance of key exotic taxa (e.g. Pinus radiata, Salix, Taraxacum, etc.) as indicators of the presence of Europeans somewhere within the catchment, thus providing some basic chronological control. No definitive signals of deforestation and subsequent succession from either Polynesian or European activities were discernible in the records obtained in this study. This probably reflects muting of the signals of clearance of individual catchments by the continued input of forest pollen from the subcatchments that remain forested.\nSummary pollen diagrams for the five sites where pollen was analysed are shown in Fig. 5. As a proof of concept, we chose to investigate Hamilton 1 for pollen, as it provides a benchmark for what we can expect a post-colonisation pollen signal to look like within flood sediments. Pollen of native trees and shrubs are the dominant pollen types recorded despite much of the native forest being cleared during the timespan covered by the Hamilton 1 site. This probably reflects the relatively high pollen production and also the robustness of the pollen grains of some canopy-forming trees present in the remaining native forest in the catchment headwaters. Pollen of introduced pasture herbs (Plantago lanceolata type, Rumex, and Taraxacum) are present in\niki sites. Data are displayed as relative proportions calculated against the sumof all dryland\nlow levels, but consistently so. Pine pollen appears in the middle of the sequence, becoming more abundant toward the top, probably representing the expansion of Pinus radiata forestry in the mid-late twentieth century. Thus, the Hamilton 1 data indicate that a European pollen signal is persevered within these fluvial sediments, but it is considerably more subtle than the signals seen in lake and bog sequences that are only capturing pollen from the immediate vicinity of the site."

    "heading": "3.5. Radiocarbon dating",
    "text": "Table 3 provides details of the radiocarbon dates. Ages were calibrated using OxCal version 4.3.2 (Bronk Ramsey, 2009) and the SHCal 13 atmospheric curve (Hogg et al., 2013). Obtaining enough organic matter for radiocarbon dating from these cores was challenging. While most cores contained scattered macroscopic fragments, these were seldom in sufficient concentration to yield enough material for an AMS radiocarbon date. To try to resolve this issue, organic matter from bulk sediment samples from Rocket and Opiki cores was concentrated by removing the clastic matter with hydrofluoric acid. Samples from the Rocket core with 0.85m between them were not distinguishable by age. This could reflect inclusion of reworked organic matter in the samples, suggesting bulk concentration is not a viable method. However, it may also simply reflect rapid infilling of the channel. The pollen data from the Rocket core suggest that the entire core accumulated prior to the arrival of humans, which is consistent with the radiocarbon age. However, the Opiki sample was collected from ca. 0.3 m below where we encounter pollen signals of European presence, so an age of 1722 cal. YBP seems an overestimation. This could also be the result of older organic matter in the dated sample or perhaps a hiatus in sedimentation. The Napier Road sample comprised macroremains (leaves, twigs, etc.) and can be considered more reliable, and 14C ages are consistent with the pollen data."

    "heading": "4. Results and interpretation",
    "text": "Of the nine cores extracted from theManawatu palaeochannels, four were located on the current floodplain (Fig. 6; Appendix: Figs. A1–A4). The remaining five sites were located beyond stopbanks in the protected floodplain (Fig. 7; Appendix: Figs. A5–A9), which no longer has flood-related sedimentation. Stopbanks in the Lower Manawatu Flood Protection Scheme are rated as providing ‘500-year’ flood protection (Watson, pers. comm., 2017). A schematic (Fig. 8) summarises the results from the cores described in detail in this section and displays their relative position on the floodplain.\nThe observedflow record of theManawatu (Fig. 4) has beenmapped to each major flood event detected using the Zr/Rb ratio and Z-score, taking into account the age of the palaeochannel and available chronology in the core (pollen, radiocarbon ages, and historical information). Based on the modelled flow depths (Table 1), floods with magnitudes around and N2000 m3 s−1 will potentially leave a sediment signature at all sites (cf. Table 1). Smaller floods will also inundate themore proximal channels. Hamilton 1 and Karere 2 (Fig. 6; Figs. A1–A2) are located within the Manawatu stopbanks and potentially provide a record of every flood since stopbank construction in the early 1960s; however, the upper metre of these cores was not scannable (too brittle with heavy bioturbation and oxidation), and the past ca. 20 years of record is missing (Fig. 8)."

Results for Hamilton 1, Riverside Drive, and Napier Road are described in detail below (see also Fig. 8). Karere 2 is described in the Appendix as it is very similar to Hamilton 1, being an historical cutoff from 1888 (Page and Heerdegen, 1985)."
  }, {
    "heading": "4.1.1. Hamilton 1",
    "text": "The oldest flood in Hamilton 1 dates to 1937, when this bend was abandoned (Page and Heerdegen, 1985), and cutoff was coincident with a flood N2000m3 s−1 (cf. Fig. 6). The site was flooded recently in 2015 and 2004. The coarser and deeper part of the palaeochannel sequence probably accumulated rapidly, when an open connection with the active channel existed (cf. Toonen et al., 2015), potentially including the years before a full cutoff was established. Withinchannel sediments in the lower part of the core demonstrate an open connection with the active channel for some short, but unknown, period. During this period coarse sediment could be conveyed into the abandoning channel. This did not necessarily occur during the earliest annual maximum peak discharges of 1941 and 1942 but could equally have occurred during higher flows throughout the year because of (periodic) connection with the channel, allowing rapid deposition to take place. Because of this connection, 35 cm of sedimentation during a single year or flood in this depositional context is not unusual. At the time when the channel was fully disconnected (1953 and 1956), variability in grain size and sedimentation rates has to be related to sediment deposited by overbank floods or to pulses of sedimentation during a single large event (cf. Macklin et al., 1992). Annual peak floods may all have been preserved in the period directly following the initial abandonment in 1937, as all inundated this site (cf. Table 1). Therefore, the flood unit at 4.33 m matches with the 1941 flood, which also exceeded 2000m3 s−1. Average sedimentation rate since abandonment is 58 mm/y, 455 cm between 2015 CE and 1937, with higher rates near the bottom and toward the top of the sequence based on general trends in channel fill grain sizes and 137Cs data (cf. Table 2). Therefore, the missing scanned section in the upper part of the core is estimated to represent at least ~25 years. Hence, recent large events (e.g. 3500 m3 s−1 flood in February 2004 and 2500 m3 s−1 flood in July 1992) are not present in the record. Floods exceeding 2500 m3 s−1 occurred in May 1941, January 1953, July 1956, and March 1965, which according to Table 1 would inundate the site to a depth of 3 m. An initial chronology is provided in Fig. 6. The coarse-grained part of the sequence has probably accumulated during the initial flood events after abandonment and the majority with the large 1941 flood (2605 m3 s−1). After ca. 1941, the channel became less connected from the main river, resulting in dramatic reduction of channel fill grain size. If the larger peaks (N2.5σ) relate to floods with a discharge N2000 m3 s−1, then the latest flood to be recorded locally would be the October 1988 event. This fits the previous assumption that at least the last 25 years was missing. The large March 1965 (2744m3 s−1) and January 1953 (3176m3 s−1) events are presumably also registered as peaks in grain-size proxy (Z-score). Based on the inferred ages at 1 and 4 m, respectively 1980s and 1940s, these events should be present in the central part of the core. The two\nlargest peaks in grain size can be found between 2 and 3 m depth. Despite the greater peak discharge of the 1953 event, the Z-score is slightly smaller than the 1965 flood. The grain size of flood deposits is dependent on the shape of the hydrograph and on hysteresis effects on river sediment load, not simply related to flood magnitude. Peaks in grain size tentatively match with peak flows exceeding 2000 m3 s−1 (Fig. 6). Smaller peaks were left unassigned because at this site these\ncan relate to any discharge exceeding just 500 m3 s−1 (Table 1) and because these relatively minor annual peak discharges or secondranked annual events are not considered in this study."

This site is located in an area of floodplain without stopbanks and is confined by high fluvial terraces (cf. Fig. 2). The 2004 flood is likely the Z-score peak in the upper 0.2 m. The entire core consists of an overbank sequence without major changes in grain size (below 1m, deposits are a little coarser, probably reflecting proximity to the active channel). High Zn and Cu in the upper 5 cm are associatedwithmodern pollution (Fig. A3). Several other distinct high peaks of Zn are located in the upper metre, and a single high peak of Pb was measured around 75 cm. These might be related to specific pollution-spillage events that must have occurred after the 1880s when industrialisation of the region commenced (Manawatu Catchment Board, 1982). If the 2004 event (3515 m3 s−1) is related to a Zr/Rb Z-score of N2σ, previous events of a similar Z-score are likely associated with events exceeding 3000m3 s−1 as well. Based on this assumption, peaks can be correlatedwith the large floods of January 1953 (3176m3 s−1), the events of May 1907 (3340 m3 s−1), June 1902 (3800m3 s−1), and April 1897 (3333 m3 s−1), which form a cluster of large floods at the turn of the twentieth century, and March 1880 (3980 m3 s−1). The position of the 1880 event is consistentwith an increase in contaminantmetal concentrations associated with early industrialisation and urbanisation in the Manawatu catchment. Before 1880 the discharge record is incomplete and the correlation becomes more tentative. However, the 1857 event (4010m3 s−1) is the largest event recorded and is likely associated with the coarsest flood units at c. 1.5m depth. If the same accumulation rates apply for the deeper part of the core, this flood record goes back to the early nineteenth century and contains several historically unknown floods of large magnitudes (in the realm of 3000–4000m3 s−1)."

It was abandoned at an indeterminate pre-1859 date (inferred from river position in 1859; Manawatu Catchment Board, 1982), and a radiocarbon age of 2050–1926 cal. BP at 2.27–2.31 m (Table 2) suggests a likely 2–3 ka record of flooding at this site. Pollen of\nEuropean introduced herbs (specifically Plantago and Taraxacum) dating to ca. 1840 CE appears between 161 and 156 cm depth within the Napier Road core. Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) is first recorded at c. 75 cm depth, representing the expansion of pine forestry in NewZealand in themid-twentieth Century. Inmore recentflood events, although not stopbanked, the site is probably disconnected from floods by a main (elevated) road, so the 1953 (3176m3 s−1) flood is likely the most recent to inundate the site (no river flooding in 2004). The lower part of the core is relatively coarse with many flood units, the middle section (60–200 cm) is silty with several thick flood units in the top, and the upper 60 cm is very fine organic clay, commensurate with a disconnection from river floods, and likely reflects ponding from local surface and stormwater runoff. The units between 60 and100 cm represent large floods and probably relate to the cluster of floods at the turn of the twentieth century. This is consistent with elevated Zn concentrations in these units (Fig. A4).\nOlder (N2050–1926 cal. BP) coarse deposits toward the base of the Napier Road core are likely to reflect channel proximity at this time, rather than indicating large floods analogous to the situation described at Hamilton 1. However, a period of significantly enhanced river activity recorded in the North Island from ca. 2400–2100 cal. BP (Fuller et al., 2015), suggests that large floods (ca. N3000m3 s−1) may have occurred during this period. Importantly, the evidence from the Napier Road core is consistent with the meta-analysis of Fuller et al. (2015)."

Pollen data indicate European impact starts between 100 and 132 cm, ca. 1840 CE. The upper sectionwas too brittle for ITRAX™ scanning and heavily bioturbated. At 130 cm a very clear and rapid transition from sandy material to overbank clays is observed. Few flood units are visible, but those present are very clear with thick units, reflected in the Z-score plots. High peaks of Zn and Pb occur around 1 m, and in the upper metre a clear trend of increasing contaminant metal concentration (Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb) is visible. The earlier peaks probably relate to the onset of industrialisation in the late nineteenth century, while the general increase is later (probably mid-twentieth century related to the expansion of Palmerston North). The large events clustered between 100 and 120 cm can bematched with large floods at the turn of the twentieth century (i.e., 1907, 1902 and 1897). Events predating this period have produced significantly larger peaks in the Z-score proxy grain-size record-notably around 130 cm and below 160 cm. Based on the palynological information and historical maps (abandonment of the channel before 1859), these peaks likely relate to extreme floods that occurred in the nineteenth century, probably those of 1880 and 1857. Several other large floods can be observed in the record before the flood-intense episode centred on the ~1850s."

    "heading": "4.2.2. Hamilton 2",
    "text": "Hamilton 2 (Figs. 7, A6) is located beyond stopbanks and away from tributary influences. The channel was abandoned (shortly) before 1859 (inferred from river position in 1859; Manawatu Catchment Board, 1982), and the last inundation was the 1953 flood prior to stopbank construction. Several clear trends were visible in channel-fill sedimentology. First, at the bottom a stepwise abandonment of the site with progressively finer overbankdeposits is evident. Around 2.50m a coarsening of material may relate to relocation of the active river closer to the site. Large floods are recorded (Z N 4), but events near the bottom of the core may have been amplified by the open channel connection conveying coarser material. No clear trends in contaminant metal concentration were observed, but a slight increase in Zn levels occurred in the upper 2 m. Although 1953 should have been the last flood to occupy the site, the first coarse flood unit is only found at c. 1 m depth. Above this level, the infilling might relate to more recent local runoff. The two events around 1 m depth are therefore probably the 1956 (2513 m3 s−1) and 1953 (3176 m3 s−1) floods. A flood-rich episode between 1898 and 1907 can be related to an intervalwith frequent coarse flood units between 2 and 2.5 m. Other smaller peaks between 1953 and 1907 relate to floods of lesser magnitude (2000–2500m3 s−1), such as 1949, 1947, 1941, 1936, 1926, 1924, 1917, and 1913. The peak at 3.5 m has a relative magnitude appropriate for the 1880 event, while one of the coarsest flood units near the base of the channel fill is likely to be related to the 1857 flood. This matches the inferred age of abandonment before 1859."

The pollen biomarker at ca. 2.25 m recording exotic species (post-European settlement) appears to conflict with the radiocarbon age of 1745–1585 cal. BP at a depth of c. 2.5 m in this core. European indicators (Rumex, Taraxacum) first appear between 225 and 218 cm in the Opiki core, with pine pollen appearing at 180 cm. No sedimentary or pedogenic evidence for a hiatus has been observed, suggesting incorporation of aged carbon in the radiocarbon date. This is the only site positioned downstream of the Oroua\nconfluence. The channel fill shows a typical abandonment sequence, with initially coarse deposits that grade into fine overbanks. Some variability in general overbank coarseness could be attributed to changes in the position of the active river, although given the low energy fluvial environment in this part of the system changes could also reflect discrete inputs from the nearby Oroua tributary. A number of large events are visible in the upper metre, with a flood unit very near to the surface. Because the stopbanks were constructed in the 1960s, this is very likely to be the 1953 event. Apart from the 1953 flood, a cluster of events between 70 and 90 cm are probably the 1897, 1902, and 1907 floods. The older part of the record is difficult to resolve; nonetheless, such information is useful in demonstrating that very large floods also occurred in the period before large-scale deforestation."

BP suggests a likely ~3 ka record of floods from this location. No European pollen indicators were observed in the samples from the Rocket site, suggesting that this site was mostly infilled prior to ca. 1840 CE. However, notably the upper 50 cm of the record was not sampled as a consequence of oxidation. Two bulk radiocarbon dates yielded ages of 2831–2775 cal BP at 3.85–3.90 m depth and 2850–2792 cal BP at 2.99–3.04 m depth. Deposits are all finely laminated overbank sediments, with gravel occurring below 5 m (not scanned). The upper 3.5 m is more fine-grained with a gradual coarsening upward, possibly related to the river migrating toward the site. Larger floods are evenly distributed throughout the core. High Zn concentrations linked to contamination were recorded at c. 50 cm. If the coarse flood unit around 1.5 m is the 1857 event, this sedimentary sequence provides evidence of several other large floods in the realm of 3500–4000 m3 s−1 in the earlier part of the nineteenth century and potentially also in the eighteenth century."

    "text": "Z-scores are site dependent, even for sites in the same reach of a river system, because they represent an offset compared with an average value, which differs given proximity effects and specific dynamics of channel infilling. Therefore, to compare flood Z-scores between locations, a statistical recurrence time is more useful. Additionally, a recurrence time can be compared with statistics of the gauged series, and allows us to test the relationship between major documented floods (ca. 1850–2015) in the Manawatu with the palaeoflood series. In the overbank palaeoflood sequence for the local records, where we have best time control and event dating, we regressed the Z-scores versus their statistical occurrence-time period of overbank section divided by the number of events exceeding a certain Z-score (Eq. (1)):\nRI ¼ y n\nð1Þ\nwhere RI is Recurrence interval (years), y is time span in overbank section, n is number of events exceeding a given Z-score.\nTo avoid jumps in the data (if for example a gap exists in Z-scores series, leading to unequally spaced data) and to get a realistic estimate on theRI of the largest Z-scoremeasured,we fitted a regression function through the estimated RIs vs. Z-scores. From these curves (Table 4) we recalculated the RI of all measured Z-scores. This procedure worked for all sites with the exception of Palmy Park, where a strong finingupward trend complicates the by-proxy relative magnitude identification of discrete large flood events on the basis of grain size. The results of this analysis demonstrate a good relationship between recurrence\nestimates based on the discharge series and the recurrence estimates based on the Manawatu palaeoflood record (Fig. 9). This confirms the robustness of using grain size as a proxy for estimating the relative magnitudes of palaeofloods in the Manawatu."

    "heading": "5. Discussion and conclusions",
    "text": "The sedimentary archive provided by palaeochannels in the lower Manawatu floodplain provides a high resolution and a long-term record of historic and prehistoric floods in the Manawatu catchment. This record is the first to provide an indicator of timing and of magnitude of discrete, storm-generated flood events in New Zealand in the late Holocene. The records from the distal palaeochannel at Napier Road (Figs. 6, 8), which has secure age control back as far as 2000 cal. YBP, suggests that historical floods are among the largest to have occurred in the Manawatu in the past 2000 years. Furthermore, of these floods, the largest estimated in excess of 4000 m3 s−1 in 1857 has not yet been surpassed and may well represent the largest in ~3000 years. The timing of such large flood events in themid- and late-1800s is consistentwith observations elsewhere in New Zealandwhere for example widespread deforestation in the Motueka catchment in the 1870s was followed by severe flooding and substantial erosion (Beatson and Whelan, 1993). A link between land cover change and changing flood magnitude and frequency is likely, since clearance of trees from a catchment increases the catchment runoff coefficient. Furthermore the endof the nineteenth century has been classified as a period of enhanced river\nactivity in New Zealand (Fuller et al., 2015), associated not only with human disturbance of catchments but also enhanced storminess (Norton et al., 1989) and neoglacial activity (Schaefer et al., 2009); and an enhanced southwesterly flow across New Zealand has been reconstructed during the Little Ice Age in New Zealand (Lorrey et al., 2014). Land cover changes and climate regime would appear to be favourable in generating large floods in the Manawatu catchment at this time.\nNonetheless, what the record presented here does imply is the absence of any particularly large or catastrophic flood event in the Manawatu during the past ~3000 years based on the nine sites in the ~20-km-long study reach. Several ‘200-year’ floods (~4500 m3 s−1) are likely, but nothing larger. The implication of this is that the extended Manawatu flood series indicates a relatively stable flood regime in this catchment or an upper physical boundary to meteorological events. This limit may be imposed by the Manawatu Gorge, which acts as a ‘throttle’ on floods generated from the eastern subcatchments (Manawatu Catchment Board, 1983), with the result that floodwaters pond to the east of the Gorge. The Manawatu flood series presented here does not appear to have been marked by notable variability in flood magnitude and frequency during the last two millennia. This may reflect the nature of the catchment, straddling as it does the coherent precipitation regions of the southwestern North Island and eastern North Island (Mullan, 1998) whose boundary is the axial ranges, which may insulate the lower reaches of the catchment from extreme floods. However, comparison with the CPF curve for the North Island does indicate that a number of flood-rich periods occurred in the past 2000 years (Fig. 6), at ca. 2300, 2100, 1700-1600, 750, 450-350, 150, and 80 cal. YBP.\nThe floodplain sedimentary archive presented here shows an acceleration in floodplain sedimentation following European forest clearance in the catchment. At the Rocket site, a sedimentation rate between ca. 870 BCE and 1857 CE of 0.57 mm y−1 compares with a rate of 9.49 mm yr−1 after 1857 (cf. Fig. 8). Extremely high rates of sedimentation were observed in the stopbanked floodplain at Hamilton 1 (58 mm y−1), where stopbanks constrain floodplain sedimentation resulting in aggradation and the development of a perched floodplain. This greatly exceeds more modest rates of 9.5 mm y−1 recorded since 1857 at Riverside Drive, where the floodplain is not stopbanked and flood deposits are more widely dispersed. This relatively modest sedimentation rate (9.5 mm y−1) corresponds with floodplain sedimentation rates elsewhere in New Zealand following post-settlement catchment disturbance (Richardson et al., 2014). The implications for palaeoflood reconstruction are that a very high resolution of floods is preserved since the 1800s, but probably only the largest floods register a clear sedimentary signature in the record prior to this, particularly in distal cores. This weaker sedimentary signature, together with limited means of constraining ages in these cores, presents challenges for palaeoflood reconstruction in the Manawatu record.\nAs a proof of concept, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that high resolution flood records can be reconstructed from XRF core scanning. This also provides a useful insight into understanding magnitude and frequency of very large floods, which is essential for flood risk assessment in a changing climate."

  "abstractText": "Article history: Received 29 September 2017 Received in revised form 13 March 2018 Accepted 13 March 2018 Available online 16 March 2018 This paper reports the first reconstruction of storm-generated late Holocene and historical river floods in the North Island of New Zealand. The sedimentary infills of nine palaeochannels were studied in the lower alluvial reaches of the Manawatu River. Floods in these palaeochannels were recorded as a series of sand-rich units set within finergrained fills. Flood chronologieswere constrained using a combination of radiocarbon dating, documentary sources, geochemical markers, and palynological information. Flood units were sedimentologically and geochemically characterised using high resolution ITRAXTM X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) core scanning and laser diffraction grainsize analysis. The longest palaeoflood record extends back ca.3000 years. The temporal resolution and length of the Manawatu record reflects accommodation space for fluvial deposits, channel dynamics and mobility, and high sediment supply. Floods that occurred in the Manawatu during the mid-1800s at the time of European land clearance and in the first decade of the twentieth century appear to be among the largest recorded in the last 3000 years. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
