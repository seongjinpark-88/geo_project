The most significant marker of this event is the negative 13C shift and rebound recorded in marine carbonates with a duration ranging rom 2000 to 19 000 years depending on localities and sedimentation rates. Leading causes for the event are Siberian trap volcanism and the mission of greenhouse gases with consequent global warming. Measurements of gases vaulted in calcite of end Permian brachiopods and whole ock document significant differences in normal atmospheric equilibrium concentration in gases between modern and end Permian seawaters. The as composition of the end Permian brachiopod-inclusions reflects dramatically higher seawater carbon dioxide and methane contents leading up o the biotic event. Initial global warming of 8–11 ◦C sourced by isotopically light carbon dioxide from volcanic emissions triggered the release f isotopically lighter methane from permafrost and shelf sediment methane hydrates. Consequently, the huge quantities of methane emitted into he atmosphere and the oceans accelerated global warming and marked the negative 13C spike observed in marine carbonates, documenting the nset of the mass extinction period. The rapidity of the methane hydrate emission lasting from several years to thousands of years was tempered y the equally rapid oxidation of the atmospheric and oceanic methane that gradually reduced its warming potential but not before global warming ad reached levels lethal to most life on land and in the oceans. Based on measurements of gases trapped in biogenic and abiogenic calcite, the elease of methane (of ∼3–14% of total C stored) from permafrost and shelf sediment methane hydrate is deemed the ultimate source and cause for he dramatic life-changing global warming (GMAT > 34 ◦C) and oceanic negative-carbon isotope excursion observed at the end Permian. Global arming triggered by the massive release of carbon dioxide may be catastrophic, but the release of methane from hydrate may be apocalyptic. he end Permian holds an important lesson for humanity regarding the issue it faces today with greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and limate change.\n2016 Elsevier B.V. and Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS.

Numerous causes have been proosed for the catastrophic end Permian mass extinction, which ay have acted alone or in concert, but with many researchers avoring a tangled web of interacting and related causes and ffects such as global warming, anoxia and/or acidification (e.g., ignall and Hallam, 1992; Cao et al., 2009; Clarkson et al., 015). This global event is increasingly associated with the iberian Trap volcanism and emission of the greenhouse gas O2 leading to global warming (e.g., Svensen et al., 2009; chneebeli-Hermann et al., 2013). Some suggest that methane rom a variety of sources may have played a supporting role Berner, 2002; Retallack and Jahren, 2008; Brand et al., 2012), hile oceanic anoxia was a minor and/or local player (e.g., Brand t al., 2012; Garbelli et al., 2015), and acidification only played role during the Early Triassic (e.g., Clarkson et al., 2015).\nCarbonates may contain gas trapped in minuscule incluions that are readily released during crushing and subsequently ay be analyzed by mass spectrometer for their gas make-up nd compositions (e.g., Blamey, 2012). If the gases in these nclusions were trapped during formation/precipitation of the arbonate and remained sealed/vaulted in the inclusions, then hey may represent seawater-dissolved gas, and with Henry’s aw and mass balance calculations, we may establish a link etween the hydrosphere and atmosphere (Brand et al., 2015b).\nrachiopods are ideal archives because they precipitate low-Mg alcite shells that are resistant to post-depositional alteration Brand and Veizer, 1980; Brand, 2004), and they incorporate\ni w e\nd duration of the mass extinction period is from Burgess et al. (2014).\narbon and oxygen isotopes into shell calcite in or near equiibrium with ambient seawater (cf. Lowenstam, 1961; Brand t al., 2013, 2015a). Furthermore, to reflect ambient environental oceanographic conditions, biogenic carbonates including rachiopods must incorporate dissolved gases and water into hell calcite inclusions from seawater without modification of he normal atmospheric equilibrium parameters (NAEC; Fig. 2). nclusions, microstructural defects manifested as pore, in modrn brachiopods (Griesshaber et al., 2007, fig. 2; Goetz et al., 009, fig. 2b) and in the end Permian brachiopod Comeliania sp. indet. (Fig. 3) may be quite small. Even smaller ores (nanostructural defects) are observed in some brachiood shells (Fig. 4A) and probably quite applicable to the icron-sized micrite in whole rock, are sufficiently ubiquious (Fig. 4B) to satisfy the volume requirements demanded y the standard operating protocol of the analytical crush ast-scan mass spectrometry (CFS-MS) method for measurng trapped gases in inclusions. Gas and fluids with dissolved as may be trapped during the depositional growth phase nd/or the early diagenetic stage degradation of the organic tisue covering brachiopod fibers and micrite crystallites (Emig, 990).\nOur objectives are, (1) to characterize the gases in modern rachiopods and coral and use them as references and baselines or evaluating gases measured in the end Permian brachiopod hells and whole rock, (2) decipher the atmospheric and oceanoraphic conditions leading up to the end Permian event, and (3) dentify the ultimate source/trigger for the catastrophic global arming and climate change event during the biggest mass xtinction in Earth history.\n498 U.

Brand et al. / Palae\n. Material and methodology\n.1. Sample material\nSpecimens of the modern brachiopod Magellania venosa ere collected at the jetty in Huinay, Chile in Comau Fjord,\nnd other modern shallow water brachiopods and corals were ollected at Friday Harbor, Washington State and Signy Island, ntarctica (Brand et al., 2013) and from Indonesia (Azmy et al., 010). The fossil shallow-water brachiopods and whole rock ere collected from the uppermost Permian Bulla Member of he Bellerophon Formation and Tesero Member of the Werfen ormation, northern Italy (Brand et al., 2012).\n.2. Microstructural analysis\nAll material was cleaned of surface contaminants and the eriostracum, while fossil brachiopods were extracted from the nclosing whole rock, and further cleaned by physical and chemcal means (cf. Brand et al., 2012). Fossil brachiopods were ut longitudinally and thin sectioned for etching with 5% HCl or 20 s and subsequent metallic coating. Microstructures were nvestigated with a Cambridge S-360 scanning electron microcope (SEM) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.\nTo visualize the presence of micro- (>1 m) and nanopores <1 m) created by degradation of biopolymer membrane and brils in modern brachiopods, shell fragments were mounted n 3 mm thick cylindrical aluminum rods. The samples were hen cut with a Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome with glass knifes o obtain a plane surface. Subsequently, surfaces were polshed with a Diatome diamond knife by stepwise removal f layers with successively decreasing thicknesses (90 nm, 0 nm, 40 nm, 20 nm, 10 nm and 5 nm; each step was repeated 5 times). The highly even surface was etched between 0 and 120 s with a 0.1 M HEPES solution adjusted to a H of 6.5. Etching of the carbonate mineral was accompaied by fixation of organic components with a solution of .5% glutaraldehyde. Etching and fixation were completed y dehydration of samples in 100% isopropanol alcohol; 3 imes for 10 s each. Subsequently shells were critically point ried in a BAL-TEC CPD 030 (Liechtenstein), then rotary oated with 3 nm of platinum and imaged at 4 kV using a itachi S5200 field-emission scanning electron microscope FE-SEM). Biopolymer decomposition was carried out with laboratoryased hydrothermal alteration. Shell pieces were placed in a eflon liner together with 25 mL of meteoric solution. Subseuently, the liner sealed with a Teflon lid was introduced into a tainless steel autoclave, sealed again, and placed in an oven at 75 ◦C for 14 days. This laboratory procedure quickly destroys he organic tissue covering the fibers and the organic fibrils ithin them, and gaps and voids between and within the fibers\necome readily visible (cf. natural decomposition, Emig, 1990; upplementary Figs. 1, 2).\nSamples were also inspected by cathodoluminescence (CL) sing a Nuclide ELM2 cathode luminoscope operating at 10 kV\nC\ng g\nd 25 (2016) 496–507 499\nnd 5–7 mA. Trace chemistry and stable isotope analyses and esults are well described in Brand et al. (2012).\n.3. Analytical gas method\nModern and fossil brachiopods and whole rock were meaured for inclusion gas in their calcite fibers (secondary layer) nd columns (tertiary layer) by mass spectrometry. Extraction nd analysis of volatiles were performed by the crush-fast scan CFS) method (Norman and Blamey, 2001; Blamey, 2012), and t room temperature it offers low detection limits (1.2e−15 mol, σ) with negligible blank readings (<4.14e−14 mols CH4 to 1.0e−16 mols Ar).\nPrior to analysis, the crushing area and bellows of the crusher ere cleaned with potassium hydroxide. Any potassium hydroxde residue was removed by swabbing with deionized water, ollowed by an isopropanol wash and air-drying. Subsequently, he crushing chamber was baked at 150 ◦C for 72 h prior to loadng the first sample. Furthermore, the mass spectrometer’s (MS) hamber was baked-out at 150–200 ◦C overnight followed by ooling to room temperature prior to analysis of samples. The S chamber is isolated from the crushing area that holds the ample material, which affords the ability to bake out the former very evening. This procedure prevents heating of samples in the rushing chamber while allowing the removal of gas adhering o or trapped interstitially in the sample material by vacuum umping.\nSamples the size of a match head (e.g., ∼100 mg) were leaned with KOH then air-dried at room temperature. Samples ere then loaded into the crushing chamber and held under vacum (∼10−8 Torr) for 18 h. During the analysis phase, samples ere crushed in swift increments, with each crush producing\nburst of mixed volatile gas that is individually analyzed. A ypical sample size of about 100 mg (one or two 3-mm grains) eleases four to ten bursts of volatile gas (up to ∼2 × 10−11 mol) nto the MS vacuum chamber, where it remains for 8–10 anayzer scans (∼2 s) before removal by turbo pump. This method oes not require a carrier gas and volatiles are not separated from ach other but released simultaneously into the chamber.\nThe MS was calibrated using Scotty Mini-mix commercial tandard gas mixture, synthetic inclusions filled with gas mixures, and three in-house fluid/gas inclusion gas standards as escribed by Norman and Blamey (2001). The Mini-mix gas ixture has a 2% error in the value of the secondary gas mixed ith nitrogen. Detection limits are described, in detail, for the analytical proess by Blamey et al. (2012). The analytical error (one sigma) s determined from multiple analyses of the NB-84 internal tandard for carbon dioxide (Appendix). Errors for other gases re determined by multiplying the CO2 error by the ratio of the O2 sensitivity factor (see Blamey et al., 2012) and by the senitivity factors for the other gases. Error relative to the reported alue for CO2 of 13.0%, Ar is 11.4%, O2 is 15.8%, N2 is 7.1%,\nH4 is 8.2%, He is 11.6%, and H2 is 3.0%.\nConversion of mass spectrometer current readings (amps) to as concentration (moles) was achieved by analyzing the major as contents of 1 L capillary tubes containing atmosphere\n5 oworld 25 (2016) 496–507\na A s ( r o T r d 1 h n e\nN g p s t b g a\n3\n( c b i c t p e (\nb g i p M C t m g o a p b T c F\ns c r r\na B c a a\n4\ni c c s a o b b g n t ( c a e\nt I c a\n00 U.

The number of moles of nitrogen obtained using PV = nRT) was equated to the measured curent. The equivalence determined at the time of measurement f meteorites was 1680 amps per mole (Blamey et al., 2015). he uncertainty in measurement was less than 1.8%. Blank curent was about double that of background current. The standard eviation of the mass spectrometer’s signal to noise ratio at mass 5 background was 1.196e−13. Overall, analytical gas signals ave precision of better than 0.5% (1σ), and gas content of interal standard NB-84 is within 1% of reported contents (Blamey t al., 2015).\nEach sample gas burst was analyzed for H2, He, CH4, 2, O2, Ar, and CO2, using two Pfeiffer Prisma “residualas” quadrupole mass spectrometers operating in fast-scan, eak-hopping mode at room temperature. A total of 37 gas meaurements were made on seven modern biogenic samples, and a otal of 44 gas measurements were obtained on six end Permian rachiopod and whole rock samples. A total of 81 normalized as measurements (weighted by gas burst size) reported in mol% re listed in the Appendix.\n. Diagenetic screening\nThe physical evidence supports the presence of suitable pores Figs. 3, 4) but that is only the first step in the evaluation proess. Furthermore, we must establish that the gas contents of rachiopod and other marine archives reflect NAEC of gases n seawater and consequently of the atmosphere. A plot of gas ontents of several modern brachiopods and one coral shows that hey indeed reflect equilibrium seawater and atmospheric comositions, which confirms their potential as archives of trapping nvironmental gases for paleo-atmospheric gas reconstructions Fig. 2).\nPreservation of fossil biogenic and abiogenic material must e established to document their reliability as carriers of NAEC ases. Petrographic (including CL), microstructural, trace chemstry and stable isotope evaluations are conducted to assess the reservation state of carbonates (cf. Brand and Veizer, 1980). icrostructural evaluations of the end Permian brachiopod omelicania show the excellent preservation of fibers within heir secondary layer as well as that of the growth-increment arked calcite columns of the tertiary layer (Fig. 3). This sugests that the shells of the brachiopods are preserved in their riginal low-Mg calcite mineralogy (cf. Brand et al., 2012). In ddition, the SEM micrographs show the presence of microores (microstructural defects) in both types of calcite of the rachiopods; potential sites for trapped fluid and/or gas (Fig. 3). he supplementary figures allow for the precise positioning and ontext of the pores within brachiopods shells (Supplementary igs. 1, 2).\nAdditional screening was carried out using trace element and table isotope distributions. The Sr/Mn ratios suggest that all brahiopod samples are better preserved than their enclosing whole ock. In contrast, the carbon isotope composition with its higher esistance to alteration suggests that the selected brachiopods\nl F r f\ncf. Brand and Veizer, 1980). Samples in solid colors were chosen for gas analysis ased on preservation status (geochemical and microstructural evidence).\nnd whole rock are the most pristine (solid symbols, Fig. 5; rand and Veizer, 1980). Furthermore, the similarity in the gas ontents of the brachiopods and whole rock suggests that altertion (diagenetic, biochemical) was inconsequential for the six rchives chosen from the end Permian of northern Italy (Fig. 6).\n. Gas classification\nFurther screening was conducted to test for the reliability n retaining NAEC of gases with the passage of time in the arbonates. Gas results of modern brachiopods plot in an area haracterizing marine conditions in equilibrium with the atmophere defined by CO2/CH4 ratios ranging from 10 to 1000, nd by N2/Ar ratios ranging from 35 to 130 (Table 1, Fig. 6), n the modified gas classification scheme originally proposed y Norman and Moore (1999) and Moore et al. (2001). Field oundaries have been constructed to accommodate ranges of as measured in modern marine biogenic and abiogenic carboates (1), for fresh-water carbonates (2), as well as carbonates hat have experienced post-depositional (diagenetic) alteration 3), and gas concentration variations in marine carbonates with hanges in atmospheric (seawater) chemistry and water salinity nd temperature (4), and changes in seawater chemistry influnced by bacterial carbonate reduction (Field 5, Fig. 6).\nIn contrast to the modern biogenic carbonates (Field 1), he end Permian brachiopods and whole rock from northern taly plot into Field 4 designated modified Marine [change in hemistry] characterized by secular changes in seawater and tmospheric gas chemistry (Fig. 6). By virtue of their excelent preservation and constrained by their gas values within ield 4, the gas results from the end Permian samples should eflect ambient seawater/atmospheric conditions during time of ormation.\nU.

Carbon Isotope Excursion (CIE)\nThe negative carbon isotope excursion (nCIE) in marine caronates has been long recognized as an important marker of the nd Permian (PT) event at Meishan, China and global localities, nd it may vary by as much as 6.5‰ (Fig. 1; e.g., Jin et al., 000; Retallack and Krull, 2006; Brand et al., 2012; Garbelli t al., 2015). However, its origin, source and duration remain\nt s s\nroblematic (Berner, 2002), and consequently, a definitive cause nd mechanism for the nCIE and PT event still eludes us. A ecent study by Burgess et al. (2014) provided more precise ages, nd thus improved times for the onset, duration and offset of the ass extinction event that are essential in better understanding he reorganization of the carbon cycle and identifying a potential ource for the trigger and kill mechanisms. Burgess et al. (2014) uggested, depending on sedimentation rate, the negative CIE\n502 U.

Brand et al., 2012).\n.1. Meishan – northern Italy nCIE Trend\nIn conjunction with results from Meishan, precisely placed nd well-preserved samples from the end Permian succession n northern Italy provide the requisite high-resolution database Brand et al., 2012) to shed more light on the cause of the greatest ass extinction. Gas ratios of the end Permian samples fall into ield 4 (marine carbonates with changing chemistry, Fig. 6), and ith methane dominating the greenhouse gas content relative to hat of modern counterparts (Tables 1, 2). A closer examinaion of the time interval preceding the mass extinction clearly hows a negative CIE of about 3.5‰ leading up to the major vent at Meishan, and in part, in northern Italy (Fig. 7A), while\nsmaller but distinct negative 13C excursion in the lower half f bed 24e at Meishan is also recognized in the results from Italy Fig. 7B; cf. Brand et al., 2012). These two negative carbon isoope excursions are designated ‘Pulse 1’ and ‘Pulse 2’, which lso correspond to negative excursions of the brachiopod 18O alues from Italy (Fig. 7C, expressed in T◦C). Based on the 18O alues of conodonts, water temperatures at Meishan remained round 25 ◦C and reached higher ones only during deposition of ed 26 and subsequent beds (Joachimski et al., 2012), whereas hose from northern Italy based on shallow water brachiopod omelicania ranged from 30 ◦C up to 35 ◦C just before the xtinction (Fig. 7C; Brand et al., 2012). The water temperatures ssociated with Pulse 2 are sufficiently high (GMAT, Table 3) to ause stress for many tropical and polar organisms because of heir poor acclimation capacity (e.g., Stillman, 2003; Peck et al., 010), leading to widespread lethal environmental conditions nd possibly mass die-off.\nThe measured CO2/CH4 ratios of the end Permian samples re relatively low (Table 2) and essentially invariant but marked y two distinct pulses corresponding to the negative carbon and xygen isotope excursions and warming trend pulses noted at eishan and northern Italy (Fig. 7D). The first gas pulse correponds to the small but significant nCIE noted in the lower half\na t c m\nf Bed 24e at Meishan and to corresponding levels in northern taly (Fig. 7A, B). The subsequent rise in the gas ratio may be elated to the rapid oxidation of some of the released methane o carbon dioxide (Berner, 2002). The second pulse and more ronounced fall in the CO2/CH4 ratio document a significant pswing in methane emission just before the onset of the end ermian biotic crisis, which corresponds well with the worldide observed nCIE and water temperature changes observed n northern Italy and Tibet (cf. Brand et al., 2012; Garbelli et al., 015).\n. End Permian atmospheric conditions\nGenerally, uncertainties of timing and duration of events limit he interpretations of many important biologic/geologic events, ncluding the end Permian mass extinction (e.g., Rampino et al., 000; Posenato, 2009; Shen et al., 2010). But this critical issue f time has been resolved with results from recent publications hat allow for the improved geochemical characterization of he source(s) for this most dramatic event (Brand et al., 2012; oachimski et al., 2012; Burgess et al., 2014). The issue of mbient gas content and concentration is resolved by the crush ast-scan method that measures gas trapped in tiny pores of select odern and fossil materials reflecting marine and atmospheric ystems (Tables 1, 2; cf. Brand et al., 2015a). Consequently, only he best material with preserved NAEC of gases in seawater will e used in characterizing the end Permian atmosphere (Field 4, ig. 6).\nThe greenhouse gas build-up prior to the PT event was riven by carbon dioxide emitted by Siberian Trap volcanic eposits (e.g., Svensen et al., 2009), and methane emission rom hydrates/clathrates is a leading contender for ‘pushing’ he global warming process over the sustainable limit (e.g., etallack and Jahren, 2008). Armed with pre-industrial atmopheric conditions, we note a gradual but rising shift in both CO2 nd CH4 by the 1980s (Table 3). This time interval clearly defines he relationship between atmospheric and marine hydrospheric onditions and those of the ambient biogenic and abiogenic arine carbonates.\nU.

Pulses 1 and 2 correlate with trend in 13C v as ratios. Gas symbols as in Fig. 6.\n.1. Model and measured parameters\nA number of researchers modeled gas ratios for the end Perman (e.g., Berner, 2002; Kiehl and Shields, 2005; Retallack and ahren, 2008; Brand et al., 2012) with contents ranging from 700 ppm to 3550 ppmv for CO2, and ‘constant’ 0.7 ppmv for H4 (during the end Perm (a), end Perm (d1), Table 3). A suplemental parameter of fixed CO2 and variable CH4 is added to he discussion and this segment (end Perm (c), Table 3). There re potentially a number of concerns with these modeled atmopheric parameters, such as, (1) the mean global atmospheric emperatures derived from these parameters may not be high nough to bring about a biotic crisis, and (2) there was insuffiient negative carbon to produce the world-wide observed nCIE t the end Permian (e.g., Berner, 2002).\nTwo modeled parameters, 1 (end Perm (a), Table 3) and 2 (end erm (b), Table 3), assume no change or contribution by methane\no the global climate change scenario, and with Brachratios (780 nd 476) well above those measured in modern and end Permian ounterparts. Clearly, the two-modeled parameters are outside he realm of possibility of the gas ratios measured in the end ermian brachiopods (Table 2). It is apparent that the inconsisency does not rest with the postulated CO2 contents but with he methane component, and consequently, alternatives to the onstant and static CH composition must be contemplated.\n4\nThe third model parameters suggest conditions (end Perm c), Table 3) equally unsatisfactory with proposed modern caron dioxide levels but an increased methane component since\ns o i t\nfrom China and northern Italy, seawater temperatures and measured CO2/CH4\nhe postulated global GMAT (20.3 ◦C) is quite insufficient to rigger a biotic crisis. Furthermore, pH level with this atmopheric parameter (8.28) was unlikely to cause great concerns ith oceanic acidification, unlike the ones calculated for the first wo model conditions (7.64, 7.78, Table 3). It has been proposed that CO2 may have varied for the end ermian between 1700 and 3500 ppm (Table 3). With an atmopheric ratio of 27.8 based on the average brachiopod ratio of .3 determined for the end Permian, we are able to determine the ethane concentration during the end Permian. In this instance, H4 may have varied between a low of about 61 (pre-Pulse) and\nhigh of about 245 ppmv (Pulse 2) with corresponding amounts f carbon dioxide (Table 3). Global temperature and seawater H levels are sufficiently high and low, respectively, and with hese postulated gas parameters environmental conditions might e a challenge for terrestrial and marine life.\n.2. End Permian atmosphere\nA detailed evaluation of the gas components and their trends uggests that during pre-Pulse time the brachiopod CO2/CH4 atio was about 4.3, but during Pulse 1 it dropped to 3.3, and hen to 2.2 during Pulse 2 with recoveries in between (Fig. 7D, able 3). Maintaining the appropriate ratios and modeled atmopheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the methane content f the atmosphere may have varied from a low of 61 ppmv durng pre-Pulse time to 121 ppmv during Pulse 1 and increased o possibly 245 ppmv at the onset of the biotic crisis (Fig. 7D,\n504 U.

In addition, the determined pH values f 7.85–7.69 are sufficiently low to suggest some acidification f seawater during this critical time period (Table 3).\n. Methane source\nThe question arises: is the emission of gas from Siberian Trap olcanism sufficient to cause both the exacerbated warming and egative carbon isotope shift experienced during the end Perman (Fig. 8a)? The answer on both accounts is in the negative e.g., Berner, 2002; Retallack and Jahren, 2008; Brand et al., 012), and thus a new question must be posed whether there is ufficient methane stored in permafrost and marine sediment, pon release, to cause a major perturbation of the global caron cycle with subsequent warming and its accompanying nCIE Fig. 8b). If the amount of methane in the atmosphere varied from 1 to about 245 ppmv based on gas measured in end Permian arine carbonates (Table 4), we should be able to determine the mount of stored isotopically light methane that would need to e released from these two reservoirs. With about 2800 Gt of\nstored in the two major sinks of marine sediments and per-\nafrost today (Kvenvolden, 1988; Boswell and Collett, 2011), nd under present climatic conditions there has been a miniscule elease of 0.1% methane hydrates over the last 100 years from arine sediments amounting to an atmospheric contribution of\nt s m\n125 ppbv CH4 (Table 4; Ruppel, 2011). We performed simple ass balance calculations of methane release for a period of 00 years and distributed these evenly among the permafrost nd marine sediment reservoirs of methane hydrate. During the re-Pulse stage atmospheric methane attained a level of about 1 200 ppbv (Table 4) and when combined with the emission ate of 1125 ppbv/100 years equal to 0.1% from methane hydrate ives a contribution of about 2.7% and 4.9% from the marine ediment and permafrost reservoirs, respectively, for a total mass f about 98 Gt C/100 years (Table 4). For Pulse 1, the amount of ethane released would have been equivalent to about 5.4 and .7%, respectively, for a total contribution of 193 Gt C/100 years\nTable 4). For Pulse 2, the amount of methane released would ave been equivalent to about 10.9 and 19.6%, respectively, for total contribution of about 392 Gt C/100 years (Table 4). These ontributions equate to yearly rates ranging from 1.0 to 3.9 Gt C CH4), which are similar to emission rates of 0.8–2.1 Gt C/y calulated for C-isotope depleted carbon dioxide derived from the xperimental metamorphism of carbon rich sediments (Svensen t al., 2009). This process would be coeval to the release of gas by he Siberian Traps and not limited to just the ‘end’ of the Perman just slightly preceding the biotic event, and furthermore, it is ot supported by the rapid onset of the well-documented nCIE Figs. 1, 7).\nIt is clear from our discussion and the extensive literature hat warming of the Earth was caused by carbon dioxide emision during Siberian Trap volcanism (Fig. 8).

Brand et al. / Palae\nnd Permian, global temperatures reached levels detrimental o marine and terrestrial life, and its oxidized product (highly egative carbon dioxide) caused the prominent negative caron isotope excursion documented in many global marine and errestrial sequences (cf. Berner, 2002; Schneebeli-Hermann t al., 2013). Thus, the gas contents of inclusions measured in arine carbonates from the end Permian support the concept hat methane released from permafrost and marine sediments as the major cause for the greatest biotic crisis (Fig. 8).\n. Conclusions\nBiogenic and abiogenic carbonates from the end Permian uccession in northern Italy carry inclusion gases that formed in ormal atmospheric equilibrium between the ambient seawater nd atmosphere. Gas measured in inclusions suggests two pulses f methane emission before the end Permian mass extinction vent.\nCarbon dioxide derived from Siberian Trap volcanism with its 13C value of about −6‰ would bring about a warming of about ◦C and a shift in marine carbonate 13C values by about −2‰. he rapid addition of isotopically lighter methane (∼−60‰) to\nhe global atmosphere and hydrosphere would bump up the averge global temperature to well above 29 ◦C, and after oxidation he 13C signature in marine carbonates would record carbon sotope compositions ranging from −2 to −7‰.\nThe emission of carbon dioxide from volcanic deposits may ave started the world onto the road of mass extinction, but it as the release of methane from shelf sediments and permafrost ydrates that was the ultimate cause for the catastrophic biotic vent at the end Permian.\nOur observations on the global warming process, such as the elease of massive amounts of carbon dioxide and subsequently ollowed by methane from hydrates, and their impacts on life uring the end Permian may have important lessons for humanity nd the problems associated with climate change in the 21st entury.\ncknowledgements\nWe thank Dr. Fan-Wei Meng and an anonymous reviewer or their helpful comments on the manuscript, and Mike Lozon Brock University) for drafting and constructing the figures.
