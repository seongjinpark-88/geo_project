It has been argued carbonate and pyrite are potentially important minerals controlling the climate of Venus, though existence of either minerals has not been confirmed. Although it used to be proposed that carbonation reaction might explain the Venus’ atmospheric CO2 abundance, it is unlikely Venus’ surface is reactive enough to control the Venus’ massive CO2 atmosphere. Venus’ surface carbonate is also able to affect the climate through the reaction with atmospheric SO2 to form anhydrite. Under the carbonate model the climate state is not in equilibrium and would be unstable due to the reaction between carbonate and SO2. On the other hand, pyrite–magnetite reaction is proposed to explain the Venus’ atmospheric SO2 abundance. Under pyrite–magnetite reaction, however, the climate would be stabilized such that the existing climate state is maintained over a geological timescale, while some observational facts such as atmospheric abundance of SO2 and surface temperature could also be reasonably explained. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

    "text": "Prior to the space age, Venus and Earth were thought to be similar, though spacecraft exploration has revealed they have a completely different surface environment (Table 1), e.g. the Venus surface temperature is as high as 737K versus 288K for Earth (e.g. Fegley, 1995; and references therein). The high surface temperature of Venus is thought to be maintained by the greenhouse effect caused by a thick atmosphere and clouds (e.g. Pollack et al., 1980). Due to the high surface temperature and pressure which enhance the gas–solid reactions on the planetary surface, it has also been suggested that the abundance of atmospheric constituents including infrared-active spe-\ne front matter r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Hashimoto).\ncies are affected by the chemical interaction between the atmosphere and surface (e.g. Fegley and Treiman, 1992). Actually, the abundance of some atmospheric species has been well explained by chemical equilibria between the atmosphere and solid surface (e.g. Fegley and Treiman, 1992). That is, when the atmospheric composition is controlled by chemical reactions at the planetary surface, a coupling of the surface chemical reaction and greenhouse effect plays an important role in controlling the surface environment. Surface temperature changes accordingly alter the atmospheric composition because the chemical equilibria is strongly dependent on temperature such that changes in the atmospheric composition affect the surface temperature via the greenhouse effect. Although it has been argued that coupling of the surface chemical reaction(s) and greenhouse effect plays an important role in controlling climate (Hashimoto and\nARTICLE IN PRESS\nG.L. Hashimoto, Y. Abe / Planetary and Space Science 53 (2005) 839–848840\nAbe, 1995, 1997; Hashimoto et al., 1997; Bullock and Grinspoon, 1996), another significant aspect is the fact that clouds are also affected by changes in the atmosphere’s chemical and physical state. The sulfuric acid clouds produced by photochemical reactions are expected to be strongly involved in atmospheric composition (e.g. Krasnopolsky and Pollack, 1994), with such Venus cloud having a large influence on atmosphere thermal balance (e.g. Pollack et al., 1980). Evaluating the variability of clouds and its influence on surface temperature is therefore necessary for studying the climate system of Venus. The development of a Venus cloud model, being the key factor in the climate model, was developed by Hashimoto and Abe (1996, 2001) and has since enabled meaningful analysis of the stability and evolution of the Venus climate (Hashimoto and Abe, 1997, 2000; Bullock and Grinspoon, 1998, 2001). Here we review two models describing the Venus climate system: the carbonate (e.g. Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001) and pyrite (e.g. Hashimoto and Abe, 2000) models. Both climate models consider radiative– convective processes in the atmosphere, chemical interactions between the atmosphere and planetary surface, and changes in cloud structure caused by variations in atmospheric states. However, they significantly differ regarding the assumption of surface mineral content; i.e., the carbonate model assumes the presence of carbonate and non-existence of pyrite, whereas the pyrite model assumes the presence of pyrite and non-existence of carbonate. While the models are accordingly completely different in their prediction of the behavior and the current climate state, the lack of Venus surface observations makes it impossible to assuredly determine which model is the best for representing the climate system. With this in mind, the strengths and weaknesses of the two models are considered in detail."

    "heading": "2.2. Carbonate buffer",
    "text": "Originally, the most attractive aspect of the model was its potential for explaining the atmospheric abundance of CO2. This is called the carbonate buffer hypothesis (e.g. Urey, 1952; Lewis, 1970; Fegley and Treiman, 1992) which is based on the fact that the observed surface condition coincides with the CO2 equilibrium partial pressure over the calcite–quartz– wollastonite assemblage within the uncertainties of thermodynamical data, i.e.,\nCaCO3 (calcite) þ SiO2 (quartz) 2 CaSiO3 (wollastonite) þCO2. (1)\nAn operation of carbonate buffer is therefore strongly suggested, whereby the partial pressure of CO2 is maintained at its equilibrium value over a carbonate– silicate mixture. In this hypothesis, formation or decomposition of carbonate stabilizes the abundance of atmospheric CO2 such that when volcanism causes CO2 releases into the atmosphere this leads to carbonate formation due to increases in CO2 pressure which favors such formation and removes CO2. A decrease in atmospheric CO2 is similarly replenished by carbonate decomposition. However, carbonate buffer hypothesis meets several difficulties, since buffering a 90 bar of CO2 atmosphere requires a large carbonate rock (CaCO3) reservoir whose size is comparable to that of the atmosphere. If 90 bar of CO2 were all converted into carbonate rock and its density is 3000 kg=m3, then the equivalent amount of carbonate rock is a layer about 1 km thick. The 1 km layer of CaCO3 requires extraction of all the Ca from nearly 10 km of basalt. Since mineral grains may become unreactive once they are coated with a thin layer of carbonate, so the layer of rock required to react would be tens to hundreds of km if significant buffering of atmospheric CO2 to occur. It seems difficult to assume that there is any diffusion of gases into such a depth.\nARTICLE IN PRESS G.L. Hashimoto, Y. Abe / Planetary and Space Science 53 (2005) 839–848 841\nBullock and Grinspoon (1996) attempted to describe the diffusion of gases through the surface rocks and demonstrated that Venusian CO2 atmosphere can be buffered. That model was adapted directly from a model of the soil of Mars (Bullock et al., 1994) and use a kinetics data measured by Mueller and Kridelbaugh (1973). However, it is not assured Venus’ surface layer more than tens of km thick is as porous as Mars’ surface that is indeed porous as indicated by aeolian landforms (dunes). Also the kinetics data of Mueller and Kridelbaugh (1973) may be inadequate for the application to the Venus, since experiments are performed under wet conditions (Fegley and Treiman, 1992). The water probably works as a catalyst, though the lower atmosphere of Venus contains only a small amount of water vapor. Furthermore, carbonation reaction (1) is a solid–solid reaction requiring mechanical mixing of materials. Without mechanical mixing, the decarbonation reaction does not respond to given perturbations. It is not assured that carbonation reaction proceeds on a geological timescale that controls atmospheric abundance. Even if Venus’ surface is reactive enough to control the atmospheric CO2 abundance, carbonate buffer hypothesis fails to explain the current Venus’ atmosphere. The hypothesis of carbonate buffer does not take temperature into account, i.e., changes in the atmospheric CO2 abundance will change atmospheric temperature due to the greenhouse effect of CO2. When atmospheric CO2 increases, surface pressure and temperature both increase. Although a pressure increase favors carbonate formation, a temperature increase favors carbonate decomposition. Therefore, the greenhouse effect is a positive feedback and is destabilizing the system. Hashimoto et al. (1997) examined the Venus’ climate system by simultaneously incorporating the effect of temperature and pressure changes. They concluded that the system is unstable when carbonation reaction buffer the atmospheric CO2 abundance.\n2.3. Overabundance of SO2\nWe know that the Venus lower atmosphere contains a significantly higher concentration of SO2 than the value in equilibrium with carbonate (e.g. Fegley and Treiman, 1992). If carbonate does indeed exist on the surface, the SO2 abundance in the lower atmosphere will be controlled by\nSO2 þ CaCO3 (calcite) 2 CaSO4 (anhydrite) þCO. (2)\nThen, a problem arises in that the equilibrium SO2 pressure for reaction (2) is approximately 1% of the observed value; a discrepancy referred to as the SO2 overabundance. Even if the uncertainties of the thermochemical data and CO concentration were taken into\naccount, it is difficult to reconcile a two order of magnitude difference between the equilibrium concentration and observed SO2 abundance. The carbonate on the planet surface would in this case be replaced by sulfate minerals by reacting with atmospheric SO2 until the concentration of this atmospheric gas was reduced considerably. If the abundance of carbonate was insufficient, it would will disappear from the surface. When Fegley and Prinn (1989) experimentally investigated the rate of SO2-consuming reaction (2), they found it would take about 2Myr to reduce the observed SO2 abundance to the equilibrium value of reaction (2). Since 2Myr is very short in comparison with geological timescales, the existence of carbonate makes it cumbersome to explain the current SO2 abundance as a necessarily consequence. Several possible explanations have been proposed regarding the SO2 overabundance in the Venus atmosphere. One is that volcanic injection of SO2 causes a transient overabundance (e.g. Esposito, 1984) such that the present SO2 abundance can be regarded as a result of the timing and magnitude of recent volcanisms. While thousands of volcanoes have been identified on Venus, it is unknown whether or not they remain active today. Variations in SO2 abundance near the cloud top (Esposito, 1984; Na et al., 1994; Esposito et al., 1997) is argued as evidence of active volcanism, yet it also seems reasonable that SO2 variations are produced by alternative mechanisms, e.g. fluctuations in atmospheric circulation, since the observed variation in abundance is as small as about 100 ppb. Another explanation is that SO2 abundance is controlled by a balance of sources and sinks such that the overabundance of SO2 is a dynamic equilibrium in which the degassing flux of SO2 is just balanced by SO2 fixation through anhydrite formation. However, no mechanism has been suggested that maintains a balance between the removal and replenishment of SO2."

    "text": "There is another kind of carbonate model which does not include carbonate buffer reaction (1). That model assumes the presence of carbonate and its chemical interaction with atmospheric SO2 (2). Behavior of the climate system of such a carbonate model was investigated by models which combine a radiative–convective model that determines atmospheric temperature, a cloud model, and a chemical model representing hydrogen escape, outgassing, and reactions with surface minerals (Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001). It should be noted that both the climate system model of carbonate model (Bullock and Grinspoon, 1998, 2001) and that of pyrite model (Hashimoto and Abe, 1997, 2000) use the same cloud model (Hashimoto and Abe, 1996).\nARTICLE IN PRESS Su rf ac e T em pe ra tu re\nTime\nPlanetary Scale Volcanism\nPresent\nFig. 1.

Abe / Planetary and Space Science 53 (2005) 839–848842\nIt has been demonstrated that the current Venus climate is unstable and catastrophic climate change occurs when the carbonate model is adopted (Fig. 1) (Bullock and Grinspoon, 1998, 2001). A catastrophic event occurs due to feedback between the surface chemical reaction and greenhouse effect, being initiated by the uptake of atmospheric SO2 through reaction (2) caused by SO2 overabundance. As a result of the SO2 greenhouse effect, the surface temperature drops according to the decrease in atmospheric SO2 abundance. Recently, some groups favor catastrophic changes in climate since the thermal stress induced by climate change may generate the tectonic features observed on the planet’s surface (e.g. Solomon et al., 1999)."

    "text": "The pyrite model assumes the presence of pyrite on the surface of Venus. The existence of sulfur in planet surface soil has been confirmed by XRF (Surkov et al., 1984, 1986), yet the host phase of sulfur remains unknown. The existence of pyrite was once a popular hypothesis, since it seemed to account for the high radar reflectivity from mountaintops (e.g. Pettengill et al., 1982; Klose et al., 1992). Radio and radar observations measured the bulk dielectric constant of surface material, giving a value for typical surface from 4.0 to 4.5, which is consistent with dry compacted rocks of various compositions (e.g. Pettengill et al., 1997). Observations of the highlands, however, often yield a dielectric constant of 50 or more, with the transition of values rapidly occurring above a critical elevation (e.g. Pettengill\net al., 1997). Several studies attempted to account for the high dielectric constant values by postulating a surface material loaded with small electrically conducting minerals such as pyrite and magnetite (loaded dielectric model) (e.g. Pettengill et al., 1982; Klose et al., 1992). The model also explains the rapid variation in values as pyrite is only stable in the highlands owing to strong altitude dependence of temperature. On the other hand, the only way to account for high dielectric constants necessitates that conducting minerals are present in significant quantities (410 vol%). Recently, heavy metal frosts are favored to explain the anomalous radar reflectivity (e.g. Schaefer and Fegley, 2004). The idea that pyrite is responsible for high dielectric constant at mountain terrain is not widely accepted now. However, results of radio and radar observations will not deny the existence of pyrite."

    "text": "It has been proposed that pyrite and magnetite control the atmospheric SO2 abundance (Zolotov, 1991; Klose et al., 1992); a hypothesis referred to as the pyrite–magnetite buffer (Hashimoto and Abe, 1997). Both pyrite and magnetite are common minerals in terrestrial igneous rocks. Most of experiments by entry probes and near-infrared observations of the nightside of Venus detected about 150 ppmv of SO2 in the lower atmosphere of Venus (e.g. Bézard et al., 1993; Pollack et al., 1993; Suleiman et al., 1996), though measurements of VEGA 1 and VEGA 2 entry probes are interpreted to indicate possibly much lower abundances (Bertaux et al., 1996). Chemical equilibrium calculations (Zolotov, 1991, 1995; Klose et al., 1992) have shown that the observed mixing ratio of SO2 is close to the equilibrium mixing ratio over pyrite–magnetite assemblage, i.e.,\n3 FeS2 (pyrite) þ16CO2 Fe3O4 (magnetite) þ6 SO2 þ 16CO. (3)\nUnlike carbonate buffer hypothesis, pyrite buffer hypothesis does not require a very thick reactive surface layer. If 150 ppmv of atmospheric SO2 were all converted into pyrite whose density is 4000 kg/m3, then a pyrite layer is about 5 cm. Therefore, 1m thick layer is required to hold all atmospheric sulfur, if pyrite content is 5 vol%. It is not unreasonable to suppose that there is a diffusion of gases into such a depth. Experimentally measured rate of pyrite–magnetite conversion indicates that the pyrite–magnetite reaction proceeds with a timescale of several million years (Fegley et al., 1995). A migration of the critical altitude will assist in the formation and decomposition of pyrite. Since pyrite is stable in elevated areas, a critical altitude exists where the stability of pyrite changes. That is, as surface temperature decreases, the critical altitude lowers and fresh magnetite is exposed between the previous\nARTICLE IN PRESS G.L. Hashimoto, Y.

    "heading": "3.3. Thermodynamical stability of pyrite and magnetite",
    "text": "Since no observation has determined the mineralogy of surface, the existence of pyrite and magnetite can only be discussed on the basis of thermodynamical considerations and experimental studies (e.g. Fegley, 1997; Wood and Brett, 1997). Several studies have examined the thermodynamical stability of magnetite based on the redox state estimated from the observed atmospheric composition (e.g. Fegley et al., 1997a, b; Wood, 1997). Accordingly, it is reasonable to consider that magnetite exists on the planet surface because it is a common mineral. Wood (1997) showed that magnetite is stable at plains altitude, yet Fegley et al. (1997a) argue that the stability of magnetite at 0 km altitude cannot be determined owing to the uncertainties of the observation and thermochemical data. Thermodynamical stability of pyrite is very controversial (e.g. Fegley, 1997; Wood and Brett, 1997; Fegley et al., 1997a; Wood, 1997), and in fact, Fegley et al. (1995) argue that a series of experiments demonstrate that pyrite decomposes on the surface, although their work is inappropriate to discuss the thermodynamical stability of pyrite because the gas mixtures used in the experiments are inadequate to reproduce atmospheric conditions at the planet surface (Wood and Brett, 1997). As Wood and Brett (1997) point out, a back-reaction counteracting the pyrite decomposition cannot take place since most of the gas mixtures used in the experiments do not contain sulfur in any form. Obviously then, pyrite would decompose in these experiments. Thermodynamical stability of pyrite can also be examined based on the observed Venus atmospheric composition, although results contradict each other (e.g. Fegley, 1997; Wood and Brett, 1997). The atmospheric concentration of CO, SO2, and OCS measured by the Pioneer Venus gas chromatography experiment (Oyama et al., 1980) and ground-based spectroscopy in the nearinfrared (Pollack et al., 1993), Wood and Brett (1997) indicate that pyrite is thermodynamically stable at the Venus surface. Fegley (1997), however, concludes that pyrite is thermodynamically unstable at the surface based on the S3 vapor abundance observed by Veneras (vonZahn et al., 1983; Krasnopolsky, 1987). Uncertainty in the measurements of atmospheric composition appears to be the under lying cause of this contradiction. Both groups try to determine the stability of pyrite using S2 vapor concentration which is calculated by assuming chemical equilibrium. The S2 concentration calculated from CO, SO2, and COS (Wood and Brett, 1997) concentrations is different from\nthat calculated from S3 (Fegley, 1997). Accordingly it is impossible to settle the dispute without new observations that can determine the composition of near surface atmosphere. It should be noted that the observed SO2 concentration of 150 ppmv is higher than the value in equilibrium with all Ca-bearing silicates, likewise calcite (Fegley and Prinn, 1989), i.e., the observed SO2 concentration is overabundant when Ca-bearing silicates exist and react with the atmospheric SO2. If the observed SO2 concentration is supposed to be not overabundant, there should be no Ca-bearing silicates that can react with the atmosphere. Although Ca-bearing silicates are common constituents of basalt, their presence on the Venus surface rock are not confirmed."

    "heading": "3.4. Climate of pyrite model",
    "text": "If the pyrite–magnetite buffer controls the atmospheric SO2 abundance, one should expect a relationship between the abundance and surface temperature in that variations in surface temperature affect atmospheric SO2 abundance via the pyrite–magnetite buffer. On the other hand, since infrared opacity of SO2 noticeably contributes to greenhouse warming (e.g. Pollack et al., 1980), the abundance has a large influence on the surface temperature. SO2 is also associated with surface temperature through clouds since it is a precursor material of them. Clouds are a predominate contributor to the planet’s greenhouse effect (e.g. Pollack et al., 1980), while determining the Venus planetary albedo as well. Changes in atmospheric SO2 abundance accordingly involve not only feedback via the greenhouse effect (chemical-greenhouse feedback), but also feedback through the cloud albedo (chemical-albedo feedback) (Hashimoto and Abe, 2000). The climate system of pyrite–magnetite buffer is investigated by Hashimoto and Abe (1997, 2000). That model consists of radiative–convective model (Nakajima et al., 1992), cloud model (Hashimoto and Abe, 1996), and atmosphere-surface chemical reaction model that includes the effect of topography (Hashimoto et al., 1997). To investigate the effect of chemically mediated feedback, surface temperatures were calculated for various sets of climate parameters with and without operation of a pyrite–magnetite buffer. In contrast to the climate using the carbonate model, that with the pyrite model is broadly stabilized by chemical-albedo feedback. The temperature change is almost halved when the pyrite–magnetite buffer is operating, e.g. the temperature change is 10K if the pyrite–magnetite buffer is not operating, while only about 5K if operating. Although a few cases exist where the sensitivity of the climate is enhanced by chemicalgreenhouse feedback, it is concluded chemical-albedo\nARTICLE IN PRESS G.L. Hashimoto, Y. Abe / Planetary and Space Science 53 (2005) 839–848844\nfeedback maintains surface temperatures near present values (Hashimoto and Abe, 1997, 2000). The mechanism for stabilization of surface temperature by chemical-albedo feedback involves changes in temperature being compensated by changes in the planetary albedo, i.e., when surface temperature decreases, the planetary albedo decreases due to the changes in the thickness of H2SO4 clouds. Since atmospheric SO2 abundance as controlled by the pyrite– magnetite buffer is reduced for low surface temperature, the rate of H2SO4 production that controls the thickness of clouds decreases as surface temperature decreases. A similar mechanism correspondingly functions for increases in surface temperature. On the other hand, chemical-greenhouse feedback magnifies the temperature change because increases in surface temperature further increase the atmospheric SO2 abundance and strengthen the greenhouse effect. In most cases the Venus climate system is therefore governed by chemical-albedo feedback since the influence of the changes in the planetary albedo dominate changes in the greenhouse effect. As chemical-greenhouse feedback only prevails when the planetary albedo is insensitive to changes in the atmospheric SO2 abundance, if the rate of H2SO4 production is limited by the H2O abundance regardless of the SO2 abundance, the chemical-greenhouse feedback will govern the climate such that the climate system is unstable. The cloud model used in the climate system study is based on physics, though it does not include all the processes that may affect the cloud albedo. If increase in SO2 makes the cloud more absorbing, it will lower the cloud albedo and makes the climate system unstable. To confirm the behavior of clouds and its influence on the climate system, further studies are required.\nIt must be stressed that even if stable chemical-albedo feedback effectively controls the Venus climate, an excursion of the climate state will occur over a timescale shorter than several million years. In order to buffer fluctuations in the climate system by the chemicalalbedo feedback, the atmospheric SO2 abundance must be adjusted. The response timescale, however, for pyrite–magnetite buffer control of atmospheric SO2 abundance is several million years, which indicates that fluctuations over a shorter timescale cannot be buffered by chemical-albedo feedback (Fig. 2)."

    "heading": "4.1. Feedback loops on Venus",
    "text": "It is possible for other chemical reactions than carbonate buffer or pyrite–magnetite buffer to form a feedback loop in the Venus climate system. CO2, SO2, and H2O are thought to strongly influence the Venus climate (e.g. Pollack et al., 1980; Hashimoto and Abe, 2001) such that chemical reactions involving these gases are frequently considered to play some feedback role in the Venus climate system. If the existing Venus climate system is in equilibrium, then a chemical reaction producing feedback is also in equilibrium such that possible feedback loops can be found by investigating chemical reactions between the atmosphere and planetary surface and by examining the stability of minerals that can be a reservoir of climatologically important gases. Thermodynamical equilibrium calculations have demonstrated that anhydrite and pyrite are minerals storing sulfur at the surface condition of Venus (e.g. Klose et al., 1992; Fegley and Treiman, 1992; Zolotov et al., 1997). Reaction (2) in which pyrite and magnetite are in equilibrium produces an SO2 concentration consistent with observed values, and this reaction forms a stable feedback loop (chemical-albedo feedback) as noted before. It is unlikely, however, that the chemical reaction of anhydrite forms a feedback loop in the present Venus climate because anhydrite is too stable to affect the atmospheric reservoir of sulfur, i.e., sulfur contained in anhydrite may be released into the atmosphere only at an extremely elevated surface temperature or considerably low SO2 atmospheric concentration. Thermodynamical calculations have also demonstrated that hydrous silicates are unstable on the Venus surface (e.g. Fegley and Treiman, 1992). It is likely that there is almost no hydrous minerals on the Venus surface. Recent laboratory experiments indicates that tremolite, that is a hydrous mineral, can survive decomposition on Venus over geologic time scales (Johnson and Fegley, 2000). Such an unstable hydrous mineral can survive, because its decomposition is\nARTICLE IN PRESS G.L. Hashimoto, Y. Abe / Planetary and Space Science 53 (2005) 839–848 845\nkinetically prohibited. So such hydrous minerals will not release a water into the atmosphere, so the existence of such hydrous minerals have no influence on atmospheric composition. It is unlikely that feedback loops mediated by H2O are operating in the Venus climate system unless the current climate state is transient. If the Venus surface condition is in equilibrium, only the carbonate and pyrite–magnetite buffers are appropriate reactions for buffering climatologically important gases, although atmospheric SO2 is not in equilibrium if the carbonate model is assumed. The fact that carbonate and pyrite–magnetite buffers cannot operate simultaneously should be noted because carbonate and pyrite cannot coexist on the planet surface. If indeed true, carbonate decomposition through anhydrite formation (reaction 2) and pyrite decomposition through magnetite formation (reaction 7) would occur place until either mineral is exhausted. Experimentally determined reaction rates indicate that decomposition of carbonate and pyrite occurs over several million years (Fegley and Prinn, 1989; Fegley et al., 1995); hence, the duration of coexistence could only be over geologically short time."

    "heading": "4.2. The present state of climate",
    "text": "The most important difference between these two models is the interpretation of the present climate state (Table 2). If the carbonate model is accepted the present state is not in equilibrium and can be interpreted as a transient state which changes into a new climate regime (Fig. 1). According to Bullock and Grinspoon (1998, 2001), changes in the climate state occur over a geologically short timescale such that the present state can be explained as a special condition resulting from\nvolcanic events taking place over the past several million years. The pyrite model on the other hand explains the present climate as a stable equilibrium state in which the climate system is stabilized by chemical-albedo feedback such that a climate state similar to the present one will exist until a substantial perturbation occurs that cannot be absorbed by the chemical-albedo feedback (Fig. 2). Both models provide a completely different view of the present atmospheric SO2 abundance in which the lower atmosphere of Venus is considered to contain about 150 ppmv of SO2 (e.g. Bézard et al., 1993; Pollack et al., 1993; Suleiman et al., 1996). While this amount is much higher than the value in equilibrium with carbonate, it is just a value in equilibrium of pyrite– magnetite buffer. If volcanism on Venus is sufficiently active in releasing SO2 into the atmosphere, a reasonable consequence might be that the Venus atmosphere contains over abundance of SO2 (Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001). Then, the abundance of SO2 is, however, determined by the flux of SO2 released by volcanism. Since activity of the venusian volcanism will fluctuate, atmospheric SO2 abundance will fluctuate. Yet no feedback mechanism has been proposed that could absorb the fluctuation of unequilibrated SO2 abundance."

    "text": "It has been proposed that climate change can generate commonly observed Venus deformation features such as wrinkle ridges, polygonal terrains, and gridded terrains (Solomon et al., 1999; Anderson and Smrekar, 1999). Since the influence of climate change is global and synchronous, this could result in a simultaneous globally\nARTICLE IN PRESS G.L. Hashimoto, Y. Abe / Planetary and Space Science 53 (2005) 839–848846\ndistributed deformation. Anderson and Smrekar (1999) reported that temperature changes of 50–100K calculated for volcanic resurfacing events are sufficient to deform the planetary surface. The carbonate model favors this hypothesis since its climatic state is unstable and consequently brings about climate change. Climate changes also can occur in the pyrite model even though the climate is stabilized by chemical-albedo feedback, i.e., perturbation produced by volcanism causes climate change before the pyrite– magnetite reaction adjusts to the atmospheric SO2 abundance and stabilizes the climate. The magnitude of climate change caused by volcanism is determined by a perturbation of the atmospheric composition which is determined by concentration of volatile species in magma and volume of magma erupted. The total volume of magma erupted during a global resurfacing event is estimated to be about 0.4–1:2 109 ðkm3Þ (Basilevsky et al., 1997). The H2O concentration in the Venus mantle is constrained to be less than 15 ppm by a model that combines degassing of mantle 40Ar and hydrogen escape (Namiki, 1995). The present atmospheric water abundance and D=H ratio is related to the degassing of water and hydrogen escape, while degassing of mantle is estimated from atmospheric 40Ar abundance. If one assumes that the magma contains 800 ppm of SO2, which is the average concentration in MORB glasses (Sakai et al., 1984), and H2O concentration of 15 ppm, the global resurfacing event should add 45–135 ppmv of H2O and 2400–7200 ppmv of SO2 to the atmosphere, with such an enormous injection into the atmosphere being sufficient to produce a climate change and deform the planetary surface (e.g. Hashimoto and Abe, 2001; Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001). It is likely that climate is continuously perturbed by fluctuations in various components related to the climate system. When the system is stable as in the pyrite model, perturbations will be absorbed and a climate state similar to the present one will be reestablished over time. On the other hand, if the system is unstable, or lacks a stabilizing feedback mechanism, the occurrence of perturbations would continuously change the climate state, and as no restoring mechanism exists, the climate would only return to the original state by chance. This indicates that we would probably not observe such an unstable climate state."

When atmospheric composition is not controlled by chemical reactions with surface, there is no chemical feedback that will destabilize the climate system. So any instability caused\nby surface chemical reaction does not occur in the climate system of non-reactive lid model. When atmospheric constituents will not react with the surface, the atmospheric inventories of CO2 and SO2 are determined by degassing. The Venus’ CO2 atmosphere is almost identical to the Earth’s surface CO2 inventory that is about 70 bar (Ronov and Yaroshevsky, 1976). So the surface CO2 inventories on both planets are similar, if there is almost no carbonate rock in the Venus’ surface. This similarity implies a common mechanism instead of surface-atmosphere reaction controls the surface CO2 inventory, though the Earth’s surface CO2 inventory might be affected by plate tectonics that is not seen on Venus. The sulfur abundance of Venus’ atmosphere is, by contrast, much smaller than the Earth’s surface sulfur inventory (Fegley and Treiman, 1992). The column density for Venus’ atmospheric sulfur is calculated to be 3:5 103 ðmole=m2Þ from the SO2 mixing ratio that is the dominant sulfur bearing gas in the Venus’ lower atmosphere. The amount of sulfur in the Earth’s ocean, that has likely its origin in degassing, is about 8:0 104 ðmole=m2Þ (Holland, 1978), or 20 times larger than the total atmospheric sulfur on Venus. If Venus’ atmospheric sulfur was not removed through chemical reactions with the surface, the difference in the surface sulfur abundance on both planets indicates that the Earth’s and Venus’ degassed gases are different in the ratio of sulfur to carbon. The pyrite model will explain the abundance of Venus’ atmospheric CO2 in the same way as the nonreactive lid model, since that model does not include a chemical interaction of atmospheric CO2. However, the pyrite model will explain that the deficit in Venus’ atmospheric sulfur is caused by chemical reactions between the surface and sulfur bearing gases in the atmosphere. Venus’ surface soil actually contains sulfur (Surkov et al., 1984, 1986), though the origin of sulfur bearing mineral is uncertain. If Venus’ surface removes sulfur from the atmosphere, the deficit in Venus’ atmospheric sulfur does not necessarily require a difference in gas compositions degassed from the Earth’s and Venus’."

    "heading": "5. Summary",
    "text": "We critically reviewed two models describing the Venus climate and summarized characteristics and differences. If the carbonate model is accepted, the present state is not in equilibrium and can be interpreted as a transient state which changes into a new climate regime (e.g. Bullock and Grinspoon, 2001). The pyrite model, on the other hand, explains the present climate as a stable equilibrium state in which the climate system is stabilized by chemical-albedo feedback (e.g. Hashimoto\nARTICLE IN PRESS G.L. Hashimoto, Y. Abe / Planetary and Space Science 53 (2005) 839–848 847\nand Abe, 2000). The difference in the models is due to surface chemistry considerations. Elucidating the stability and evolution of the Venus climate requires understanding the chemical state of the surface. If carbonate exists on the surface, the atmospheric abundance of CO2 coincides with the equilibrium of controlling carbonation reaction, but then that of SO2 is higher than in equilibrium. Also, the existence of carbonates on the Venus surface destabilizes the climate. To maintain the present state for a geological timescale, some mechanism(s) must be in place to stabilize the climate system and maintain the atmospheric SO2 abundance in a dynamic equilibrium, otherwise the present Venus climate would certainly be transient and changes in the climate state would occur over a geologically short timescale (e.g. Bullock and Grinspoon, 1996, 2001). On the other hand, if carbonate does not exist on the Venus surface, the climate state would be stable against perturbations in surface temperature or pressure and the atmospheric concentration of SO2 no longer be overabundant. Since there is no evidence of carbonate on the Venus surface, it may be the most elegant solution to the SO2 overabundance. It is also possible for pyrite to exist stable on the Venus surface when there is no carbonate. If pyrite–magnetite buffer is operating, the current concentration of atmospheric SO2 can be explained by the buffer such that the surface temperature is maintained near the present value by chemical-albedo feedback (e.g. Hashimoto and Abe, 1997, 2000). One straightforward approach to examine model validity involves clarifying surface mineralogy; i.e., the carbonate and pyrite models require carbonate and pyrite, respectively. Since pyrite and carbonate are only stable above the critical altitude where temperature is relatively low, this provides a promising target for future explorations designed to determine whether these minerals exist on the Venus surface with a distinct altitude dependence."

  "abstractText": "We review two models describing the Venus climate system: the carbonate and pyrite models. It has been argued carbonate and pyrite are potentially important minerals controlling the climate of Venus, though existence of either minerals has not been confirmed. Although it used to be proposed that carbonation reaction might explain the Venus’ atmospheric CO2 abundance, it is unlikely Venus’ surface is reactive enough to control the Venus’ massive CO2 atmosphere. Venus’ surface carbonate is also able to affect the climate through the reaction with atmospheric SO2 to form anhydrite. Under the carbonate model the climate state is not in equilibrium and would be unstable due to the reaction between carbonate and SO2. On the other hand, pyrite–magnetite reaction is proposed to explain the Venus’ atmospheric SO2 abundance. Under pyrite–magnetite reaction, however, the climate would be stabilized such that the existing climate state is maintained over a geological timescale, while some observational facts such as atmospheric abundance of SO2 and surface temperature could also be reasonably explained. r 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
