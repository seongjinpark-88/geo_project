    "text": "The present study focuses on particulate matter collected in the upper troposphere (UT) and lowermost stratosphere (LMS) by the passenger aircraft based CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container) observatory [Brenninkmeijer et al., 2007]. The transport of air enriched in ozone and particulate sulfur from the stratosphere into the troposphere can be monitored by CARIBIC throughout the seasons and years. Although the cruise altitude is nearly constant, the variable altitude of the extratropical tropopause allows the retrieval of vertical profiles across the tropopause and a sampling both in the UT and in the LMS. By this, CARIBIC can follow the fate of stratospheric aerosol.\nThe sulfurous fraction is the major component of stratospheric aerosol [Deshler, 2008; Rosen, 1971]. Recent studies [Martinsson et al., 2009; Murphy et al., 1998; Schmale et al., 2010] find that the aerosol also contains significant amounts of carbonaceous species. In addition, small crustal [Andersson et al., 2013] and meteoric [Murphy et al., 2014] components are found in stratospheric aerosol particles.\nThe two largest sources of sulfuric acid particles in the stratosphere are the photolysis/oxidation of OCS and SO2 [Crutzen, 1976; Weisenstein et al., 1997], with a minor contribution from direct injection of sulfurous particles from the tropical troposphere. SO2 forms sulfuric acid at all altitudes in the stratosphere via oxidation by radicals, while OCS is photooxidized chiefly at higher altitudes in the stratosphere. Injections of particulate matter via volcanism are by far the source inducing most variability in the stratospheric aerosol [Robock, 2000]. Remote sensing at lidar stations (in Boulder, Colorado, and in Mauna Loa, Hawaii) revealed a trend of increasing aerosol burden in the stratosphere (20–25 km altitude) in the period 2000–2009 [Hofmann et al., 2009], which was later shown to be caused by volcanism in the tropics [Vernier et al., 2011]. The stratosphere’s increasing aerosol concentration has been found to cause a negative radiative forcing of 0.1Wm-2 [Solomon et al., 2011]. Later studies\nFRIBERG ET AL.

These findings indicate that volcanism is a major cause for the deviations between the actual and predicted [Flato et al., 2013] global warming since year 2000.\nThe Brewer-Dobson circulation transports air from the tropical tropopause via the middle and upper stratosphere (deep branch) and quasi-horizontally (shallow branch) to midlatitude and high latitude [Holton et al., 1995]. The deep branch brings air with high concentrations of O3 and sulfuric acid particles from the Junge layer to lower altitudes where it mixes with air from the lower branch. Whereas the deep branch transports air to midlatitudes within years, the shortcut via the lower branch requires only a few months.\nThe LMS is restricted downward by the tropopause, while its upper boarder is defined as the 380 K isentrope [Holton et al., 1995]. Stratospheric air with high concentrations of O3 and particulate sulfur that reaches the LMS undergoes mixing with air from the troposphere. On a local scale, mixing through the tropopause results in a 2–3 km thick layer with strong vertical gradients of trace gases [Hoor et al., 2004; Pan et al., 2004], called the extratropical tropopause transition layer. Seasonality in the strength of the transport paths results in seasonally varying proportions of stratospheric and tropospheric air in the LMS leading to, for example, varying ozone concentrations during the year, with the highest concentrations in spring and lowest during fall [Zahn and Brenninkmeijer, 2003]. Via observations of trace gas concentrations, Bönisch et al. [2009] revealed a seasonal cycle in the mean age of air in the LMS, decreasing from spring to fall.\nMixing through the tropopause eventually leads to transport of sulfur-rich stratospheric aerosol to the midlatitude UT, where particulate sulfur concentrations are substantially lower compared to the LMS [Martinsson et al., 2005]. Sulfur compounds can also be transported from the surface by deep convection and warm conveyor belts and then lead to particle formation in the UT. Guan et al. [2010] report that large forest fires contributed to about 10 occurrences of pyroconvection, in 2006–2009, that could have transported biomass burning smoke to UT altitudes. Particles from this source type contain mostly carbonaceous matter with traces of metals such as potassium [Reid et al., 2005]. However, Murphy et al. [2006] found that UT particles generally contain mixtures of sulfurous and carbonaceous components. Most of them contained no potassium, suggesting pyroconvection to be only a minor source of UT aerosol. Investigating particle morphologies, Nguyen et al. [2008] established that the sulfurous and carbonaceous components are internally mixed residing in different parts of the particles.\nAerosol particles in the UT are involved in the formation of cirrus clouds. Cirrus ice crystals either form homogeneously via freezing of supercooled solution droplets or heterogeneously when water crystallizes directly on ice nuclei (IN) [Pruppacher and Klett, 1997]. Mineral dust and metallic particles have been proposed to be the main suppliers of IN in the UT [Cziczo et al., 2013; DeMott et al., 2003]. Soot particles may also act as IN but at lower temperatures than mineral dust [Hoose and Möhler, 2012]. Recent measurements indicate that soot IN concentrations from aircraft have been underestimated [Schumann et al., 2013], and the question whether soot particles from aviation affect cirrus properties has been the focus of several modeling studies recently. Gettelman and Chen [2013] found no effect on cirrus from aviation soot while Zhou and Penner [2014] found the soot to significantly alter the cirrus cloud properties. The different outcomes of the studies are caused by the different assumptions regarding the nucleation efficiency of soot. Besides soot, jet engines emit metallic elements [Agrawal et al., 2008] that might add somewhat to the concentration of IN in the UT. Coating of IN, by compounds such as sulfuric acid, has in laboratory experiments been found to decrease aerosol particle effectiveness to act as IN [Hoose and Möhler, 2012].\nHomogeneous nucleation was for many years considered to be the dominant formationmechanism for cirrus clouds [Jensen et al., 2010], and in situ measurements of temperature, relative humidity, ice water content, particle size, and fall velocities have been found to confirm this [Mitchell et al., 2011]. However, a recent study, investigating ice particle residuals [Cziczo et al., 2013], indicates that heterogeneous freezing is the dominant mechanism for cirrus clouds over Central America and parts of North America. Heterogeneous ice nucleation has recently been incorporated in model studies of cirrus clouds [Barahona et al., 2014; Kuebbeler et al., 2014; Storelvmo and Herger, 2014]. One such study, Barahona et al. [2014], finds homogeneous freezing to be the dominant mechanism globally except over central Asia, the Arctic, and the west coast of North America. However, Zhou and Penner [2014] find that if aircraft soot emissions\nFRIBERG ET AL. VOLC AFFECTS S AEROSOL IN UT AND CIRRUS 286\nprovide additional IN, they could shift the freezing regime from homogeneous to heterogeneous freezing over North America, Europe, and the North Atlantic Ocean.\nWhether or not volcanic aerosols injected into the stratosphere can affect cirrus clouds in the UT has been the topic of several research papers and the conclusions differ. One satellite study found an increase in high-level cloudiness after the El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo eruptions [Song et al., 1996], while other satellite studies found no changes in cirrus properties after the Mount Pinatubo eruption [Luo et al., 2002; Wylie and Menzel, 1999]. Moreover, modeling studies of the same event using only homogeneous nucleation theory find increased ice crystal number concentrations in cirrus clouds after the eruption [Karcher and Lohmann, 2002; Lohmann et al., 2003]. Recently, a satellite study by Campbell et al. [2012] found cirrus clouds formed by seeding from a stratospheric layer of volcanic aerosol from the Kasatochi eruption in 2008.\nCirrus clouds are estimated to have an overall larger impact on the long-wave than on the short-wave radiation, resulting in a net warming of the surface [Boucher et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2000]. Estimations of radiative forcing from cirrus clouds hold considerable uncertainties [Boucher et al., 2013] depending on a range of factors [Baran, 2009] including ice crystal shape, size, number concentration, cloud coverage, cloud thickness, and temperature [Fusina et al., 2007].\nIn recent studies we investigated variations in the LMS aerosol concentrations during periods of tropical [Friberg et al., 2014] and extratropical [Andersson et al., 2013; Martinsson et al., 2009] volcanism. We now investigate the influence on midlatitude UT aerosol concentrations of volcanic aerosol from the LMS, based on elemental analyses of aerosol samples collected by CARIBIC between 1999 and 2013. Perturbation of LMS aerosol by volcanism during these 15 years ranged from low to moderate. With the direct impact of volcanic aerosol in the UT/LMS having been addressed by Andersson et al. [2015], we now present a comparison between measured UT/LMS aerosol concentrations and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) retrieved cirrus reflectance (CR), in the light of the indirect climate impact of volcanism."

The CARIBIC system is currently based on a 1.5 t automated measurement container constituting a compact laboratory. The container is installed monthly for 2–6 consecutive flights in a Lufthansa passenger Airbus A340-600, which has been retrofitted for this task with a permanent inlet system having inlet probes for water vapor, cloud water, aerosol, and trace gases. So far about 100 publications deal with methods and results (www.caribic-atmospheric.com). The CARIBIC system is part of IAGOS (In situ Aircraft for a Global Observing System, www.iagos.org)"

The phase #2 (phase #1) device consists of 14 (12) channels for sequential samples. In addition, 2 channels were used to collect integral samples, to check for contaminations. Typical air volumes of 0.25 (0.09)m3 STP (standard temperature and pressure) were sampled during 100 (150)min or 1500 (2200) km flight distance. Sampling is suspended when the pressure exceeds 350 hPa (landing and takeoff cycles) to avoid sampling of aerosol from lower altitudes.\nFRIBERG ET AL. VOLC AFFECTS S AEROSOL IN UT AND CIRRUS 287"

    "heading": "2.4. Sampling in the Midlatitude UT/LMS",
    "text": "Because the CARIBIC aircraft collects samples in a narrow altitude interval (9–12 km above sea level), either the extratropical UT/LMS or the tropical middle troposphere is investigated. However, due to the movement of the tropopause level relative to the aircraft flight track, air masses with vertical distances relative to the tropopause from 5 km below the tropopause to 5 km above the tropopause are probed [Zahn et al., 2014]. At midlatitude and high latitude the tropopause is frequently crossed. In the present study, samples collected on latitudes south of 30°N were excluded to keep the influence from tropical air low. 2.4.1. The Dynamical Tropopause We used potential vorticity (PV) to define the tropopause. PV values were derived from archived ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast) analyses with a resolution of 1° × 1° in the horizontal at 91 vertical hybrid sigma-pressure model levels. PV values were interpolated linearly in latitude, longitude, log pressure, and time to the location of the aircraft and for each sample averaged over the duration of sampling. Generally, PV values of 1.5–3.5 potential vorticity unit (PVU) [Hoerling et al., 1991; Hoinka, 1997] are employed for defining the dynamical tropopause. Here we use 2 PVU. 2.4.2. Classification of UT and LMS Samples Samples with an average PV> 2 PVU were classified to be stratospheric, while UT samples were those below 1.5 PVU. The sampling time for the impactor is relatively long, sometimes resulting in samples representing air from both the UT and the LMS. To eliminate a bias in the UT aerosol concentration from samples partially taken in the LMS, samples collected at average PV lower than 1.5 PVU were excluded from this investigation, if the aircraft had crossed the tropopause (2 PVU) during the sampling interval."

    "heading": "2.5. Exclusion of Samples Affected by Fresh Volcanic Aerosol",
    "text": "Volcanic clouds reaching the UT/LMS can enhance the background aerosol concentrations tremendously. In the weeks following an eruption the emitted SO2 is converted to sulfate and the resulting volcanic aerosol mixes at various degrees with the background. Moreover, fresh volcanic aerosol injected in the UT is susceptible to scavenging by precipitation formation. Therefore, samples collected within 30 days after volcanic eruptions that reached the extratropical UT/LMS (listed in Table 1) were excluded to prevent bias from patchiness in aerosol concentrations and influence from large ash particles. An extremely high particulate sulfur concentration was observed for one additional sample (August 2001). Trajectory analysis shows direct transport from the area of an eruption of Bezymianny, at the Kamchatka peninsula, Russia. Hence, this sample happened to have been collected in a fresh volcanic cloud was also excluded."

It was produced by splitting each sample into 10 equidistant parts along the flight track, and the average position of the aircraft in longitude× latitude was calculated for each part, yielding 10 sample parts of typically 150 km along the flight route. These parts were assigned aerosol concentrations according to the analytical results and were sorted into and averaged on a longitude × latitude grid of 5° × 5°, and a center-weighted 2-D smoothing was performed. Grid cells with fewer than 10 samples in their eight nearest surrounding grid cells were excluded to reduce the impact from regions where few observations were made. The data were then 2-D interpolated to 1° × 1° (longitude × latitude) to form the presented graph.

    "heading": "2.7. Satellite Measurements",
    "text": "We use satellite data of cirrus clouds from the MODIS instruments. One MODIS instrument is placed on the satellite Terra, launched in December 1999, and the other on Aqua, launched in May 2003. Terra has a descending orbit while Aqua has an ascending orbit and their equatorial crossing times are 10:30 and 13:30 local solar time [Platnick et al., 2003]. MODIS is a whiskbroom scanning radiometer with 36 wavelength channels spread between 0.620 and 14.4μm. One of these channels, centered at 1.38μm, was selected specifically for the study of cirrus clouds [Gao and Kaufman, 1995]. Incoming solar radiation at 1.38μm is either reflected and scattered by the cirrus clouds or completely absorbed by the underlying atmosphere due to high water vapor absorption at this wavelength [Gao et al., 2002; Meyer and Platnick, 2010]. However, 1–10% of the atmospheric water vapor is normally located above the cirrus clouds which results in attenuation of the 1.38μm signal. To quantify this attenuation, a scaling factor is calculated from the slope of scatterplots of the reflectance in the 1.38μm channel versus the reflectance from a cannel in the visible spectrum (0.66μm) [Gao et al., 2002]. Each MODIS granule (2030×1354 pixels) is divided into 16 subgranules, and a scaling factor is calculated for each of these subgranules. The scaling factors are then interpolated to avoid a chessboard effect, and the reflectance from the cirrus clouds for each pixel is calculated [Gao et al., 2002; Meyer and Platnick, 2010]. Our analysis is based on the Level 3 monthly averaged CR with a resolution of 1° ×1°.\nDuring dry atmospheric conditions not all solar radiation at 1.38 μm will be absorbed by the underlying atmosphere. Hence, reflection from the surface or lower lying clouds can contaminate the CR product [Meyer and Platnick, 2010]. The atmospheric water vapor product from MODIS has therefore been used to screen out dry atmospheric conditions. Similar results were obtained when using the total column water vapor from the ECMWF. The limit was set to 0.4 cm after recommendation from B.-C. Gao (personal communication, 2014) and investigation of the CR and atmospheric water vapor data. Since the same area is to be used for all monthly averages, pixels that have atmospheric water vapor less than 0.4 cm during the investigated years are removed from the entire data set. This was done for Terra and Aqua separately, but the areas included are very similar, see Figure 1. It is mainly continental areas over central North America and Asia, in particular ranges of high mountains, that are excluded but also some small ocean areas east of these continents. In order to compare the MODIS-retrieved CR against the CARIBIC measurements, only data from 30°N to 60°N are used to form average monthly cirrus products. Due to the latitude dependence of temperature and therefore atmospheric water vapor concentration, the fraction of pixels that are too dry increases with latitude. To avoid bias from this phenomenon, zonal averages were computed using 1° × 1° pixels. These averages were then weighted according to area in order to obtain the average CR for 30–60°N. An estimation of the uncertainty in the averages was calculated using error propagation on the standard deviation of the daily mean of each 1° × 1° pixel. Internal checkups of the MODIS instrument on Terra were carried out\nTable 1.

    "heading": "3.1. Geographical Distributions of Sulfur and PV",
    "text": "CARIBIC measurements over the years cover latitudes 30°S to 70°N and longitudes 120°W to 120°E. Figure 2a provides a geographical view of the particulate sulfur concentrations at 9-12 km altitude for all samples, tropospheric and stratospheric. The concentration clearly depends on the geographical location of sampling. A strong latitudinal gradient of the concentration of particulate sulfur is observed, with higher concentration in the North Hemisphere (NH) midlatitudes, than in the subtropics. Martinsson et al. [2005] found a correlation of sulfur and PV in the LMS, due to downwelling of particulate sulfur from the higher altitudes. A comparison of the geographical distribution of particulate sulfur concentrations (Figure 2a) and that of the average PV during sampling (Figure 2b) indicates the possible stratospheric origin of high sulfur concentrations. Downwelling of sulfur-rich stratospheric air can strongly enhance the particulate sulfur mass concentrations in the midlatitudes tropopause region. The samples in the subtropics are somewhat influenced by stratospheric air, while the tropical samples are purely tropospheric. The gradient to the tropics could also be caused by other differences in source patterns as well as by more efficient wet\nscavenging of the hygroscopic sulfur particles in the tropics by deep convective clouds. The following sections deal with the coupling of the LMS and midlatitude UT.\n3.2. Volcanic Influence on Particulate Sulfur in the Midlatitude UT\nOver the 15 year time span considered, particulate sulfur concentrations in the UT and LMS vary by a factor of about 100 (Figure 3). In parts of this period the LMS serves as a reservoir of volcanic aerosol that eventually is transported to the midlatitude UT. To investigate a coupling between the UT and LMS we will group data depending on the magnitude of volcanic influence on the aerosol concentrations. In the LMS, the sulfur concentrations need to be normalized by PV in order to compensate for the strong gradient of sulfur in the LMS and to highlight deviations from the nonvolcanically influenced particulate sulfur distribution. UT data are scarce as most of the midlatitude\nsamples were collected in the LMS. Thus, details in the variability in sulfur concentrations do not show as clearly in the UT as in the LMS. We will therefore use the LMS sulfur concentrations as a more distinct measure of the magnitude of the volcanic influence in the UT/LMS and divide the data into groups depending on the volcanic influence."

    "heading": "3.3. Grouping Data Depending on Volcanic Influence",
    "text": "The average S/PV ratio for the period 1999–2002 was low (Figure 3), indicating a time of low volcanic impact on the stratosphere [Martinsson et al., 2005]. However, particulate sulfur was affected by volcanic aerosol to various degrees after the year 2005. The 3 year period mid-2002 to mid-2005 was not monitored by CARIBIC but is known to have had little volcanic activity [Myhre et al., 2013].\nIn the period May 2005 to July 2008 the LMS aerosol was influenced by three volcanic eruptions in the tropics (Manam, Soufriere Hills, and Rabaul). They injected large amounts of SO2 (Table 1) into the tropical stratosphere [Vernier et al., 2011] that was subsequently, while being oxidized, transported to midlatitudes within the Brewer-Dobson (BD) circulation. Subsequent downwelling [Friberg et al., 2014] explains the observed increase in the LMS sulfur concentrations from the 1999–2002 baseline. A concomitant increase in UT sulfur concentrations is evident (Figure 3).\nFigure 3 shows several large peaks in S/PV, starting with the Kasatochi explosion in 2008, which eventually decline [Martinsson et al., 2009] by transport across the tropopause into the UT. Extratropical volcanism then caused peaks of varying magnitudes in 2009–2010 [Andersson et al., 2013] and in spring 2011, followed by an eruption of the tropical volcano Nabro. Nabro emitted about the same amount of SO2 (1.5 Tg) as Kasatochi and Sarychev did (Table 1). After transport from the tropics to midlatitudes, downwelling through the LMS explains the observed rise in S/PV from late summer 2011. Volcanic clouds reaching the tropical stratosphere can affect the extratropical LMS for years via transport in the deep BD branch. However, the long-lasting perturbations after Nabro were limited to the first half of the year 2012, because most of the transport took place in the tropical transition layer or in the lower BD branch [Bourassa et al., 2012]. Finally, remaining aerosol particles from the Nabro explosion transported in the deep BD branch slightly elevated the concentration level in spring/summer 2013.\nNext, the data are divided into the following groups: (1) background conditions, (2) samples affected by direct injections into the LMS, and (3) samples influenced by volcanic aerosol downwelling from the stratosphere from above the 380 K isentrope. Thus, we derive the following:\n1. The years 1999–2002 as the period that represents background levels.\nFRIBERG ET AL.

Impact on UT/LMS Aerosol From Tropical Volcanism\nTo explore the influence from tropical volcanism on the aerosol concentrations in the midlatitude UT we compare sulfur concentrations from the periods May\n2005 to July 2008 and 2013 (Category 3b) to that of the period 1999–2002 (Category 1) (hereinafter termed periods 05-08/13 and 99–02, respectively).\nThe LMS contains a larger proportion ofmidstratospheric air in spring and summer, compared to fall when a large fraction of the LMS’ air is of recent tropospheric origin [Bönisch et al., 2009]. Hence, in the period 05-08/13 elevated aerosol concentrations are expected in the LMS and midlatitude UT during spring when volcanic aerosol is brought down from higher altitudes, while concentrations in fall are expected to be more connected to the aerosol concentrations in the troposphere. We explore seasonal differences by combining data from the two periods into one season of large stratospheric influence (March–July) and one season with large tropospheric influence (September–November). 3.4.1. Latitude Dependence of Particulate Sulfur UT Concentration The latitudinal distribution of UT sulfur is displayed in Figure 4, revealing a clear tendency of increasing concentrations from the tropics to higher latitudes. For March–July, this gradient is more pronounced in the periods 05-08/13 than during 99–02 (Figures 4a and 4b). A direct comparison of the March–July moving averages (Figure 4c) shows similar concentration levels in the tropics and part of the subtropics.\nFRIBERG ET AL. VOLC AFFECTS S AEROSOL IN UT AND CIRRUS 292\nof the S/PV in the LMS shows that the seasonal variations span approximately a factor of 2. In fall, the S/PV values close to the tropopause are higher than at higher PV values. However, this is not caused by higher sulfur concentrations at the lower PV values. Instead, it is an effect of a very weak dependence on PV of the sulfur concentrations in the LMS during fall [Friberg et al., 2014], resulting in high S/PV for low PV values."

To deal with the scarcity of observations in the UT we group the years together, based on each year’s average S/PV in the LMS, thus improving statistics. The years 2009 and 2011 are excluded in this comparison as midlatitude eruptions that reached the UT/LMS (Redoubt,\nFRIBERG ET AL. VOLC AFFECTS S AEROSOL IN UT AND CIRRUS 293\ndirect injections to the LMS by extratropical volcanism. To gain better statistics we extend the fall season to include August.\nAerosol samples collected in the August–November months after Kasatochi (August 2008), Sarychev (June 2009), and Nabro (June 2011) were all largely affected by volcanism. As Kasatochi exploded in August, samples from August and September 2008 are excluded.\nThe coupling between the LMS and UT is further explored via a comparison of the fall data (Figure 6, magenta data points) for the years when the LMS was strongly affected by volcanism (2008, 2009, and 2011) to that of the less affected years (2006, 2007, and 2012). Unfortunately, comparison to the period 99–02 is not possible, as only two observations of the sulfur concentrations in the LMS in fall are available. A linear regression of the fall data, results in a strong correlation (R2 = 0.95) of high significance (>99%). The 2008 (Kasatochi) data are omitted in this calculation as only one observation from the UT is available. The strong correlation in fall, combined with the correlation found during spring/summer (see section 4.1.1), indicates that downwelling from the stratosphere strongly affects the particulate sulfur concentration in the UT. Interestingly, the slope in spring/summer is a factor 4 larger than in fall. The higher slope is attributed to increased stratosphere-totroposphere transport [Sprenger and Wernli, 2003], resulting in a stronger influence from stratospheric aerosol in the UT."

    "text": "Whereas stratospheric aerosol affects Earth’s radiation budget directly, tropospheric aerosol can affect the budget also indirectly, namely, by altering the occurrence and properties of clouds. In the previous sections the variability of sulfur in the northern midlatitude UT was found to be caused (i) by the seasonally varying subsidence of high-stratospheric air and (ii) by the varying contribution of volcanic aerosol mixed-in from the LMS. Next we will investigate whether volcanism influences the radiation budget via interaction with cirrus clouds. 4.2.1. Comparison to the MODIS Retrieved Cirrus Reflectance To explore a possible impact of downwelling stratospheric aerosol on cirrus clouds, the particulate sulfur concentration measured during CARIBIC is compared to the CR retrieved by MODIS (see section 2.7). Because of the scarcity of UT data we use the S/PV in the LMS as a reasonable proxy for the UT particulate sulfur, as validated above (using samples collected below 5 PVU as in Figure 6). Only the season with\nFRIBERG ET AL. VOLC AFFECTS S AEROSOL IN UT AND CIRRUS 294\nlargest stratospheric impact on the UT/LMS (March–July) is investigated here. The comparison is illustrated as time series (Figure 7a) of each year’s average S/PV from CARIBIC and CR from the Terra and Aqua satellites. While no CARIBIC measurements were performed in the years 2003 and 2004, also the years 2002 and 2009 need to be excluded since too few months of CARIBIC data are available for these years.\nThe year-to-year changes of the CR of both satellites agree very well, in which the average Aqua values are ~20% higher, see explanation in section 2.7. The year-to-year variability and the general trend in S/PV are anticorrelated to CR; note the inverted scale of S/PV (Figure 7a). S/PV increases gradually from 2001 until 2011/2012 as a result of volcanism, whereas CR decreases. The increase in CR after the year 2012 coincides with less volcanic aerosol in the LMS. Unfortunately, maintenance of the CARIBIC aircraft in the year 2014 resulted in too few measurement months to include that year in the comparison, but the volcanic activity is known to have been low. The rate of CR decrease of Aqua is slightly weaker than that of Terra, which could be caused by stronger influence of convection. Since the CR obtained by Terra is less influenced by convective activity, it is expected to be more sensitive to changes in the UT/LMS conditions, which in this case concerns changes in the sulfur concentrations. We therefore use the CR of Terra to illustrate the close coupling of S/PV and CR as a scatterplot (Figure 7b). A linear regression reveals a good anticorrelation between CR and S/PV (R2 = 0.63) with a significance level of 99%, even though the two parameters compared were obtained using fundamentally different measurement methods (the corresponding results for Aqua are R2 = 0.74, significance level of 99%). The relative decrease in CR between 2001 and 2011 is 8 ± 2%, while the particulate sulfur concentration in LMS increased by a factor of 3–4 during this time.\nIn Figure 8, the average CR during 2 years of low volcanic influence (2001–2002) is compared to the average CR during the 2 years of highest volcanic influence on the LMS/UT (2011–2012). The observed CR is generally higher over areas where convection is common since this gives rise to anvils (Figures 8a and 8b). This can be seen in the eastern parts of the oceans where warm water is transported northward resulting in convection and over the North American continent where convection also is common during this season. The CR decreases from 2001–2002 to 2011–2012 for large parts of the NH midlatitudes, see Figure 8c, and the largest decreases are found over Europe, the Atlantic Ocean, the North American continent, and the midPacific Ocean. Change in the location or decrease in convective activity over the eastern parts of the oceans or the North American continent may cause a change in the CR (Figure 8c). However, limiting the computations to areas without persistent convection slightly increased the correlation between the Terra CR and S/PV. Hence, the anticorrelation seen in Figure 7b cannot be explained by a change in convective activity. In the following section possible causes for the anticorrelation will be discussed. 4.2.2. Cloud Microphysics and Climate Recent geoengineering (GE) studies suggest that increased stratospheric sulfurous aerosol concentration can decrease cirrus cloud reflectance in a homogeneous nucleation regime. The GE aerosol increases temperatures and decreases vertical velocities in the tropopause region, which reduce the ice crystal formation rate, leading to optically thinner clouds [Kuebbeler et al., 2012].\nFRIBERG ET AL. VOLC AFFECTS S AEROSOL IN UT AND CIRRUS 295\nSulfurous aerosol could also shift the freezing mechanism of the cirrus clouds from homogeneous to heterogeneous. If the sulfuric acid is neutralized by ammonia, the downwelling LMS aerosol could act as IN [Abbatt et al., 2006; Hoose and Möhler, 2012]. Increases in IN concentrations could shift the freezing mechanism from homogenous to heterogeneous, creating optically thinner cirrus clouds with fewer, larger ice crystals. Seeding of cirrus clouds have been found to make them optically thinner, except in pure heterogeneous freezing regimes [Storelvmo and Herger, 2014].\nIn a heterogeneous nucleation regime, a decrease in the amount of IN would reduce the number of ice crystals in the cirrus clouds, making them optically thinner. Sulfuric acid aerosol downwelling from the LMS may interact with some of the IN present in the UT, reducing their nucleation abilities and that way decrease the number of IN. Deactivation of soot IN from aviation could provide an explanation to the pronounced CR decrease over the Atlantic, North America, and Europe, as a large fraction of the soot emitted from the aviation corridor over the northern Atlantic ends up in this region [Zhou and Penner, 2014].\nOne of the discussed mechanisms, or a combination of them, may have caused the decrease in CR seen in Figures 7 and 8. A decrease in CR implies that the clouds are optically thinner and both reflect less shortwave radiation and absorb less longwave radiation. Because the latter effect dominates, a decrease in CR corresponds to a smaller greenhouse effect from cirrus clouds [Storelvmo et al., 2013].\nThe strong response of 8% decrease in CR to a 3.5-fold increase of S/PV in the LMS indicates a substantial radiative forcing. Making use of the fact that CR and cloud optical thickness (COT) are linearly dependent for thin clouds [Meyer et al., 2007], and the sensitivity of net radiative forcing to changes in COT according to Cirisan et al. [2013, their Figure 8] the maximum decrease of 8% of CR in the time period studied corresponds to approximately 2Wm-2 in net radiative forcing at NH midlatitudes. This regional result pertains to the season March to July."

    "text": "This study focuses on particulate sulfur in the Northern Hemisphere’s upper troposphere (UT) and lowermost stratosphere (LMS) in the period 1999–2013 measured by the CARIBIC observatory. Particulate sulfur\nFRIBERG ET AL. VOLC AFFECTS S AEROSOL IN UT AND CIRRUS 296\nconcentrations varied by a factor of about 100 in this period, mainly as a result of volcanic injections. The sulfurous aerosol concentration in the UT was strongly connected to that in the LMS, as downwelling aerosol constituted the major fraction of the UT particulate sulfur concentration in the periods of volcanic influence.\nDuring the 15 year time span, the UT/LMS was perturbed by volcanism to various degrees. The lowest sulfur concentrations were observed in 1999–2002, a volcanically quiescent period. The largest perturbations were found not only after extratropical volcanic eruptions, specifically in 2008 (Kasatochi) and 2009 (Sarychev), but also in fall 2011 to spring 2012 after an eruption of the tropical volcano Nabro.\nIn the periods 2005–2008 and 2013, the variability in sulfur concentration was dominated by downwelling of volcanic aerosol from tropical volcanism that was transported through the stratosphere. In that period, the LMS sulfur concentration peaked in May as a result of downwelling of air transported in the deep BrewerDobson branch. The same seasonal variation was found in the UT, illustrating a strong coupling of the LMS and the UT. Downwelling of volcanic aerosol was found to more than double the spring and summer UT particulate sulfur concentrations compared to the background levels.\nA comparison of sulfur concentrations to satellite observations of theMODIS retrieved cirrus reflectance (CR) from the satellites Terra and Aqua, for the season of largest stratospheric impact on the UT and LMS (March–July), resulted in strong anticorrelations (R2 =0.63 (Terra), R2 =0.72 (Aqua). The CR and thereby the cloud optical thickness (COT) decreased by 8% in the period 2001–2011. During this time the particulate sulfur concentration increased by a factor of 3.5 in the LMS. The strongest reduction in CR occurs over North America, the North Atlantic, and Europe, where soot ice nuclei (IN) from aviation [Schumann et al., 2013] could shift the cirrus freezing mechanism from homogeneous to heterogeneous [Zhou and Penner, 2014], making deactivation of IN by volcanic sulfate aerosol a conceivable explanation for the observed reduction in CR. However, more research is needed to establish the definite mechanism.\nPrevious studies have shown that volcanism induced a significant radiative forcing after the turn of the millennium [Santer et al., 2014; Solomon et al., 2011] by the direct effect from stratospheric aerosol. New findings of the importance of LMS aerosol in this respect further increase this estimated forcing [Andersson et al., 2015; Ridley et al., 2014]. The tropical Pacific cooling [England et al., 2014; Meehl and Teng, 2014], variations in solar forcing [Flato et al., 2013], and volcanic aerosol forcing occurring after the year 2000 [Santer et al., 2014; Solomon et al., 2011] are not captured by the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, resulting in overestimation of the global warming over the last 15 years [Flato et al., 2013; Fyfe et al., 2013]. Here we introduce an indirect effect from volcanic aerosol that can contribute further explanation of the mismatch of model results and observations."

  "abstractText": "The influence of downwelling stratospheric sulfurous aerosol on the UT (upper troposphere) aerosol concentrations and on cirrus clouds is investigated using CARIBIC (Civil Aircraft for Regular Investigation of the Atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container observations) (between 1999–2002 and 2005–2013) and the cirrus reflectance product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The initial period, 1999–2002, was volcanically quiescent after which the sulfurous aerosol in the LMS (lowermost stratosphere) (SLMS) became enhanced by several volcanic eruptions starting 2005. From 2005 to 2008 and in 2013, volcanic aerosol from several tropical eruptions increased SLMS. Due to consequent subsidence, the sulfur loading of the upper troposphere (SUT) was increased by a factor of 2.5 compared to background levels. Comparison of SLMS and SUT during the seasons March–July and August–November shows a close coupling of the UT and LMS. Finally, the relationship between SLMS and the cirrus cloud reflectance (CR) retrieved from MODIS spectrometer (on board the satellites Terra and Aqua) is studied. SLMS and CR show a strong anticorrelation, with a factor of 3.5 increase in SLMS and decrease of CR by 8 ± 2% over the period 2001–2011. We propose that the increase of SLMS due to volcanism has caused the coinciding cirrus CR decrease, which would be associated with a negative radiative forcing in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes.",
