    "text": "The Early Jurassic Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (∼183Ma) was marked by marine anoxia–euxinia and globally significant organic-matter burial, accompanied by a major global carbon-cycle perturbation probably linked to Karoo–Ferrar volcanism. Although the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event is well studied in the marine realm, accompanying climatic and environmental change on the continents is poorly understood. Here, utilizing radioisotopic, palynological and geochemical data from lacustrine black shales, we demonstrate that a large lake system developed contemporaneously with the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in the Sichuan Basin, China, probably due to enhanced hydrological cycling under elevated atmospheric pCO2 . We attribute increased lacustrine organic productivity to elevated fluvial nutrient supply, which resulted in the burial of ∼460Gt of organic carbon in the Sichuan Basin alone, creating an important negative feedback in the global exogenic carbon cycle. We suggest that enhanced nutrient delivery to marine and large lacustrine systems was a key component in the global carbon cycle recovery during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event and acted to shorten the duration of the recovery of global δ13C values.\nThe early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE at∼183million years ago (Ma)) is recognized as one of themostintense and geographically extensive events of oceanic redox change and accompanying organic-carbon burial in the Mesozoic era1,2. The T-OAE ismarked bymajor changes in global geochemical cycles, with an apparently rapid negative shift of as much as ∼7h in bulk marine and terrestrial organic-carbon isotope records and a typically smaller (3–6h) negative excursion in carbonate archives and specific organic compounds3–10. The observed early Toarcian perturbation to the exogenic carbon cycle has been linked to volcanism of the Karoo–Ferrar large igneous province and associated release of volcanogenic CO2, thermogenic methane (CH4) from sill intrusion into Gondwanan coals, and biogenic methane from dissociation of sub-seafloor clathrates3,6,11–13. Early Toarcian elevated atmospheric pCO2 probably induced climatic and environmental change5,12,14–16 by accelerating the global hydrological cycle and increasing silicate weathering, thereby increasing delivery of riverine nutrients to the oceans and potentially also to large inland lakes17. In the marine realm, the consequential increase in primary productivity and carbon flux to the seafloor is credited with enhancing the burial of planktonic material in relatively deep continental-margin sites, whereas in shallowerwater semi-restricted marine basins, chemical and physical water-column stratification probably aided the burial of organic matter17. Particularly in northern Europe, the evidence points to regional to global development of anoxic–euxinic (sulfide-rich) bottom waters that strongly affected palaeoceanographic conditions and marine ecosystems15,17,18. Globally significant burial of 13C-depleted photosynthetically derived organicmatter commonly produced an overarching positive carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) interrupted by the characteristic abrupt negative shift that invariably characterizes the T-OAE (early Toarcian tenuicostatum–falciferum ammonite biozones)1,2,18. Marine records of the T-OAE, based on the presence of apparently coeval organic-rich shales, have now been identified from many outcrops in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres2,5, but climatic and environmental change on the continents is still poorly understood. Intriguingly, however, sedimentary archives from continental interiors in China (for example, the Tarim, Ordos and Sichuan basins) are consistently marked by the occurrence of organic-rich black shales that are latest Early Jurassic in age19–21. This stratigraphic evidence suggests that major inland lakes potentially formed or expanded contemporaneously with the T-OAE. Here, we determine the precise age of the upper Lower Jurassic lacustrine organic-rich black shales in the Sichuan Basin; determine their depositional context; and explore the possible relevance of major lake formation as an additional sink for carbon in the context of the major disturbance in the early Toarcian exogenic carbon cycle."

The Re–Os isochron from the upper Lower Jurassic lacustrine Da’anzhai Member (Core A) gives an age of 180.3±3.2 Ma, and the Lower Toarcian marine Jet Rock (Yorkshire) gives a Re–Os isochron age of 178.2±5.6 Ma (ref. 44).

The palynomorph assemblages obtained from the studied cores closely resemble floras from lower Toarcian marine successions in northern Europe and Australia, further suggesting a similar depositional age for the lacustrine Da’anzhai Member (see Methods). The observed parallel signature in δ13CTOC (Cores A and B) and δ13Cn-alkane (Core A) in the main phase of the Da’anzhai Member (above 2,698m) (Figs 2 and 3) probably reflects a true perturbation of the global exogenic carbon cycle (see Methods). It is similar in shape and magnitude to what is characteristically observed in early Toarcian marine calcite and compound-specific marine and terrestrial organic-matter records from Europe and elsewhere spanning the T-OAE4,8–10 (Fig. 3).\nThe combined macro- and microfossil biostratigraphy, palynostratigraphy, Re–Os chronology and chemostratigraphy uniquely constrain the formation of the Da’anzhai Member to be time-equivalent with the T-OAE."

    "text": "Terrestrial (fluvial/deltaic and soil) deposits of the Ma’anshan Member in the mid-Early Jurassic Sichuan Basin pass upsection into the lacustrine facies of the Da’anzhai Member. Chemostratigraphic correlation between the more distal Core A and the more proximal Core B, based on elevated values of total organic carbon (TOC) and hydrogen index (HI) and the observed δ13CTOC negative CIE, suggests a diachronous base of the\nDa’anzhai Member, as defined by the presence of characteristic lacustrine facies lying stratigraphically above palaeosols (Fig. 2). The lower half of the Da’anzhai Member in Core A is marked by abundant fossiliferous limestone, primarily consisting of bivalve and ostracod shell fragments, alternating with more clay-rich sediments. This interval is also marked by generally low TOC (∼1%) and HI values (∼150mgC g−1 TOC), suggesting a nearshore depositional environment with low aquatic organic matter productivity and/or preservation. The abrupt transition from palaeosol to fossiliferous limestone at∼2,714.85m, followed by the transition to laminated organic-rich black shale at ∼2,693.40m in the more distal Core A, and the coeval transition from palaeosol to laminated organic-rich black shale at ∼3,156.34m in Core B (Fig. 2), suggests the rapid expansion and deepening of the lake, with decreased macrofossil carbonate supply (Fig. 4). Macrofossils in the regularly occurring limestone beds show variable orientation and degrees of fragmentation and, depending on the stratigraphic horizon, are in life position, or were subjected to local transport and re-deposition. The interbedded marls and black shales are interpreted as representing quieter water sedimentation and/or sedimentation inimical to benthic life.\nThe fossil assemblages from both cores signify a predominantly non-marine depositional environment, with the occurrence of the freshwater bivalve genus Margaritifera24, lacustrine ostracods, and the freshwater/brackish alga Botryococcus (Supplementary Information).

On the right are idealized δ13C records across the T-OAE, with the\nstratigraphic intervals marked with grey shading representing the di erent phases in lake evolution. Phase A: the continental Sichuan Basin was marked by fluvial and terrestrial sedimentary deposition pre-T-OAE negative CIE, with possibly geographically restricted lacustrine conditions in the central part of the basin. Phase B: early Toarcian temperature and sea-level rise increased evaporation from the approaching marine waters, enhancing the hydrological cycle and promoting precipitation in the continental interior of the Sichuan Basin, which resulted in the formation or strong expansion of the palaeo-Sichuan lake. Phase C: continuing late early Toarcian eustatic sea-level rise allowed for occasional marine incursions into the dominantly lacustrine palaeo-Sichuan Basin. Phase D: eustatic sea-level fall in the latest early Toarcian initiated the return to fully lacustrine conditions and maximum lacustrine organic-carbon burial. Phase E: global recovery from the early Toarcian climatic perturbation, with associated reduction in global temperature and cessation of enhanced hydrological cycling, initiated the return to a terrestrial and fluvial depositional environment in the Sichuan Basin.\n2,695.80m and 2,702.49m to 2,710.73m) contain in situ marine palynomorphs such as the acritarch Veryhachium collectum and the prasinophyte Halosphaeropsis liassica (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information). These occurrences suggest marine incursions into the basin. Significantly, the oldest sediments of the lacustrine Da’anzhai Member studied in Core A are devoid of acritarchs (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Information), indicating that the lake had already developed before any potential marine incursion took place. Furthermore, the relative abundance of acritarchs in the samples studied shows no positive correlation with TOC or (pyritic) sulfur abundance (Figs 2 and 3), indicating that deposition of the most organic-rich sediments and the supply of sulfate was\nunrelated to a potential marine connection. Sedimentary facies in Europe and elsewhere indicate that the early Toarcian witnessed a significant marine transgression, culminating in the falciferum ammonite biozone27,28. Although the Early Jurassic Sichuan Basin was surrounded by compressional mountain ranges in the north, east andwest, the palaeo-Sichuan lake system probably formed close to sea level and the basin could, therefore, have been temporarily connected to the ocean to the south (Fig. 1 and references herein, Fig. 4). Overall, however, the abundance of freshwater fossils and palynomorphs, combined with a highly elevated radiogenic initial 187Os/188Os composition of ∼1.29, significantly higher than Early Jurassic Toarcian open marine Osinitial values of 0.4–0.8 recorded from Europe29 (Supplementary Information), points to a dominantly lacustrine environment during the deposition of the Da’anzhai Member. This interpretation is further supported by the presence of tetracyclic polyprenoids (typically sourced from freshwater algae; Supplementary Fig. 5), the near absence of C30 steranes (typically sourced from marine algae; Supplementary\nFig. 6) and high hopane over sterane biomarker ratios throughout Core A30,31 (Supplementary Information).\nA previous study on a section from Bornholm, Denmark suggested a sharp increase of atmospheric pCO2 reconstructed from terrestrial leaf stomatal density at the onset of the negative CIE12. The increased occurrence of Classopollis in tetrads (relative to single specimens; Fig. 2) observed during the negative CIE interval suggests stressed environmental conditions on land during the T-OAE, probably in response to enhanced atmospheric pCO2 and greenhouse-gas-induced climatic warming12,14,18,32,33.\nThe Toarcian mid-palaeolatitude setting and geomorphology of the palaeo-Sichuan Basin, with surrounding high mountain ranges21, may have made the basin susceptible to an enhanced monsoonal system and increased hydrological cycle with high amounts of runoff, particularly when warm shallow transgressive seas approached (Fig. 4) (see the modern South Asian monsoon34). The formation or strong expansion of the palaeo-lake system in the early Toarcian Sichuan Basin, with the deposition of the Da’anzhai Member lacustrine black shales with elevated TOC (of up to ∼3.3%) and HI (of up to 450mg HCg−1 TOC) levels, suggests increased aquatic primary productivity due to increased continental weathering and accelerated riverine nutrient supply. Significantly, based on all the stratigraphic data herein (Fig. 3), the level of maximum TOC enrichment in the Da’anzhai Member developed coevally with themost organic-rich black shale inmarine sections from Yorkshire, UK (Fig. 3), consistent with a fundamental global climatic control on the introduction of nutrients into aquatic environments, even though the quantity and type of organic matter deposited and preserved may have been different.\nElevated sulfur concentrations in the most organic-rich sections of laminated black shale of the Da’anzhai Member in Core A (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Information) coincide with the occurrence of small (<5 µm diameter) and also larger pyrite framboids (Supplementary Fig. 11). The source of sulfur is, however, as yet uncertain, but lake sulfate could have originated from the weathering of the Lower–Middle Triassic evaporites in the hinterland22. Although the larger pyrite framboids could have formed diagenetically in sulfiderich sedimentary pore waters, the smaller framboids (<5 µm) probably formed by sulfate reduction in the water column, as typically happens under euxinic conditions35. The stratigraphic intervals with high (pyritic) sulfur concentrations coincide with levels of elevated sedimentary molybdenum enrichment (with Mo >20 ppm; Fig. 3). In oxic conditions, Mo exists as soluble molybdate (MoO42−) that adsorbs onto Mn oxides and only slowly precipitates. In sulfidic (euxinic) waters, however, molybdate dissociates into thiomolybdate anions, which are rapidly reduced to highly reactive Mo(IV) sulfides that precipitate out of solution, leading to sedimentary Mo enrichment36. Furthermore, water-column stratification, which\n132\n© 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Gammacerane is a biomarker derived from tetrahymanol that forms in abundance under conditions of high bacterial productivity within stratified water columns, commonly in lakes or isolated marine basins37. The combined geochemical and mineralogical data suggest the development of a physically or chemically stratified water column during laminated black-shale formation in the palaeo-Sichuan Lake, even in relatively proximal depositional settings.\nLacustrine carbon burial and the Toarcian carbon cycle The early Toarcian negative CIE has been widely attributed to the release of 13C-depleted volcanogenic CO2 and/or methane from either thermal metamorphism of Gondwanan coals or the dissociation of sub-seafloor gas hydrates, also resulting in enhanced early Toarcian atmospheric pCO2 levels\n3,11,12,15. The typical early Toarcian δ13C pattern, with a stepped negative shift interrupting an overarching positive excursion, has been observed inmarine and terrestrial organicmatter and shallow-water platform and deep-water pelagic carbonates and manifestly affected the entire ocean–atmosphere system3,5,6,8. The overall positive shift is attributed to globally accelerated organic-carbon burial whereas the superimposed stepped negative shift suggests that the release of isotopically light carbon took place in pulses that have been attributed to astronomical forcing of the global carbon cycle6. Astronomical interpretation of periodic fluctuations in chemical and physical proxy records estimate the duration of the early Toarcian negative CIE at 300–900 kyr (refs 6,38–40).\nIn the early Toarcian Sichuan Basin, the laminated black-shale interval in both cores is marked by elevated HI and TOC values (with HI up to 450mg HCg−1 TOC and TOC up to 3.3% in the more distal Core A), probably reflecting increased algal primary productivity, in addition to a background supply of terrestrial organic matter, during the interval with the lowest carbon-isotope values of the negative CIE. This chemostratigraphic pattern is very similar to that developed in marine sections from northern Europe, where sedimentary TOC levels can locally reach ∼20%. Box-model studies for the early Toarcian carbon cycle suggest that the release of ∼9,000Gt carbon from methane clathrates (with δ13C of ∼−60h) or ∼25,000Gt carbon as thermogenic methane (with δ13C of ∼−35h) is required to generate a negative δ13C excursion compatible with the mean change in bulk carbonate of 4–6h, and which would have caused an increase in atmospheric pCO2 of ∼1,000 ppm (refs 7,8,15,41). Excess atmospheric CO2 is assumed to have been sequestered both by enhanced weathering of Ca–Mg silicates due to greenhouse warming, and by massive burial of organic carbon in marine dysoxic, anoxic and euxinic depositional environments17. These combined processes would have dictated the pattern of δ13C recovery, but the total amount of 13C-depleted carbon released may have been even larger than modelled because enhanced 12C-enriched carbon burial would have acted as a mechanism to potentially increase ocean–atmosphere δ13C during the onset of the T-OAE, even though the resultant summed effect was to move values in the opposite direction.\nSequestration of carbon in marine basins is generally considered to have been a major driver behind δ13C recovery. The sheer size of the latest Early Jurassic continental basins, and the expansion of this major lake in response to early Toarcian environmental change provide, however, an additional, and significant, sink for carbon. The Da’anzhai Member lacustrine black shale formed over 70,000 km2 in the palaeo-Sichuan Basin, with an average thickness of 60–120m and 0.8–3.5% TOC; lacustrine marl and carbonate accumulated coevally over large parts of the remaining 160,000 km2 of the basin42. Applying the average of these parameters, it is estimated that ∼460Gt of organic carbon and ∼1,200Gt of inorganic\ncarbon was extracted from the global ocean–atmosphere system and sequestered in the palaeo-Sichuan lake during deposition of the lower Toarcian Da’anzhai Member black shales alone (Supplementary Information). This figure is, however, a conservative estimate because original sedimentary TOC values may have been even higher considering the present-day maturity of the rock. Also, TOC values in the deepest, most central part of the basin may have been more elevated than in the more proximal cores studied herein. Enhanced continental inorganic-carbon burial would not affect the isotopic composition of exogenic carbon reservoirs, but the burial of isotopically depleted organic carbon would shift the carbonisotope composition of the global exogenic carbon cycle to more positive values. Assuming the (pulsed) release of 9,000Gt of carbon from methane clathrates (with a δ13C of ∼ − 60h) or 25,000Gt as thermogenic methane (with a δ13C of ∼− 35h) to explain the observed step-wise negative shift in δ13C (−5h; from 1h to−4h) during the T-OAE41, and assuming global carbon sequestration largely by organic-matter burial (with a δ13C of −25h) to explain the observed recovery in global δ13C, a simple mass-balance model indicates that early Toarcian organic-carbon burial in the black shale of the palaeo-Sichuan Basin alone sequestered 1.3–2.2% of the total amount sequestered to recover from the δ13C negative shift during the T-OAE negative CIE (Supplementary Information). The present-day global lake surface area is about ∼0.69% of the surface area of the global ocean; lakes, however, account for∼10%of the global carbon drawdown and burial43. The palaeo-Sichuan lake alone covered over ∼230,000 km2, which is ∼10% of the presentday global lake surface, but it was responsible for, at least, 1.3–2.2% of the global organic-carbon burial flux. The generation of massive sinks of carbon in the early Toarcian continental interiors by the formation and/or expansion of major lakes and subsequent sequestration of carbon, in addition to marine carbon burial, potentially significantly impacted the nature and duration of the observed exogenic carbon-cycle perturbation. If the carbon sink of the Sichuan Basin black shale had not formed, and with the assumption of constant climatic/environmental parameters affecting the rate of carbon drawdown, the recovery from the δ13C negative shift would have required an additional∼4,000–20,000 yr of global marine carbon drawdown (Supplementary Information). In addition, massive burial of inorganic carbon in the Sichuan Basin, extracted from the ocean–atmosphere system, would have significantly lowered atmospheric pCO2 , which probably further shortened the early Toarcian climatic perturbation. Given that several other lacustrine basins, for example, the Tarim and Ordos basins in northwestern and central northern China (Fig. 1) also appear to have developed in the late Early Jurassic with the deposition of organic-rich sediments19,20, these figures are undoubtedly minima.\nThese results suggest an as-yet-unexplored, negative feedback in the global exogenic carbon cycle during oceanic anoxic events. Climatic warming induced by addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and an associated increase in hydrological cycling, allowed for the formation of major lake systems in continental settings, where enhanced fluvial nutrient supply with increased productivity and preservation could have led to major carbon sequestration. Together with widespread burial of organic matter in the marine realm, the lacustrine carbon sink would have reduced atmospheric pCO2 , allowed rebound of the global δ\n13C signal, and cooled global climate through an inverse greenhouse effect18."

    "text": "Geological setting of the Sichuan Basin. The Sichuan Basin formed on the western part of the Yangtze Platform, in which sedimentation commenced with the Neoproterozoic Sinian sequence (850–570Ma)45. Shallow-marine carbonates formed from the Tonian to the Middle Triassic, with occasional epeirogenic events, for example, widespread basalt emplacement due to extension of the western margin of the Yangtze Platform, in the Late Palaeozoic45. Sedimentation switched from marine to continental in the Middle to Late Triassic with Indosinian tectonic uplift due to closure of the Palaeotethys and collision of the North and South China cratonic blocks22. Siliciclastic sediments were deposited as alluvial fans and lakeshore–deltaic plain facies in the Early Jurassic, particularly along the southern front of the Longmen and Micang–Daba mountain ranges at the northwestern and northern margins of the Sichuan Basin21,23,42,45 (Fig. 1). Continental/fluvial deposits and green/red pedogenic horizons with soil carbonate nodules mark the Ma’anshan Member (middle Ziliujing Formation) and underlie the lacustrine facies of the upper Lower Jurassic Da’anzhai Member (uppermost Ziliujing Formation). The Da’anzhai Member represents the development of dominantly lacustrine conditions and the formation of a major lake. Lacustrine conditions may, however, have persisted through most of the Early Jurassic in the most central and deepest part of the basin, although their onset and termination are still poorly dated46.\nAge model. Re–Os radioisotopic dating on 16 samples from two combined intervals of the Da’anzhai lacustrine black shale (Core A) shows a well-constrained single isochron of 180.3±3.2Ma (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1), constraining the Da’anzhai Member to the Toarcian, following the Jurassic timescale of ref. 26. A Re–Os isochron for the organic-rich marine mudrock from the falciferum ammonite subzone in Yorkshire (UK) suggests a depositional age of 178.2±5.6Ma (ref. 44). The age obtained here for the lacustrine Da’anzhai Member in the Sichuan Basin is in agreement, within uncertainty, with the marine-realm early Toarcian Re–Os isochron-based age (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2).\nThe palynomorph assemblages of the lacustrine Da’anzhai Member, with the superabundance of the pollen Classopollis sp. (and the absence of Callialasporites spp.), the occurrence of the spore Ischyosporites variegatus, the acritarch Veryhachium collectum, multi-specimen clumps of the prasinophyte Halosphaeropsis liassica and the rare occurrence of the dinoflagellate cyst ?Skuadinium sp., are comparable to floras from lower Toarcian marine successions in northern Europe and Australia, indicating that the successions studied here are of similar age (Supplementary Fig. 4 shows a range chart with selected palynomorph occurrence). The superabundance of the thermophilic pollen genus Classopollis and the occurrence of the opportunistic prasinophyte species Halosphaeropsis liassica, thought to have thrived in environmentally stressed conditions and normally occurring in multi-specimen clumps, are especially typical of the T-OAE (Supplementary Information)47–50.\nFurthermore, δ13CTOC analyses of Core A reveal<3h fluctuations in the basal 15m of the Da’anzhai Member, followed by a transient ∼4h negative excursion (Fig. 2). The base of Core B is interpreted to be stratigraphically younger than Core A on the basis of carbon-isotope correlation, and similarly shows a ∼4h negative excursion in δ13CTOC (Fig. 2), followed by a full positive return to initial base values. The two cores combined illustrate the complete negative CIE, which is similar in shape and magnitude to that observed in marine records of the T-OAE (Fig. 3)6,44. Compound-specific long-chain n-alkane (C23–C33) δ13C analyses of Core A also show a distinct ∼4h negative excursion, similar in magnitude to the bulk organic-matter δ13CTOC from the same stratigraphic interval (Figs 2 and 3). Long-chain n-alkanes in sedimentary organic matter are typically sourced from terrestrial higher plants or freshwater algae51 whose isotopic compositions are commonly indistinguishable because lake-water dissolved inorganic carbon is isotopically in equilibrium with the atmosphere52. Consequently, the observed shift in δ13Cn-alkanes directly reflects changes in the carbon-isotope composition of the atmosphere (and lake-water dissolved inorganic carbon) during the early Toarcian global carbon-cycle perturbation. The odd-over-even predominance in the long-chain (C23–C33) n-alkane distribution, typical for terrestrial higher plant leaf waxes or freshwater algal-sourced sedimentary organic matter51 is, however, not observed from Core A (with a carbon preference index of ∼1), probably due to its relatively elevated thermal maturity53. The ∼2–3h carbon-isotope fluctuations in δ13CTOC in the lower Da’anzhai Member of Core A (2,702–2,715m in the core) are,\nhowever, not repeated in the δ13Cn-alkane record. This feature may suggest a shift in the dominant sedimentary organic matter source away from freshwater algae to 13C-enriched terrestrial woody organic matter, with HI values of<100mg HCg−1 TOC at 2,711.4–2,712.3m and 2,703.5–2,706.6m in the lower Da’anzhai Member of Core A, which are much lower than HI values of the upper Da’anzhai Member, where the degree of maturity is similar (Fig. 2; see Supplementary Information for further discussion).\nOverall, relatively enriched δ13CTOC values in the more proximal Core B may be explained by the greater woody component of terrestrial residual sedimentary organic matter (the isotopically heavier ligno-cellulose component of a plant)3,54, as suggested indirectly by low HI values (<200mg HCg−1 TOC; Fig. 2) and directly by palynological study (with 26–45% wood). In addition, the more proximal Core B is thermally more mature, with Tmax values mainly of 453–470 ◦C (Tmax values of Core A are mainly 444–460 ◦C). Maturation of kerogen can increase its δ13CTOC values by 1–2h, which may have further contributed to the offset observed between the organic-carbon isotope records of cores A and B55. The observed parallel signature in δ13CTOC and δ13Cn-alkane in the main phase of the Da’anzhai Member (above 2,698m) therefore probably reflects a true perturbation of the global exogenic carbon cycle. It is similar in shape and magnitude to what is characteristically observed in lower Toarcian marine calcite and compound-specific marine and terrestrial organic matter from Europe and elsewhere spanning the T-OAE4,8–10 (Fig. 3).\nTerrestrial environment. The consistent superabundance in both cores of the thermophilic pollen genus Classopollis, which is thought to have derived from gymnosperm conifers dwelling in regions marginal to bodies of water32, suggests higher temperature conditions in the continental interior or along the shorelines of the palaeo-Sichuan lake system. Elevated atmospheric and marine temperatures during the T-OAE have also been suggested from coeval marine records, also with increased abundance of Classopollis and the 18O-depleted signature of macrofossil calcite14,18,32.\nData availability. The authors declare that the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files."

  "abstractText": "The Early Jurassic Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (∼183Ma) was marked by marine anoxia–euxinia and globally significant organic-matter burial, accompanied by a major global carbon-cycle perturbation probably linked to Karoo–Ferrar volcanism. Although the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event is well studied in the marine realm, accompanying climatic and environmental change on the continents is poorly understood. Here, utilizing radioisotopic, palynological and geochemical data from lacustrine black shales, we demonstrate that a large lake system developed contemporaneously with the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in the Sichuan Basin, China, probably due to enhanced hydrological cycling under elevated atmospheric pCO2 . We attribute increased lacustrine organic productivity to elevated fluvial nutrient supply, which resulted in the burial of ∼460Gt of organic carbon in the Sichuan Basin alone, creating an important negative feedback in the global exogenic carbon cycle. We suggest that enhanced nutrient delivery to marine and large lacustrine systems was a key component in the global carbon cycle recovery during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event and acted to shorten the duration of the recovery of global δC values.",
