These two global orogenies caused many global events, and because they are close to us in time, causality links between these orogenies and these far scattered events aremuchmore apparent than in older orogenies. These teleconnections include establishment of the present world oceanic current system; the beginnings of oceanic cooling at 14 Ma; an increase in hemipelagic mud bordering the continents; changes in continental tilts and river systems; great biological changes; increased desertification; replacement of C3 by C4 grasses; a major shift in siliceous microfossils from the Atlantic to the Pacific at 15Ma; and first development of the earliest hominids in East Africa starting at 10Ma. In addition, spreading rates of oceanic ridges increased, volcanism increased, there was movement along many transform faults, and continental elevations increased. Short, bulleted statements set forth these near and far field events.\nImmediate causes were increased rates of plate motions and/or changes of directions. Only a strong, short 11 Ma pulse of heat from the Earth's core provides the logical ultimate source of this energy. Only such a pulse of heat from the core has sufficient magnitude and acts globally. Thus the deep Earth cycle is a plausible, easy-to-understand, overarching explanation that should be increasingly considered by geologists and geophysicists studying the outer crust. A flow diagram links major earth surface features on the continents to the deep earth. Alternative explanations for these events are considered and seem totally inadequate.\n© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nWe propose that the major events in Miocene oceans, atmosphere, and continents are all related to plate tectonics, and that these events in turn, are linked to the deep earth cycle as an integrated system extending far back in time. Demonstration of\nFig. 2. Global map of two antipodal superswells over large low shear velocity provinces (LLSV Courtillot et al. (2003, Fig. 1), Tamaki and Honza (1991, Fig. 1), and Dickinson et al. (1986, mochemical piles (Bull et al., 2009).\nMiocene connections to the deep earth will go far to help identify similar connections in earlier global orogenies.\nThere are two reasons why understanding the interrelationships among the many synchronous global events from the base of the Middle Miocene (Langhian) to the end of the Late Miocene (TortonianeMessinian) from 16 to 5.3 Ma (Fig. 1), best demonstrate the links between the earth's surface features and its deep earth cycle. First, the Middle and Late Miocene are close to us in time, so their major tectonic processes and consequences are readily studied, making causality links easier to identify than those in earlier orogenies. Second, many, if not most, of the diverse global events of theMiddle and LateMiocene are either directly or indirectly related to only two major tectonic events: the Alpine-Himalayan and Circum-Pacific Orogenies (Fig. 2). In broad terms, these two orogenies marked the final replacement of a lingering greenhouse world by an icehouse world. Advances in deep earth seismic tomography link both of these orogenies to the deep earth's major cycle, first proposed by Arthur Holmes, 1929, 1944.\n2. Global setting\nThe Alpine-Himalayan and Circum-Pacific global orogenies both formed over subduction zones along oceanic margins, and both contain new and rejuvenated mountain belts, some of the latter as recent as 84e37 Ma (Gries, 1983; Getz, 2012), the widespread Laramide Orogeny (North America). The Alpine-Himalayan Orogeny extends from Gibraltar into Vietnam, some 13,000 km. This orogeny resulted from the African, Arabian, Indian and Australian Plates impacting southern Eurasia as Gondwana broke up and its fragments moved north over approximately 120 Ma to finally close the Tethys Ocean in the early Miocene. Today, only the Mediterranean, Black, Caspian, and Aral Seas, and some smaller lakes to the east remain. South America first rifted and opened from Africa between 135 and 120Ma ago. This initial narrow gulf opened\nPs); back-arc basins of western Pacific, and late MesozoiceTertiary orogenic belts. After\nFig. 1.11). The two superswells may be thermal plume clusters (superplumes) or ther-\nnorthward to finally connect with the central Atlantic, forming a proto-Atlantic Ocean at about 58 Ma (Scotese, 2000).\nThe Circum-Pacific orogenic belt, on the other hand, is 29,000 km long and also formed over subduction zones along the margins of the Pacific Ocean, but with a most significant difference: along the western and northern margin of the Pacific from New Zealand to Alaska, where oceanic crust is oldest and coldest (Sclater et al.,1985, Fig. 3), retreat of the subducting plates was accompanied by the formation of interarc and backarc basins. These basins have complex tectonism that included seafloor spreading andmultiple subduction zones. From Gibraltar eastward along the border of southern Laurentian Asia, the impact of north-moving fragments of Gondwanadthe African, Arabian, Indian, and Australian Platesdformed mountain chains such as the Atlas, Alps, Carpathians, Zagros, Himalayas, and those of Vietnam and Thailand. These two global Miocene orogenic belts are largely built on an earlier global orogeny of Late Cretaceous-Early Eocene age with modifications in and near the Oligocene-Neogene boundary (Levin, 1994). Although collisions started as early as the Permian, much of the present tectonic configuration of southern Asia traces its origin to the first docking of India that began at about 50.5 Ma (Green et al., 2008). This impact finally produced the great change in sedimentary strike around the east end of the Himalayas, with its many strike-slip faults, and the dominantly northesouth grain across Vietnam and Thailand that controls much of its principal drainage. Similarly, the northward drift of the Australian and Indian Plates produced themajor tectonic features of the Indonesian archipelago. All of these broadly contemporaneous events are associated with major subduction zones and clearly require a deep earth cause. Renewed heating and upwelling along the margins of the two large, low shear velocity\nprovinces, the African and Pacific Superswells (Fig. 2), are the ultimate drivers of these global events. See Potter and Szatmari (2009, 2012) for earlier, initial discussion of these events.\n3. Middle and Late Miocene events\nMany of these teleconnections are proximal to major near field tectonic events, such as an orogenic front or transform fault, whereas others are far field events, such as the closing or opening of a key but distant isthmus, a far-ranging change in continental tilt, the growth of a large rain shadow as a major mountain range rose or the development of a monsoon as a jet streamwas deflected. Most, but not all, of these events started in either the Middle or Late Miocene, but also included are a few long term (many millions of years) events associatedwithprocessesdating fromthebreakupofPangea (about200Ma) or fromtheOligoceneandcontinued intoand through the11Maof the Middle and Late Miocene. Many of these display an increase of intensity in the Middle or Late Miocene. The events below can be thoughtof asa check listewhat to look foror considerwhenstudying, and especially when modeling, earlier global orogenies. An early demonstration of these global teleconnections with respect to intercontinentaluplift andclimatewasprovidedbyRuddimanetal. (1989); see Chapin (2009) for a comprehensive example in the southwestern United States, who integrated both on and off shore events. None of the events reported here were screened with respect to their origin.\n3.1. Tectonic\nThe Middle Miocene saw increased spreading rates (Kominz, 1984, Fig. 3A) as well as one of the fastest spreading rates of\nntrasted with today's disjointed and fragmented system (Perrin, 2002, Fig. 5).\n180e210 mm/yr observed on the ocean floor in the Cocos Plate (Wilson, 1996). Logically, faster spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges imply increased tectonic activity at and along convergent and transform margins and probable enhanced activity in continental interiors as well. Heightened and new activity of the Circum-Pacific and AtlaseAlpineeZagroseHimalayan global orogenic belts, totaling some 42,000 km, formed high mountains and plateaus and globally shed immense quantities of mud and sand (Dickinson et al., 1986 and our Fig. 2). The Tethyan Ocean (Fig. 3) was closed by fragments of Gondwana, first by India during the Eocene at 50.5 Ma (Green et al., 2008), intermittently isolated the Mediterranean from the Tethys in much of Miocene (Ziegler, 1988; R€ogel, 1999) and temporarily closed Gibraltar during the latest Miocene at 5.3 Ma (Maldonado and Nelson, 1999, p.229). This long interval of closing is a tectonic event comparable to the two global orogenies, because it concentrated the continents in the northern hemisphere, formed the gigantic accretionary margin of southern Eurasia, and disrupted the long-lived global equatorial current (Perrin, 2002, Fig. 5 and Smith and Pickering, 2003). The global orogeny formedmany new sedimentary basins while older ones were uplifted (inverted) and eroded. Wide epeirogenic uplift of continental interiors and many passive margins (but not everywhere) helped cool the atmosphere and accelerate erosion. Examples include the uplift of British Columbia at 10 Ma (Farley et al., 2001), the Rocky Mountains (Christiansen and Yeats, 1992), the 10 Ma uplift in the central Andes (Garzione et al., 2008), the replacement of tropical forest in northeast Africa by semiarid landscape in response to uplift at 10 Ma (Sakai et al., 2010, Fig. 9), the uplift of the north Tibetan Plateau since 15Ma (Li et al., 2011), the Central Range Orogeny of New Guinea at 12 Ma (van Ufford and Cloos, 2005), and as summarized by Dooley et al. (2013), the Middle and Late\nMiocene epeirogenic uplift of much of the interior and coastal regions of the southern United States. The climax of long-term, northward drift of Gondwana's fragmented continents led to seven stepwise major openings and closings of ocean gateways (Fig. 3), and finally ended the earlier warm, global, homogenizing equatorial current (Smith and Pickering, 2003). This fundamentally rearranged the earth's atmospheric heat balance. The Japanese archipelago assumed its present form largely in the Middle Miocene (Takahashi and Oda, 1997, Fig. 3). Central America initially connected to South America in the Middle Miocene judging by UePb ages of zircons (Montes et al., 2015). On the east side of the North Pacific in the “mid Miocene,” there was a transition across the Cordilleran region of the western United States from Laramide tectonics to strike slip and extensional tectonics (Christiansen and Yeats, 1992, p. 261). Many major, large transform faults on or near the continents were reactivated or initiated, and by inference, so were those at sea. Two onshore examples are the Dead Sea Transform, whose main movement began in the Middle Miocene (Kesten et al., 2008), and the Great Alpine Fault between the Australia and Pacific Plates of New Zealand began in the Early Miocene (King, 2000) both of which continue to this day. Block faulting began in the Basin and Range Province of the western United States between 17 and 15 Ma, followed by later spreading (Fosdick and Colgan, 2008).\n3.2. Volcanic\nWidespread volcanism occurred not only along midocean ridges (Saemundsson, 1986) and ocean-continent convergent margins, but also on the continents and in some intraplate regions.\ngions with histogram of ages.

The Columbia River\nThe Colombia basalts started just before the Middle Miocene (17 Ma) fed by the rupture of the descending Farallon slab (Liu and Stegman, 2012). Two examples of Miocene intraplate volcanism are the Colombia River basalts-greater Yellowstone region and the greater Mediterranean regions (Fig. 4). Notice the sharp increase of Miocene activity in the greater Mediteranean area in the Middle and Late Miocene. Early seismic image (Fig. 5) of the shallow upper mantle plume beneath the modern Yellowstone volcanic field is probably typical of other hotspots, past and present.\nFig. 6.

Global climate and oceans\nConjunction of opening and closing of seven tectonic gateways, clustering of continents at northern high latitudes, and higher continental interior elevations initiated cooling of the global ocean and atmosphere between 15 and 14Ma greatly altered the world's temperature regime (Zachos et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2005), a most significant inflection point in Cenozoic earth history (Fig. 6). A good specific example is provided by the entry of cold water into the North Atlantic at the beginning of the Middle Miocene (Wright and Miller (1996, p. 161). Principal features (locations, intensities, and temperatures) of much of present global oceanic circulation developed concurrently with the expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet between 15 and 14 Ma in the early Middle Miocene (Keller and Barron, 1983). Near the base of Middle Miocene the ocean becamemore oxic in response to its new more energetic circulation (Norris et al., 2013; Fig, 2). The withdrawal of the Tethyan Ocean was almost completely established by the late Middle Miocene (Keller and Barron, 1983). Major eustatic falls in global sea level occurred in theMiddle and Late Miocene with Antarctic ice advances an important cause Bartek et al. (1991). See widely separated examples both in clastics along the Atlantic and Gulf crests of the United States (Greenlee and Moore, 1988) and offshore of southwestern Brazil on the Campos and Santos Basins (Zerfass et al, 2013) and carbonates (Betzler et al., 2000, Tcherepanov et al., 2008). Sea level fall at the base of the Tortonian is notably widespread and is inferred to result from a large advance of East Antarctic ice (Flower and Kennett, 1995). Deep-water unconformities, disconformities, and hiatuses developed when shorelines retreated below the shelf edge bringing stronger currents to deeper waters forming subsea turbidite fans and disconformities; in the Middle Miocene there was some extensive carbonate dissolution of calcareous bottomsdthe “carbonate crash” of the Caribbean (Roth et al., 2000, Keller and Barron, 1983).\nial global current system and was a key factor in cooling the world ocean, as inferred by Ma.\nRise of the Tibetan Plateau shifted the Asian jet stream to form themonsoon. Aided by thewithdrawal of the Paratethyan Ocean from central Asia and new uplifts with rain shadows (Qui, 2014). Chinese loess started at 22 Ma (Guo et al., 2002). Most of southwestern Asia and the Sahara became drier in the Tortonian as the Tethys closed (Zhang et al., 2014). In northeast Africa epeirogenic uplift induced dryness (Wichura et al., 2010). The Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum at 17.0e14.7 Ma is widely reported across the world (Hilgren et al., 2012, Fig. 29.13). Mountain glaciation spread as the Miocene cooled and supplied thick, poorly sorted clastics to high-latitude marginal marine basins with deposits such as the Yakataga Formation (Armentrout, 1983; Eyles et al., 1991), and to large cratonic rivers with glaciated watersheds.\n3.4. Clastic deposition\nSedimentation rates in the ocean greatly increased during the Middle and Late Miocene (Davies et al., 1977), along with increasing amounts of Al2O in deep-sea muds (Donnelly, 1982) as Middle and Late Miocene deltas thickened and expanded; e.g., the Orinoco (Di Croce, 1995, Fig. 3.3b) and the Gulf Coast (Galloway, 2008). In the Gulf of Mexico clastics increased in the late Early Miocene and again in the Late Miocene (Galloway et al., 2015, Fig. 20). Thick clastics developed in the latest Oligocene and continued into the Pliocene in the central and eastern parts of the Alpine foredeep with final continuous paleoflow to the east in its foredeep (Pfiffner, 2014, Fig. 7.1) Shorelines prograded markedly along passive margins with many clinothems and new and enlarged continental embankments (Fig.7). Near the continents there was enhanced hemipelagic mud deposition (Donnelly, 1982). The Middle and Late Miocene was a time of great tectonically induced change in river systems, and new and enlarged older deltas, and subsea fans (Fig. 8), especially on passive margins (Potter and Hamblin, 2006). Large falls in global sea level in the Miocene shifted sand deposition from shelf or platform to lower slope and deepwater, as happened at the base of the Tortonian of the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and elsewhere. This progradation beyond the shelf edge onto the lower continental slope caused mass gravity sliding (enhanced over steepening and overpressure) at lowstands (Fig. 9). Large deep sea fans such as those of the Amazons developed at the same time. Principal sedimentary fill of the western Pacific back arc basins occurred in the Miocene after volcanic dominance that started in the Oligocene.\nFig. 7. Idealization of a clinoform in a Tertiary conti\nStepwise flooding of mud to global oceans in theMiocene is well defined at 16 Ma by a sharp rise in d7Li0/00 (Misra and Froelich, 2012, Fig. 4b), based on many hundreds of samples from benthonic foraminifera (Fig. 10). A new disjointed and invigorated ocean current system (Fig.3) introduced cold polar waters to lower latitudes and caused many deep-sea hiatuses andunconformities and increasedupwellingof cold nutrient richwater. These newareas ofMioceneupwelling in the Pacific formed the organic rich shales off Sakhalin Island and the Middle Miocene Monterey Formation of California.\n3.5. Landscape\nGlobally, Middle and Late Miocene tectonic activity left two major global landscapes: a near-field tectonically altered Miocene alpine landscape with a far-field landscape (vast aprons, llanos, and steppes in the Northern Hemisphere), plus a relic, little-altered Gondwana landscape quite different from much of today's glaciated Northern Hemisphere (Squires, 1988). Middle and Late Miocene tectonism shifted continental tilts and divides in response to accelerated plate motions and new uplifts and continental tilts. Some preexisting rivers were destroyed and many new ones formed, along with their associated deltas and subsea fans. A few examples of new Middle and Late Miocene rivers include the Amazon, Amur, Columbia, Danube (and those flowing north and west away from and in Alps and Carpathians), Orinoco, and Magdalena plus the Nile canyon. (Potter and Hamblin, 2006, Fig. 16). Sharpened climate contrasts developed on continents: large rain shadows with deserts and loess and growth of mountain glaciation, all were concurrent with global oceanic and atmospheric changes and glaciers expanded in Antarctica. 40Ar/39Ar dating of individual grains of regolith cryptomolan (profiles 400 km apart) shows a strong weathering event between 10e8 Ma that correlates with the global eustatic curve and kaolin content (Carmo and Vasconcelos, 2004, Fig. 6).\n3.6. Groundwater\nBack tilting of adjacent platforms and cratons can shift or reverse the direction of subcontinental groundwater during an orogeny in adjacent foreland and cratonic basins (Garven,1992; Nunn and Lin, 2002). Such reversals may lead to distal, far-field, mineralized fracture systems as hot acid fluids expelled from marginal highlands cool in carbonate platforms such as in the Trenton carbonates (Acadian Orogeny) of the northeastern United States and Canada (Smith and Davies, 2006; Davies and Smith, 2006).\nnental embankment (Bartek et al., 1991, Fig. 2).\n3.6.1. Biology\nRapidly changing paleoclimates, paleo-oceans, and paleogeography greatly increased environmental stresses on land and sea, caused not only accelerated evolution (horses, cats, hominids, etc.), but also major shifts in fauna and flora and greater diversity. See Kauffman (1976) and the summary by Hoorn et al. (2013). C4 grasslands rapidly began to replace C3 grasslands 8e3 Ma ago, one of the most rapid bionomic changes in the geologic record (Edwards et al., 2010). This altered erosion rates and sediment yields (shallower root systems). The biotic consequences of the opening and closing of gateways can be far-reaching, both in the oceans and on land; as the Isthmus of Panama closed, siliceous microfossils shifted (the silica shift) from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean (Keller and Barron, 1983, Fig. 13), and the Central American tiger displaced\nthe terror bird (Kespka, 2014, p. 37) as the dominant predator of South America. Uplift in East Africa at 10 Ma set the stage for early hominid evolution (Fig. 11). Dissolved oxygen increased deep-sea benthonic foraminifera test size at 16 Ma (Kaiho, 1998, Fig. 3). Reef sites started to decline at about 12 Ma during the Serravallian (Perrin and Kiessling, 2010). Starting at 10 Ma, the flood of Andean mud and silt into the tropical western Amazonia region changed nutrient-poor tropical soils into nutrient-rich Andean soils, greatly enriching their microbiology and fauna and flora (Hoorn et al., 2010). Thepresentdominanceof redalgal reefs started in theBurdigalian and expanded in the Middle Miocene (Halfar and Mutti, 2005). At 74 N on Banks Island in the Arctic Archepelego a pine forest growing in lower middle Miocene beds started to decline (Williams et al., 2008)\n3.7. Petroleum\nNew or enlarged deltas and deep-sea fans provided reservoir beds and reservoirs so that today the Middle and Late Miocene, with a duration of only 11 Ma (only 2 percent of Phanerozoic time), hosts about 17 percent of the world's petroleum. Equally important, prolific Middle and Late Miocene sedimentation buried underlying Cretaceous organic-rich shales to form petroleum source rocks. In the Middle Miocene, lowering of sea level shifted deposition from the platform to the continental slope and beyond to form many of today's deep-water reservoirs in the Gulf Coast (Galloway, 2008) and elsewhere. Rapid muddy sedimentation on these unstable slopes induced sliding of large slabs of slope sediment on the Gulf Coast and Niger delta with extensional faulting at their heads and frontal fold-and-thrust belts. Synsedimentary diapirism and trap formation occurred during rapid burial above weak, thick mud or salt on continental shelves and slopes (Miocene of northern Gulf of Mexico, as well as in the Niger delta, Trinidad, Azerbaijan, and Indonesia). Diatom reservoir rocks of the Miocene Monterey Formation and those of Sakhalin Island accumulated in the Middle Miocene as cold, nutrient-rich water upwelled against continents. Far-field, mineralized fracture systems andwrench faults related to major orogenies may harbor secondary dolomitic reservoirs (Smith and Davies, 2006). Because of a flood of clastics, there are only 197 carbonate petroleum reservoirs in Early and Middle Miocene deposits whereas there are 348 in Late Miocene deposits (Markello et al., 2008, Fig.5) e suspended mud inhibits filter feeders.\n4. Proximate causes\nCollectively, the events and teleconnections cited in the above observations reveal the amazing number and diversity of the events related to Late and Middle Miocene atmospheres, oceans, biology, and surface geology, all of which transformed a lingering greenhouse world into an icehouse world. Especially notable is their short time span, only 11 Ma, in comparison to the Laramide Orogeny of 84e37 Ma years in the Americas.\nThe vast majority of these events are directly or indirectly linked to plate motionsdthe placement of continents with respect to each other and the poles, whether continents have convergent,\ntransform, or passive margins or develop major rift systems. All of these rearrange oceanic circulation systems by opening and closing key gateways, shutting off or opening cold or warm water and possibly altering their nutrients and oxygen content and velocity. It is plate motion that directly forms major mountain belts, energizes transform faults, and both forms new sedimentary basins and destroys others. Continental tilts are also directly related to plate motions and are responsible for many other significant features, such as the orientation and locations of large, subcontinental river systems and their associated deltas and subsea fans, flooding much of the world ocean with mud and helping build thick wedges of continental embankments on the margins of continents. The topographic deflection of jet streams by rising mountains (Southeast Asia, Andes) and far-reaching rain shadows of high mountains or plateaus provide other examples. Global orogenies also favor more mountain glaciation and seem important for middle latitude ice sheets too. Volcanism is also a major feature of ocean-continent convergence as it correlates with ridge spreading rates, and also occurs in intraplate settings (Fig. 4); more plume and hotspot activity is responsible for much of this. These rapid and extensive changes of paleogeography during global orogenies caused extensive evolutionary changes and many shifts of flora and fauna. The short time of 11 Ma for all these events points to a single cause. The global scope of these events in this short time reinforces this inference. We argue that the great global reach and broad, global 11 Ma contemporaneity of the above Miocene events are best explained by a sharp, short strong pulse of heat from the earth's core. That this pulse of heat was global in scope was first suggested by Mjelde and Faleide (2009), who proposed co-pulsation for the magma fluxes of the Hawaii-Emperor Ridge in the Pacific and the Iceland hotspot in the Atlantic; similar antipodal co-pulsation can be noted also between the Ontong-Java LIP in the Pacific and the Parana-Etendeka LIP that preceded the South Atlantic.\n5. Machinery of the deep Earth cycle\nThe machinery of the deep earth, first proposed by Holmes (1944), has since become increasingly sophisticated, mainly by studies of seismic tomography. This shows that the Earth's surface history is controlled by the dynamics of the mantle. Subducted plates formed by the amalgamation of supercontinents periodically collapse to form the high-velocity D00 layer, a slab graveyard at the core mantle boundary (Maruyama et al., 2007, Fig. 12). Heat from\nthe core in time partial melts this layer, causing andesitic solids to rise, forming large low shear velocity provinces or superplumes. Large igneous provinces have been generated by plumes rising from the steep margins of these LLSVPs (Fig. 13; Courtillot et al., 2003; Anderson, 2007; Torsvik et al., 2006; Li and Zhong, 2009; Foulger, 2010). The rise and thermal subsidence of individual plumes strongly affect sedimentation especially in shallow seas (Fig. 14). The position of these two antipodal Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), one below Africa and the other below the central Pacific, correlate with dynamic topographic highs or superswells (Figs. 2, 12 and 13) that may have remained constant for hundreds of millions of years while plates migrated above them (Torsvik et al., 2006; Burke et al., 2008). Alternatively, proxy modeling indicates that the LLSVPs and thermochemical “superplumes”may have been easily swept away by cold subducting slabs throughout the Phanerozoic, moving over the free-slip surface of the liquid outer core (McNamara and Zhong, 2005; Zhang et al., 2010).\nOther examples of this inferred linkage between earth surface features and those of the deep earth include: (1) the reversal of the Amazon River (continental drifting over a sinking slab; Shepard et al., 2010); (2) origin of the Columbia River basalt (rupture of the Farallon slab; Liu and Stegman, 2012), (3) flooding history of the Australian craton in the last 70 Ma (sinking slab and proximity to Melanesian subduction; Heine et al., 2010); (4) coupled uplift of the Colorado Plateau and the less dense/hotter mantle underlying high\nareas of the Rocky Mountains (Karlstrom et al., 2012); (5) development of a regional drainage system in Paleocene-Eocene mudstone north of Scotland (in response to passage of the Icelandic plume; Hartley et al., 2011); and (6) modeled reconstruction of the last 30 Ma years of mantle topography of Africa's basins and rifts (Moucha and Forte, 2011). Another example is provided by basin evolution above a shallow rising mantle plume (Fig. 13). See Hager et al. (1985), Braun (2010), Allen (2011), Jones et al. (2012), Cloetingh and Willet (2013) and Kerr (2013) for a discussion of the effects of the mantle on dynamic topography.\nWhat does the deep earth literature tell about a possible cause of the abrupt increase in global tectonic activity at the beginning of the Middle Miocene? As far as we know, this question has not been asked or discussed in detail in the literature. The recent recognition that the core has thermochemical cycles just as does the mantle (Maruyama et al., 2007; Aubert et al., 2008) is a possible pathway to an explanation for this short, abrupt, global pulse of heat. Could it\nLow Shear Velocity Provinces of the lowermost mantle (Li and Zhong, 2009, Fig. 11).\nbe that the simultaneous heat pulse we infer for the two superplumes resulted from a brief spatial superposition of both mantle and core cycles, one heat maxima briefly positioned under the other?\nOur hypothesis of a pulse of heat from the Earth's core as the cause for the Middle and Late Miocene events finds support in the recent work by Pozzo et al. (2012, 2014) who used density functional theory to compute thermal and electrical conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles. They found the conductivities of both cores to be two to three times higher than those currently used, concluding that the adiabatic heat flux is 15e16 TW at the core mantle boundary (CMB). Building on these results, Morgan and Vannucchi (2014) showed that an approximate 500e1000 g/m3 seismically-inferred increase in density between the liquid outer core and solid inner core allows us to directly infer the core-freezing Clapeyron Slope (temperaturepressure ratio during phase change) for the outer core's actual composition which contains ~approximately 8 ± 2% lighter elements (S,Si,O,Al, H,...) mixed into a FeeNi alloy. Basing their Clapeyron Slope on the 600 kg/m3 jump between outer and inner core (Preliminary Reference Earth Model PREM; Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981), Morgan and Vannucchi (2014) concluded that there has been approximately 774 K of core cooling during the freezing and growth of the inner core, releasing approximately 24 TWof power during the past 3 Ga; such high heat flowacross the core-mantle boundary (CMB) means that the present-day mantle is strongly 'bottom-heated' so that diapiric mantle plumes should dominate deep mantle upwelling. Like diapiric mantle plumes, core convection is also pulsating. This fully supports our hypothesis that a “pulse of heat” from the core was the power source for global orogenic events such as those of the Middle and Upper Miocene.\n6. Flow diagram for the continents\nThe flow diagram of Fig. 15 outlines the principal causal connections between the deep earth and its surface geology on the continentsdcrustal tectonics connected to the deep Earth cycle. We suggest that Fig.15 applies to all of Phanerozoic history andwell into the Neoproterozoic. Uncluttered by many secondary feedback loops, this diagram identifies only the main pathways of causality on the continents and thus provides an easy-to-understand way to see how heat from the earth's core drives its surface geology. Faster plate motions and more plume and hotspot activity were the immediate drivers of the burst of activity in the Middle and Late Miocene that laid the foundations of our modern world. Most of these events and their associated processes occurred within the 11- Ma interval of the Middle and Late Miocene and thus were either partially or totally overlappingdcertainly itself strong evidence for a deep earth cause. Fig. 15 also lists the principal volcanic areas on the continents since the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, which have long been linked to underlying plumes (Kerrick, 2001).\nSeven immediate major controls on global paleogeography that are most directly related to plate tectonics and the deep earth include (1) the configuration (clustering and shape) and position of the continents (alter the earth's heat balance and polar ice sheets reduce global sea level); (2) global and subcontinental orogenies alter continental elevations, tilts, watersheds, and jet streams; (3) uplifts of continental interiors and passive margins change drainage; (4) tectonic openings and closings of oceanic gateways change global oceanic circulation and thus world climate. Andwhat can be said of local relative sea level, as the immediate control to shifting shorelines and cycle stratigraphy? Here tectonic control is less direct, because shoreline shifts depend on the interplay of basin subsidence (accommodation), supply, and changes of eustatic sea level. Even here, however, sub-lithospheric mantle\ntemperatures can strongly modify the local sea level curve, as along the New Jersey coastline. Plate tectonics also has significant influencedit can directly alter eustatic sea level through changes of mid-ocean ridge volumes, or less directly, by causing global cooling, leading to expanded polar ice sheets. In sum, plate tectonic controls on eustatic sea level are simply more modulated and thus less direct than either global orogenies, polar clustering of the continents, or widespread epeirogenic, continental uplifts.\n7. Possible alternative explanations\nLet's test the above summary and explanation of Middle and Late Miocene events by exploring two alternatives.\nOne possibility is simply more rainfall in the Middle and Late Miocene e were these 11 Ma years wetter or dryer than earlier in the Tertiary? Evidence about rainfall comes from stratigraphy and regional geology. The first loess in Northwest China is dated at 22 Ma (Guo et al., 2002), in response to a rising Tibetan Plateau followed by the withdrawal of the Peri-Tethyan Ocean across Kazakhstan and neighboring countries. Desertification accelerated in the late Miocene in the Sahara, across southwest Asia. In North America, desertification started in the late Middle Miocene, and some 5 Ma later in Europe (Eronen et al., 2012). By the Late Miocene, desertification was advanced in coastal Peru and Chile and rain shadows existed in front of the Andes. During the Tertiary Australia drifted northward and in the Miocene had a climate broadly similar to that of today. Thus, with the possible exception of the brief Middle Miocene warm period, stratigraphic and landscape evidence points to a drier rather than a wetter Middle and Late Miocene climatedmaking a worldwide increase in rainfall a most unlikely cause of more Middle and Late Miocene clastics.\nIn a pioneer paper in 1990, Molnar and England suggested\nanother alternative: late Cenozoic cooling as an alternative cause of worldwide uplift and increased sediment supply. They reasoned as follows. Today's high mountains may result from lower temperatures leading to expanded mountain glaciers, stronger and wider mid-latitude storm tracks (altered jet streams), more variable humidity, and different vegetation, all causing more erosion. This would increase isostatic uplift and in turn lead to more erosion and sedimentation. A voluminous and conflicting literature has since followed as summarized by Whipple (2009) and Owen (2013). Most of these studies are of single mountain ranges. Herman et al. (2013), however, compiled 17,833 fission tracks of apatite and zircon from around the globe and clearly established an increase in sedimentation rates since 8Ma, and especially since the Pleistocene with its more widespread mountain glaciation. Thus, mountain glaciation is and was a factor in the past. But think of all the Middle and LateMiocene tectonic events reviewed aboved reorganization of the tectonics of theMiddle Miocene in thewestern United States, the consolidation of the Japanese archipelago between 16 and 14 Ma, the accelerated spreading of mid-ocean ridges in the Middle Miocene, the lava-induced subsidence of the GreenlandeIceIandeScotland gap (released cold arctic water into the world ocean), the long-term closing of the Isthmus of Panama, the marked increase in Middle Miocene volcanism in western Europe and the Mediterranean area, as well as the initial extrusion of Columbia Plateau basalts at 17 Ma. All of these are major features of the modern world, as are the uplift and faster movements of its mountainous, convergent plates. From another point of view, think of the Late Miocene uplift of the North Range of New Guinea, the Late Miocene emergence of Taiwan, or the uplift of East Africa starting at 10 Madnone of which are glaciated. It seems most improbable that isostatic uplift, driven by deep glacial erosion, could have had a comparable role. Can the climate-glacier argument be more than a small secondary enhancement?\nOne last question remainsdhow long did the inferred pulse of Middle and Late Miocene heat flow last? Dowe still have it or has it ceased? We did not explore this question, but we did finddtotally by accidentdsome research on it in the diatomaceous, offshore Neogene beds of the northeast Atlantic Ocean near the Faeroe and Shetland Islands (Davies and Cartwright, 2002). Utilizing both the temperature-dependent transition of amorphous (opal A) to crystalline (opal CT) and seismic data, they inferred higher burial temperatures (opal CT) from the base of the Middle Miocene to the top of the Late Miocene, which is separated from the early Pliocene by an unconformity. The early Pliocene beds only have opal Adin other words; during the time interval of the unconformity, heating ceased. More attention to Neogene heat flow and its relations to the Earth's surface seems most worthwhile.\nSumming up, none of the above alternatives come as close to explaining the many diverse Middle and Late Miocene events and their flood of clastics and teleconnections than globally reactivated plates. The most logical source for this needed energy is a short 11 Ma pulse of heat from the Earth's core.\n8. Conclusions\nThe two closely synchronous global Middle and Late Miocene orogenies caused many global near- and far-field teleconnections on the continents, in the oceans, and in the atmosphere in only 11 Ma. Virtually all of these global events are best explained, either directly or indirectly, by plate tectonics. The only source for increased global plate activity is an intense pulse of energyda sharp, strong burst of heat from the earth's coredtransferred upward by conduction through the D00 boundary layer into the mantle and then by plumes into the lithosphere and its plates.\nThe global teleconnections of the Miocene identified in our research make them the ideal standard for what to look for, when studying earlier basins or earlier major orogenies far back into Neoproterozoic time. Broader awareness of the teleconnections reported here is the first step toward identifying many, many more in the Earth machine.\nAlthough most practical significance is yet to come, it seems clear that in the near future many more explanations of surface geology will increasingly incorporate insights from deep earth seismic tomography. When this happens, practicality should be close at hand.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are most pleased to acknowledge the many, who have helped us over the years.

  "abstractText": "The 11 Ma Middle and Late Miocene interval forms only 2% of Phanerozoic time but includes two broadly contemporaneous global orogeniesdone reaching across southern Eurasia and the other spanning the Circumpacific. These two global orogenies caused many global events, and because they are close to us in time, causality links between these orogenies and these far scattered events aremuchmore apparent than in older orogenies. These teleconnections include establishment of the present world oceanic current system; the beginnings of oceanic cooling at 14 Ma; an increase in hemipelagic mud bordering the continents; changes in continental tilts and river systems; great biological changes; increased desertification; replacement of C3 by C4 grasses; a major shift in siliceous microfossils from the Atlantic to the Pacific at 15Ma; and first development of the earliest hominids in East Africa starting at 10Ma. In addition, spreading rates of oceanic ridges increased, volcanism increased, there was movement along many transform faults, and continental elevations increased. Short, bulleted statements set forth these near and far field events. Immediate causes were increased rates of plate motions and/or changes of directions. Only a strong, short 11 Ma pulse of heat from the Earth's core provides the logical ultimate source of this energy. Only such a pulse of heat from the core has sufficient magnitude and acts globally. Thus the deep Earth cycle is a plausible, easy-to-understand, overarching explanation that should be increasingly considered by geologists and geophysicists studying the outer crust. A flow diagram links major earth surface features on the continents to the deep earth. Alternative explanations for these events are considered and seem",
