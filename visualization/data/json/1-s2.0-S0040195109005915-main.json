The sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization, which represents a thermal event at ∼250–220 °C, developed during the early stage of basin formation between 34.71±0.16 Ma and 35.36±0.21 Ma (adularia 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages; 2σ). The termination of hydrothermal mineral deposition at Ada Tepe occurred contemporaneously with the earliest phase of calc–alkaline type magmatism at Iran Tepe (33.97±0.36 Ma to 34.62±0.46 Ma, hornblende and biotite 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages, 2σ). Thermal historymodelling of apatitefission-trackdata shows that the lowerplate rocks cooled through∼120 °C at ∼18.3±1.9 Ma (1σ). A time–temperaturemodel obtained from zircon and apatitefission-track data from the upper plate reveals that it was being buried during the late Eocene. At ∼33–30 Ma, a dramatic change of the time–temperature path was caused by the initiation of horst–graben structures, resulting in rapid exhumation of the upper plate. Our new thermochronological data reveal many aspects of the mechanisms of formation of sedimentary rockhosted gold deposits. The heat accumulatedduring sedimentary burial of theupper plate is a plausible heat source to drive hydrothermal fluid circulation and ore formation. The development of large half-graben basins in the hanging walls of detachment faults, accompanied by a favourable climate, may have created a situation that was adequate to capture aprimarymeteoricwater supply that subsequentlyunderwenthydrothermal convection.Our new 40Ar/39Ar age data indicate that magmatic activity was contemporaneous with gold deposition and must be considered as a source of heat, sulphur and/or a metal for the ore-forming hydrothermal system. Thepreservationandexhumationof sedimentary rock-hostedoredeposits is largely controlledby theexhumation history of the upper plate, which has been quantitatively constrained by low-temperature thermochronological methods, and commences with rapid exhumation at ∼33–30 Ma.\nTerre et de l'Environnement, eva, Switzerland.

    "text": "Accurate knowledge about the sources of heat that exert a major control on fluid circulation and metal solubility is a key factor to understand the formation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits (Cline et al., 2005; Oliver et al., 2006;Márton et al., 2007). Therefore, low\ntemperature, radiometric thermochronological methods can provide a unique insight into themechanismsof ore genesis in theupper crust, and can constrain the timing and duration of mineralizing processes (Chakurian et al., 2003), and also the relative roles of magmatism, metamorphism and burial as heat sources (Tosdal et al., 2003; McInnes et al., 2005; Hickey et al., 2007). Furthermore, there is increasing academic and industry interest to improve our understanding of postmineralization processes, which preserve or destroy ore deposits and their overlying rocks (Wilkinson and Kesler, 2007). Low-temperature thermochronology quantifies the cooling, and potential exhumation histories of rocks, and thereforehasuseful applications in the exploration of extensional settings (e.g. Stockli, 2005).\nIn extensional tectonic environments, several geological processes can generate and disperse heat, including metamorphism, magmatism,\nhydrothermal fluid flow, the burial of sediments or the juxtaposition of high temperature isotherms against cooler rocks, via rock uplift and exhumation (Fig. 1). The intimate and complicated relationships between theseprocesses arepoorlyunderstood. Little direct quantitative evidence (e.g. geochemical or structural data) has beenpublished,which constrains the ultimate control on the thermal histories of rocks in an extending upper crust. Consequently, adequate models have not been published from such settings that link the thermal consequences of regional tectonism with their manifestation on a local scale (e.g. an ore district). The Tertiary history of the Eastern Rhodopes, Bulgaria is a case example where different styles of extension were superimposed during rapid stretching of the upper crust, resulting in exhumation of the lower crust within metamorphic core complexes (in the sense of Lister and\nFig. 2. Plate tectonic configuration of the area around the Aegean and recent plate vectors bas (2001): (1) Rhodope Massif, (2) Olympos–Peilon Region, (3) Cyclades-Archipelago, (4) Cre\nDavis, 1989) during successive rifting phases (Bonev et al., 2006a). Poorly constrained facets in theEasternRhodopes include (i) the temporal relationships between core complex formation, magmatism, and regional metamorphism, (ii) the fundamental driving force(s) of extension, (iii) the heat sources for driving hydrothermal systems that ultimately led to the formation of gold deposits that are spatially associatedwith low-angle normal faults, and (iv) the relationships between exhumation processes and half-graben formation (Marchev et al., 2004a,b; Bonev et al., 2006a).\nThe aim of this study is to provide new insights into the Tertiary evolution of the Eastern Rhodopes, to assess the role of different thermal sources in the genesis of the sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits, and to evaluate thepossible factorswhich contributed topost-mineralization preservation, and subsequent exhumation. We present the results of\ned on Papazachos et al. (1998). Themetamorphic domes are summarized after Lips et al. te, (5) Menderes Massif, and (6) Kazdag Massif.\n40Ar/39Ar step-heating analyses of hornblende, muscovite, biotite and adularia, and zircon and apatite fission-track (ZFT andAFT, respectively) analyses from upper and lower plate rocks that have different origins (metamorphic, volcanic, sedimentary and hydrothermal). The results from each radiometric system have been integrated to construct time– temperature histories that span approximately 550 to 60 °C. These thermal history solutions provide a means to quantify the timing, magnitude and duration of heating and cooling events that occurred during theextensional tectonicevolutionof theEasternRhodopes, andestablisha plausible exhumation history. Ourmodel constrains the relative roles and impact of the above considered processes on the formation, preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits in the Eastern Rhodopes. The new model is compared to the origin of gold deposits in\nFig. 3.

    "text": "The Rhodopemetamorphic terrain is part of the Alpine–Himalayan orogenic belt within the Aegean region (southern Bulgaria and northern Greece; Figs. 2 and 3). Its Cretaceous–Recent history is linked to the convergent tectonic setting along the Eurasian plate\nlcanic centers, themain sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits (stars: Ada Tepe, Rosino, b) and Bonev et al. (2006a). A detailed cross section of the northern part of the Kesebir–\nmargin. Two major phases of deformation are distinguishable in the Rhodopes (Bonev et al., 2006a,b), which are (1) a compressional stage with south-verging thrusting and amphibolite facies metamorphism, which probably culminated during the Middle Cretaceous, and (2) syn- and post-orogenic extension that initiated during the Late Cretaceous in a back-arc setting. Deformation within the present day Aegean region is being driven by the relative motion of several microplates. The Anatolian plate (including the Aegean microplate) is currently drifting towards the SW, which is being accommodated by strike-slip and extensional faulting in the North Aegean region (Fig. 2; Jolivet andPatriat, 1999; Zhuet al. 2006). TheAegean region represents a clear example where significant continental extension is currently ongoing, which is expressed by rapid stretching of the upper crust, exhumation of the lower crust in metamorphic core complexes during successive rifting phases, and several different structural styles of extension. The metamorphic terrains of the Aegean region (Rhodope, Menderes and Kazdag Massifs, Cyclades and Crete; Fig. 2) are characterized by exposures of high-grade metamorphic rocks and granitic intrusions that were unroofed during extension, which is a process that typically follows significant crustal thickening (Lips et al., 2001). Geochronological studies demonstrate that successive thrust fronts migrated southwards from the RhodopeMassif in the Cretaceous, Cyclades and the Menderes massifs in the Eocene, Crete in theMiocene, and the currently active thrust front is located south of the Mediterranean Ridge (Jolivet and Patriat, 1999). The relative impact of individual processes such as erosion, buoyant rise, tectonic extension, brittle faultingandductileflow, on theexhumationof high-grademetamorphic rocks from the lower-middle crust to the Earth's surface, is not fully understood.\nAnalogue examples of extension during the formation of metamorphic core complexes include the Basin and Range Province of the western United States, where an extensional back-arc tectonic setting is considered to exert a first order control on the world-class, Carlin-type gold deposits (Cline et al., 2005; Embso et al., 2006). Therefore, one important objective of this contribution is to consider the factors that operate at the orogen to lithosphere scale.\nThe Eastern Rhodopes are characterized by abundant exposures of high-grade metamorphic complexes with different ages and metamorphic P–T histories, separated by tectonic contacts that formed during extensional tectonism. Themetamorphic basement consists of pre-Alpine crustal domains that experienced southward progressing crustal growth via deep level subduction–accretion, during theMesozoic–Cenozoic (Barr et al., 1998). The regional tectonic pattern of the Eastern Rhodopesmassif is dominated by the Kesebir–Kardamos and the Biala reka–Kechros, late Alpine, extensional metamorphic domes, which expose several lithotectonic units and structural elements (Fig. 3; Bonev et al., 2006a). These are, (1) Maastrichtian–Oligocene sedimentary rocks, including conglomerate and sandstone, which are either in tectonic contact with, or were transgressively deposited upon metamorphic basement rocks, (2) a variegated metamorphic complex, which mainly consists of pre-Alpine and Alpine amphibolite facies metasedimentary rocks (amphibolites, marbles, paragneisses, and schists), metaigneous rocks (gabbros and quartz–feldspatic gneisses), and remnants of a Jurassic–Early Cretaceous metaophiolitic sequence, and limestones, (3) a high-grade gneiss– migmatite complex within the core of the dome, which consists of orthogneiss, paragneiss, micaschist and amphibolite layers interlayered with sillimanite-bearing migmatites, and (4) syn-metamorphic thrust contacts or predominantly low-angle extensional detachment faults, which are related to Late Cretaceous crustal thickening and Tertiary extension. The footwall of the detachment fault consists of shear zones withamylonitic fabric,whichhavedeformed theupperpart of thegneiss– migmatite and variegated complexes. The detachment faults and shear zones separate the basement units into upper and lower structural plates. Geologic structures around the Ada Tepe deposit (Fig. 3) and adjacent prospects can generally be modelled by domino-style rotational normal faulting in the upper plate above the detachment fault (Fig. 1).\nNumerous fault-bounded half-grabens containing relatively thick Maastrichtian toMiocene sedimentary continental clastic, lacustrine and volcanoclastic deposits are an important feature of the geology of the EasternRhodopes (GoranovandAtanasov, 1992; Fig. 3). Theyare located along the hanging wall of the low-angle detachment fault, and provide sedimentary constraints on the onset and progression of crustal extension. Widespread Eocene–Oligocene volcanism developed in several areas (Fig. 3; Iran Tepe, Zvezdel, Dambalak), and was coeval with, or post-dates sedimentary basin formation (Marchev et al., 2004a). The volcanic rocks are intermediate to acid lavas, and their associated volcanoclastic products, with subordinate basic varieties, were probably depositedwithin a collisional setting (Marchev et al., 2004a). Numerous dykes of intraplate basalts intruded during the terminal stages of magmatism in the area (Marchev et al., 1998, 2007)."

    "text": "The Rhodope Massif hosts a range of small and moderately sized Pb–Zn–Ag, Cu–Mo and Au–Ag ore deposits in high-grade metamorphic, continental sedimentary and igneous rocks (Arikas and Voudouris, 1998; Marchev et al., 2005). Historically, the most significant ore deposits in the Rhodopes are Pb–Zn–Ag-dominated veins and marble replacement bodies, which are hosted by basement metamorphic rocks in the roofs of large extensional domes. Most of these deposits occur in the Bulgarian or Greek side of the Central Rhodopes, at the ore fields of Madan, Laki, Davidkovo, Thermes and Ardino, and one prospect at Popsko is hosted within the Eastern Rhodopian basement (Fig 3.). They are associated with silicic dyke swarms, and their temporal (with ages of 29–32 Ma; Marchev et al., 2005) and genetic relationships to core complex formation and acid magmatism have been demonstrated (Kaiser-Rohrmeier et al., 2004). In the EasternRhodopes, Pb–Zn–Cu–Au–Agepithermal deposits aremainly hosted by differentiated calc–alkaline, high-K calc–alkaline and shoshonitic volcanoes, which are locally associated with low-grade, porphyry Cu–Mooccurrences inmonzonitic to granitic stocks that intrude into the volcanic rocks. They variably exhibit characteristics of low-, intermediate-, and high-sulphidation deposits (Hedenquist et al., 2000), and their close temporal (∼32 Ma,Marchev et al., 2005) and genetic relationships with local magmatism have been demonstrated (Arikas and Voudouris, 1998, Marchev et al., 2005, Rice et al., 2007). Intermediate-sulphidation epithermal Pb–Zn–Cu±Ag–Au deposits are located within major Palaeogene shoshonitic to high-K calc–alkaline volcano intrusive centers of the Bulgarian Eastern Rhodopes (e.g., Spahievo in the Borovitsa complex, Zvezdel,Madjarovo; Fig. 3). High-sulphidation (enargite–gold) mineralization mainly occurs in recently discovered gold-bearing prospects in the southeastern Rhodopes, Greece (at Perama Hill and Sappes; Fig. 3; Arikas and Voudouris, 1998).\nThe Au–Ag epithermal deposits studied in this contribution represent the oldest known Tertiary mineralization event (∼35 Ma, Marchev et al., 2005) within the Eastern Rhodopes, and they have been found in the northern part of the Kesebir–Kardamos dome near the town of Krumovgrad (Ada Tepe, Surnak, Kuklitza prospects), at Rosinowithin the Biala reka–Kechros dome, and at Stremtsi, all within the volcano-sedimentary depression of the Eastern Rhodopes (Fig. 3; Marchev et al., 2004a,b; Bonev et al., 2006a; Márton et al., 2006). Apart from its unusual structural setting and lack of a clear relationship with local igneous rocks, these sedimentary rock-hosted gold prospects exhibit many features that are typical of the low sulphidation type of epithermal deposits, including banded veins of variably crystalline silica with adularia, bladed carbonates (which occur locally at Rosino and Stremtsi, but commonly at Ada Tepe), and locally visible gold in some veins, giving rise to bonanza gold grades. In other prospects, such as Surnak, Kremenitz, Skalak and parts of the Rosino and Ada Tepe deposits, boiling textures are scarce to absent, and gold is associated with arsenic-rich pyrite and marcasite ores. Márton (2009) distinguishes two main ore parageneses: a) a high-\ngrade, electrum-rich and sulphide-poor ore assemblage, associated with intense silica, adularia and carbonate alteration, which developed as a consequenceof drastic changes of thehydrothermal conditions (e.g., boiling), and b) a lower grade sulphide-rich ore assemblage, locally associated with silica, carbonate, argillic, sericite and barite alteration, which developed as a consequence of more passive fluid evolution, dominated by fluid/rock interaction processes including early phase decarbonatization and later phase sulphidation of host rock iron, subsequent to thermal refrigeration of the hydrothermal system. These two ore parageneses may overlap with each other at the prospect scale, within the same hydrothermal system, therefore resulting in a complex ore mineralogy as a consequence of repeated mineralization pulses. The deposit is typically base-metal-poor at Ada Tepe, but subsidiary galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and sulfosalts occur at Stremtsi and Rosino (Fig. 3).Metamorphic basement rocks are generally barren, although the increased permeability of connected observable structures along listric faults at oneparticular prospect (Surnak) favoured ore depositionwithin the metamorphic basement rocks.\nIn theKrumovgradarea,whichhasbeenexplored themost intensively andwhich is the focus of our study, a low-angle normal fault between the metamorphic basement and the sedimentary rocks constitutes themajor ore-controlling associated structure. The host rocks are, (1) tectonically deformed coarse grained conglomerates, which include decameter sized marble blocks (e.g. Shavar Formation), (2) fine grained sandstones intercalated with organic-rich layers, and (3) rare amphibolites. The geometry of the ore bodies reveals structural and lithological controls on mineralization. Márton (2009) presents lithological, alteration and radiogenic isotopic evidence to demonstrate that host rock composition was a primary control onfluid evolution and the development of different depositional processes. (1) Lithologies, suchasmarbles,marls andgranitic rocks provided an excellent environment to acid neutralization, which maintained a sulphide-rich fluid at near-neutral pH conditions and optimized gold transport over extended areas. (2) Amphibolites and serpentinites rich in Fe-bearing minerals and carbon-rich sandstone sequences provided adequate sites for ore deposition as a consequence of fluid de-sulphidation. (3) Lithologies with high (primary or secondary) permeability were the locus of major ore deposition processes as a consequence of boiling of the mineralizing fluids.\nHigh-grade ore vein samples from the Ada Tepe ore deposit typically contain significant amounts of rhombic adularia. XRD and microRaman studies show that the structure of adularia fromAdaTepehas a relatively disordered (sanidine-like) Al/Si distribution (Márton andMoritz, 2007). A high rate of nucleation and crystal growth under low temperatures is the most accepted explanation for the generation of metastable, highly disordered adularia, due to the decompression and boiling of fluids in hydrothermal systems (Drummond and Ohmoto, 1985; Dong and Morrison, 1995). Disordered adularia is also evidence for the absence of an important thermal overprint after its crystallization (Černý and Chapman, 1986), and therefore the absence of any extensive, high temperature, late-stage fluid circulation post-dating ore formation."

    "text": "Bonev et al. (2006b) summarize radiometric absolute ages and characterize the exhumation history for the Tertiary basement of the Eastern Rhodopes (Fig. 4). K/Ar (Krohe and Mposkos, 2002) and 40Ar/ 39Ar (Lips et al., 2000; Bonev et al., 2006a,b) cooling plateau ages of 42– 36 Ma were obtained from biotite and muscovite from the Kesebir– Kardamos dome, which provided constraints on its thermal evolution between300and350 °C (e.g. retrogrademetamorphism). This stagewas followed by cooling to 150–300 °C at 36–12Ma (Dinter et al., 1995; Lips et al., 2000). Late- to post-tectonic plutons intruded the metamorphic units between 32 and 13Ma (Del Moro et al., 1988; Jones et al., 1992; Dinter et al., 1995). All of the Eocene–Oligocene volcanic activity in the Eastern Rhodopes, including the intrusion of subvolcanic bodies and dyke swarms, occurred between 37 and 21 Ma (Marchev et al., 2004a). The Krumovgrad intraplate alkali basalts intruded into the Kesebir– Kardamos and Biala reka–Kechros domes at 28–26 Ma (Marchev et al., 1998). The oldest volcanic activity in the northern part of the Kesebir– Kardamos dome, where our study is focused, occurred at Iran Tepe (Fig. 3), which yields 40Ar/39Ar plateau ages of 33.91±0.24 to 34.69± 0.25 Ma (Kibarov, 2008; 2σ errors). These ages are comparable with a concordant zircon U–Pb age of 33.24±0.03 Ma obtained from the same volcano (Kibarov et al., 2007). The sedimentary rock-hosted epithermal mineralization at Ada Tepe and Rosino were dated at 34.99±0.23 Ma and 36.45±0.25 Ma, respectively (Marchev et al., 2004b; Bonev et al.,\ne, Eastern Rhodopes, Bulgaria (the shaded ranges indicate the age distribution including\n2006b; 2σ errors). A slightly older age was obtained for the mineralization at Stremtsi in the northern part of the Eastern Rhodopes, with a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 37.57±0.31 Ma (Noverraz et al., 2007; 2σ error). The supradetachment half-grabens arefilledwithMaastrichtian– Paleogene sedimentary rocks of the Krumovgrad Group (∼800 m thick; Goranov and Atanasov, 1992; Stoykova and Ivanov, 2006). The upper unit is interbedded with volcanic flows and volcano-sedimentary rocks (Boyanov and Goranov, 2001)."

    "text": "Wehaveutilized the apatite andzircon FT, andmulti-phase 40Ar/39Ar methods to generate thermochronological information. After a rigorous assessment of potential palaeo-heat sources (Fig. 1), the samples were mainly collected alonganorth–south traverse across thenorthernpart of the Kesebir–Kardamos core complex (Krumovgrad area; Fig. 3), where the best studied sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposit occurs at Ada Tepe, at a distance of ∼10 km from the oldest known Paleogene volcanic center at Iran Tepe (Fig. 3). For comparative reasons, two samples (denoted with the “UGRO227” prefix) were also taken from the upper plate, along the detachment fault of the Biala reka–Kechros core complex.\nMineral separates for both the 40Ar/39Ar and fission-track methods were extracted fromwhole rock specimensusing conventionalmagnetic andheavy liquidmethods (e.g. Donelick et al., 2005). A special procedure was developed to obtain high-purity adularia separates from the hydrothermal veins. The adularia occurs as 50–200 µmsize sub-rhombic crystal in the quartz–carbonate–adularia–electrum banded veins (Márton and Moritz, 2007). Sub-samples of the veins were crushed, milled and sieved to≤300 µm. The carbonates were dissolved in 1M HNO3(aq) for 10 min, and sub-sample compositions were checked by XRD. Subsequently, adularia-rich grains were hand picked and the final separate homogeneity was checked by microRaman spectroscopy. The final separates consisted of mixtures of adularia and quartz, with estimated adularia contents being between 50 and 70%. Despite this rigorous sample preparation procedure, the step-heating results (Appendix A) for sample UGAT194 show an elevated 37Ar content, which suggests that some of the ankeritic component was not fully dissolved by 1MHNO3(aq) acid, and hence remainedwithin the adularia concentrates (below the 3–5wt.% detection limit of XRD) during irradiation.\nCO2-IR laser 40Ar/39Ar incremental-heating (11–23 individual heating steps) analyses of hornblende, muscovite, biotite and adularia\nseparates were conducted on a Faraday multi-collector Argus mass spectrometer at the University of Geneva. Age plateaus were determined using the criteria of Dalrymple and Lamphere (1971). The detailed analytical procedure and the individual step-heating results are presented in Appendix A; a summary, which includes the plateau ages (with associated ±2σ standard errors), is presented in Table 1 and Fig. 4.\nAll FT analyses were performed at the University of Melbourne, Australia, using the external detector method. Apatite aliquots for AFT analysis were mounted in epoxy resin on glass slides, and ground and polished to an optical finish to expose internal grain surfaces. Themounts were etched in 5 MHNO3 for 20s at room temperature to reveal the fossil tracks on internal surfaces. Zircon grains were mounted in PFA Teflon discs, and etched 25h in a eutectic KOH–NaOH melt at 210 °C (Gleadow et al., 1976). Thermal neutron effluencewasmonitored bymeasuring the track density in muscovite plates mounted in intimate contact with Corning CN-5 standard glass (∼12.5 ppm U) for apatite, and the Corning CN-1 (∼40 ppm U) standard glass for zircon. Neutron irradiations were carried out in the Australian HIFAR Research Reactor at Lucas Heights. Following irradiation, all muscovite detectors were etched for 30min in 48% HF at room temperature to reveal induced tracks. FT ages were calculated using the zeta calibration method and standard fission-track age equation (Hurford and Green, 1983). To correct for the difference between track registration geometries of internal surfaces and the external muscovite detector, a factor of 0.5 was used (Gleadow and Lovering, 1977). The observed age spread was determined statistically using the Chi-square test, which for all analyzed apatite samples show a probability of N5% indicating that all grains counted belong to a single population of ages. Therefore all ages reported here (Table 2) are the ‘central age’ (Galbraith and Laslett, 1993),which is essentially aweightedmean age. Standard errors (expressed here at the ±1σ level) were calculated using the “conventional method” of Green (1981)."

An amphibolite (UGAT240;\nTable 2) taken from a lower structural position in the upper plate yielded an AFT age of 14.8±5.1 Ma. A majority of these apatite crystals host abundant fluid inclusions and have low U content, rendering it difficult to obtain precise FT data. A single FT age of 25.0± 1.5 Ma was obtained from gneisses in an upper plate structural position from the Biala reka–Kechros dome. The measured mean AFT lengths are N14 μm for all the presented upper plate samples (Table 2). Our FT ages are comparable with those published for apatites from different basement units of the Central Rhodopian Dome (Wüthrich et al., 2006, 2007), which range between 16.3± 3.0 Ma and 33.3±10.8 Ma (the confidence interval of the errors was not reported). Similar AFT ages from the Kesebir–Kardamos (23.9± 1.7 Ma) and Biala reka–Kechros (25.0±1.5 Ma) domes suggest that the entire Eastern Rhodopes had a coherent exhumation history during the Oligocene."

    "text": "The thermochronometers used in this study span temperature sensitivity ranges of 550–300 °C (40Ar/39Ar; adularia, muscovite, biotite and hornblende; single t–T points; McDougall and Harrison, 1999), ∼300–200 °C (ZFT; single t–T point; Tagami, 2005) and 120–60 °C (AFT; integrated thermal history; Laslett et al., 1987). The results have been integrated in time–temperature paths (Figs. 6 and 7), which permit an assessment of the cooling history of the upper and lower plates around\nthe northern part of the Kesebir–Kardamos metamorphic dome in the Eastern Rhodopes.\nCooling histories from the AFT data were obtained by inverse modelling using the annealing model of Laslett et al. (1987), and the HeFTy software package (Ketcham, 2005; Fig. 6). HeFTy is able to simultaneously derive theoretical AFT data for multiple apatite populations exhibiting different annealing characteristics in a single sample. The annealing model of Laslett et al. (1987) is calibrated against the standard Durango apatite, which has a Cl composition of 0.43 wt.%. Electronmicroprobe analyses of the apatites of our investigation yield compositions that are similar to the ones of Durango apatites, hence we consider the Laslett\ninversion modelling of AFT data obtained from UGAT239 (upper plate) and UGSU242\nack annealing model of Laslett et al.

The lack of a positive correlation between the average Cl content and AFT age for individual samples (Fig. 6, Table 2) suggests that the variation in AFT ages has been controlled by varying thermal histories, as opposed to varying annealing kinetics.\nIn our thermal history model for sample UGAT239, its depositional age is considered to be Upper Eocene because identical strata elsewhere within the deposit are mineralized, and are therefore older than 35 Ma (Figs. 6 and 7). According to our model the ZFT age represents the retrograde cooling of the sample through ∼220–280 °C, via exhumation that started at∼33–30 Ma. Based on theAFT thermal history solutions of the sample UGAT239, rapid cooling commenced at ∼30 Ma, which we interpret to be a consequence of exhumation of the upper plate (Fig. 7). Finally, our model shows that the upper plate experienced heating between ∼36Ma (sample deposition) and ∼30Ma.\nThe lower plate has experienced protracted cooling since the Late Eocene. 40Ar/39Ar muscovite ages of 36.90±0.16 Ma and 37.28± 0.19 Ma, acquired frommetamorphic rocks, are interpreted as indicating the timing of cooling of the footwall through ∼350 °C. Within this framework, the 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained from the hydrothermal mineralization at Ada Tepe reflect the heat dispersion along the detachment fault, i.e. the zone of interaction between the upper and lower plates. Based on these data, the lower plate cooled to ∼250–220 °C (formation temperature of adularia; Márton et al., 2006) between 34.71±0.16 Ma and 35.36±0.21 Ma. The AFT thermal historymodel of sample UGSU242 reveals continuous coolingof the lowerplate to∼120 °Cat∼18 Ma,which was followed by quick cooling,whichwe interpret to be a consequence of continuous exhumation (Fig. 7)."

    "heading": "4.2. Tertiary evolution of the Eastern Rhodopes",
    "text": "Continental extensional tectonism can be modelled as a continuum between two end-members (Twiss and Moores, 1992). Highly extended continental terrains constitute one end-member (“Wernick-model”; Wernicke and Burchfiel, 1982), and form in back-arc regions, where the crust has undergone dramatic thickening before extension, generally resulting in the formation of supradetachment sedimentary basins (Friedmann and Burbank, 1995; Forster and Lister, 1999). In this case, the bounding faults are commonly active at low-angle dips (or may appear with associated domino faults), and the slip rates (N2 mm/year) and bulk extension (N100%) are high. The other endmember consists of continental rift structures (“McKenzie-model”; McKenzie, 1978), which form in a more thermally equilibrated crust, with steeply dipping bounding normal faults, which join the graben– horst structures, and have low slip rates (b1 mm/year) and lowmagnitude extension (10–25%). Previous investigations (Dinter and Royden, 1993; Kruger et al., 1995; Morgan et al., 1986) show that the basins could evolve from one end-member of continental extension to the other over relatively short time-scales. In such cases, the most rapid extensional mode coincides with the earliest phase of basin evolution, which evolves to slow, less dramatic extension and results in “rift-like” basins during the later phases.\nWe suggest that in the case of the Kesebir–Kardamos dome, the switch between the two extensional tectonic end-members occurred at ∼33–30 Ma (Fig. 7), when the existing supradetachment basin was crosscut byhigh-angle faults. These structures resulted in ahorst–graben arrangement, which exerts a dominant control on the present day geomorphology of the area (Bonev et al., 2006a). The regionalmagmatic evolution of the region also supports this model: (1) volcanism was initially calc–alkaline at Iran Tepe (34–34.6 Ma; Kibarov, 2008) and Zvezdel (32–29 Ma; Marchev et al., 2004a), which is typical for highly extended terrains (Friedmann and Burbank, 1995); and (2) the younger, 28–26 Ma (Marchev et al., 1998, 2007) subvolcanic alkaline basalts exposed in the Krumovgrad region are the most primitive Paleogene magmatic rocks found in the Rhodopes, and are interpreted as revealing a transitionary magmatic system evolving towards a rift-type setting.\nThe thermal flux variations and the rate of extension might be the first order controls on the style of tectonism, which controlled the geological evolution of the Eastern Rhodopes at different stages. At an early stage, the presence of high thermal gradients and a high rate of extension resulted in a dominantly horizontal motion in the upper plate. The thermochronological data for the late Eocene show (Fig. 7) that the lower plate cooled by ∼100 °C over a period of ∼2–3 my (∼40 °C/my). At a later stage, and with much lower geothermal gradients, geometric constraints arising from continental extension dynamics, resulted inmore vertical movements. Thermochronological data from the lower plate reveal cooling of ∼60 °C, over a period of ∼5 my (∼10 °C/my) during the Early Miocene (Fig. 7).\nFig. 8 and Table 3 summarize the Eocene–Miocene tectonic evolution of the Kesebir–Kardamos core complex, based on the model presented above. A) According to the muscovite 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages, footwall exhumation and detachment faulting started at or before 38 Ma. B) A faulted half-graben basin developed prior to hydrothermal mineralization at Ada Tepe. C) Sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization (35.36±0.21 Ma to 34.71±0.16 Ma) developed during the early stage of basin formation, with high geothermal gradients and nearly continuous burial of theupper plate. D) The earliest known calc–alkaline typemagmatism at Iran Tepe (34.62±0.46 Ma to 33.97±0.36 Ma)was contemporaneouswith the termination of hydrothermalmineralization at Ada Tepe (Fig. 7). E) At ∼28–26 Ma, the Krumovgrad intraplate basaltic dikes intruded the upper crust, which immediately post-dated the onset of horst–graben tectonism at ∼33–30 Ma. This model corroborates with that of Wütrich et al. (2007), which is based on FT and (U–Th)/He age data from the Central Rhodopian Dome, where they speculate that the metamorphic core complex formed during several phases, with significant Miocene back-arc extension at ∼30–24 Ma."

    "heading": "4.3. Genetic aspects of the epithermal gold mineralization: possible heat, fluid, ligand and metal sources",
    "text": "Understanding of the origin of epithermal gold mineralization requires accurate knowledge about the source and interaction of four important components: heat, fluids, ligands and metals.\nSince the stability of metal–ligand complexes is primarily controlled by temperature and generally enhanced by elevated temperatures, it is clear that the role of heat is critical during the leaching and transport of metals by hydrothermal fluids. Moreover, many authors have discussed the significance of thermally driven fluid flow during the formation of sedimentary basin-related hydrothermal ore deposits (Oliver et al., 2006). Therefore, the application of thermal history modelling to investigate possible heat sources represents a powerful tool to develop models of ore deposition. Fluid inclusion and oxygen isotope data from ore related minerals at the Ada Tepe and Rosino deposits indicate that the temperature reached 220–250 °C during ore formation (Márton et al., 2006). The thermal history models obtained from the FT data of sample UGAT239 demonstrate (Fig. 7) that, as a consequence of burial, the sedimentary rockswereheated to temperatures higher than the total annealing temperature of fission tracks in apatite (∼120 °C for Durango apatite; Green et al., 1986) during the late stage (∼30 Ma)of half-graben formation. The generation of a relatively high temperature was partly a consequence of a high thermal flux, which is characteristic of metamorphic core complexes. In the case of the Basin and Range Province, western USA, Morrison and Anderson (1998) utilized epidote–quartz oxygen fractionation to report extremely rapid footwall refrigeration along detachment faults at an early stage of exhumation,with extremely high geothermal gradients of 82 °C over 38m. Based on the boiling conditions of low salinity and CO2-rich fluids, and the thickness of the host Shavar Formation (Goranov and Atanasov, 1992), the paleo-depth of ore formation was estimated to be a few hundredmeters at Ada Tepe (Marchev et al., 2004b). Therefore, sufficient heat to sustain an ore deposit-forming hydrothermal system could have accumulated at an early stage of basin formation, as a result of burial of the sedimentary\nrocks in an environment with high geothermal gradients, typical for metamorphic core complex exhumation. The heat may have been distributed regionally, and a thermal front progressively migrated southwards, as controlled by the southward migration of the thrust front during the Tertiary evolution of the Aegean. This may account for the slightly older 40Ar/39Ar age of 37.5±0.31 Ma obtained at the Stremtsimineralized system (Fig. 3; Noverraz et al., 2007), located to the north of the mineralization at Ada Tepe, which dates between 34.71± 0.16 Ma and 35.36±0.21 Ma (this study; Marchev et al., 2004b; Fig. 3). The close spatial relationship and the new 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained from theearliest lavaflowsof the Iran Tepe volcano (33.97±0.38 Ma, 34.62± 0.46 Ma; Fig. 3) show that some heat, with a limited local extent, could also have been supplied by incipient magmatism.\nThe thermochronological data confirm the formation of extended supradetachment basins in this part of the Eastern Rhodopes during the Eocene–Oligocene (Fig. 7). Supradetachment basins, or basins formed in highly extended terrains, have predominantly long, transverse drainage networks derived from the breakaway footwall (Friedmann and Burbank, 1995). Basin formation in the continental Rhodopes during the late Eocene temporally coincideswith a humid paratropical climate (Goranov and Atanasov, 1992; Strömberg et al., 2007), which was conducive to supplya largehydrothermal convective systemwithmeteoricwater. Fluid inclusion and stable isotope data from theAda Tepe deposit are consistent with an ore-forming fluid of dominantly meteoric origin (Márton et al., 2006). The drastic paleoclimate modification recorded in the entire Northern Hemisphere during the Eocene–Oligocene transition ∼34Ma, Premoli Silva and Jenkins, 1993) was a change from paratropical to subhumid–temperate conditions (Bowen, 2007; Zanazzi et al., 2007). Such a drastic climate transition may be responsible for the waning stage of any large hydrothermal convective system, as a consequence of decreasing regional meteoric water supply; a relationship which has also beendocumented in other epithermal ore deposits (Ebert andRye, 1997).\nSulphur isotope and ore mineralogy studies (Márton et al., 2006) suggest that, in the case of the Eastern Rhodopian sedimentary rockhosted deposits, gold was transported as a bisulphide complex. The new 40Ar/39Ar age data demonstrate that a magmatic sulphur reservoir was available at the time of gold deposition. Furthermore, the typical element association of the studied deposits, which includes Au, As, Sb and Ag, is consistent with a contemporaneous magma source (Heinrich, 2005). However, this assemblage could also have been produced by leaching metals from sedimentary rocks during extensive fluid circulation through large sedimentary basins."

    "heading": "4.4. Preservation and exhumation of the studied epithermal gold deposits",
    "text": "Ore deposits that form in the shallow crust (b5 km) are frequently obliterated by erosion and reworking, particularly if they form in environments that are being exhumed (Wilkinson and Kesler, 2007). The probability of exposure of a sub-surface ore is clearly a function of the depth atwhich it formed, and the rate atwhich it is exhumed towards the surface.\nTherefore, concealment of shallow, epithermal ore deposits by postmineralization sedimentation represents a convenient way to preserve them for a longer time. The thermal history models obtained from Ada Tepe (Fig. 6) show that ore formation was followed by continuous sedimentation until ∼33–30 Ma, which may account for the fact that they were preserved, which is unusual for shallow, Eocene ore deposits (Wilkinson and Kesler, 2007).\nBased on the time–temperature solutionof the upper plate in theAda Tepe region (Fig. 7), exhumation of these deposits suddenly startedwith the onset of horst–graben formation at ∼33–30 Ma. The steep, postmineralization normal faults played a key role during the exhumation of the deposit and they are the bounding structures of the exhumed gold deposits. Therefore, future structural mapping should focus not only on the low-angle detachment faults, which were genetically related to ore formation, but also on post-mineralization faults, which exhumed the deposits. In the present context, low-temperature thermochronological data from the upper plate could be used as an exploration tool for upper plate hosted ore deposit exploration. Favourable targets would be represented by a time–temperature history that corroborates ore emplacement depth, exhumation rate and age distribution characteristics (Fig. 9)."

    "heading": "4.5. Comparison with Carlin-type gold deposits",
    "text": "The world-class Carlin-type deposit group of the western USA is one example, which shares several similarities with the sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits from the Eastern Rhodopes. Although the latter display, in particular at the Ada Tepe prospect (Fig. 3), typical low sulfidation-type epithermal vein characteristics, including banded veins of microcrystalline silica, adularia, bladed carbonates, and visible gold, there are definitely several similarities encountered in both groups of ore deposits revealing comparable mineralizing processes in both areas, such as abundant regional de-carbonatization textures, the presence of pH-buffering host rocks with marble and marl providing adequate environments for acid neutralization and optimized gold transport over extended areas, low salinity fluid compositions, a typical Au–As–Sb–Ag association, the correlation of high gold contents with arsenic-rich pyrites in some prospects, and comparable sulphur isotopic compositions of sulphides (Cline et al., 2005; Márton et al., 2007).\nInterestingly, the Basin and Range Province hosting the Carlin-type deposits experienced an Eocene and post-Eocene tectonic evolution in many points similar to the one presented above for the Eastern Rhodopes in Bulgaria (Cline et al., 2005; Embso et al., 2006). Eocene NW–Wextension in the Basin and Range Province re-opened favourably oriented structures formed during earlier compressional events, resulting in the formation of thehalf-graben controlled Elko basin, and hosting the ore deposits of the Carlin trend and the Jerritt Canyon district. The spatial and temporal overlaps of FT annealing and the occurrence of ore deposits along the Carlin trend have been interpreted to be the far-field expression of the Eocene hydrothermal system, which resulted in the\nformation of thisworld-class gold province (Arehart andDonelick, 2006; Hickey et al., 2007). Based on the FT ages (Chakurian et al., 2003), a regional thermal event took place at 37.3±1.5 Ma and a younger, more local event occurred at 18.6±4.5 Ma. However, the area of FT annealing is much greater than the area of mineralization in the northern Carlin trend and it is at least in part likely due to very shallow meteoric water circulation, related to a shallow level igneous system that does not appear to be related to the mineralization (Cline et al., 2005).\nThus, comparable alteration and ore characteristics, and tectonic evolutions during exhumation processes in both the North American Basin and Range Province and the Bulgarian Eastern Rhodopes suggest that a similar interplay of regional factors may have been the triggers for gold deposition over large areas, including: (1) the formation of huge supradetachment sedimentary basins as a consequence of extensional tectonics, therefore providing large volumes of permeable host rocks, possiblemetal andsulphur reservoirs, andaquifers formeteoricwater; (2) the accumulation of regional thermal heat as the result of the burial of sedimentary rocks; (3) a high thermal gradient coupledwith exhumation of the lower crust; and (4) a possible presence of local magmatic fluid, sulphur, metal and/or heat sources."

    "text": "40Ar/39Ar and fission-track data have been used to quantify the thermal and exhumation history of the Eastern Rhodopes, which has permitted the genetic relationships between mineralization and extensional processes to be constrained. These results were integrated in time–temperature paths, which permit an assessment of the timing, magnitude and duration of different thermal events in relation to the ongoing extensional tectonic evolution. As a result, a quantitative framework for the Tertiary thermal and exhumation history of the\nEasternRhodopeshasbeenestablished,whichprovides constraints on the role of different processes in the formation, preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits in the Eastern Rhodopes. Heat accumulation during burial of the upper plate rocks is considered to be a plausible heat source for ore formation. The development of large halfgraben basins above the detachment faults, accompanied by a favourable climate, might have provided the primary meteoric water supply for the hydrothermal convective systems. Our new 40Ar/39Ar ages support the presence of amagmatic heat, sulphur and/or themetal reservoir contemporaneous with gold deposition. The preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits is largely controlled by the exhumation history of the upper plate, which can be quantitatively constrained by low-temperature thermochronological methods.\nTheEocene–Miocene tectonic evolutionof this area is characterizedby several distinct structural episodes. Based on 40Ar/39Ar and FT thermochronology, the lower plate experienced continuous cooling and exhumation since the Late Eocene. 40Ar/39Ar data acquired from metamorphic rocks of the lower plate show that the footwall cooled through 350 °C between 36.90±0.16 Ma and 37.28±0.19 Ma, via exhumation during detachment faulting. Sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization, which occurred at ∼250–220 °C, developed during the early stage of basin formation (34.71±0.16 Ma to 35.36±0.21 Ma). The earliest known calc–alkaline type magmatism at Iran Tepe (33.97± 0.36 Ma to 34.62±0.46Ma), and the end of the hydrothermal mineralization from Ada Tepe were contemporaneous. The AFT data show that the lower plate rocks cooled to ∼120 °C at ∼18.3±1.9 Ma. The ZFT and AFT thermal history models for the upper plate show that it was being buried duringmost of the Oligocene. A dramatic change occurred at ∼33–30Ma, with the onset of horst–graben tectonism, resulting in rapid exhumation of the upper plate, together with the incorporated gold deposits."
