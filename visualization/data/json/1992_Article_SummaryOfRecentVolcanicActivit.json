    "text": "At Etna (Italy), a SE-flank fissure eruption began near the base of the Southeast Crater on 14 December. Activity ended that day from the initial vents, but fissures propagated downslope where more vigorous lava production began the next morning. The eruption produced a substantial lava field, with flow fronts to hundreds of meters wide. By 14 January, the field extended about 6 km E from the vent, destroying numerous orchards, but stopped about 150 m from a containment barrier constructed to divert the flows. Lava extrusion continued as of 21 January, although apparently at a reduced rate."

    "text": "An earthquake swarm centered near Loihi Seamount (Hawaii) began with a sudden burst of events early 19 December, with the most vigorous activity continuing through late the next day. No seismicity was detected by late afternoon on 23 December. The swarm of more than 400 events (16 exceeding M 3.0) was located beneath the steep E flank, apparently concentrated at 10-20 km depth. Earthquake swarms have been frequent near Loihi, the youngest volcano in the Hawaiian chain, with the most recent strong seismicity reported in March 1990. An August/September 1991 Sea Beam resurvey revealed no major morphologic changes since the previous survey in 1986.\n* This information is from a worldwide network of correspondents who receive a more detailed Bulletin.

The swarm, with 3 felt shocks, was the first in the area since 20-23 August, when a similar hypocenter distribution was observed. Earthquake swarms have been frequent in the area since 1978, but seismicity has been relatively low since the July 1989 submarine eruption of Teishi Kaikyu, about 8 km NW (Bulletin o f Volcanology Vol. 51, No. 6, and Vol. 52, No. 1)."

Brief harmonic tremor and 15 volcanic earthquakes were recorded during the eruption. Seismicity then gradually decreased. Steam emission also declined, and by 12 January steam plumes were only 50-100 m high. Seismic activity had remained at background levels (<5 events/day) through the day before the eruption, and pre-emption steam emission was weak."

Acoustic waves from the explosions were heard and felt over a 15-kin radius. Seismic activity increased for 7 hours, with up to 150 explosions recorded hourly accompanied by tremor, and then declined. Vigorous explosions resumed on 13 January. During 1991, 14 eruptive episodes were documented at Pacaya, with the strongest in July and August (Bulletin o f Voleanology Vol. 54, Nos. 1 and 2). Lava extrusion onto the SW flank began on 27 October and continued as of early January."

    "text": "The press reported that hot \"lava\" began moving down the flanks of Merapi (Indonesia). There were unconfirmed descriptions of damage to plantations in one area, but officials reported no evacuations. Merapi's summit lava dome had stopped growing by mid 1990, remaining at a volume of 6.8x106 m 3 through late 1991 (Bulletin o f Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 4).\nContinuing Activity\nThe eruption that began at Westdahl (Aleutian Is.) on 29 November (Bulletin of Voleanology Vol. 54, No. 4) continued until 15 January when a significant decrease in activity was noted. The lava flow front was 7 km from the vent by 3 December, but bad weather prevented further observations. Aircraft pilots reported steam and ash plumes reaching 2-7 km altitude until 15 January, when only a small amount of steam was visible at ground level and there was no sign of a vertical plume. Light ashfall was reported 90 km NE of Westdahl on 16, 25, and 26 December. Analyses of ash samples indicated a basaltic andesite composition.\nIn Japan, steaming from Niigata-Yake-yama's summit vents had increased slightly since October, but only 1 earthquake was recorded 20 December-16 January. Steam emission has continued since late April 1987, when a small ash ejection occurred (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 49, No. 6). Larger plumes in April 1989 also included ash (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 51, No. 5). Lava extrusion continued at Unzen through early January. Talus from the domes buried their SE slopes. A new dome began to emerge in early December, reaching 370 m long, 180 m wide, and 80 m high by 7 January. The previous dome, active since 21 November (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 4), grew upward about 50 m in mid December to become the highest of the six 1991 domes. Pyroclastic flows, generated mainly by collapse of the youngest dome, advanced as much as 2.5 km SE. The seismic swarm that began beneath the dome on 24 October (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 3) was continuing as of mid January. The evacuation zone remained almost unchanged since September, with a total of 8125 evacuees, At Kirishima, the seismic swarm that began on 13 November (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 4) declined on 26 November. Seismicity remained at low levels through mid January, but weak tremor continued to be recorded. Steam began to emerge from the crater on 24 November, and steady steam emission to 100-200 m height was continuing in January. The number of explosions at Sakura-jima increased from 15 in November to 37 in December, bringing the 1991 total to 295, the highest since 474 explosions were recorded in 1985. The month's highest ash cloud rose more than 3 km (16 December), and an air shock broke a glass door. Seismicity was more vigorous than normal, with swarms recorded on 12 days during December.\nSeismic activity at Pinatubo (Philippines) has declined notably during the past few months, with 10-17 small to moderate earthquakes recorded daily. Ash emission from the caldera has not been observed for 4 months (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, Nos. 1-4), and steaming has not intensified. Lahars continue to threaten low-lying areas, and a danger zone with a radius of 10 km is still in effect. No typhoons have passed near Pinatubo since-the eruption, and most of the eruption debris remains in place.\nAt Barren Island (India), 11 secondary explosions occurred from the lava flow, first observed in mid May (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 53, No. 7) at the coast during a 2 1/2-hour visit in mid November. Since July, the active cone had grown to about 320 m elevation, and its crater was estimated at 250-300 m in diameter. Although no plume was evident from the ground, Indian Navy pilots observed fuming during a later overflight, and minor fuming was visible during fieldwork on 30 November.\nIn Papua New Guinea, Rabaurs seismicity decreased slightly, with 146 caldera earthquakes recorded in December, compared to 200 in October and 347 in November (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 4). The maximum daily count was 18, recorded on 2 November. Ulawun released only weak to moderate white vapor. A slight increase in seismicity (up to 182 low-frequency earthquakes daily) occurred in December after waning temporarily at the beginning of October. Decreased activity at Langila persisted throughout December. Continuous vapor emission was accompanied by deep rumbling, explosion noises and night glow. The daily number of low-frequency seismic events ranged from 4 to 52 in\nDecember, up from 1-28 in November. Generally low-level activity at Manam, consisting of weak white vapor emissions, was punctuated on 5 December by the eruption of a dark ash cloud that rose several hundred meters. Incandescent lava fragments were observed rolling down the SW flank, and there was light ashfall on the NW and SW sides of the island. Light ashfall also occurred on 20 and 26 December.\nThe new crater at White Island (New Zealand), formed in mid October (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 3), continuously emitted a large white ash-poor plume during fieldwork on 5-6 December. Bombs (some visibly incandescent) rarely rose above the crater rim, although bombs from recent explosions were found 500 m from the vent. Bomb compositions showed little change since 1977. Periods of intermittent low-amplitude tremor on 29 November-1 December were associated with 3 E-type (explosion) shocks, 2 accompanied by observed eruption plumes.\nAt Hudson (Chile), weak fumarolic activity was visible at several summit vents during a helicopter overflight on 21 January. Strong winds produced a continuous dense gray haze SE of the volcano. Tephra cover on the caldera glacier was estimated to exceed 10 m. Aa-like lava flows, up to 15 m wide and 1 m thick, extended 1-1.5 km down the NW-flank glacier from the rim fissure, and were partly covered by ash from the smaller, initial 8-9 August eruption (Bulletin of Voleanology Vol. 54, No. 1).\nSeismicity at Galeras (Colombia) decreased notably in December, with a decline in the number and energy of long-period events through the end of the month. Fumarole temperatures, ranging up to 411 ~ had dropped slightly since May (Bulletin of Voleanology Vol. 53, No. 7). The maximum SOz flux detected during the month was 3440 metric tons/day (t/d) (9 December), higher than in recent months, but measured rates on 5 other days did not exceed 600 t/d.\nIn Costa Rica, Arenal's SW-flank lava flow, which had been active in September and November (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 3), apparently ceased moving by 1 December after extending 1 km (to 850 m elevation). In mid to late November, a new lava flow began to advance along the levees of the older flow, reaching 1150 m elevation by 7 December. Seismic activity was at normal levels in November and early December, with a daily maximum of about 30 events, most associated with Strombolian activity. Several pyroclastic flows were observed, forming both at the active vent and by collapse at the active lava flow front. The active crater rim has continued to grow, and is now 24 m higher than the previous summit. At Iraz~i, fumaroles at the base of the main crater remained at 90 ~ through mid November. Crater lake temperature was fairly similar to previous months, while pH declined to 3.0, from 3.5 in September.\nViolent phreatic explosions were observed at Santiaguito (Guatemala), at intervals of 7-25 minutes, during fieldwork on 4 January. The explosions produced steam clouds 800-2500 m high, with minor ash, and ejected small blocks onto the E flank. Sporadic spalling of large blocks (to 2 m in size) from the dome's E and S flanks indicated that the lava dome was growing. One small avalanche of rubble produced an apparent small pyroclastic surge that reached the S foot of the dome. Seared vegetation suggested that larger pyroclastic surges had recently occurred.\nAt Kilauea (Hawaii), lava production continued as of early January from the East rift zone's Kupaianaha vent, but at steadily declining rates. Lava breakouts occurred from the main tube system. Renewed activity in Pu'u O'o vent, 3 km uprift, was first observed on 4 December, following a temporary halt associated with the 8 November fissure eruption (episode 49; Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, Nos. 3 and 4). Activity increased through December, although it was not as vigorous as in September and October. Lava from 2 vents resurfaced the crater floor with fresh pahoehoe. Low-amplitude volcanic tremor continued, and an earthquake swarm occurred 7-17 December in the upper East rift zone, 25.5 km from the summit.\nReceived March 16, 1992\nDecember\nA dramatic change in volcanic and seismic activity at Deception Island (Antarctica) followed a M 3.2 earthquake on 14 January 1991 (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 53, No. 7). During December 1991-February 1992 fieldwork, 3 large earthquakes (to M 3.5), many microseismic swarms (to 100 microearthquakes/day), long periods (up to 3 hours) of volcanic tremor, new fumarole fields, increased fumarole temperatures, and visible uplift were observed. The scientific team was partially evacuated on 19 January. Geologists noted that the increased activity may have been related to a magmatic intrusion. Deception Island's last documented eruption, in 1970, produced 5 maar-like submarine craters and 7 land vents along an arcuate zone about 5 km long, and built about 1.5 km z of new land. Seismic data suggested that an eruption occurred in September 1972 and a plume was seen on a July 1987 satellite image (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 49, No. 6, and Vol. 50, No. 3), but neither could be confirmed by ground observations."

    "text": "Rockfalls were first visible at Merapi (Indonesia) confirming the start of quiet dome extrusion. Rockfall seismicity had begun in late December and increased through mid January, but clouds blocked views of the summit. Small block-and-ash flows, generated by collapse of parts of the new dome, travelled down the SW flank. Merapi's summit dome, intermittently active since the 1970's, had apparently stopped growing by mid 1990, and seismicity was described as moderate in mid December 1991.\n25 January\nTaal, which fills the 15 x 22 km caldera. According to press reports, the temperature of the 1.0 x 1.4 km crater lake (on the island formed by the active cone) increased by several degrees, and a bulge and several fissures (up to 400 m long) formed on the volcano's N flank. The island was ordered evacuated by authorities, and more than 2600 of its 6000 residents had left by 16 February. Seismicity quickly decreased on 15 February, and only 14 earthquakes were recorded during a 13-hour period on 16 February. Similar increased activity occurred in March-April 1991, although no inflation was observed (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 53, No. 6)."

    "text": "At Kilauea (Hawaii), a new 100-m fissure extended uprift from the lower flank of Pu 'u O 'o 1/2 hour after the onset of a 2-hour burst of increased tremor. Low (3-5 m high) lava fountains fed small flows that moved N and ponded near the base of Pu 'u O'o. The fissure episode was preceded by a decrease in the rate of lava production from Kupaianaha vent (3 km downrift) during January, with flows gradually becoming more viscous, and then stopping by 11 February. Two lava ponds were also active at Pu 'u O'o in January, with several overflow and drainback episodes. A swarm of intermediate-depth long-period seismic events was recorded 20- 24 January, followed by a shallow seismic swarm in the SE part of the caldera and uppermost East rift zone that began on 24 January and lasted several days."

    "text": "An \"alert\" was declared at Sabancaya (Pertl) by the Instituto Geofisico del Peril and Civil Defense officials, following increased activity at the volcano. Gas and ash from the 4.5-kin-high plume had reportedly caused respiratory problems and covered homes and crops during the previous several months, prompting people to evacuate several towns within a 14-km radius of the volcano. The press also reported that several small streams of \"lava\" had moved downslope during the previous few days. Seismicity at the volcano had increased to as many as 50 recorded earthquakes daily. Vulcanian activity has continued at varying intensity (ash clouds 2-7 km high) since the start of the eruption in late May 1990 (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 52, Nos. 6-7), prompting several evacuations.\nAt Kliuchevskoi (Kamchatka), distinct, single explosions produced ash columns rising 1000 m on 25-26 January. A 29 January Space Shuttle photograph showed a steam plume rising from the apparently ash-covered summit region. Earthquake swarms had been recorded in the vicinity of the volcano since the beginning of January. Several small ash emissions were reported in 1991 (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 53, Nos. 6 and 8)."

    "text": "A sudden increase in seismicity at Taal (Philippines) reached a peak of 385 high-frequency earthquakes during an 18-hour period 14-15 February. Many were felt in towns near the shores of Lake\nContinuing Activity\nLava extrusion continued at Nyamuragira (Zaire) as of 27 November. The eruption, which began on 20 September (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, Nos. 2-3), was confined during its first 2 weeks to a fissure about 500 m long, with fountaining at the S end. By 24 November, the fissure had propagated about 3 km northward and had formed 7 cones. Lava emission continued intermittently at one cone, with ejecta thrown to 240 m height. The 2 main cinder cones were about 60-80 m high, with basal diameters of 300-350 m . \\\nThe SE-flank fissure eruption at Etna (Italy) that began on 14 December (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 5) was continuing as of early February. No notable decrease was observed in the rate of effusion, but explosive activity had declined to sporadic ejection of lava fragments. Lava was carried in tubes onto the 6 km 2 lava field. Lava volume was estimated at 55-60x 106 m 3, with flows extending a maximum of 6 km. Seisimicity has declined to isolated weak events.\nThe eruption at Westdahl (Alaska) appeared to have stopped, following a significant decrease in eruption intensity on 15 January (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 5). Although poor weather limited visibility during a 23 January overflight, the lava field appeared to have widened to cover 2-3 times its 3 December\narea, while its front had not advanced significantly. Only scattered steaming from the flow was observed during a 13 February overflight, while minor steaming occurred from a small cinder cone near the intersection of the fissure vent and the E part of the summit glacier.\nIn Japan, lava dome growth continued at Unzen through early February, but was mainly endogenous. Pyroclastic flows were generated by collapse from the edges of dome 5 (formed in late November) and 6 (appeared 3 December; Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, Nos. 4-5). Two blocks on the front of dome 6 (estimated block volume, 3-5 • 105 m 3) collapsed on 2 February, forming a larger-than normal pyroclastic flow that travelled an estimated 3 km. A second large series of pyroclastic flows, lasting about 30 minutes, developed on 12 February when a pile of blocks (about 5 • 105 m 3) collapsed on the S margin of dome 6. Rockfall talus from domes 5 and 6 continued to bury the SE slope of the dome complex. At Kirishima, steam emission began on 24 November (Bulletin of Voleanology Vol. 54, No. 4) and continued in January, reaching 200-400 m height. Fieldwork 28-29 January revealed a trace of ash covering half of the crater floor, but no associated changes in seismicity were recorded. The number of earthquakes declined but weak tremor continued. At Sakura-jima, 60 explosions were recorded in January, up from 37 in December, marking the highest monthly total since December 1985. The month's highest ash cloud rose more than 2500 m. Lapilli cracked a car windshield during one explosion. Seismicity was higher than usual, with earthquake swarms recorded on 8 days.\nThe 1991 cone at Barren Island (India) had enlarged considerably by 15 November, burying the pre-existing central cone. Gas emerged from rootless vents on the several-meter-thick covering of ash atop the still-hot lava flow in December and January. The height of the central cone had declined from 305 m elevation to 225 m, but its diameter had increased from a pre-1991 60 m to about 200 m. Two cinder cones about 15-20 m high had developed in the W part of the lava field, about 100 m and 130 m W of the main cone, respectively.\nIn Papua New Guinea, Manam emitted thin-to-dense ash clouds during mid and late January, causing ashfall on the SE side of the island. Incandescent projectiles were observed, rising 80- 120 m, on 30 January, the first since October 1991 (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 3). Seismic activity was at low-moderate levels with 100-500 low-frequency events daily. At Langila, white to gray ash and vapor emission was punctuated on 21 January by dark ash-laden clouds rising several hundred meters. Light ashfalls occurred on the SE side of the volcano. Rumbling, explosion sounds, and night glow were reported throughout the month. Ulawun's seismic activity was at low levels in January, after a slight increase in December. The volcano released a moderate white va-\npor plume. Seismicity at Rabaul continued to decrease in January, with a monthly total of 75 small-magnitude caldera earthquakes (compared to 146 in December, and 347 in November). Levelling measurements on 19 January showed only minor uplift. At Bagana, activity remained similar to mid 1990 (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 53, No. 1), with emission of a brownish-white plume and extrusion of sluggish lava into the summit crater and onto the flanks. On 14 January, a part of the summit lava dome collapsed onto the SE flank of the volcano, and initiated a new lava channel. Minor collapses of the dome occasionally reached the SW flank, and possibly other parts of the volcano.\nIn Colombia, gas emission at Galeras was punctuated by sporadic fine ash emission, a decrease from the intense degassing and almost continuous ash emission in September-November 1991 (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, Nos. 1-4). No lava dome growth has been reported since mid November 1991, and SO2 flux was at low levels. Seismicity stabilized in January, at levels somewhat higher than those recorded before the October-November 1991 peak. Electronic tilt measurements showed slight deflation in January, ending a trend of inflation measured since September 1990. At Ruiz, weak steam emission continued in January, producing a plume 800 m high. Seismieity peaked with a small swarm of high-frequency earthquakes on 2 January. Deformation measurements showed no signifcant changes.\nIn Costa Rica, fumaroles at Turrialba were at 89 ~ in January; temperatures have been similar since 1982 (Bulletin of Voleanology Vol. 53, No. 2). At Irazd, the crater lake level fell in January, following a rise of 1 m associated with heavy rains at the end of November. Although fumarolic activity continued unchanged along the northern edge of the lake, subaqueous fumaroles disappeared in the lake's NE and SW parts in December. Vegetation was damaged on the S flank, probably due to acid rain and cold weather. Pods's crater lake water level rose 3 m in November-December, before dropping 1.2 m in January. Large gas clouds rose from the lake and were carried SW-W. Phreatic explosions were last seen in November (Bulletin of Volcanology Vol. 54, No. 4). Temperatures of the lake water and dome fumaroles remained similar to prior months. A total of 4343 low-frequency earthquakes was recorded, with no high-frequency events or tremor episodes. At Arenal, lava emission and Strombolian explosions continued in January. A SW-flank lava flow reached 1000 m elevation, and a second flow was visible high on the NNW flank in January. Explosions decreased in number and magnitude near the end of January. White clouds associated with ash emissions rose > 1 km and were carried NW, W, and SW. Seismicity in January declined to 50% of December levels. Tremor became more frequent, with continuous episodes of more than 24 hours.\nReceived April 8, 1992"

Similar deformation reversals have been associated with the 8 other episodes of heating and minor phreatic activity since 1985, most recently in January 1990 (Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 52, No. 4)."

Ashfall was reported 50 km away, on the North Island coast, but only a thin layer of new ash was found on White Island\nduring fieldwork 5 days later. Geologists suggested that the explosion may have been caused by collapse of the conduit wall onto the top of the magma column at considerable depth. This changed activity from the \"open vent\" Strombolian eruptions of scoriaceous bombs observed through early January to the \"closed vent\" phreatomagmatic eruptions of lithic-rich, dominantly ash-sized tephra seen after 17 January. Explosive activity and vigorous gas emission have been frequent at White Island since 1976.\n12February\nGreenish water discoloration extending 1-5 km from MinamiHiyoshi Seamount (Volcano Is.) was seen from aircraft on 5 occasions through early March. Japan Maritime Safety Agency overflights are conducted nearly every month in the Izu and Volcano Islands, but no activity has been evident at Minami-Hiyoshi since bubbling, spouting, and discolored water were occasionally sighted in the mid to late 1970s.\n17 February\nMore than 300 small, high-frequency earthquakes, were recorded in the Coso Mountains geothermal area (California) during an apparently tectonic swarm that peaked on 20 February and had declined substantially by 26 February. Most events were at 3-5 km depth in a N-NW-trending zone about 3 km long. Eight shocks exceeded M 3.0; the largest, M 4.0, occurred on 19 February. The focal mechanism of the largest event was mainly strike-slip with a small normal component. Swarms have occurred in the past, as in 1982, when thousands of earthquakes were recorded, to M 4.9.

Seismicity was quiet 13 March, but 42 events were detected 4 March, and 39 more before noon the next day, many on both the near-summit station and another station 7.5 km away. The swarm included some landslide events, and a dozen landslides were seen on the cone's W flank in 3 1/4 hours of observations on 5 March. Precursors of the 1991 lava dome extrusion were similar, but the 1992 activity had declined to near background by 10 March.\nContinuing Activity\nIn Indonesia, increased seismicity at Merapi (Java) preceded extrusion of a new summit lava dome. A- and B-type earthquakes began in mid December, and the number of recorded rockfall events grew from a few per week at the end of December to almost 50 between 13 and 19 January. Lava production remained unconfirmed until improved visibility revealed glowing rockfalls on 20 January. Rockfalls were traveling 1500 m from the summit by 31 January, and during fieldwork that day a new lava dome was seen covering the NW part of the 1984 dome. Avalanche-generated pyroclastic flows began on 31 January, and were most vigorous on 2 February when 33 were observed in a 10-hour period, reaching 4 km from the summit. Residents were warned to be ready to leave the area, but pyroclastic-flow activity declined, with none detected after 2 March, and the alert level was reduced. The lava dome continued to grow as of mid March, feeding nearly continuous glowing rockfalls.\nAt Awu (Sangihe Is.), crater lake pH had dropped to 3 when measured on 4 March, from a value of about 5 the previous month. Lake volume appeared unchanged at about 600,000 m 3. Surface activity was limited to a thin white vapor plume, and\nmaximum fumarole temperatures were about 100~ Little seismicity was evident. Awu last erupted in 1966, when powerful explosions ejected the lava dome and crater lake, and pyroclastic flows advanced about 5 km down the flanks, killing 39 people. The number of deep volcanic earthquakes at Gamalama (Ternate I.) increased from 91 the first week in March to 159 the following week, associated with a smaller increase in shallow seismicity. No surface changes were reported. More than 65 eruptions from Gamalama have been reported since 1538, most recently on 15 June 1991, when a pair of explosions ejected mainly white clouds (Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 54, No. 1).\nPapua New Guinea's Manam ejected ash from its Southern Crater in February. Ash occasionally fell at the coast, 4-5 km from the summit. Incandescent lava was visible on 29 February. The eruption has continued since 1974. Tephra from Langila's two active craters occasionally fell on the flanks, and glow was seen on clear nights. A large explosion on 11 February produced a cloud 1 km high. Langila's eruption began in 1973. Seismicity at Rabaul increased slightly in February, with a swarm on 22 February and a series of small discrete events on 29 February producing the highest dally earthquake totals. Only minor deformation was detected.\nSeismicity and crater lake temperatures at Taal (Philippines) declined after the earthquake swarm, deformation, and temperature increase of 14-15 February (Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 54, No. 5). Most residents of Taal Island have returned home. Steam emission continued from a linear trend of fumaroles along the south edge of Pinatubo's 1991 caldera floor. Occasional episodes of more vigorous steaming have been observed, one of which was associated with a seismic event, but no ash emissions have been confirmed. Rains triggered small lahars in surrounding valleys.\nSummit lava dome growth continued at Unzen (Japan) at a rate (about 3 x 105 m3/day) that has remained nearly constant since June 1991. Partial dome collapse generated frequent pyroclastic flows, including two on 12 February that had seismically recorded durations of about 5 minutes, the longest since 15 September. Heavy rainfall on 1 March triggered a large debris flow along the east flank's Mizunashi River, the route taken by another large debris flow on 30 June 1991 (Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 53, No. 8). The 1 March flow approached to within 100 m of the coast, 8 km east of the summit, crossed two highways, and buried a 200-m section of the Shimabara Railway. Seismicity remained vigorous through February, but declined somewhat in early March. Steam emission resumed in late November at Kirishima (Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 54, No. 4) and continued steadily through February. A fine dusting of ash was seen near the fumaroles during overflights in early to mid February. The number of explosions at Sakura-jima, active since 1955, declined from a 6-year high of 60 in January to 16 in February. Lapilli cracked car windshields on 1 and 2 February. Seismicity was higher than normal, with frequent earthquake swarms.\nLava production continued from the episode-50 fissure at Kilauea (Hawaii), active since 17 February (Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 54, No. 5). Lava ponded north of the fissure, on Pu'u O'o 's lower west flank, and overflows built levees around the ponded area. The small lava lake in Pu'u O'o crater dropped about 40 m as episode 50 began, but had risen about 15 m two days later. A thick crust formed over the lava lake by 28 February, before gas-piston activity resumed at the beginning of March. Seismicity and summit deflation on 3 March marked a magmatic intrusion into the upper East rift zone, 4-6 km from the caldera rim. Small cracks developed over the intrusion, but no eruption occurred. Activity from the episode-50 fissure stopped almost immediately and the area remained quiet until 7 March, when a 1-hour burst of seismicity was noted on a nearby instrument. Lava emerged from a new fissure near the episode-50 vents, while the level of lava rose in Pu'u O'o crater. Episode-51 eruptive activity continued intermittently through mid March, forming another ponded area from which most lava moved south as channelized aa and slabby pahoehoe.\nIn Costa Rica, fumarolic activity continued at Turrialba, at temperatures similar to those measured since 1982. Eruptions were\nfrequent at Turrialba in the 18th and 19th centuries, but vegetation has covered most of the cone since the ashfall and pyroclastic surges of 1864-66. Fumaroles remained active in and around the crater lake at Iraz~i through February. More than 200 earthquakes were recorded during the month at a station 5 km from the crater. Geodetic lines across the summit had contracted slightly since October. Gas emission persisted from the crater lake at Pods, accompanied by an average of more than 200 earthquakes per day. Little deformation was detected. Eruptions have been frequent at Po~s throughout historic time, periodically ejecting its lake. Extrusion of a pair of blocky lava flows continued through February at Arenal, active since 1968. Gravitational collapse at the front of the west-flank lava on 24 February triggered block-and-ash flows. Strombolian explosions were smaller and less frequent in February than in previous months. An average of 10 volcanic earthquakes were recorded daily. Tremor increases on 6, 7, and 21-25 February coincided with increased lava output and strong gas emission. Vigorous fumarolic activity continued within and near the crater lake at Rincdn de la Vieja. Concentric and radial fissures had formed on the flanks, probably from partial collapse of the crater walls. Sporadic phreatic eruptions occurred in mid 1991, most recently in August.\nOccasional emissions of fine ash at Galeras (Colombia), sometimes associated with long-period earthquakes or variations in tremor, punctuated continuous gas emission in February. Seismicity\nhas remained relatively steady since the increased activity that accompanied lava dome growth in October-November 1991 (Bulletin of Volcanology, Vol. 54, No. 3 and No. 4).\nSeveral hundred earthquakes and several hours of tremor were recorded daily during mid-January fieldwork at Llaima (Chile). Seismicity had been slightly less vigorous during the previous measurements 12 months earlier. More than 30 eruptions have been reported from Llaima since its first historic activity in 1640. During the most recent event, in February 1990, ejection of incandescent material followed a small explosion from the main crater.\nVisits to the summit of Ol Doinyo Lengai (Tanzania) in late 1991 revealed very young carbonatite lava flows on the crater floor, where small-scale lava production has continued since explosive activity in early 1983.\nEtna's (Italy) SE-flank fissure eruption was continuing in early March, but was less vigorous than in previous months. Hawaiitic lava from fissure vents moved through tubes, then emerged onto the lower part of the flow field, feeding short lobes that did not advance beyond the eruption's longest flow, about 6.5 km from the eruptive fissure. This flow had stopped a few tens of meters from a barrier erected in early January to protect east-flank towns and property. Geologists from Italy's Gruppo Nazionale per la Vulcanologia also documented changes in seismicity, deformation, gravity, magnetics, self-potential, and gases associated with the eruption."

  "abstractText": "At Etna (Italy), a SE-flank fissure eruption began near the base of the Southeast Crater on 14 December. Activity ended that day from the initial vents, but fissures propagated downslope where more vigorous lava production began the next morning. The eruption produced a substantial lava field, with flow fronts to hundreds of meters wide. By 14 January, the field extended about 6 km E from the vent, destroying numerous orchards, but stopped about 150 m from a containment barrier constructed to divert the flows. Lava extrusion continued as of 21 January, although apparently at a reduced rate.",
