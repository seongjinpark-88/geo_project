    "text": "The Deccan Trap continental flood basalt eruptions of India occurred c. 67–63 Ma, thus spanning the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (65 Ma). Deccan eruptions were coeval with an interval of profound global environmental and climatic changes and widespread extinctions, and this timing has sparked controversy regarding the relative influence of Deccan volcanism upon endCretaceous catastrophic events. If Deccan Trap activity was capable of affecting global ecosystems, evidence should be present in proximal Indian sedimentary facies and their palaeontological contents. The impact of late stage Deccan volcanism upon biota inhabiting Mumbai (Bombay) Island’s post K–T boundary lagoonal systems is documented here. Sediments (or bintertrappeansQ) which accumulated within these lagoons are preserved between Trap lavas that characterise the closing stages of this flood basalt episode.\nMumbai Island Formation intertrappean faunal and floral communities are conspicuously distinct from those common to many pre K–T boundary, late Maastrichtian intertrappeans across the Deccan province. The latter sedimentary intercalations mostly developed in cognate semiarid, palustrine ecosystems; by contrast, those around Mumbai evolved in sheltered, peripheral marine settings, within subsiding continental margin basins unique to this late Deccan stage, and under an increasingly humid Danian climate. Geochemical analyses reveal that Mumbai sedimentation and diagenesis were intimately related to local explosive volcanic and regional intrusive activity at c. 65–63 Ma. Although tectonic and igneous events imprinted their signatures throughout these sedimentary formations, organisms usually sensitive to environmental perturbations, including frogs and turtles, thrived. Critically, palynofacies data demonstrate that, whilst plant material deposition was responsive to environmental shifts, there were no palpable declines in floral productivity following Mumbai pyroclastic discharges. Therefore, it is implausible that this late stage explosive volcanism influenced major ecosystem collapses globally. D 2004 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Continental flood basalt provinces are laterally extensive lava accumulations of substantial thickness and low topographic relief (Rampino and Stothers, 1988). India’s dominantly tholeiitic Deccan Trap flood basalt province presently extends across approximately one sixth of the subcontinent, encompassing up to 106 km2 of its western portion (Deshmukh, 1982; Fig. 1). The basalts include Traps downfaulted into the Arabian Sea west of Mumbai (Bombay) and forming part of the Seychelles microcontinent (Tandon, 2002; Devey and Stephens, 1991), and possibly originally occupied a volume of up to 106 km3 prior to their erosion (Courtillot et al., 1986).\nThe duration of the whole Deccan volcanic episode remains a polemic issue, and advocates exist for both a brief (b1 m.yrs., e.g., Duncan and Pyle, 1988; Hofmann et al., 2000) and extended (e.g., Widdowson et al., 2000; Sheth et al., 2001a) period of activity. This theme is particularly pertinent when assessing the effects of flood basalt volcanism upon local, regional and even global ecosystems. A rapid\nFig. 1. Present-day Deccan Trap outcrop extent. Major\nemplacement of an entire flood basalt province would theoretically prove more detrimental than a series of events separated by protracted dormant intermissions. Proof of quiescent phases exists in the form of sedimentary sequences that accrued between the Traps. Subsequent extrusives often preserved these bintertrappeansQ, and evidence can be sought within them regarding the influence of volcanism upon sedimentary systems, microclimates and biota.\nBecause substances released during mafic eruptions are less likely to reach potentially damaging stratospheric levels than those expelled by felsic volcanism, the effects of late stage, increasingly felsic, explosive Mumbai volcanism are of interest. Controversially, a study of massive, well-constrained pyroclastic events (Erwin and Vogel, 1992) found that these did not reduce the ecological diversities of land and marine ecosystems on regional or global scales, and hence were unlikely to be responsible for mass extinctions. A bolide impacting Mexico’s Chicxulub platform (Hildebrand et al., 1991) is broadly accepted to have exacerbated, if not singularly forced, end Maastrichtian extinctions across the\ntectonic structures redrawn from Biswas (1991).\nplanet (e.g., Pope et al., 1994; Sweet et al., 1999; Vajda et al., 2001).\nThe literature review we offer draws together c. 100 years of disparate observations, with the benefit of a much improved chronostratigraphic framework, and represents the most comprehensive overview yet produced on Mumbai sequences. Data presented here are placed within this context, to illustrate the ecology of a Deccan volcanic region towards the close of this flood basalt episode. This is one of the\nFig. 2. Mumbai District, including localities visited, a\nfirst attempts to evaluate ecosystems within a flood basalt succession using an integrated palaeobotanical, geochemical, geochronological and sedimentological approach.\nA similar study was conducted for central India’s Jabalpur region, near the Narmada–Tapti rift zone, and the Nagpur area to the south, by Tandon (2002; Fig. 1). Tandon’s article described the environmental changes leading up to the onset of local Trap emplacement that are recorded in central Indian\ndapted from Subbarao and Sukheswala (1979).\nJogeshwari Bom 1/98 Fairly coarse, carbonate-rich Jogeshwari Bom 2/98 Dark, carbon-rich, laminated Jogeshwari Bom 3/98 Coarse, pale and dark laminations Jogeshwari Bom 4/98 Thick, carbon-rich,\nburrows, pyrite\nJogeshwari Bom 5/98 Rippled silt Jogeshwari Bom 6/98 Predominantly coarse Jogeshwari Bom 7/98 Tuff Jogeshwari Bom 8/98 Fissile, laminated Jogeshwari Bom 9/98 Tuff/calcareous mix Jogeshwari Bom 10/98 Dark, carbon-rich Jogeshwari Bom 11/98 Coarse, plainly bedded Jogeshwari Bom 12/98 Dark shale and pale,\ncoarser sediment interlaminated\nJogeshwari Bom 13/98 Dark shale Jogeshwari Bom 15/98 From bdoggerQ layer with calcite veins Jogeshwari Bom 16/98 Ash containing small white flecks Jogeshwari Bom 17/98 Light olive-grey silt Jogeshwari Bom 18 /98 Trap basalt (top of section) Jogeshwari Bom 19/98 Rippled, dark grey silt Jogeshwari Bom 20/98 Finely laminated very\ndark grey silt\nJogeshwari Bom 22/98 Float crustacean claw Jogeshwari Bom 23/98 Fragments from coarse bed,\npossible tuff\nJogeshwari Bom 1/99 Phlogopite-rich, ?rhyolitic tuff Jogeshwari Bom 2/99 Slatey layers, flat-bedded,\nv.dark, ?organic-rich\nJogeshwari Bom 3/99 Volcanic bombs Worli tunnel Wo 2001 2001 m west from shaft,\norganic-rich shale\nWorli tunnel Wo 2100 2100 m west from shaft,\norganic-rich shale\nWorli tunnel Wo 2210a 2210 m west from shaft,\norganic-rich shale\nWorli tunnel Wo 2210b 2210 m west from shaft,\norganic-rich shale\nWorli tunnel Wo 2600 2600 m west from shaft,\norganic-rich shale\nWorli tunnel Wo 2610 2610 m west from shaft,\norganic-rich shale\nWorli tunnel Wo 2735 2735 m west from shaft,\norganic-rich shale\nLameta Formation sediments. Here, topographic adjustments caused fluvial currents to redirect, and periodically submerged terrain to became increasingly subaerial. Although this dynamic landscape was influenced by regional volcanic activity, it was exploited by sauropod dinosaurs prior to the first local lava incursion (Tandon, 2002).\nThe Mumbai peninsula is investigated by the present authors. Originally a series of islands (e.g., Bombay Island, Salsette Island), the landmass projects southwards into the Arabian Sea at c. 198 north (Fig. 2). Three intertrappean sections on the western side of the peninsula were investigated: an outcrop at Amboli quarry in Jogeshwari, and two tunnel cuttings excavated seawards from the coast, just south of Worli and near Bandra (Fig. 2). Both tunnels extend westward into the Arabian Sea, and samples were extracted along them between 2001 and 3408 m in the Worli tunnel, and 1890 and 3740 m in the Bandra tunnel (Table 1). Since completing fieldwork, the Amboli section has been demolished for housing construction. This work provides a graphic log and field summary of the lost section. A brief description of Amboli, Worli and Bandra lithologies is given in Table 1."

    "text": "The Mumbai and Salsette Islands landmass comprises a linear depression bounded by easterly and westerly ridges (Sukheswala, 1956). Muddy sediments deposited in the central lowland dip 12–158 west, and lavas up to 258 west (Sheth et al., 2001a). A separate classification to the Deccan chemostratigraphy, established in the Western Ghats and now\ncovering much of the main Deccan province (MDP), exists for the distinct geochemistries of Mumbai intrusives and extrusives (Sethna, 1999; Table 2). The Amboli (Bom), Worli (Wo) and Bandra (B) intertrappean shale sections detailed here occur within the Mumbai Island Formation, the lowermost of the Salsette Subgroup (Table 3). Sethna (1999) placed this above the highest of the MDP, the Wai Subgroup. According to him, Worli intertrappeans occur stratigraphically above the Malabar Hill flow (Fig. 3). Sethna (1999) estimated this shale’s thickness at c. 150 m, interrupted only by a 10-m tuffaceous breccia (hyaloclastite) horizon, and a 5-m basaltic layer. The nearby Bandra tunnel also runs through this sedimentary unit, and the onshore Amboli section possibly represents a lateral equivalent.\nPandey and Agrawal (2000) detected several sedimentary basins offshore of Mumbai and in adjacent western Indian offshore areas, retaining India’s largest hydrocarbon reserves (Gombos et al., 1995). Stratified intertrappeans in quarries around Jogeshwari (Fig. 2) have been intruded by a columnar jointed tholeiitic lopolith (Subbarao and Sukheswala, 1979) and are conformably overlain by a basaltic lava flow. The position of Jogeshwari exposures within the regional stratigraphy, and possible provincial north– south correlations, are given in Fig. 4.\nData compiled from: (1) Cox and Hawkesworth (1984), (2) Cox and Hawkesworth (1985), (3) Beane et al. (1986) and (4) Sethna (1999). Initial Salsette Subgroup eruptions were coeval with Mahabaleshwar-Desur Formations of the Wai Subgroup.\nMagnetostratigraphical correlations between Mumbai flows and the MDP volcanic pile have been attempted. Vandamme et al. (1991) and Vandamme and Courtillot (1992) detected a reversed-normal boundary obscured by a secondary palaeomagnetic component in some localities. These authors established that the changeover occurred at much lower altitudes than the typical 600-m elevation observed elsewhere in the Deccan (e.g., Western Ghats), and interpreted the Mumbai boundary to possibly represent a later, younger magnetic reversal."

    "heading": "2.2. Age",
    "text": "An early Tertiary age was first assigned to uppermost Mumbai intertrappeans by Blanford (1867), and an inferred close affinity of Mumbai intertrappean biota with modern forms led Sukheswala (1956) to support this. However, Singh and Sahni (1996) found that several Mumbai taxa additionally occurred in intertrappeans as divergent as Kutch (Gujarat), Jabalpur (Madhya Pradesh), Nagpur (Maharashtra), Gurmatkal and Marepalli (Andhra Pradesh; Fig. 1), indicating correlations between all these sections. Mumbai ostracod assemblages were observed to have affinities with late Cretaceous and Palaeocene forms. The authors ultimately ascribed a Maastrichtian date, attributing contrasts between Mumbai and other Deccan facies to environment rather than age differences.\nHighly accurate radiometric dates of Mumbai extrusives recently obtained (e.g., Table 4) are closely comparable with those received for late stage MDP feeder dykes (Widdowson et al., 2000). Sheth et al. (2001a) argued that Mumbai volcanism continued for\nz1 m.yrs. Hence, it strongly appears that Salsette Subgroup igneous activity was coeval with terminal Wai Subgroup eruptions along the Western Ghats, although the flow-types are not geochemically related. By this closing stage, the most intense and voluminous MDP lava formations had already erupted (Table 2). Locally restricted Mumbai Island magmatism directly proceeded the major K–T boundary global\nFig. 4. Possible correlation of Mu\nextinctions, and represents the final throes of the Deccan flood basalt episode."

    "heading": "2.3. Tectonic setting",
    "text": "Sukheswala (1956) determined that a narrow basin and common volcanic centres occurred along subsurface fracture zones, trending north–south across the\nmbai province stratigraphy.\nMumbai and Salsette Islands. A regional, ovalshaped, 12 km height by 35 km base diameter positive gravity anomaly, with its focus along the west coast of Salsette Island, coincides with an area of high heat flow (Negi et al., 1992, 1993; Fig. 1). Hooper (1999) and Sen (2001) inferred that mildly alkaline and tholeiitic dykes bearing mantle xenoliths, again trending roughly north–south, created this gravity high, and Sethna (2003) associated the Mumbai anomaly with intermediate and felsic igneous rocks underplated by gabbroic intrusive complexes.\nVertical movements played a key role in shaping Mumbai Trap palaeoenvironments. Blanford (1872) proposed a mechanism which instigated alternating rising and sinking events across Mumbai Island, and structures across the district have recently been attributed to tectonic deformation (Widdowson, 1997; Sheth and Ray, 2002). North–south trending fractures through, and the block tilting of, offshore Mumbai basement rock have been related to the western margin of India rifting from Madagascar, then the Seychelles bank, respectively, before or during the Deccan volcanic episode (e.g., Devey and Lightfoot, 1986; Singh and Sahni, 1996).\nInferring a different sequential order from flowmapping, Hooper (1990) concluded that the lithospheric thinning, shearing and rotation which produced the present regional westward dips only ensued after Réunion mantle plume emplacement, lithospheric doming and MDP eruptions. This crustal\nextension arguably promoted the mantle upwarping that resulted in the Mumbai gravity anomaly (Dessai and Bertrand, 1995). Lightfoot et al. (1987) considered this to have triggered partial melting of lower crust gabbroic complexes and an associated production of trachytic magmas, whilst contamination from assimilated crust was debated to have generated the more acidic suites present.\nNegi et al. (1992) interpreted the Salsette Island gravity anomaly as a magma conduit, discrete from the main Deccan plume, which breached the continental margin fracture zone offshore of Mumbai. This fracture, and the Seychelles block detachment, were stated to be related to a bolide collision. Chatterjee and Rudra (1996) submitted the Mumbai High (Fig. 1) oilfield and Deccan intrusives as evidence of an impact (the bShiva craterQ), embroiling a putative offshore Mumbai meteorite strike with K–T boundary extinctions. Shale organic maturation was allegedly instigated by impact-induced lithospheric heating, and the offshore region, uplifted by earlier Deccan magma accumulation, sank in response (Pandey and Agrawal, 2000).\nMumbai regional tectonic characteristics are more widely implied to be entirely products of terrestrial processes (e.g., Sethna, 2003; Table 5). Gombos et al. (1995) suggested that India’s west coast hydrocarbon reserves resulted from a Mesozoic collapse of Proterozoic mobile belts into passive margin basins, during and following the rifting that produced the\nMumbai High fault block. Sedimentation into Mumbai High rifts was dominated by organic-rich shales, with continued subsidence promoting their thermal heating and maturation (Gombos et al., 1995). Widdowson (1997) attributed the current western Indian margin geomorphology to simultaneous onshore erosion and offshore deposition operating throughout the Tertiary."

    "heading": "2.4. Facies",
    "text": "The crustal subsidence that accompanied Mumbai Island Formation activity represents the waning phase of Deccan activity (Singh and Sahni, 1996). Consequentially, Mumbai intertrappeans are generally much thicker than MDP sequences. An exceptionally thick shale overlying the Malabar Hill flow reflects a prolonged volcanic hiatus (Sethna, 1999; Fig. 3), and The Worli and Bandra tunnels cut into extensive, carbonaceous shales (Sethna, 1999). Sukheswala (1956) described the western ridge at Malabar and Worli as composed of a repetitive series of green and black ashes, and similar facies occur further north, around Jogeshwari (Sukheswala and Awate, 1957; Fig. 2). Volcanic and pyroclastic units were substantially reworked during repose phases, becoming increasingly clay and organic-rich, as reflected in a transition from greenish ashes and rhyolites to dark, fossiliferous shales in the Malabar and Worli hills of the western ridge (Sukheswala, 1956).\nStructures including ripple marks prompted Sukheswala (1956) to advocate shallow lakes as likely depositional environments for the lowermost sediments. Oblong concretions of V10 cm diameter in a prominent ash bed exposed along Mumbai Island’s western ridge were interpreted by this author to represent ash bombs which coalesced during pyroclastic eruptions, and a recurring subaqueous influence was deduced from the widespread occurrence of laminated beds. Deshmukh (1984) recognised that breccias had evolved from explosive volcanic activity, such volatility being enhanced by the invasion of water following subsidence.\nSethna (1999) described most Mumbai district flow facies as at least partially subaqueous. Extrusive breccias in the Amboli section, Jogeshwari, are composed of basaltic and altered vesicular glass clasts in a fine- to medium-grained clay, carbonate and quartz-rich matrix. Their petrography indicated a spilitic origin to Tolia and Sethna (1990), the hyaloclastites having consolidated during phreatomagmatic basalt effusions. These authors did not detect volcanic bombs, finding infrequent subcircular objects possessing chilled margins to be pillow structures. The angular shapes of most volcanic fragments suggested to Singh (2000) that these underwent minimal aqueous transportation; consequentially, the eruptive centres themselves are likely to have occupied low-grounds.\nSharma and Pandit (1998) assigned ignimbrite facies to cycles of felsic tuffs overlying intermediate to mafic pyroclastic flows in the Sasunavghar– Juchundra area, c. 5 km north of Salsette Island. The greater pyroclastic content of such sequences around Mumbai than other Deccan fringe regions was regarded by Singh and Sahni (1996) to reflect a closer proximity to their volcanic source, their evolved chemistries pointing to the termination of Deccan events.\nIgneous, tectonic and hydrological activity greatly influenced Mumbai shale as well as ash facies. Amboli intertrappeans display a hardened, baked margin where they contact the tholeiitic lopolith, and elsewhere exhibit plastic deformation (Tolia and Sethna, 1990). Singh (2000) attributed shale baking to heat conducted from overlying lavas. Mumbai shales are indicative of sedimentation under waters with low oxygen concentrations (Singh and Sahni, 1996), as\nreflected in pyrite precipitation along many carbonaceous laminations (Singh, 2000). However, occasional subaerial exposure led to desiccation and swamp formation under semiarid climes, as evidenced by calcite-filled rain prints and mud cracks (Singh, 2000)."

    "heading": "2.5. Geochemistry",
    "text": "Sukheswala (1956) identified pyroxenes and feldspars flanking calcite crystals in a Worli ash, and thus inferred a mafic chemistry. Partially decomposed feldspars, pyroxenes and biotite also occur in Jogeshwari tuffs, with calcite and quartz forming the major minerals here. Amboli hyaloclastites contain higher H2O and Na2O proportions than the local tholeiites, these enrichments in hydrous and alkali phases having been influenced by magma contacting water during its crystallisation according to Tolia and Sethna (1990). These authors recognised Amboli plagioclase to be a sodium-rich variety, and found that much of the calcite and quartz occurred as secondary minerals filling veins alongside zeolites. Metasomatism related to tectonism and intrusions is likely to have instigated zeolite precipitation across the Mumbai district (Sabale and Vishwakarma, 1996).\nEvidence of pyroclastic activity associated with terminal Deccan tensional regimes is preserved in the clay fractions of Mumbai shales. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) study of Amboli, Worli and Malabar intertrappean mineralogies (Singh, 2000) revealed matching mineral suites that indicated a mafic ash provenance for the shales’ clastic components. Pyroxenes degraded, glass devitrified and smectitic clays evolved during reworking, the smectites producing few reflection angle peaks due to their weak crystal structure development (Singh, 2000). Smectites and chlorite constitute the most important Mumbai clays, and combine to form a mixed-layer superlattice."

    "text": "Owen (1847) assigned frog remains within shales underlying the Malabar Hill Trap at Worli Hill the species Rana pusilla, although the fossil evidence for Maastrichtian Indian ranids has since been queried (Bossuyt and Milinkovitch, 2001). Turtles and molluscs from this section were detailed by Blanford\n(1867), and additional species of frogs, the most abundant faunal element, by Chiplonkar (1940). Sukheswala (1956) extracted two Carteremys leithii freshwater Pelomedusidae turtle specimens, and a tooth later diagnosed as crocodilian (Singh and Sahni, 1996).\nAccording to Singh and Sahni (1996), preservation within the Mumbai shales is unique to the Deccan, being superior to that within most MDP intertrappeans. These authors examined the faunal component of sections at Worli Hill, Amboli and Malabar, unearthing Shweboemys (Carteremys) leithii skull and carapace fragments within the latter. This genus was further documented in MDP sediments at Nagpur, Marepalli and Kutch (Fig. 1). Similarly, the Mumbai ostracod genera Mongolianella, Altanicypris, Cypridea (Pseudocypridina), Timiriasevia and Cyprois were associated with those from MDP intertrappeans (e.g., Bhatia et al., 1990; Whatley et al., 2003). A new pelomedusoid turtle species, Sankuchemys sethnai, has recently been extracted at Amboli (Gaffney et al., 2003).\nGenera common to inland and marginal marine ecosystems signify that either lagoon waters were occasionally virtually freshwater, or that central Indian lakes tended towards brackish. However, Singh and Sahni (1996) emphasised that dinosaur and fish taxa, important in several widely distributed MDP localities, are entirely absent in the Mumbai shales (Table 6). The lack of fish was attributed to water turbidity or contamination, conditions frogs were capable of tolerating (Singh and Sahni, 1996), although turbid waters of modern coastlines are often colonised by fish. Even the Mumbai Leptodactylidae frog Indobatrachus was distinguished from MDP Pelobatidae and Discoglossidae forms (see also Khosla and Sahni, 2003, and references therein).\nThe absence of some important MDP taxa around Mumbai, despite favourable preservation conditions, led Blanford (1867) to speculate that the cumulative effects of previous Deccan volcanism suppressed rainfall and damaged Mumbai environments to the extent that most MDP organisms lapsed into extinction. He interpreted poorly fossiliferous volcaniclastics low in the Malabar and Worli sequences to signify originally barren ecosystems, and suggested that Mumbai communities were a replacement biota to MDP fauna. Sukheswala (1956) reasoned that con-\ntemporaneous local, rather than preceding regional, volcanic activity generated a terrain inhospitable for Mumbai life. A thick basal greenish ash was thought to indicate an extended extrusive episode prior to a period of diminishing volcanism and community regeneration, represented by upper dark, fossiliferous shales.\nAccording to Mumbai Trap radiometric dates (Table 4), the diverse shale communities survived regional and global K–T boundary events. Bossuyt and Milinkovitch (2001) detailed archaeobatrachan frog lineages enduring the Deccan volcanic episode along the Indian island’s peripheries, and thriving during the early Tertiary, notwithstanding their probable confinement along the western fringe by volcanism to the east and an ocean to the west. Although many frog groups are environmentally sensitive, some Leptodactylidae species have broad physiological tolerances, and today populate habitats undergoing ecological or climatic disturbances (Kaiser, 1997)."

    "text": "Mumbai intertrappean plant megafossils are uncommon and distinct from those of the MDP (Blanford, 1867), but have similarly originated from land plants (Sukheswala, 1956). Bande et al. (1988) and Bande (1992) found limited Bambusaceae and Podocarpaceae wood, leaflets of possible Acacia (Leguminosae) affinity, and seeds similar to Artabotrys (Annonaceae). Megafloral remains are allochthonous within Mumbai basin facies, and the buoyancy of such organs as bamboo cane probably assisted their transportation. Leptodactylidae frog taxa that currently inhabit marine supra- to intertidal zones and consume saline marine food must regulate their osmotic balance (Abe and Bicudo, 1991). It thus seems plausible that Indobatrachus consumed terrigenous plant detritus washed down from vegetated\nareas, a diet that ostensibly safeguarded the frogs from any effects of temporary productivity declines driven by volcanic disturbances (cf. Sheehan and Fastovsky, 1992).\nPalynofacies analyses are useful in combination with sedimentological investigations, potentially distinguishing environmental transitions before macroscopic change is visible (Tyson, 1985). An amalgamation of the ecology of organic matter (OM) producers, palynodebris transportation, decomposition prior to burial and alterations during diagenesis generates a sediment’s palynofacies characteristics. According to Cross and Taggart (1982), the principal factors determining plant fossilisation are tissue durability, transportation distance, the existence and persistence of viable preservation sites, and sedimentation rates and consistency. No palynofacies analyses have previously been performed upon Deccan intertrappean floral material."

Its base is\nobscured by the quarry floor (the underlying flow, occurring c. 3–4 m beneath ground level here, outcrops to the northeast). Sediments range from dark grey, flat-laminated shales, through silts, to pale grey, cross-rippled sands (the latter occurring exclusively around Jogeshwari). Coarse grains, rarely present along certain laminations, include well-rounded c. 0.4 mm diameter carbonate clasts and rounded quartz sands (e.g., Fig. 6b). Dark, laminated horizons (e.g., Bom 4/98 and Bom 12/98; Table 1) contain pyrite framboids. The majority of units are planar-bedded, although one chaotically deposited, coarser layer contains btabletsQ of flat-laminated sediment. Ripples of 0.1 cm amplitude by 2 cm wavelength traverse another upper bedding plane, and some ripple crests have been transformed into flame structures (e.g., Fig. 7c). Undulose upper bedding planes\nfrequently exhibit fine, laterally continuous organic drapes. A 1.22-m ash, Bom 1/99, forms a salient, continuous bed through the section’s centre. This resistant unit yields virtually unaltered crystals the potassic mica phlogopite and quartz. Beneath, the uppermost fraction of Bom 8/98 consists of a series of fining-upwards beds. Fining-upwards cycles throughout this section tend to be continuous but thin, containing neither body nor trace fossils. However, small (1–2 cm) internal moulds of bivalves and gastropods occur sporadically elsewhere. An upper bedding plane exposed upon the quarry floor is pitted by common burrows (cf. Thalassinoides), these being virtually absent in higher beds. These are subhorizontal, smooth-walled, pellet back-filled, c. 1.5 cm diameter and 6 cm length, connecting at triple-junctions. Slightly oblate features of 1–1.5 cm diameter in Bom 6/ 98, viewed in cross section in the quarry face, initially appear to be higher, slightly compressed, vertical expressions of these horizontal traces. However, laminations cup underneath them and, when excavated, their true subspherical rather than cylindrical shape becomes apparent. Several ash beds are indistinctly stratified, either coarsening or fining-upwards. Some layers are dominated by grains, commonly feldspars, of up to 1 cm, horizontally aligned in thin, parallel bands. A coarse carbonate cement envelops the Bom 1/98 and Bom 2/98 matrices. Crystalline cement is particularly evident towards the uppermost basalt. Slickensides both follow and cross bedding planes. Sediments contacting the columnar lopolith exposed in the quarry face exhibit polygonal cracks. In sharp contrast with many MDP sections, no reddened ashes are present.\n(2) The Worli and Bandra Tunnels are inacces-\nsible, hence their overall sedimentological context is impossible to gauge. However, cuttings reveal that the tunnels pass through similar lithologies to those present in the Amboli section, except that the sediments generally lack cemented layers, being dominated by shale and OM (Table 1)."

The clay separate was subjected to glycolation and heating, to distinguish between smectites, chlorites and kaolinites. Element concentrations were established using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). Analyses of major elements were performed on glass discs, and powder pellets were used for trace element analyses. Losses on ignition (LOI) were recorded to account for volatile contents.\nTwo Amboli and two Worli tunnel samples were chosen for stable carbon isotope composition determination.

A trace of kaolinite is evident in the whole-rock profile, although, interestingly, this clay is unusual in MDP intertrappeans (Cripps, 2002).\nXRF results reveal that, although Amboli ash and tuff chemistries vary considerably, all the samples possess elevated Na2O levels (Table 7). The two Amboli ashes analysed for stable carbon isotopic composition exhibit marginally lighter d13C values\nthan the Worli shales (Table 8). The significance of these findings is discussed in Section 5."

    "text": "Although significant volumes of organic residue remained after macerating Mumbai intertrappeans, palynomorphs supplied a negligible contribution. Spinizonocolpites palm pollen, Azolla water-fern massulae, Botryococcus algal colonies and various fungal spores were exceptionally logged in some shales. While this paucity means that a comprehensive palynological interpretation is unfeasible, similar lithologies through the Amboli, Worli and Bandra sections permit comparisons of their palynodebris\ncharacteristics. Mumbai shales and silty sands are suited to palynofacies investigations due to their high concentrations of well-preserved, structured organic clasts. Seventeen Amboli (Bom), 11 Worli (Wo) and 4 Bandra (B) specimens were examined; samples were selected to typify the range of sediment types present (Table 1).\nTwo hundred phytoclasts were logged for each sample, and grains allocated 1 of 16 designated microfloral categories (Table 9; Fig. 9). Palynodebris percentages are displayed at their stratigraphical positions through the Amboli sequence in Fig. 10. Six Amboli ashes proved unproductive (Table 1), and only one ash horizon macerated trapped significant quantities of organic clasts (Bom 16/98). By contrast,\nall 11 Worli and 4 Bandra samples contained abundant palynodebris.\nChanges in absolute palynodebris abundances occur with lithology transitions through these beds, the changes being accompanied by variations in the relative percentages of some phytoclast categories to others. For example, taking into account that drops in angular black clast numbers will force rises in other category percentages, decreases in small and large angular black clasts in Worli samples are accompanied\nby marked increases in fragments displaying tracheids (Fig. 9). Following a different trend, low amounts of angular black clasts in Amboli samples generally accompany augmented amorphous organic matter (AOM) and branching leaf-like fragment percentages (Fig. 10).\nSmall angular black clasts are consistently present in high percentages; the largest concentration occurs in Bom 4/98, a laminated, pyrite-rich bed (Table 9). Large angular black clasts are less concentrated, but\nfollow a similar pattern up the samples. Branching leaf-like clasts are important in Amboli and Worli sediments, and Bandra cuttings are dominated by AOM. Amorphous matter and parenchymatous tissues are more abundant in Amboli than Worli samples, while fragments displaying tracheids are only important in Worli sediments. As with the small and large black clasts, branching leaf-like fragments and black laths typically exhibit angular edges.\nPhytoclast colours are recorded in Table 10, following the thermal maturity scheme of Batten (1996).

    "text": "The conspicuous absence of archetypal MDP boles and calcretes in Mumbai Island intertrappeans highlights a general lack of sediment subaerial exposure. Tectonic adjustments controlled the subaqueous nature of Mumbai sediments and Traps, allowing water to flood into the developing shallow basins as rifting and foundering of the margin progressed. Slickensides that both follow and cross bedding planes probably developed during this period of tectonism. Substantial intertrappean thicknesses are partly due to the extent of contemporaneous regional subsidence.\nShale laminations indicate a lack of bioturbation, suggesting that infauna were unable to exploit these sediments, possibly due to inadequate interstitial oxygen levels. The combination of swamp facies and anoxic laminated sediments implies that water levels were generally very shallow, yet liable to stagnation. This was perhaps a consequence of restricted water mixing through a low-energy column, the aqueous body being isolated from a fully open marine influence.\nA stratified water column with a high potential towards basal anoxia may have resulted from a subtly more dense, brackish layer separating surficial, aerated freshwater from the sediments, such circumstances being liable to occur in partly enclosed, sheltered lagoons fed by rivers. Shale carbon concentrations appear to have been optimised by low clastic sediment input combined with high terrigenous organic productivity, and OM decomposition would\nin turn have depleted oxygen resources. Clastic sediments are dominated by volcanic material, signifying that sedimentation rates diminished during nonvolcanic periods. Although OM was largely introduced, the dearth of eroded clastic material points to hinterland gradients having been negligible.\nWater energy infrequently increased, and undulating or rippled horizons became deposited above flatlaminated sediments. Paler, ash-rich units typify these faintly higher energy facies, the water movement perhaps initiated by ash introductions that triggered minor density currents. Tablets of flatlaminated shale in one sandy ash appear to have been ripped up and reworked after their compaction but before lithification. Horizons bearing asymmetric ripples indicate directed flow, potentially having resulted from such ash-bearing currents progressing across lagoon floors. Ripple tops were sometimes preserved flattened or altered into flame structures during their rapid deposition, dehydration and collapse (e.g., Fig. 7c).\nThe Mumbai lagoons were stable environments that were disrupted by ash eruptions. Rare fine, laterally continuous organic drapes settled above rippled layers, as the water reverted to its calm state. Repetitive pyroclastic influxes established the series of fining-upwards, ash-rich rhythms through the Amboli section. The transition from Bom 8/98 to Bom 1/99 appears to equate to a gradual increase in pyroclastic activity, culminating in a major local event. Many ash beds are indurated, their matrix, having been welded.\nSpherical to ovoid objects, constituting Bom 3/99, lack internal structure, more closely resembling the coalesced ash bombs described by Sukheswala (1956) than the spilitic fragments or pillows detailed by Tolia and Sethna (1990), occurring in an ash rather than a flow breccia. Laminations cup underneath these bombs, as though the pyroclasts dropped upon and depressed unconsolidated sediments. These accretionary lapilli strongly suggest that ejecta cones were in close proximity to the Amboli lagoon. The lamination deficit through most ashes probably resulted from their accelerated, chaotic deposition styles. Air-fallen and fluvially deposited loose pyroclastics were possibly aerated enough to support burrowing organisms that obscured original bedding features.\nWhen present, bivalve and gastropod internal moulds are of small (1–2 cm) sizes. This might be consequential to oxygen deficiency having stunted growth and/or caused large proportions of the mollusc populations to die prior to reaching maturity. The sizes of feeding traces upon a quarry floor bedding plane point to excavation by small crustaceans, and float crustacean claw sample Bom 22/98 (Table 1) may have originated from this horizon. Subhorizontal burrowing activity suggests sedimentation rates were low when organisms exploited the sediments. Their near absence in higher beds might be consequential to subsequent ash injections.\nThe prevalence of shales through the extensive Worli and Bandra sequences points to continually low sedimentation rates here, and therefore substantial sedimentation durations. Discrepancies in ash and Trap frequencies between Amboli and the Worli and Bandra tunnels indicate that either volcanic centres were closer to Amboli, or activity was more intense at the time of Amboli deposition. Worli and Bandra shales are not as well-cemented as the Amboli sediments, suggesting cement migrated from ash horizons. Diagenetic events have altered the Amboli section, and recrystallisation during lithification is particularly evident towards the uppermost basalt. Polygonal cracks in sediments contacting the columnar lopolith are likely to have evolved simultaneously with the intrusion’s contraction upon cooling."

    "text": "The XRD profile of a volcanic bomb (Bom 3/99) exhibited numerous, clearly defined reflection peaks at positions signifying well-developed corrensite crystals (Fig. 8). Relatively fresh feldspars produce peaks; thus, it seems unlikely that sedimentary processes occurred over an extended enough period to permit the development of regularly alternating chlorite:smectite lattices. Rather, increasing diagenesis temperatures and durations transformed smectites into this mixed-layer, chloritic clay, by means of repeated dissolution and precipitation events. The ratio of chlorite to smectite (c. 80:20) indicates a heating event of z100 8C during lithification, possibly accompanied by a degree of saline fluid flow (Beaufort et al., 1997; Murakami et al., 1999).\nKaolinite forms a minor contribution to the volcanic bomb. As weathering continues, smectite can alter to kaolinite through a succession of smectite–kaolinite mixed-layer transitions. Its near absence in weathered Deccan volcanics suggests these fossilised at early stages of modification. Kaolinite crystals can, however, grow within substrates subjected to prolonged waterlogging, and while MDP boles were largely too well-drained to promote its precipitation, the Mumbai lagoonal basins provided more favourable precipitation sites. Kaolinite is a common alteration product of felsic igneous rocks, and phlogopite micas present through tuff sample Bom 1/99 may be indicative of a transformation to more felsic late stage volcanism as the region rifted and subsided.\nThe varied chemistries of Amboli ashes are a reflection of their occasional explosive genesis in aqueous facies, clastic contamination, element mobilisation prior to lithification and hydrothermal alteration resulting from nearby intrusions. High sodium levels through these relative to MDP ashes (Table 7) may be consequential to their deposition in saline lagoons, although sodium from albites present would have augmented these concentrations.\nAmboli kerogen possesses marginally lower carbon isotopic signatures than those of Worli (Table 8). Thermal maturation, induced by local intrusion emplacement, is one means by which original Amboli OM d13C could have been lowered. Dykes cross-cut intertrappeans offshore Mumbai (Sethna, personal communication); if these imparted a greater influence on Amboli than Worli sediments, they might additionally have been responsible for the darker Amboli phytoclast colours (Table 10).\nRelative depletions in Mumbai shale 13C through heating was possibly influenced by a selective preservation of organic fractions with augmented 12C comparative to the total OM. Lipids, the most stable of plant constituents, are enriched in 12C by up to 8x compared with other biogenic compounds (Faure, 1986), and their hydrocarbon composition closely resembles that of petroleum. Smectitic clays catalyse lipid transformations to hydrocarbons virtually identical to petroleum (Faure, 1986), and the offshore Mumbai region is rich in source rocks."

    "text": "Although molluscs are sporadically distributed through Amboli shales, no typical MDP genera (e.g., Physa gastropods, Unio bivalves) were identified during the present study. Since shale faunal material possessed high preservation potentials, the absence of ubiquitous MDP forms almost certainly reflects their intolerance to marginal marine environments. Investigations are required to ascertain whether these genera continued to occupy contemporaneous MDP Danian, ?Desur Formation palaeoenvironments (e.g., Singh and Kar, 2002), and thus survived the full effect of the Deccan episode proximal to the principal focus of flood basalt activity. Invertebrates which did inhabit Mumbai lagoons were periodically capable of exploiting oxygenated surface sediments, as demonstrated by the pellet back-filled feeding traces.\nNo macroflora was recovered from the Amboli section by the present authors, although this sequence is extremely rich in disseminated plant matter. Parent plants possibly colonised firm terrain tens of metres from the low-angled, muddy lagoon shores and, consequentially, intact plant organs were seldom fluvially transported into the lagoons."

    "heading": "5.4. Palynofacies analyses",
    "text": "Of the 16 palynofacies categories selected to represent the Mumbai phytoclasts (Table 9), 14 symbolise land-derived plant fragments which received their shapes, colours and sizes from their parent plant and organ varieties and taphonomic (including sedimentological) effects. (AOM is of unknown derivation, and fungal remains are virtually ubiquitous.) To classify the OM according to kerogen type (Tyson, 1985), these palynofacies are rich in humic kerogens (higher plant wood and parenchymatous tissues), much of this having altered to inertinite (carbonised black wood). The sapropelic kerogen component (structureless matter, largely planktonderived) is negligible and fusinite (fossil charcoal) is rare. Any volcanogenic charcoal potentially entered the open sea due to its slow waterlogging rate (cf. Nichols et al., 2000).\nAll phytogenic clasts of known origin are terrigenous, reflecting deposition proximal to land, sheltered from a strong marine influence. The lack of\nmacroflora, and fragmented nature of wood and leaf material, infers these are allochthonous phytoclasts, allowing their characteristics to be applied sedimentologically to interpret their transport histories and depositional environments.\nBecause the palynodebris were from palynomorphreleasing plants, the dearth of pollen and spores (Table 9) is unlikely to reflect low productivity, and sporopollenin-walled grains doubtfully degraded prior to wood and leaves. Whereas larger, more massive phytoclasts settled upon lagoon floors near river mouths, palynomorphs, particularly those trapping air, probably floated into the marine realm. This would necessitate slight horizontal water movements within the lagoon. Nonetheless, shales trap rare palm pollen, water-fern massulae, algal colonies and fungal spores, these grains also occurring in MDP intertrappeans (Cripps, 2002). Well preserved, seemingly autochthonous Botryococcus algae conceivably bloomed following seasons of high rainfall, within negligible salinity surficial layers of density- and salinity-stratified lagoons.\nThrough the Amboli sequence, depletions in angular clasts correspond to rises in AOM and/or branching leaf-like fragments (Fig. 10), these changes normally accompanying transitions into shale facies (Table 1). Large angular clasts (e.g., Bom 13/98) accumulated when high runoff volumes rapidly transported palynodebris to the basins. Bom 4/98 has the most small angular black clasts. A lower velocity waterway would permit palynodebris darkening through oxidation during protracted transit times, selectively entraining finer grains, without promoting significant rounding. High AOM percentages in the Bandra samples and Bom 12/98, as well as a relatively large concentration of parenchyma in Bom 20/98, signify periods of diminishing river currents, during which only the lightest material reached the lagoons.\nLarge black angular clast abundances mimic the trend of their small counterparts, implying that black clast percentages are predominantly associated with preservation effects. At Worli, negative correlations of palynodebris exhibiting tracheids to angular black clasts (Fig. 9) are likely to have resulted from runoff fluctuations vertically displacing the oxygen minimum zone. Palynodebris displaying tracheids increased in importance when this zone rose, while\nfalls increased biodegradation, deteriorating ultrastructural details and blackening palynodebris.\nBranching leaf-like material forms the second most common structured palynodebris type after angular black clasts. Worli sediments appear to have accumulated in a more distal setting than the Amboli intertrappeans, typically beneath the oxygen-minimum zone, with many particles exhibiting tracheids or leaf ultrastructures. The presence of leafy material in many Amboli and Worli sediments indicates that the decay of vast quantities of introduced leaves exhausted oxygen supplies, leaving much of the litter to become buried beneath muds (e.g., Bom 10/98).\nBom 16/98, the only productive ash bed, contains a disproportionately high percentage of leaf-like material, and this is mostly pale. It is plausible that pyroclastic debris fell into a river, charging the water with sediment until it breached its banks, overwhelming and incorporating leafy floodplain plants. Upon entering the lagoon, the prompt and chaotic dumping of this material prohibited organic biodegradation. Bom 16/98 phytoclast distributions are very different to those of adjacent samples (Figs. 10 and 11), due to its distinct deposition style. Diluted palynodebris concentrations in other ash horizons have resulted from extremely rapid ash accumulation rates. The Amboli logs do not exhibit a constant palynofacies evolution timeline (Figs. 10 and 11) because of substantial disparities in shale and ash deposition rates and compaction extents.\nAlthough palynofacies data cannot delineate successional seres following pyroclastic events, low OM concentrations would be anticipated after catastrophic eruptions, and these are not apparent above Amboli extrusives. Ash Bom 16/98 terminates in black shales, and Bom 10/98 is a very productive bed occurring above ash Bom 9/98. It appears that Amboli vicinity ash-falls were localised phenomena, imparting minimal disturbance upon plant-life in the surrounding watershed. The manifest lack of a consistent palynoclast distribution pattern following ash emplacements is perhaps due to the erratic natures of the fluvial and aerial transport mechanisms.\nMinimal sorting has led to black wood exhibiting angular shapes and notable size ranges through the three sequences. It is thus surmised that much of the parent vegetation grew behind the lagoon shores, separated by stretches of muddy coastline. The\ndominance of equant- over lath-shaped phytoclasts is a reflection of debris buoyancy. Laths remain in suspension longer than equant grains, their high surface area to weight ratios retarding settling through the water column (Tyson and Follows, 2000). Palynofacies in which laths become increasingly significant (e.g., Bom 3/98, Wo 2600) delineate times of low lagoon energy, when sediment barriers to the sea developed. The marginally lower mean E:L ratio for Worli than Amboli suggests that Worli sedimentation occurred slightly further from river mouths.\nMost phytoclasts have high thermal maturities (6.3 Amboli mean, 5.6 Worli mean; Fig. 11; Table 10). While colour differences between palynodebris are influenced by variations in OM type and pre-burial oxidation (McArthur et al., 1992), diagenetic heating by intrusions was important around Mumbai."

The latter fluctuated consequential to depth changes, salinity stratification, turbulence and OM additions. Palynodebris sedimentological and preservational responses to environmental transformations produced the palynofacies patterns present. Mumbai intertrappean phytoclasts were deposited in extensive lagoons which experienced mild horizontal currents but insignificant vertical mixing.\nForests persistently occupied river watersheds draining into the lagoons, on the solid, gently sloping hinterland beyond their muddy shores, regardless of sporadic regional pyroclastic volcanism. Terrigenous OM was supplied by rivers following precipitation. Although the Amboli, Worli and Bandra sections may not be contemporaneous, their depositional facies are likely to have coexisted concurrently in adjacent areas (Fig. 12). Worli and Bandra sediments accumulated further from the mouths of palynodebris-bearing rivers and ash cones than those at Amboli.\nMegaflora is scarce, although large land plant organs have been identified (e.g., Podocarpaceae wood; Bande, 1992). Sizeable fragments, such as logs, would be most effectively transported by an\nepositional environments (aerial view, not to scale). Fauna based on d Bande et al. (1988).\naggressive, erosive drainage system. At Mumbai, however, megafloral remains were deconstructed through biological activity into smaller fragments, light enough to be suspended in distributaries meandering down the low-gradient back-shores to the lagoons.\nCharcoal is uncommon in Mumbai palynofacies, although it might be anticipated in volcanic regions (e.g., Uhl et al., 2004). Molten lava could promote the vaporisation and/or aerobic ashing of flora it advanced upon, rather than anaerobic charcoalification. Sedimentological and geochemical evidence points to Mumbai activity being more explosive than previous MDP tholeiitic eruptions; Mumbai surges presumably had lower expulsion temperatures than those of mafic effusions, and potentially cooled before contacting plants, as documented at Merapi, Java by Kelfoun et al. (2000). OM was infrequently scorched either within airborne plumes or by volcanic bombs. Eruptions doubtless uprooted or smothered plants, killing those worst affected, and forcing others to defoliate. However, the palynofacies reveal that few burned and, more importantly, a significant percentage survived to produce both OM and later generations.\nParoxysmal volcanic explosions repeatedly showered Mumbai coasts, and organisms at bground zeroQ must have been subjected to serious environmental trauma. However, palaeontological evidence confirms the establishment of enduring communities of remarkable diversity and sensitivities. As well as the magnitudes of volcanic impacts decreasing with radial distance from ash vents, effects would be dependent upon the direction of pyroclastic flow and plume movements. Refugia clear of gravity flow drainage routes and upwind of plumes could have remained comparatively unscathed. Pyroclastic releases can decouple into flows and clouds (cf. Kelfoun et al., 2000) that generate at least two deposits, and fluvial reworking into further accumulations is possible. In such ways, one Mumbai expulsion might be represented by several lagoon layers, giving the semblance of more frequent eruptions than actually prevailed.\nIf ashes did not reach Worli and Bandra because pyroclastics were transported in negligible distances, eruptions would have been of an inadequate magnitude to have injected materials into the stratosphere.\nHence, it is rational to conclude that no long-term climatic ramifications resulted. Negi et al. (1993) proposed that an offshore Mumbai extraterrestrial impact triggered Deccan volcanism, and argued for a bimodal origin for the K–T boundary extinctions. The palaeontology of intertrappeans near the focus of this alleged bolide cataclysm demonstrably contradicts this. The establishment of a varied biota shortly after the MDP eruptions calls into question their efficacy regarding environmental devastation. These data add credence to models implicating the Chicxulub impact as the main cause of organism turnover at the K–T boundary."

This work highlights the imperative for future investigators to identify irrefutable K–T bounda-\nries within the main Deccan tholeiitic succession, and thereby divide intertrappeans into pre- and post-boundary environments. Tertiary Deccan intertrappeans are extremely scarce (e.g., Singh and Kar, 2002), and the Danian Mumbai Island Formation possesses facies and organisms that are highly distinctive from all known MDP sediments. ! Mumbai facies are dominantly subaqueous, the sediments being significantly more organic-rich\nthan those of the MDP. This is due to their coastal palaeoenvironments having undergone syndepositional subsidence, although it may additionally reflect the influence of an increasingly humid Danian climate. Crustal extension supplied pathways for intrusions which heated basin sediments, and created the Mumbai gravity high. ! Mumbai ecosystems represent the legacy of global K–T boundary phenomena combined with local\nand preceding intense regional Deccan flood basalt activity. Numerous pyroclastic eruptions influenced lagoon intertrappean accumulation; however, no evidence exists for extensive wildfires ensuing or for floral mass mortality events. Rather, abundant plant material entered the lagoons throughout this active period. ! Based upon the current findings, the authors stress a need to reassess the palaeoenvironments of other\ncontinental flood basalt provinces that are temporally correlated with ecological crises."

  "abstractText": "The Deccan Trap continental flood basalt eruptions of India occurred c. 67–63 Ma, thus spanning the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (65 Ma). Deccan eruptions were coeval with an interval of profound global environmental and climatic changes and widespread extinctions, and this timing has sparked controversy regarding the relative influence of Deccan volcanism upon endCretaceous catastrophic events. If Deccan Trap activity was capable of affecting global ecosystems, evidence should be present in proximal Indian sedimentary facies and their palaeontological contents. The impact of late stage Deccan volcanism upon biota inhabiting Mumbai (Bombay) Island’s post K–T boundary lagoonal systems is documented here. Sediments (or bintertrappeansQ) which accumulated within these lagoons are preserved between Trap lavas that characterise the closing stages of this flood basalt episode. Mumbai Island Formation intertrappean faunal and floral communities are conspicuously distinct from those common to many pre K–T boundary, late Maastrichtian intertrappeans across the Deccan province. The latter sedimentary intercalations mostly developed in cognate semiarid, palustrine ecosystems; by contrast, those around Mumbai evolved in sheltered, peripheral marine settings, within subsiding continental margin basins unique to this late Deccan stage, and under an increasingly humid Danian climate. Geochemical analyses reveal that Mumbai sedimentation and diagenesis were intimately related to local explosive volcanic and regional intrusive activity at c. 65–63 Ma. Although tectonic and igneous events imprinted their signatures throughout these sedimentary formations, organisms usually sensitive to environmental perturbations, including frogs and turtles, thrived. Critically, palynofacies data demonstrate that, whilst plant material deposition was responsive to environmental shifts, there were no palpable declines in floral productivity following Mumbai pyroclastic discharges. Therefore, it is implausible that this late stage explosive volcanism influenced major ecosystem collapses globally. D 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
