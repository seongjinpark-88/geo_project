Present address: Departm Mandela Metropolitan University, PO Box 77000, Port\nE-mail address: sftoteu@yahoo.fr (S. Felix Toteu).\n‘Africa Alive Corridors’ (AAC) addresses major stewardship goals in Africa through a selection of 20 heritage Corridors (varying from 1000 to 4000 km in length and 50 to 100 km wide). These include more than 400 heritage nodes (World Heritage Sites, Biosphere Reserves, biodiversity hotspots, Geoparks, etc.). AAC tracks Africa’s journey from around 4 billion years ago to the present day through these chronologically sequenced Corridors. And so, the 4-billion-year autobiography of the continent is told. It encompasses the geological, biological and anthropological/cultural history of Africa’s 54 nations – a (hi-) story without borders. The wealth of scientific and biographical knowledge archived in this network of Corridors tells the story of continental drift, mega-geohazards, climate variability and change, and the origin and extinction of biodiversity; and includes our human roots, culture and spirituality, our impact on the Earth and our potential to influence its future. In telling this story of Africa, new research avenues will be discovered and new learning methodologies will be experienced and developed and shared. In this way, the AAC provide loci along which the eight UN-Millennium Development Goals may be readily and realistically achieved. In concert, they can form the basis for a new collective endeavour – of Pan African Earth Stewardship Science.\nIn this, the final – 2010 – phase of IYPE (the International Year of Planet Earth), we aim to make a start at bringing the ‘Africa Alive Corridors’ into real-life context. Whilst the concept of the Corridors has been formulated and presented at various international forums—most recently in Africa at the launch of IYPE in Arusha, Tanzania, in May 2008—here we present in brief their conceptual framework, and summarize the rationale behind the selection of the 20 African Corridors. Then, we describe, for the first time, how the AAC concept might evolve. To achieve the latter, we focus on an exploratory design of one Corridor (AAC 4 – through Cameroon and Nigeria) that we have named the ‘African Pole of Rotation’ Corridor. We outline its significance in Africa, and the world, and formulate an approach in forging its reality in the countries through which it passes. We show how the uniqueness of this and other Corridors, as ‘‘global heritage trails”, might translate into holistic lasting benefit for all. AAC aims to draw all 900 million Africans of every background and persuasion into co-curating, co-documenting and together keeping alive their continent’s unmatched heritage – an epic and unfolding story.\n2010 Elsevier Ltd.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "The ‘Africa Alive Corridors’ project is a scale invariant jump from ‘Gondwana Ali Corridors’ (GAC) that, in turn, grew out of ‘Gondwana Alive’ (GA), a sustainability concept first presented at the ‘10th International Gondwana Conference’ in Cape Town (28 June–4 July 1998, Anderson et al., 1999). GA gained the full endorsement of a wide range of world leaders including: Nelson Mandela, referring to ‘two concerns most dear’ to him, ‘the children of today’s world and the children of tomorrow’s world’; Kofi Annan (former\nAll rights reserved.\nent of Geosciences, Nelson Elizabeth 6031, South Africa.\nSecretary-General of the United Nations), speaking of his hope that we ‘reach out to all the people of the world and serve as a catalyst’; and HH the Dalai Lama, reminiscing about learning ‘the importance of a caring attitude towards the environment’.\nGAC was first introduced at the ‘11th International Gondwana Conference’ in New Zealand (25–30 August 2002), and concurrently at the ‘World Summit on Sustainable Development’ in Johannesburg (by de Wit and Anderson, respectively). The scope and aims of the GAC were published at length—with major contributions from Earth scientists around Gondwana detailing particular Corridors in Africa, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica and Japan—in a special volume of ‘Gondwana Research’ (de Wit and Anderson, 2003). A follow-up workshop on GAC (Anderson and de Wit, 2005), again involving\ncolleagues from across Gondwana, was held at the ‘12th International Gondwana Conference’ in Mendoza, Argentina (6–11 November, 2006).\nThe ‘Africa Alive Corridors’ (AAC) initiative, in particular, was first presented at the Africa Launch of the International Year of Planet Earth (IYPE) in Arusha, Tanzania, in May 2008 (Anderson and de Wit, 2008a,b; Anderson et al., 2008). Twenty selected African scholars played a central role at this event in launching a board game – now known as ‘Imizila’ (see below) – promoting ‘Earth Alive Strategies’ along ‘Africa Alive Corridors’. Their efforts were eagerly encouraged by H.E. Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of Tanzania (Fig. 1). The following year, at the Sciences Implementation Team Leaders and Chairs of IYPE African National Committees meeting in Pretoria (18–19 May 2009), S.F. Toteu presented the case for AAC as being ideally suited to the purpose of IYPE in translating the rapidly growing knowledge of our planet through the Earth Sciences to the improved stewardship of Earth – to the lasting benefit of all Africans (ICSU, 2009). At this event in Pretoria, the project was endorsed continentally as one of Africa’s contributions to the scientific legacy of IYPE.\nIn Lisbon, Portugal, at the 6th Board Meeting of IYPE (19 November 2009), the AAC initiative was officially endorsed internationally as a legacy project for Africa – embracing the motto, towards a ‘healthier, wealthier, happier future’ for all; and S.F. Toteu later presented the AAC concept during the ‘African Conference of Planet Earth’ (21 November 2009) at this same UNESCO-driven Lisbon event.\nBy publishing the present article in this Special Issue of the ‘Journal of African Earth Sciences’, devoted to Africa and the IYPE, we hope that the AAC will, firstly, gain the support of our African colleagues in all 54 countries across the continent; and, secondly, will engage a dialogue to promote a holistic network of partnerships between all sectors of the African population, young and old, including political, traditional and religious authorities, and civil society generally. The plan ultimately is to role out the concept as ‘Earth Alive Corridors’ (EAC)."

    "heading": "2. Concept of the Corridors",
    "text": "The ‘Africa Alive Corridors’ initiative embraces two complimentary ideas. Firstly, the Corridors tell the biography of the continent from its oldest foundations (ca. 4.0 billion years ago) to\nthe present, viewed from its geological, biological and cultural perspectives. The story is told along 20 Heritage Corridors (Fig. 2), each a chapter in the overall story. Secondly, in view of the status of each Corridor as unique heritage, they offer ideal foci for encouraging co-curatorship – the holistic, sustainable, pan-African management by all, for all, and to develop life-long learning laboratories from which to design new social contracts about Africa’s common wealth.\nIn brief—emphasising the duality of their nature and purpose— the ‘Africa Alive Corridors’:\n1. Celebrate the heritage of Africa – through telling its epic 4-billion-year story: along 20 Heritage Corridors, each telling a chapter in that\nstory; each varying from 1000 to 4000 km in length, and from 50 to 100 km in breadth; each including 20 Heritage Nodes (Geoparks and geosites, Ramsar Sites, biodiversity hotspots; Biosphere Reserves, Trans-frontier Peace Parks, World Heritage Sites, archaeological sites, rock-art galleries, historical cities, etc.), each telling a part of the chapter; together weaving the interdependent history of the prodigiously diverse geological, biological and cultural environment; forming an interactive network across the length and breadth of the continent.\nAnd sculpting the autobiography of the continent – a majestic and continuing story.\n2. Embrace all 900 million people of Africa as stakeholders (not forgetting all other species); in the co-curatorship of their continent; in interpreting and writing its autobiography (inscribed in\nits rocks, wilderness and people); interconnecting all 54 nations – writing a history without borders; addressing major Earth stewardship goals in Africa; promoting the aims of UN’s Millennium Development Goals.\nAnd offering a science-based strategy towards a ‘safer, healthier and wealthier’ continent.\n‘All persons living along a Corridor or in its general vicinity feel kinship, as for a football team, an Olympic athletic squad or a national flag. It is an educational Corridor, an ecotourist flight-path, a scientific laboratory and a workbench for holistic management’ (de Wit and Anderson, 2003).\nEach Corridor and each Node is scientifically unique, geologically and biologically, and this has forged an equally unique history of human cultural evolution. In turn, along each Corridor, the human activity has impacted in a specific way on the landscape and its biodiversity. Each of these Corridors is trans-national and unifying in drawing together people from different countries through which the Corridors pass.\nA Corridor offers wide potential to be developed into an ecotourist path. Prospective opportunities for life-long learning and exploration will stimulate the growth of all sectors in the tourist, education and entrepreneurship industries, and indeed the community at large. Beneficiaries include tour operators, local hostelries (e.g. via proliferation of bed-and-breakfasts), service industries, local groups reviving traditional music and developing theatre reflecting oral traditions, artists and craftsmen, to small business developing sustainable lifestyles. Such ecotourism could be on the ground in Africa or virtual back in Tokyo or New York."

    "heading": "2.1. Why Africa?",
    "text": "Africa is the continent where we find Earth’s oldest best-preserved piece of landscape (Barberton Mountains, South Africa, 3570–3060 Ma), yielding the earliest known preserved life (fossil bacteria, at ca. 3472 Ma)—effectively the earliest historical records of the mother continent. From then up to the present, the biography of Africa stands out tall in the biography of Gondwana, which, in turn, stands out tall in the biography of Earth! To highlight, Africa is the:\nHeart of Pangaea—the supercontinent prior to splitting, rifting & drifting since the Late Triassic.\nWomb of humanity—at each step of our hominid/hominin evolution through the past 7-million years. Centre of Earth’s geo-biodiversity—with plant and animal diversity reflecting geological diversity. Cradle of our primate ancestors—and place of our closest cousins, the chimpanzees and gorillas. Home of Earth’s only intact megafauna—decimated by the hand of man across all other continents, including Madagascar. Stem of human language—with the Khoi-San and Pygmy peoples persisting today as the closest living representatives of ‘sapiens’ ancestors. Roots of human culture—reflecting on what set us on a new trail within the mammalian tree.\nFountainhead of our art—considering our earliest symbolic artifacts found along Africa’s southern Indian Ocean coast, dating back to the Middle Stone Age. Colossus amongst the continents—concerning size, natural resources and heritage. Yet Continent of greatest human suffering—through disease, hunger, warfare, inequality, illiteracy And Place of our biggest dreams—towards a new kind of future.\nAfrica is indeed the continent with the deepest and richest geological, biological and cultural heritage. And it is certainly the continent suffering the greatest ills with regard to the concerns of the Millennium Development Goals. If we are to fashion a new future for life on Earth, we can do no better than begin at home—we can do no better than begin, literally and figuratively, in Africa."

    "heading": "2.2. Africa’s autobiography",
    "text": "The epic story of the continent will be told in a 22-volume series of books and CDs currently being explored with the publisher Springer. The first volume will outline the full autobiography of Africa, then follow the details in 20 volumes covering the 20 Corri-\ndors individually, whilst the last volume tells the story of the African diaspora colonising the world. Each of the Corridor volumes incorporates three interlinked and interwoven themes—primary, secondary and tertiary—covering the successive geological, biological and cultural realms:\nGeological (lithosphere) – the rocks, minerals and soils that form the foundation; Biological (biosphere) – the richly diverse flora and fauna so intimately tied to the lithosphere and exosphere; Cultural (anthroposphere) – the human story that is so closely tied to both biosphere and lithosphere;\nAnd explores further inseparable realms of the Exosphere such as\nClimate (atmosphere) – fundamentally affecting and affected by the above, Water (hydrosphere) – integrally part of all of the above.\nThese dynamically interacting outer layers of the Earth are inseparable players in the ‘Africa Alive Corridors’. The Corridors were chosen primarily on the basis of their uniqueness – either in terms of their geo-bio-anthropo-histories and/or their present-\nday earthscapes, manscapes and bio-cultural diversity. Furthermore, each was carefully chosen, chronologically, to serve as a time-line link providing a seamless deep history of Africa through to the relative shallows of the Anthropocene. In this way, each chapter provides a number of ‘golden spikes’ from which to predict and retrodict global events. Each will provide specific milestones in the story; whilst the early chapters will reveal more about deep time, the later chapters have more to offer in terms of recent history. But all contribute to the rich tapestry of the earth-and-life story of Africa, past, present and future.\nWe have specifically selected the ‘African Pole of Rotation’ (APR) Corridor for more detailed cover – with the linked themes portraying its uniqueness especially well. The APR (Fig. 3) is founded on what ranks, globally, as ‘one-and-only’ geological heritage—the Cameroon Volcanic Line—providing a natural theatre in which a biological-biodiversity tragedy plays out on an anthropogenic-stage filled with a rich and ever-adapting cultural heritage. This Corridor, then, calls for specific yet cosmopolitan remedies as we move to meet the UN-Millennium Goals. It can act as a guide, perhaps a mentor, for future efforts to consolidate and define other African Corridors. We would like, here, to emphasise that the loci and focal points (nodes) of our 20 selected Corridors are not set in stone. Each will need to be carefully assessed by those living either in or near them; each may await adjustments; nodes will almost certainly need to be added or re-selected by those far more knowledgeable about the local history, and so improve on what we have provided. The project invites all Africans to join in the interpretation and writing of their continent’s story—the story that is so vividly archived in its rocks, fossils and extant flora and fauna, and in its archaeological and cultural sites. Let the journey begin."

    "heading": "2.3. Pan-African collaboration and UN-Millennium Development Goals",
    "text": "It is generally acknowledged that few if any countries in Africa are on track to meeting the MDGs by 2015 (http://www.uneca.org/ mdgs/). Two questions arise from this: how are the countries of Africa currently performing in regard to the MDGs; and, how do we envisage the AAC initiative most effectively helping promote those goals? We address these questions in spelling out the ‘African Pole of Rotation’ Corridor below.\n‘The complexity and importance of the issues at hand demand effective collaboration among a broad range of partners. It is imperative that we work together and coherently’ – Koichiro Matsura, Director-General of UNESCO, at the IYPE Regional Launch for Africa, Arusha, Tanzania (May 2008). These words highlight the interlinked spectra of initiatives at various stages of development in Africa and beyond. Closely complimentary to the ‘Africa Alive Corridors’ (ultimately ‘Earth Alive Corridors’), are three IYPE legacy projects with an Earth-Science focus:\n1. UNESCO Earth Science Education Initiative for Africa – supporting the development of the next generation of Earth Stewardship Scientists in Africa with the necessary tools, networks and perspectives to apply sound science to solving, and benefiting from, the challenges and opportunities of sustainable development; 2. ‘OneGeology’ (http://www.onegeology.org/) – accessing the geological map of all countries online; since geology forms the substrate of each Corridor, this project will inevitably become an invaluable resource for AAC; 3. Young Earth Scientists (YES) – empowering scholars to influence decision makers, including everyone from parents to teachers to local business and national leaders.\nA platform for such interaction is offered by the ‘Imizila’ board game—to become widely available in 2010 (see imizila.org). It is\nabout ‘finding a new way forward’ through the uncertain 21st Century and beyond. Through ‘Imizila’, we envisage the AAC initiative most effectively helping promote the MDGs: as is spelled out more explicitly in the ‘African Pole of Rotation’ Corridor below."

    "heading": "3. 20 Heritage Corridors",
    "text": "Anderson and de Wit (2008a,b) proposed 20 preliminary ‘Africa Alive Corridors’. The full set of 20 corridors (Fig. 2) follow in chronological sequence from the oldest, ‘Cradle to Cradle’ (AAC 1), to the youngest, ‘Carbon Footprint’ (AAC 20). Briefly, below, we spell out the primary theme of each Corridor; together they provide a succinct account of the autobiography of the continent. And, we follow with a more expanded version for a single Corridor (the APR) as a baseline from which to develop this and other Corridors further in the future."
  }, {
    "heading": "3.1. 400 Prime Heritage Nodes",
    "text": "Though not elaborated here, we have selected for each Corridor a preliminary set of 20 ‘Prime Heritage Nodes’. These are strung out like ‘‘pearls along a necklace” (the Corridor); and each contributes a distinct part of the chapter in the biography of Africa told through the particular Corridor. Like the loci of the Corridors, these nodes are not fixed in concrete. It is our intention to place the full preliminary selection of nodes on the Africa Earth Observatory Network (AEON) website linked to a ‘comment-board’: thereby encouraging debate over alternate suggestions, help in fine-tuning designs of the Corridors, joining together as their collective champions, and becoming stakeholders.\n3.2. The ancient world: before we were Africa—Emergence of life\nCorridor 1: Cradle to Cradle (Swaziland to South Africa) 3,5 billion – present ’Celebrating 3.5 billion years of life on Earth’\nThe sinuous strip of territory running from the Makonjwa (Barberton) Mountains to the Vredefort Dome represents by far the most continuous passage through geological time preserved anywhere on Earth. It traverses the planet’s top-podium geological hotspot in a storyline of Earth, life and cultural superlatives.\nThis Corridor begins in the world’s oldest, largest, best preserved stretch of early landscape, the Barberton Greenstone Belt (ranging in age from 3570 to 3060 Ma), which yields the oldest known evidence of fossil bacteria dating back to 3480 Ma). Towards its western edge, it passes through the world’s richest assemblage of fossil hominid sites, the Sterkfontein ’Cradle of Humankind’ World Heritage Site.\nAlong the Cradle to Cradle Corridor, we find also the world’s oldest biogenic reefs (Transvaal Supergroup, 2.6–2.3 Ga) with the best-preserved rock sequence from which to decipher the processes that first irreversibly oxygenated Earth’s exosphere; its largest known meteorite impact site (Vredefort Dome, 2023 Ma), and one of its youngest, best preserved impact sites (Tswaing, 220,000 BP); the world’s richest gold-bearing deposits (Witwatersrand Supergroup, 3000–2714 Ma); the world’s greatest source of platinum (Bushveld Igneous Complex, 2060–2055 Ma); and from the Cullinan Kimberlite Pipe (1200 Ma) has come the largest diamond ever found (at 3106 carats). And there is a great deal more to this legacy. Not least, that all this mining has left a near disastrous acid-mine-drainage problem, the source of pollution of the regional water supply to 10% of the country’s inhabitants and agricultural land; and it is a potential ecosystem ‘killer’.\nCorridor 2: Snowball Earth (Namibia to Angola) 1000–500 Ma ’From a lifeless snowball Earth to the biological big bang’\nFor 150 million years, in relatively recent times (from ca. 730 to 580 Ma), our Earth went through a most extraordinary interval in its history—the Snowball Earth episode. During this extended time, the planet’s surface was almost entirely frozen over, covered in ice. The evidence for this is especially clear in the parched mountainous terrain of Namibia.\nIn the interval 580–505 Ma, following the meltdown of the ice covering the planet from pole to pole, sprang diverse, complex, multicellular life from seemingly nowhere. First in this biological big bang, arose the Ediacaran Fauna (ca. 580–543 Ma). Theirs was an almost equally unlikely and strange world. The ediacarans, the first known animals (also the first multicelled organisms), were enigmatic soft-bodied, jellyfish-like creatures, some to 2 m in length, rooted to the sea-floors. They flourished across the Precambrian world for some 40 million years. They were essentially passive, immobile and defenceless, living in a world at peace, a world in which predators had not yet evolved.\nThen came the Cambrian explosion of life (ca. 543–505 Ma). Within a few million years, the full spectrum of current animal phyla exploded into existence. The peaceful lifestyle of the ediacarans became a thing of the past with the rise of the first large predators. Though the continents were still bare of evident life, the world was, from our perspective, becoming a more familiar place.\nToday this Corridor epitomises life adapted to the hot and waterless conditions of the Namib Desert.\nCorridor 3: Great Karoo (Lesotho to South Africa): 325–175 Ma ’Pangaea through the mother of all extinctions’\nTo traverse the Karoo from the Drakensberg to the Western Cape is to walk through Pangaean time more expansively than on any other continent. No other geological basin can match the Karoo as a library unfolding the evolution of life through this critical interval of some 150 million years (325–175 Ma). From the mid-Carboniferous to the Early Jurassic, when the single supercontinent Pangaea was most tightly packed, when global temperatures were sharply on the rise, when the mammals evolved from the reptiles and the stem-angiosperms from the gymnosperms, the Karoo Basin lay deep within the heartland of Gondwana. The great thickness of richly fossiliferous sediments spans the Third Extinction—the most catastrophic of the global extinction events—at the end of the Permian period, and the extraordinary radiation of new life that followed. In this Triassic explosion of new biodiversity, we find what appears to be the heyday of terrestrial life.\nThis 150 million year interval from the ice-house world of the Carboniferous to the hot-house world of the Jurassic represents the most sustained warming curve since the colonisation of land by plants and animals. The great Karoo became a ‘compost-heap’ during the Permo-Carboniferous—a decayed biomass that is now one of the world’s largest coal reserves. Today, these reserves are the root cause of some of the most gruesome ecosystem failures throughout the subcontinent: through acid-mine-drainage pollution of its fresh water resources; and through the oxidation of this fossil biomass in the furnaces of South Africa’s powerplants that feed some of the greatest man-made CO2 plumes ever to sustain global warming into the future.\nThis then provides yet another case study of the close parallel between climate change, atmospheric chemistry and the shifting fortunes of life."

    "text": "Corridor 4: African Pole of Rotation (Cameroon to Nigeria) 200 Ma – present ’Africa across the Cameroon Hot Line’\nEspecially evident on the topographic map of Africa is the linear chain of islands—Pagalu, São Tomé, Príncipé and Bioko—angling across the Gulf of Guinea to meet an arc of peaks curving gracefully through Cameroon. This Cameroon Volcanic Line, comprising numerous plugs, cones and craters, stretches southwest to northeast for some 1600 km. The region bears witness to the break-up of Gondwana; a protracted episode through the Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary. We see an archive of events that spans nearly the entirety of the Mesozoic, with Africa separating from South America and going through significant anti-clockwise rotation. And we are witness to the surface expression of an upper mantle ‘Hot-Line’. This volcanic archipelago is a unique geological-topographic structure traversing both ocean and continent. Existing knowledge reveals that its history reflects the drifting and anticlockwise rotation of Africa, as it separated from South America. Nevertheless, its origin remains a geological enima.\nA second theme, albeit compressed into an altogether shallower time frame is of the greatest historical-cultural significance in Africa. This is revealed where the Corridor ends on the Jos Plateau in central Nigeria, generally recognised as the centre of the earliest evidence of iron smelting in sub-Saharan Africa: at Taruga, as many as 13 furnaces have been excavated, with the oldest dating to 600 BC. Also, the general region around the Adamawa Plateau within the Great North Cameroon is recognised as the centre of migration of the Bantu people from ca. 1500 BC.\nCorridor 5: Colliding Continents (Morocco to Tunisia): 200 Ma – present ’Rifting, drifting, folding along the Atlas Mountains’\nThe Atlas Mountains along the northwestern extremity of Africa comprise a geological gallery of rifting, drifting and folding from the Late Triassic (225 Ma) to the present that is difficult to match elsewhere. These mountains provide clear evidence of the initial disintegration of the supercontinent Pangaea (rifting); then of the separation of Gondwana from Laurasia (drifting); and finally, with the anti-clockwise rotation of Africa (see Corridor 4), that entailed its collision with Europe (folding). During these tectonic transitions, opening and closing of the Gibraltar straight forced spectacular episodes of desiccation and catastrophic refilling of the Mediterranean Sea; the latter, around 5.33 million years ago, causing peak flooding rates that drove sea level rise throughout the Mediterranean at more than 10 m per day. The climate effects and ecosystem responses to these crises are yet to be fully analysed.\nAs with the previous Corridors, a second theme—in the human time frame—comes into play here. In view of the unique situation of the Atlas Fold Belt at the strategic crossroads between two continents, the region has seen the ’rise and fall’ of a succession of empires: the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, then the British and French Empires. This history is reflected in an extraordinary spectrum of architecture—from the 8th Century AD to the present—and the institution of an African-record concentration of UN World Heritage Sites (some 25) and Biosphere Reserves (over 10) along this belt.\nWe see in these twin themes, the clearest confirmation that our world is never at rest. Change and evolution are ubiquitous; often expressed in dramatic, if not saltational, dynamics. Moreover, all\nabiotic and biotic entities originate, persist and disappear in an interdependent system.\nCorridor 6: Lemur-Chameleon (Madagascar): 65 Ma to present ’Born on a microcontinent’\nAfter Greenland, New Guinea and Borneo, Madagascar is the world’s fourth largest island and it is the most isolated. Its natural history provides profound insights into key concepts of geologic and biologic co-evolution: the formation and break-up of supercontinents, ecosystem dynamics, vicariance and radiation, extinctions, sustainability of biodiversity. This island, through its unique Lemur populations may hold one of the most important keys to understanding the origin of these and all other primates.\nMadagascar is the most vulnerable of the world’s 25 recognised biodiversity hotspots and constitutes the world’s hottest biodiversity hot spot, with 3.2% and 2.8% of the total global endemic plants and vertebrates, respectively: over 9700 extant plant and 770 vertebrate species are endemic to the island – the highest levels of endemism on our planet. Many of these endemics are phylogenetically ancient, with several clades represented by the most fascinating adaptive radiations.\nMany believe that this biological heritage evolved in isolation on Madagascar after it separated from Africa (160 Ma) and from India 70 Ma later. Such a vicariance view of Madagascar as an independent evolutionary hub, was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace more than 100 years ago. Very recently, in the geological time frame, a catastrophe hit Madagascar: a microcosm of the 6th Exctinction struck, when a mere 2000 years ago, the first humans arrived on the island. They have wrought havoc on Malagasy biodiversity ever since. The megafaunal extinction window is currently estimated at between 1.5 and 0.5 Ka, linking their demise closely to overkill by human colonisers. At least 17 species of large mammals, birds and reptiles—including pigmy hippos, giant tortoises, elephant-birds and giant lemurs as big as gorillas—became extinct, apparently since the start of the human influx. And now, in our time, there is massive destruction of habitat: about 65%, 34%, and 10% of the island’s primary tropical rainforest remained in 1950, 1985 and 2000, respectively."

    "text": "Corridor 7: Lungs of Africa (DRC to Tanzania): 10 Ma – present ’Womb of our hominid family and of our sister pongids’\nAfter 4.6 billion years of Earth’s history, at around 8 Ma, in the rainforests of Africa, a fork occurred in one of the branches of the primate phylogenetic tree: one lineage led to gorillas and the other, eventually, to the emergence of humans—a species able to piece together its deep history and to contemplate its effect on the rest of life. The ’lungs’ of Africa here represent the expanding and contracting expanse of tropical forest as a photosynthetic ’bellows’, yielding greater or lesser amounts of oxygen from carbon dioxide and water.\nLike the Khoisan of southern Africa, the pygmies of the tropical forests of central Africa are in serious decline. This catastrophe should be treated as one of the gravest global concern. The Khoisan and the pygmy have the deepest roots in our human family tree— their lineages being traced back to perhaps 130,000 years. The two groups are the direct bearers genetically, linguistically, and anthropologically of our earliest history.\nAside from the enormous importance of our kin, the pygmies, and our cousins, the chimpanzees and gorillas, the tropical forests\nof Africa are home also to what would appear to be the mammalian diversity hotspot of the world. With 415 species, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), ranks third richest after Indonesia (515 species) and Mexico (439 species). However, if we also consider the families and orders that represent the deeper phylogenetic diversity as indices of conservation significance, then the Congo Basin ranks top in global priority – not least considering the fish fauna of at least 1000 species that has evolved across the vast Congo drainage system.\nCorridor 8: Eastern Rift Valley (Ethiopia to Malawi): 5 Ma–150,000 BP ’Our hominid trail from Ardipithecus to Homo’\nDominating the topography of Africa is the spectacular Rift System, slicing more than 3000 km through the eastern heart of the continent from the Afar Triangle in Ethiopia to Lake Malawi. Nowhere else globally do we see the splitting apart of a continent that highlights the action of plate tectonics so strikingly. And it is one of the great coincidences of Earth history that so much of the story of our human evolution should be fortuitously archived in the sediments deposited along this crack in the lithosphere. Without the development of the East African Rift and the accumulation within it of lake deposits interbedded with datable volcanics, our knowledge of the evolution of the hominid family would be considerably less complete.\nFrom a string of localities, Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli in Tanzania amongst them, have been unearthed the remains of perhaps 300–400 hominid individuals, spanning four million years (5.5–1.5 Ma) in our evolution. These real flesh-and-blood individuals—Lucy, The First Family, Zinj, Dear Boy, the Dikika Baby, Ardi, NMK 1470—from our ancestral past, are represented in the collections by anything from an isolated molar or fragment of humerus to a 50%-complete skeleton. From this material are currently recognised some 10–13 species in three genera, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus and Homo.\nAnd as in all of these stories of Africa, climate change has been an inseparable factor. Our gradual emergence from within the primate order and, later, the hominid family, has through tens of millions of years been tightly linked to a prolonged phase of cooling through the Tertiary. It is in our genes.\nCorridor 9: Western Rift Valley (Uganda to Tanzania): 5 Ma – present ’Extreme fish diversity in the Great lakes’\nLakes Albert, Edward, Kivu, Tanganyika and Malawi, strung out north to south along the Western Rift Valley, hold a number of world records between them. Lake Tanganyika is the world’s deepest lake. Lake Malawi is home to a greater diversity of fish than any other and has perhaps as many as 1000 different species living in its surface waters. Together, the Rift-Valley lakes form an archipelago of explosive speciation; ranging from the oldest radiation in Lake Tanganyika, through Lake Malawi to LakeVictoria.\nCollectively and individually these lakes are the most superb natural laboratory for studying the phenomena of evolution, extinction and radiation over the past 10 million years and, particularly, the last million years of the Pleistocene. This is especially so because of the active ongoing rifting and thick accumulation of lake deposits interbedded with volcanic tuffs offering precision in absolute dating. Lake Tanganyika, being the oldest of the lakes at 10 Ma, and with deposits up to 5 km thick, has the potential to provide a superb record of climate change and shifting diversity patterns since the split in the pongid and hominid lineages.\nCorridor 10: Homo sapiens sapiens (South Africa): 140,000–60,000 BP ’The first half of our human sojourn on Earth’\nWith respect to superlatives and uniqueness, this Corridor is difficult to match. At a succession of some 20 sites along the spectacular southernmost coastline of Africa, is preserved, without peer, the archaeological story of our human (Homo sapiens sapiens) emergence—from our first mutual ancestor, popularly dubbed Mitochondria1 Eve, at some 140,000 years ago. The earliest known human footprints (at Langebaan, ca. 117,000 BP), the oldest reliably dated human skeletal remains (Klasies River mouth, ca. 115,000 BP), the most ancient works of art (Blombos Cave, ca. 77,000 BP), are all there to engage our wonder.\nIt is a sad irony that the Sixth Extinction of global biodiversity and wilderness should be so particularly evident along the adjacent Cape Fold Belt with its associated Fynbos vegetation. In the extreme diversity (ca. 9000 species) and endemism (69%) of the Fynbos flora, this restricted biome confined to the tip of Africa is unique globally. It is generally recognised as one of the six plant kingdoms on Earth—virtually the entire northern hemisphere is another—and as one of the most threatened of the 25 biodiversity hotspots. It is arguably the world’s plant-biodiversity hotspot. In this one distant corner of our planet, we are witness to our blossoming humanity, to the richest flora on Earth, and to the devastating impact of the one on the other in our own day."

    "text": "Emergence of civilisations\nCorridor 11: Khoisan Kalahari and the African superswell (Namibia to Botswana): 60,000 BP – present ’The Khoison stem of our human phylogeny’\nIt is now firmly established that of the numerous languages spoken globally, those ‘clicks’ of the Bushmen have the deepest roots. They are the closest to the stem of the phylogenetic tree of language. Likewise, amongst the great diversity of modes of spirituality and religion, theirs will have the deepest roots in the long history of humanity. The legacy of the Khoisan people merits, then, the highest possible respect: it is hardly possible to cherish their heritage highly enough. What a terrible irony that the rest of humanity has driven them to near extinction. Until 1927 it was legal (with an official permit) for white South Africans to hunt bushmen, just as today it is legal (with the necessary documentation) for humans to hunt lion or buffalo. And just as buffalo horns are proudly displayed as trophies, so the body parts of the murdered Bushmen were displayed by their hunters.\nOf the four principal hunter–gatherer rock-art regions across Africa, that of the Bushmen is perhaps the best known and amongst the best understood. With well over 10,000 rock-art sites, engravings or paintings (the overwhelming majority being hunter– gatherer), occurring south of the Zambezi, it is a colossal heritage. The works span a considerable range in time: the oldest pieces of painted stone being from deposits dating to 27,000 BP (from the Apollo II cave); whilst from word of mouth it is known that both engravings and paintings were still being produced well into the 19th Century.\nAll these works of art, preserved in caves, on rock faces or on boulders, occur at localities scattered across the immense Kalahari Plateau – the southern African highlands – the world’s largest plateau away from active plate boundaries. Whilst the origin of the Kalahari Plateau remains shrouded in debate, it seems somehow connected to a great upwelling of heat and material from the core-mantle boundary – a superplume linked to a bulging litho-\nsphere. This African superswell, in turn, has profound effects on biospheric processes, climate, and perhaps even our magnetosphere. The episodic geodynamic uplift history over the last 100 million years or so holds the key therefore to the Kalahari’s paleo-ecodynamics and to the ancestral ‘home’ of the Khoisan.\nCorridor 12: Saharan Paradise Lost (Tunisia to Chad): 22,000 – present ’The rock-art gallery traces desertification’\nThis corridor straddles some of the world’s most isolated barren rockscapes—home to the Tuaregs and other great nomadic tribes. It is a gallery of landscapes that spreads from the lofty granite domes and basalt plugs of the inhospitable Hoggar Massif, to the volcanic cones of Tibesti and the great trans-Saharan escarpment cut into Palaeozoic sequences that separates Libya from Chad.\nAlong this spread of mountains—the peaks of the Sahara—is a second of the great African sub-continental rock-art galleries that portray parts of human history. This Saharan gallery tells an especially pertinent story at a time when people across the world have (belatedly) awakened to the disturbing uncertainties of sudden, punctuated global warming. A 12,000-year chronology of rock paintings and petroglyphs (engravings or carvings on rock) depicting different conditions of the landscape during this time mirror the drying out of the Sahara from verdant paradise to the world’s most extensive desert.\nThe earliest period (the ’Bubalus Period’, from 12,000 to 9000 BP), for instance, is characterised by engravings of the elephants, rhinos, and the prehistoric wild ox, Bubalus antiquus, hunted by the people of the region. The third period, the ’Pastoral Period’ (7000–3650 BP) depicts nomadic people as dominant over nature, rather than as part of nature, as had earlier been the case. This is followed by a ’Horse Period’ (3650–2200 BP), the Hyksos having conquered Egypt by chariot and introduced the domestic horse. Last came the ’Camel Period’ (2200 – present), the camel having by now arrived from Asia. The rock paintings of animals vividly depict, through those portrayed, the fatal climate change and ecosystem collapse, so rapid, so severe and spatially so extensive, that befell the region between 6000– 5000 years ago. It might serve as a real warning to formulate robust adaptative strategies across those regions of Africa anticipating further droughts during the rest of this century.\nHowever, the story told by this Corridor goes a good deal further back. Two hominids, Abel (Australopithecus bahrelghazali) at 3.5 Ma and Toumai (Sahelanthropus tchadensis) at 7 Ma, lived here along the wooded-savannah shores of north Africa’s inland Lake Chad; then a mega-lake covering a far greater stretch of the Sahara than today. Abel and Toumai highlight the paleo-anthropological and paleo-environmental significance of the Corridor.\nCorridor 13: Valley of the Pharaohs (Egypt to Sudan): 3100–30 BC ’Life cycle of the classical Egyptian civilisation’\nCivilisation arose in the Middle East with the domestication of plants and animals (agriculture), the concentration of human habitation (cities such as Babylon, Nineveh, and Ur, of the Tigris and Euphrates valleys in what is now Iraq) and, most critical and far reaching, the invention of writing as a means of recording information. The earliest writing, a pictographic script used apparently for administrative and economic purposes, was developed by the Sumerians in southern Mesopotamia shortly before 3000 BC, which later evolved into the more symbolic Cuneiform.\nMost fascinating and long-lived of these early civilisations is the one that sprang up along the floodplains of the Nile Valley. It is divided into 12 periods, the best known being the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms (from ca. 2575 to ca. 1075 BC). Ironically, it owes much of its success and longevity to the insularity afforded it by\nthe ’catastrophic’ desertification of the Sahara (C 12)—one community’s disaster is another’s opportunity.\nThe ‘Valley of the Pharaohs’ brims, too, with geological history. There were the great architects of the pyramids, developers using natural building materials with their own deep history – the nummulites (a family of large Tertiary protozoans), like the ammonites and belemnites, with no trace in the present world, yet so striking in the limestones of which the ancient Pyramids in Egypt were composed. There are the Pan African granites used as building stones and artefacts: the Rosetta stone; Cleopatra’s Needle, looted by Napoleon, now a tourist attraction in central Paris. There is the history of the Nile delta told in its archaeology and sedimentology, holding the key to a variety of tales, from historical earthquakes to the flooding of the Mediterranean. It is a colossal story that links geo-history to the dawn of human history, archaeology and the tales of Genesis!\nCorridor 14: Nubian Nile (Sudan to Ethiopia): 3000 BC – present ’Of civilisations and cultures over 5 millennia’\nThe first 3000 years of the story of the Nubian Nile parallels and interdigitates with that of the Egyptian Nile. Here is an intriguing and perhaps little-known part of that linked story.\nAs we have seen, the Egyptian civilisation ran for close on 3000 years, from 3100–30 BC, when the Roman conquest finally brought it to a close. In the succession of 31 pharaonic dynasties, the 25th, the Nubian, lasted from ca. 770–656 BC. For a span of three-quarters of a century, the so-called Black pharaohs, conquerors from Nubia to the south, ruled over Egypt.\nIn 701 BC, the Assyrians from the east marched into Judah (in present-day Israel). The Nubians confronted them and though the Assyrian emperor claimed victory, the great pharaoh Piye’s son Taharqa survived. The Assyrians held the embattled Jerusalem siege, but then, according to the scriptures (and other texts) a miracle occurred. The massed Assyrian army melted away; was it the plague, or was it the advancing Taharqa? By the time Nebuchadnezzar a century later could banish the Hebrews, their faith, Judaism, had strengthened to a point where it could not be erased. From Judaism sprang Christianity and Islam, the three great monotheistic Abrahamic religions that dominate so much of world affairs today. It was absolutely touch and go back in 701 BC. It was against all possible odds, a towering moment in world history.\nFrom these fragile beginnings developed the great Coptic Church with headquarters in Alexandria and Axum, a regional trading centre 400 BC, with churches at Lalibella cut into volcanic ash layers. The latter is at the source of the great African legends of the Queen of Sheba; with its artefacts and relics at Axum, giant obelisks cut out of Pan African granites, looted by Italians in 1937, displayed in Rome, but then rightfully returned again in 1967. These now tower atop the great Ethiopian Highlands formed from the world’s greatest flood-basalts: a great igneous province that erupted 35–40 million years ago; and whose bounding lava cliffs have helped keep out most attempts at Western colonisation.\nHere too, the beginnings of one of the great rivers of the world, the (Blue) Nile, making its way through Lake Tana and cutting the majestic canyons through the basalts before entering the desert of Sudan and Egypt. Sadly, and who knows in this world of sovereign states, the people of the region are forever under suspicion of cutting water supplies to Cairo.\nCorridor 15: Songhay’s Timbuktu (Senegal to Nigeria): AD 700–1600 ’Key civilisations of the Niger and Senegal Kingdoms’\nTimbuktu, an extant town of some 10,000 persons in central Mali, is a remote legendary place in the Western mind (as captured in the\nphrase, ‘from here to Timbuktu’). From AD 1340–1550, it was the capital—an imposing city on the banks of the Niger River—of the Kingdom of Songhay. It became one of the greatest centres of trade, religion and academia of the time; its renowned university the equal of any that then concurrently existed in Renaissance Europe. Ultimately, the reason for the city’s prosperity can be traced back to the goldfields of the ancient West African Craton (2.0–1.5 billion years in age) from where the Senegal and Niger Rivers rise.\nIn the history of pre-European civilisation in Africa, the successive kingdoms of Ghana, Mali and Songhay (spanning some 900 years, from 700–1600 AD) centred along the Niger and Senegal Rivers, played a key role around the south-western margin of the Sahara. They overlap in time the Nubian Kingdoms of the Nile (3200 BC–1000 AD) and the Mapungubwe-Great Zimbabwe Kingdoms of the Limpopo and Zambezi Valleys (1000–1500 AD).\nThese great civilisations, as always, have a compelling geological story underscoring them. There is the intimate relationship between the escarpment and local cultures developed around cave dwelling; the great Taoudeni Basin with major gold mines in the Eburnean basement shear zones that were discovered recently on the basis of indigenous knowledge from the nearby Ashanti gold mines; and there are the diamond and bauxite deposits in Guinea that form a chapter all their own.\nCorridor 16: Mapungubwe-Great Zimbabwe (South Africa to Zimbabwe): AD 900–1700 ‘The rise and fall of a golden empire’\nProbably without parallel globally is the degree to which the territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo Valleys from 1100 to 1700 AD became a cultural vortex, As the Bantu civilisations evolved through 600 years they were touched by the more ancient spirituality of the Bushmen to the west, and by the wholly different worldviews of the traders from the east, representing the European, Middle East and Far East cultures.\nThis vortex of civilisations was played out on, and crucially fuelled by, the geological formations of the Achaean basement of the Zimbabwe Craton (2.5–3.5 Ga) and the Limpopo high-grade metamorphic suites representing Earth’s oldest Himalaya-like collision belt. It is interesting that these rocks are now exhumed to levels still some 50 km below the present Himalayan mountain ranges.\nThe people who lived in the Shashe-Limpopo basin developed the first complex society in southern Africa. Characterised by sacred leadership and distinct social classes, this society also created the first town, the first king, the first stone-walled palace and the first city-state with a capital within the subcontinent. A clear succession of three capitals occurs within the Mapungubwe World Heritage Site: Schroda (AD 900–1000), then K2 (AD 1000– 1220) and finally Mapungubwe itself (AD 1220–1300). The latter was a peaceful farming kingdom trading skilfully in crafted gold, ivory, iron and copper artefacts.\nMapungubwe was the forerunner of the famous town of Great Zimbabwe (ca. AD 1100–1600), the second World Heritage Site declared in the region and some 200 km distant. By the 15th Century the type of society developed at Mapungubwe had spread over an area the size of France."

It is a story of irony you could barely conceive. The story begins in the 1430s with the founding, by Henry the Navigator (1394–1460), of the world’s first naval academy at Cape St Vincent on the south-western tip of Portugal. From this peripheral corner of Europe began the colonisation of Africa and of the globe by Renaissance Europe. It is indeed remarkable that within the ensuing 100 years, Europe had its tentacles encircling the Earth. By 1460, when Prince Henry died, his mariners had rounded the bulge as far as Sierra Leone and Liberia; and by the early 1470s, the Portuguese had reached the Gulf of Guinea. Vasco Da Gama reached India via the Cape in 1498. Columbus had ’discovered’ America in 1492; and Magellan circumnavigated the globe in 1521. The era of Western colonisation and empire-building had begun in earnest.\nFor over 400 years, slaves were harvested from the African countryside and bartered for sugar, gold, horses, or cowrie shells as ’legitimate items of commerce’; if Europeans were the traders, the Africans themselves were the suppliers. While every corner of Africa was involved in the slave trade, it was the West Africa to America trans-Atlantic run that flourished most and is also the most clearly documented. And in the annals of man’s depravity towards man, even the Hitlerian Holocaust can hardly parallel these three centuries of barbarous human trade.\nIt shook Africa badly: and, until now, episodes of the grimmest brutality continue to flare up around the bulge—which might readily be seen as the left half of a gigantic firing Catherine wheel centred on Timbuktu.\nCorridor 18: Zambezi River (Zambia to Mozambique), AD 1800–2009 ’The story of a southern African river and its wetlands’\nS. Felix Toteu et al. / Journal of Afri\nAt the plumb-centre of Africa south of the equator lies what is set to become the world’s largest conservation area—the ’Kavango-Zambezi Trans-frontier Conservation area. This is a Peace Parks initiative and it was set in motion as recently as December 2006, when the Ministers of the Environment of five countries—Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe—signed a memorandum of agreement. It is a whisper of the conservation of the future, of the year 2050. Aside from its size and position, the area will be peerless in several other regards. It will embrace large sectors of five adjacent countries; it will include the famed Victoria Falls (one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World), the equally famed Okavango delta (the largest Ramsar site in the world, and Earth’s unique example of an endorheic delta forming inland sediments); and it will embrace a number of other national parks. But most exciting, it promises to become home to the largest population (some 250,000) of the world’s largest terrestrial herbivore, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana).\nFrom the heyday of European empire-building, to the dissolution of those empires, to the conservation of coming decades, this is the meat of this chapter—from 1850 to 2050—in the story of Africa. Each frame of the triptych embodies unmatched superlatives: from mega-exploration (David Livingstone); to mega-engineering (Cahora Bassa and Kariba Dams); to mega-conservation (Kavango-Zambezi). All three frames are about humankind dreaming big, mega-big; they are about romantic, idealistic humanity at its best—by and large.\nCorridor 19: Sixth Extinction (Somali to Sudan): 1940 – present ’From dumping site to denudation to civil war’\nOn Boxing Day, 26 December 2004, a magnitude 9 earthquake struck off the northwest coast of Sumatra. This unleashed the tsunami that was on everyone’s lips. The leading wave of the tsunami\nsped west across the Indian Ocean at greater than 500 mph. After 7.5 h and a journey of 3000 miles (4828 km) it struck the coast of Somali (with waves now down to 4 ft.). Around 290,000 people were killed outright that fateful Boxing Day, some 300 of them in Somali. But the tsunami had a more far-reaching menacing effect along littoral Somali. It unearthed a grim malevolent truth: along over 400 miles of shoreline, ’the turbo-charged wave churned up reinforced containers of hazardous toxic waste that European companies had been dumping a short distance offshore for more than a decade.’ Some of those containers were ripped open, releasing an ungodly mix of industrial debris: from radioactive nuclear waste to hospital waste. Serious long-term effects on human health are predicted by UNEP. Cancers are showing up.\nThis Sixth Extinction Corridor, running from the Horn of Africa to the desert-scape of western Sudan, is included by way of an object lesson. The focus here is on virtually every calamity that can befall human beings and nature—spreading desertification, disease, civil war, dumping of toxic waste, terrorism, piracy, and disappearance of natural habitat. This Corridor offers a warning to Homo sapiens, harshly proclaiming the ill effects of human negligence and destructiveness.\nCorridor 20: Carbon Footprint (Algeria to Egypt): AD 1900–2010 ’Oil deposits to carbon footprint across the northern Sahara’\nOil could be seen as one of the principal arsonists behind the Sixth Extinction and global warming spinning out of control. Across the northern belt of Africa, from Algeria to Egypt, is emerging a new front in the relentless spread of our carbon footprint. Large petroleum reserves occur in Ordovician to Tertiary reservoirs spread through the region.\nThis Corridor takes us directly into the realm of global warming, into the whole question of managing our planetary home holistically—before it is too late. It is about Energy, about oil-rich nations holding oil-poor nations to ransom; about the international oil giants holding sway, and about pipelines bringing oil and gas vast distances to Europe, and to a burgeoning number of other places. It is about the international car-manufacturers choosing the pace of introduction of new technology. Oil is too often a trump card in international negotiations. And the debate over nuclear energy comes into this: symbolically significant is that the first aboveground atom-bomb testing site by the French was in this Saharan belt (western Algeria, 1950s–1960s). But it is also about new visions for new energy technologies and the reduction of the African carbon footprint; and about vast solar energy potential—again to power Europe—across this Corridor.\nA further focus of the Corridor is on the growing concern over the vital resource of fresh water. It is about the extensive sub-Saharan ground-water reservoirs: what part will they play in future potential conflicts in the worsening equation between population growth and water shortage as global warming continues."

First as Homo erectus, then Homo sapiens and finally as Homo sapiens sapiens, we have spread out of Africa to inhabit and change the Earth. Each step of\nthe way, Africa was our ancestral home. Africa has always been the crucible.\nIn modern day Israel, near Mt. Carmel, there are two caves perched a couple of hundred metres apart along the slopes of a wadi.

    "heading": "4.1. AAC 4. ‘African Pole of Rotation’",
    "text": "More than a decade ago, Kevin Burke first suggested that the Cameroon Volcanoes coincided approximately with the pole of rotation of the African Plate during its epic separation, along the mid Atlantic ridge, from the Americas and its simultaneous collision with Eurasia along the complex subduction margin flanking North Africa (Burke, 1996). The ca. 70 Ma life of the CVL tracks lithosphere–asthenosphere mantle activity over at least 40% of the life-span of the African plate and the drifting apart between Africa and South America. However, during this entire period of relative motion, that first heralded the onset of formation of the African Plate some 180 million years ago, Africa has not moved far, horizontally, in absolute terms. Except for its mostly anti-clockwise rotation, Africa has remained close to its present position relative to its deep underlying mantle, and in particular over the last 30– 40 million years it has remained almost stationary (Burke, 1996, 2001). Whatever the detailed origin of the CVL, it clearly has left an indelible and unique tectonic ‘stamp’ as an axis of rotation in the global framework of plate tectonics. Nowhere else in the world is surface geology and geomorphology linked to mantle interaction above a plate’s pole of rotation over such an expanse of time.\nOne important spin-off from this is that paleoclimate records along the APR Corridor, from volcanic lakes for example, will prove especially valuable. Such records are very sparse, globally, in equatorial regions; and yet they hold the key to understanding the relationships between northern and southern hemisphere climatic fluctuations and changes. Having remained relatively stationary for so long an interval at approximately the same latitude, Africa provides unparalleled scientific opportunities. This is the geo-legacy – hence the title – of Corridor 4."

    "text": "The African Pole of Rotation (APR) Corridor has the Cameroon Volcanic Line as its geological foundation. For scientists, this Line is a major geological structure of the African continent offering great potential across a range of related fronts: understanding the structure of the crust and the dynamics of the underlying mantle; researching the biological and mineral resources and the natural hazards; addressing the various socio-economic impacts on the regions its crosses. But local populations would more likely view the Line from the perspective of their faith: it hosts most of their sacred sites (peaks, forests, lakes, caves, animals). One could hear local people arguing this on national radio news during the erup-\ntions of Mt. Cameroon in 1999 and 2000. In terms of biodiversity, sacred areas are probably the oldest form of habitat protection on the planet (Dudley et al., 2005a,b). The Cameroon Volcanic Line contains many such cases showing how over the century’s local populations – through their faiths – have protected sacred sites from environmental degradation in general and from biodiversity loss in particular. Here is a point where science and local indigenous knowledge and beliefs can meet to forge a trusting and effective partnership between scientists, communities, traditional leaders and government authorities towards the holistic co-curatorship of the APR Corridor."

This landscape forms the Cameroon Volcanic Line, comprising numerous plugs, cones and craters including crater lakes, which stretche southwest to northeast for some 1600 km. Volcanism is recorded as far back as 40 Ma and is still active today as in Mt. Cameroon (latest eruption 28 May 2000). Closely associated is a chain of over 60 anorogenic ring complexes (granites, syenites, gabbros) ranging in diameter from 1 to 10 km and in age from 70 to 6 Ma (see synthesis by Déruelle et al., 2007). These represent the erosional remnants of the roots of volcanoes that were emplaced into the ancient lithosphere of Cameroon."

    "heading": "4.3.1. Story told or not yet told by the CVL",
    "text": "The CVL is unique. It is the only example on Earth of an active intraplate alignment of volcanoes – a ‘hot-line’ – synchronously developed in both the oceanic and continental domains linked to a common mantle source. This has made it an exciting research theme among Earth scientists over the past five or six decades. Several different models or combinations of model have been proposed to explain the origin of the CVL: plume, rifting, seafloor spreading, ‘en-échelon’ faulting—see discussions by Fitton (1980), Moreau et al. (1987), Halliday et al. (1988), Déruelle et al. (1991), Burke (1996; 2001), Marzoli et al. (2000), Ngako et al. (2006). However, none of the proposed models consistently fits the geology, geochemistry and geochronology—there is, for instance, no obvious progressive change in age or chemistry of the volcanic rocks along the CVL (Fig. 4b). A recent model for the CVL is a ‘hot line’ along a lithospheric ‘crack’, representing the surface expression of mantle convection currents that may have caused melting of the lithosphere during reactivation of older fractures (Meyers et al., 1998; Montigny et al., 2004; Déruelle et al., 2007). This seems to be supported by seismic and gravimetric data in the oceanic domain. Between 2005 and 2006, the continental sector of the CVL was seismically surveyed using 32 stations distributed along and around the line. The results show a low velocity anomaly beneath the CVL at a depth of at least 350 km, suggesting that the CVL is triggered from the upper mantle (Euler et al., 2007), but connections to the deeper mantle, as predicted from numerical models, mostly remain to be explored. The origin of the Cameroon Volcanic Line – stretching across an ocean-continent boundary – is unresolved and offers a highly challenging scientific detective story that can intimately reveal how interactive asthenosphere–lithosphere processes contribute to shaping our plates."

    "text": "Many authors have stressed the close similarities in shape and orientation between the CVL and the nearby Benue Trough in Nigeria (Fig. 4d), an early structure formed during the final rifting phase\nof Gondwana and the earliest opening of the South-central Atlantic. In spite of considerable research effort since the 1950s, no single coherent hypothesis has emerged to explain the CVL. Some answers to understanding the origin of the CVL, and its unique contribution to plate tectonic theory may, therefore, lie further afield. For example, the genetic association between the volcanism of the Adamawa and Biu Plateaus in central Cameroon and eastern Nigeria, respectively, and the CVL is still a matter of debate (Fitton, 1980; Halliday et al., 1988; Poudjom Djomani et al., 1997; Marzoli et al., 2000; Déruelle et al., 2007). Because of this close spatial and temporal relationship that has produced similar volcanic landscapes with crater lakes, we extend the APR Corridor across these regions. The geodynamic processes in all these regions witness Africa’s drift and/or rotation associated with various other processes—doming, reworked older lithospheric structures—interacting or not, since the break up and drifting apart of Gondwana from the Late Triassic and through the Cenozoic. Other geological evidence suggests that the foundations for the origin of the CVL might be traced back to ca. 500 Ma at the end of the Pan-African orogeny (Moreau et al., 1987; Toteu et al., 1991; Ngako et al., 2006). Some important high peaks along the Line are made up of Pan-African granitoids (e.g., Alantika and Mandara mountains).\nThe continental termination of the APR Corridor is the Jos Plateau in central Nigeria. It consists of Cambrian to Ordovician granites (Older Granites), Jurassic tin-bearing granites (Younger Granites), and numerous extinct volcanic cones and basaltic flows of Pliocene age (Schlueter, 2006).\nThe Jos Plateau also constitutes another type of ‘hot-spot’ – an anthropogenic ‘melting pot’ – acknowledging the profound impact of indigenous iron-smelting techniques developed by the Nok people in this region around the early-mid first millennium BC (Tylecote, 1975; Alpern, 2005). This African technology would have been exported first by Bantu-speaking people during their subsequent southward migrations across the rest of Africa (Alpern, 2005)."

They are co-curators of the geological and biological beauty of the Corridor and they share its diversified socio-economic potentials and its various threats. The richness of the Corridor lies in its crossing from the Atlantic Ocean into the continent, and in its geological and geomorphological foundation associated with a marked progressive shift in vegetation from the equatorial rain forest in the south—Debuncha, a locality situated 20 km west of the coastal town of Limbe in Cameroon, is the second wettest locality in the world (Fraser et al., 1998)—to the dry savannah of the SoudanoSahelian region to the north. This has forged the biological, cultural and economical uniqueness of the APR Corridor."

    "text": "The APR possesses some of the richest biodiversity in Africa. Of the 10 Global Eco-regions recognised by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF, 2000) in central Africa, the Corridor passes through eight, and five of these (Cameroonian Highland Forests, Gulf of Guinea Mangrove, Cameroon Crater Lakes, Mandara Plateau Mosaic, Congolian Coastal Forest) are totally or partially genetically linked with the Corridor. This picture is enhanced by the presence of a number of major National Parks and reserves concentrated along the Corridor (Obo in Príncipé, Gran Caldera and Southern Highlands in Bioko Island, Santchou, Kurup, Oku, Faro, Waza, Mozogo Gokoro and Mayo Louti on the Cameroon mainland, for example, Fig. 4c).\nMany parameters have shaped the richness of this biodiversity: (1) the presence of a string of volcanic mountain peaks, ideal as refuge for the flora and fauna; Maisels et al. (2000) have, for example, described rare plants on the summit of Mt Oku); (2) the presence of an archipelago of islands sufficiently distant from one another, and of a spread of ages to less than 5 Ma, providing a natural laboratory for biological colonisation (the oldest geological dates recorded for the Príncipé, São Tomé, and Annobon islands are 31 Ma, 14 Ma, and 4.8 Ma respectively, (Lee et al., 1994); (3) the presence of numerous crater lakes, both on the oceanic and continental sectors of APR, providing special habitats for endemic species (WWF records that 75% of the fish species and approximately one-third of the aquatic insects in the Cameroon Crater Lakes are endemic); and (4) the presence of mangroves (the biggest in Africa) on either side of Mt. Cameroon, in the Douala Bay and Rio del Rey, which, despite the absence of endemic species, provide refuge for endangered species, feeding areas for marine fishes, and sites for bird concentrations during migration (Tognetti, 2001).\nAs a plan for co-curatorship, the Government of Cameroon has recently created the Takamanda National Park which links eastwards with Nigeria’s Cross River National Park, thus ensuring a vast trans-boundary refuge for the endangered Cross River Gorillas (Oates et al., 2007)."

Nowadays, although hunting is illegal in many countries, it is one of the most important threats to faunal biodiversity; and it is particularly so in this Corridor. For example, a study by Albrechtsen et al. (2007) on the Bioko Island showed that between March 1996 and October 1998, ‘hunting incursions, especially into the south of the island, may have resulted in drastic faunal losses’. Bioko is no longer a paradise for monkeys. Monkeys, especially, are greatly endangered on the island. Despite a relatively recent ban issued by the government, the bushmeat trade at Malabo (capital of Equatorial Guinea on north of Bioko) still flourishes, certifying that ‘the ban alone is not enough’ to curb demand (Morell, 2008) – here is an urgent need to develop new partnerships in Earth stewardship science.\nApart from the negative effects of the bushmeat trade on sustaining biodiversity, threats to human health are severe. Morell (2008) reported: ‘Part of the presidential edict explains that monkey meat is unsafe because ‘‘primates are carriers of epidemics and other pathologies” that can infect people. (Indeed, epidemiologists have found several simian immunodeficiency viruses in western and central Africa primate species, among which the precursors of HIV-1 and HIV2 have been identified’. Infected chimpanzees have been found in the rainforests of southeastern Cameroon, where bushmeat trade is also rife, and which is considered the likely focus of the early evolution and diversification of HIV-1. Molecular dating of viral DNA sequences reveals that HIV first jumped to human hosts early in the 1900s (Sharp and Harn, 2008)."

Unfortunately, this history also includes many threats to which people living in the region must adapt. Frequent volcanic eruptions of Mt. Cameroon have been recorded since the 19th century – in 1868, 1909, 1922, 1954, 1959, 1982, 1999, 2000 (Déruelle et al., 2000, 2007). The 1909 eruption and associated earthquakes particularly impacted on the social and political evolution of Cameroon. Exacerbating great panic and grave\ndestruction affecting the population around the volcano (Mann, 1909; Njome et al., this issue), was the threat of expropriation in 1910 of ‘Plateau Joss’ (Douala city) in the plan to transfer the capital of Cameroon from Buea that was deeply affected by the earthquake—to the more stable region of Douala. This instigated the very first serious geohazard-related political crisis in Cameroon. It led finally to relocation of the capital to Yaounde, 250 km to the east, by the German colonisers (Messina and van Slageren, 2005).\nThe volcanic eruptions of Mt. Cameroon, and the high rainfall in the region, are generally associated with severe sustained damage to both biodiversity and infrastructure. Populations along the slopes of this mountain live in constant threat of landslides, the most tragic having been that of 2001 resulting in 24 deaths (Ayonghe et al., 2004).\nAlso well known is the explosive release of CO2 gas from lakes Mounoun in 1984 and Nyos in 1986 (Le Guern and Sigvaldason, 1989), with tragic consequences for humans and animals. The Government of Cameroon, with international support, has committed the Institute for Geological and Mining Research (IRGM) to conduct the ambitious international project of degassing lakes Nyos and Mounoun; as well as to monitor volcanic activity through a Centre for Volcano Observatory now operational at Ekona on the slope of Mt. Cameroon (Kusakabe et al., 2008; Ateba et al., 2009)."

The Barombi-Mbo Lake deposits (to ca. 28,000 BP) are the oldest yet recorded (Giresse et al., 1994), but more than 40 volcanic crater lakes distributed all along the Corridor from Pagalú to the Biu Plateau (NE Nigeria) are potential targets for more extended and detailed records. Research into this rich scientific resource has hardly begun.\nArchaeological excavations at Shum Laka (de Maret et al., 1995; Lavachery, 2001) provide further potential for tracing paleo-environment changes related to early human activities going back to at least 30,000 BP. Similarly, the weathering history preserved in numerous bauxite deposits derived from volcanic rocks in Cameroon and Nigeria provide unparalleled opportunities to document robust paleoclimate records (Schwarz, 1997; Salzmann et al., 2002).

The settlement dynamics of this multitude of ethnic groups has various causes and sources. For example, through the European-driven slave trade via São Tomé and Príncipé; successive conquests by various ethnic groups from the Adamawa Plateau; and Arab slave raids from the north. The Fulani Djihad on the Adamawa Plateau and the plains to the north has deeply impacted the settlement pattern of Cameroon in general, and the highlands of west Cameroon in particular (Herault, 1993; Kuete et al., 1993); and in the north, the Galim-Atlantika-Mandara\nMountains are the historical refugee encampments for populations escaping from various slave raids and Fulani Djihad (Fanso, 1989; Neba, 1999; Hudgens and Trillo, 1999; Mouctar Mbah, 2003). These forced movements have contributed also to the dense population along the Cameroon Volcanic Line—where we estimate that about 55% of all Cameroonians live, and where the rich volcanic soils, especially the southern slopes, attract agriculture.\nThis settlement history has produced, through the centuries, strong hierarchically structured civilisations based on Chiefs and Fons in the south, and Sultans and Lamibe in the north. Since 2007, a number of the palaces (Garoua, Maroua, Bafoussam, Bandjoun and Foumban) have been selected by the UNESCO office in Yaoundé for an inventory of their collections and the training of their curators (UNESCO, 2007)."

The varying influence of the British, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese has been deeply and widely absorbed.\nThe earliest contact with Europeans was in the late 15th Century with the arrival of the Portuguese: São Tomé was re-discovered first (21 December 1471); followed by Príncipé (17 January 1472), and Bioko (formerly Fernando Poo) and the Cameroon coast, which was invaded sometime in that same year; and lastly Pagalú (formerly Anobon) on January 1, 1473. São Tomé and Príncipé remained a Portuguese colony (until 1975), but after their initial colonisation by Portugal, Bioko and Anobon fell under Spanish control, in 1778, in exchange for territory in South America and later became a Spanish colony until 1968.\nAlthough the British were present on the Cameroonian coast since 1850, Germans were the first to sign a treaty with coastal chiefs in 1884, and later that year proclaimed a German protectorate.\nAfter 14 European countries and the United States gathered in Berlin, in 1884, under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck to decide on the future of Africa, Cameroon became a German colony. It remained so up to the end of the First World War, after which it was split between France and Great Britain, with the border roughly following the Cameroon Volcanic Line. Francophone Cameroon east of CVL became independent in 1960; and, following a referendum in 1961, the south-western Anglophone part—previously administrated by the UK from Nigeria—chose to join Francophone Cameroon to form a new Cameroon with two official languages (French and English). The Nigerian territory was divided into many protectorates in 1900, before becoming a British colony from 1914 until 1960."

In response to the slave raids and the dilution of the population, Africans developed many strategies to sustain their social organisations, cultures and religions. The mountains of the northern part of the Corridor offered convenient refuge with its caverns, underground tunnels, rock outcrops, ramparts and fortresses (Mouctar Mbah, 2003).

In addition, a variety of dialects have evolved from colonial languages. The Grassland Bantu of the Highlands of West Cameroon are considered the most linguistically fragmented of any region in Africa (Watters, 2003). Of interest are the Fulfulde (a language of West Africa spoken by Fulani in Cameroon), which has evolved over time into the most common language of communication between the majority of ethnic groups along the northern part of the Corridor; Pidgin English (Kamtok) is spoken by people in the southern part of the Corridors. The diversity of contributions to the settlement of São Tomé and Príncipé is reflected in the three surviving Creole languages that evolved on the archipelago: Sãotomense and Angolar, both spoken in São Tomé; and Príncipénse, spoken in Príncipé. ‘These Creole languages are characterized by an African substratum provided by Kwa and Western Bantu languages, and they share significant proportions of their lexicon, which is predominantly derived from archaic and modern Portuguese’ (Tomás et al., 2002)."

For centuries these special places have played a central role in the many belief systems of local populations. To mention just a few examples: Mount Kupe and Lake Menegouba for the Bakossi ethnic group in SW Cameroon; the caves of Mt. Jim for the Nyem-Nyem group of the Adamawa Plateau; or the highlands of the Mandara Mountains in far northern Cameroon for the Matakam (Messina and van Slageren, 2005; Wild et al., 2005; Mouctar Mbah, 2003).\nToday, the religious beliefs of the people living along the Corridor have evolved as a result of the Fulani invasions and European colonisation. Broadly, the pattern is twofold: primarily indigenous and Christian in the Gulf of Guinea and most of the southern part of the continental sector; and primarily indigenous and Muslim in the northern sectors. Separating these two is the Bamoun Kingdom, with its capital Foumban. The Sultan Njoya (1875–1933), King of the Bamoun, with his indigenous roots, was the artisan of a harmonious tolerance of both Christianity and Islam in his kingdom (Messina and van Slageren, 2005; Mukum Mbaku, 2005). Development of Christianity during the middle of the 20th Century in northern Cameroon was enhanced by populations secured by geological and geomorphic barriers—the Mandara Mountains and the swamps of the Logone and Chari rivers—that protected them over\nthe centuries from clashes with Fulani (Messina and van Slageren, 2005)."

A very variable use of sustainable indigenous materials shows up in the way people have designed their homes, especially before the introduction of concrete during colonisation. For example, the people around Mt. Cameroon and Manegouba—a region dominated by mudstones, tuffs and scoria—built carabotte houses using planks from the local corkwood tree. These traditional wooden houses appear today, most appropriately, in this seismically active environment (Ateba et al., 2009). In the grassland of the west Cameroon highlands, lateritic soil from the weathering of lavas favours the use of sun-dried mud holding indigenous Raphia bamboo (and today bricks) to build houses and has resulted in the imposing architecture of the palaces of the Chiefs and Fons. Farther north still, rocks derived from the granitic Mandara Mountains of north Cameroon are preferentially used by the Matakam ethnic group to build their circular houses and walled perimeters (Hilaire, 1975)."

Considering repeated cultural mixing over the centuries, it is not surprising that many instruments found here—drums, xylophones, flutes, sanzas, horn trumpets, rattles, harps etc., are common to most of sub-Saharan Africa, but with frequent adaptations of design according to local environment. Of special interest is the ‘talking drum’, a long-standing mode of African communication widely acknowledged as a forerunner of Morse-code telegraphy. Two types of ‘talking drum’ are used along the Corridor. The first, with animal hide at either end connected by leather cords running the length of its body, are prominent in Northern Nigeria and North Cameroon (this instrument bears close resemblance to those from West Africa); the second is a slit-drum made of wood from an appropriate species of tree, and is used in many communities of the West Highlands of Cameroon. This latter drum is hosted usually in a special house situated in a dedicated place within the king’s domain (Djache Nzefa, 1994; Knöpfli, 2002). For example, the house ‘‘Kindi” hosts the ‘Big Drum’ (Plates 3.2 and 3.3) that today is part of the tourist route of the Bamoun King’s Palace (West Cameroon). An indigenous mural in the ‘‘Kindi” tells the remarkable story of how the Bamoun King and the chief of his army coordinated the building and transportation of the drum to its present location."

Famous is the Mount Cameroon ‘Race of Hope’, an annual international race starting in the town of Buea and ascending the slope of Mt. Cameroon. Since 1972, athletes from all over the world have challenged the summit of this spectacular mountain. The Government of Cameroon was instrumental in linking the first race to the first major agricultural event—the 1973 Agric Show—held in Buea (Ongbehok, 2009), one of the most productive agricultural regions of the country. This initial commitment of the government ensured the success and sustainability of the race. The association of these two events was, in fact, the survival of a secular tradition of harvest festivals common to many ethnic groups in\nthe region. One such example is the ‘Nguon’, a 3-day cultural event of the Bamoun ethnic group in the western highlands of Cameroon, a tradition that goes back more than 600 years. The festival encompasses various aspects of the Bamoun culture and traditions (Harvest, Secret Society, Supreme Court, Ritual Dance, Art, and Sport). ‘The ‘‘Nguon” is like the blood of Nchare Yen—it flows through the vein of Bamoun people’ (James, 2008).\nThe grasslands of West Cameroon are famous for the spectacular costumes paraded during traditional dances associated with ritual and funeral ceremonies. The numerous caves in the Tignere and Galim regions, west of Ngaoundere, which for centuries served as hide-outs for local populations against attacks from invaders, have forged the culture of the Nyem-Nyem ethnic group. Mount Jim has become a platform for the Nyem-Nyem festival to celebrate their resistance against the Baare-Chambe, Fulani slave raiders and German soldiers who attacked the Galim Mountains in 1901 (Mouctar Mbah, 2003).\nAside from the various annual festivals organised in the main cities of north Cameroon during the tourist season (November– May), the deployment of the Fantasia—processions of warriors wearing extravagant costumes and riding on decorated horses running at full speed—constitutes one of the most spectacular cultural events in the region. Traditionally, the fantasia was designed to celebrate Islam, to demonstrate allegiance to the Lamibe, and to foster community solidarity; but today, it is also organised by the Lamibe in honour of important guests (Youngstedt, 2008)."

With its highest elevation at 2010 m, the granitic Jos Plateau is the only place in Nigeria that has a temperate climate. Here, we find the earliest evidence of iron smelting (ca. 600 BC) in sub-Saharan Africa. The plateau was the home of the Nok Civilisation that flourished from ca. 1000 BC to 200 AD, and then mysteriously disappeared: by oral tradition in the Bantu community in west Cameroon, ‘the king cleaved the earth with his hand and disappeared below with his people’. The Nok, with negroid features, honed their skills in crafting iron to a fine artistic pitch.\nNode 2: Biu Plateau ‘Sacred crocodiles of Tila’. The Biu Plateau’s most striking features are the numerous well-defined extinct volcanic cones and craters aligned roughly parallel to the CVL, and rising 60–200 m above the plateau.

It appears as isolated volcanic plugs and sub-circular granitic massifs in an environment dominated by Precambrian (Atlantika-Mandara Mountains) rocks, by Cretaceous sandstones of the Upper Benue Trough, and by recent sedimentary cover of the Chad Basin.\nThe Soudanian savannah north of the Adamawa Plateau includes important National Parks (Benue, Faro, Boubadjida, and Waza) and a network of protected areas. It hosts major concentrations of African megafauna which include the Savannah elephant, black rhino, buffalo, giraffe, and numerous antelope species, notably the Lord Derby (giant) eland; and anong the predators, the lion, leopard, spotted hyena, cheetah and African wild dog.\nThe arrival of the Fulani created a new settlement pattern in the region and deeply reshaped it politically, culturally and economically.\nNode 3: Sao Civilisation ‘skilful craftsmen’. The Sao Civilisation (6th– 15th centuries AD), one of the oldest in the Cameroon, flourished in the extensive wetland plains to the south of Lake Chad. They were amongst the earliest humans to leave cultural artefacts (sculptures of human and animal figures, coins, funerary urns, household utensils, jewellery, pottery, spears) indicative of their presence in the region. They interbred with the indigenous people across the region—with today’s Kotoko ethnic group amongst others claiming to be their descendants.\nNode 4: Waza National Park ‘West African giraffe’. Waza village is built on the northernmost granitic massif of the Cameroon Volcanic Line and has given its name to the internationally known Waza National Park (a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 1979), rich in birds and mammals, including lion, elephant and one of the last remaining populations of the West African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta). The park is one of the most rapidly growing tourist destinations in Cameroon, with visitors from around the world.\nNode 5: Maroua ‘Back to Neolithic’. Maroua is the capital of the Far North, the most populous region in Cameroon, and also its most attractive city for tourism—famed for its craftsmanship in tanning and forging. Maroua was also one of the three biggest centres of Fulani settlement in North Cameroon at the beginning of 19th Century, forcing the locals to migrate either to the west into the Mandara Mountains or to the east into the Logone wetlands. The region hosts many archaeological sites, such as in the metamorphic basalt inselbergs (hills) around the town and beyond in the plains, that may tell the settlement history of the region back to the Neolithic.\nNode 6: Rumsiki/Kapsiki (Mandara Mountains) ‘Landscape of volcanic plugs’. The landscape of the area is dominated by towering columnar volcanic plugs, creating a spectacular scenery considered amongst the most beautiful in the world. It is one of the most important tourist regions in Cameroon. We are here in the heart of the Mandara Mountains that have been, for centuries, the refuge for many communities escaping from successive conquests, seeking to control the rich soils of the Diamare plains.

Even through oral traditions, the origin and meaning of these petrogryphs are unknown to local populations.\nThe engravings are poorly dated, but none are considered to be older than the Iron Age (2500–1500 BP). Recent industrial extraction of marble has endangered the site and the Cameroonian Ministry of Culture proposed it as a potential UNESCO Cultural Heritage Site in 2006.\nPlate 2.

However in the place of fish exists a special species of frog, the Lake Oku Clawed Frog, Xenopus longipes. Photo 2: This tiny aquatic frog is found only in Lake Oku in the Northwest Region. Frogs of the genus Xenopus are usually difficult to catch because they move very fast in the water propelled by their large webbed feet. Xenopus longipes, on the other hand, is very easy to catch, probably because it has been isolated in a remote lake with few predators.

Garoua city, in the Upper Benue Valley, is surrounded by numerous outliers of tabular sandstone of great scenic beauty. Most important of these is the Tinglin Plateau (400–500 m), refuge of the Fali ethnic group (now absorbed and converted to Islam) escaping from Fulani raids. Archaeological evidence shows the presence of settlements here as early as the 8th Century AD—the rich plains of the Benue have been coveted for centuries. The river port at Garoua gives this inland region intermittent access to the sea: it is the potential beneficiary of\nan ambitious regional project to transfer water from the Oubangui River to save Lake Chad from further desiccation.\nNode 9: Adamawa Plateau ‘Centre of Bantu migration’. The Adamawa Plateau is considered to be the ‘water tower’ of Cameroon and is the transition zone between the southern forests and the northern Soudano-Sahelian region.

The Bantu people have their origin (3000–1500 BC) in this general region, and it was the emigration centre from which they colonised southern and eastern Africa: reaching Angola and Uganda by 1000 BC and South Africa by 500 AD.\nNode 10: Mount Djim ‘Nyem-Nyem festival’. Mount Djim in the Alantika mountain belt is a historical and cultural site of the Nyem-Nyem Group. The mountain contains numerous caverns that served as refuge for the Nyem-Nyem people from Fulani slave raiders and German penetration. Each year in January, the NyemNyem Festival celebrating this resistance is held. The festival in-\nvolves dances by young men and women, mimicking both domestic and wild animals. It is an exceptional symbiosis between man and his environment, and between culture and the conservation of biodiversity."

    "text": "Heritage Nodes 11–13 fall within the highlands of West Cameroon (1000–2500 m)—covering the west and the northwest regions of the country. Mount Bamboutos reaching to 2740 m and Mt Oku to 3008 m, dominate the landscape that is sculpted out of volcanic\nrocks, and includes scattered Precambrian granitic and gneissic massifs and spectacular Cambrian shear zones.\nThe high population density has led to extreme deforestation associated with a severe threat to biodiversity. Montane forest, such as that of Mount Oku, the sacred forests generally surrounding royal palaces, and those around the numerous crater lakes of the region, are of prime importance in biodiversity conservation.\nArchaeological excavations at Shump Laka (15 km SW of Bamenda city) show evidence of early settlement in the range of 30,000–7000 years ago. The more recent appearance of the Grassland Bantu occupying the region today occurred through successive migrations since the 15th Century: they are organised now into several kingdoms with a strong focus on traditions and culture.\nNode 11: Lake Nyos and Mount Oku ‘silent killer & sacred forest’. Lake Nyos in the West Highlands of Cameroon is known worldwide for its ‘silent’ and catastrophic release of CO2 that suddenly exsolves from the bottom lake water when it is disturbed by sudden storms. In 1986 such an overnight event caused over 3 million m3 of heavy CO2 gas to creep down the mountain slopes overwhelming and silently killing more than 1750 people and 3000 cattle in their sleep. Today, the lake remains a threat as CO2 from its deep magmatic source continues to recharge the lake waters. Nyos is a prime example, like Mount Cameroon, where a major geohazard site has inspired co-operation. Scientists from all over the world have joined with Cameroonian leaders and local communities to ‘slay’ this natural killer. The lake is now a natural laboratory for scientific and technological innovation – to monitor and control CO2 levels literally through letting off (CO2) ‘steam’ through deeply penetrating piping systems. This is a unique example of Earth stewardship and partnership between science and society.\nMont Oku (3010 m) is a stratovolcano (22–31 Ma) in the West Highlands of Cameroon. The region comprises the largest and highest in altitude remaining patches of montane forest in West Africa. This important habitat harbours many endemic species of both plants and animals. Nearby Lake Oku, a crater lake lying at 2235 m, hosts numbers of endangered amphibian and rare bird species. Although the Oku forest is considered by the Oku people to be sacred, and thus protected, there is still a critical need for effective conservation.\nNode 12: Foumban Sultanate ‘Ngouon Festival’. Foumban is the capital of the Bamoun Sultanate founded in 1395—with the present Sultan being the 19th in an unbroken lineage going back to that date. The town is the cradle of a rich history that is recalled during each ‘Ngouon Festival’, a bi-annual, 3-day celebration of Bamoun culture and tradition. The festival embraces many issues related to the life of the Sultanate, including the assessment of the king’s performance as manager of the Bamouns. The palace, built-in 1917, was renovated by UNESCO in 1981.\nNode 13: Grassland Kingdoms ‘Volcanic soil to a spread of palaces’. The fertile volcanic soil has encouraged numerous waves of settlement of grassfield people; resulting in the region being the most densely populated in Cameroon. This dynamic flux has produced well-structured communities whose life is centred on extensive kingdom palaces with complex organisation (power and cosmogony). Rich cultural traditions and art are vividly expressed during grandiose funeral ceremonies and many other festivals of the Bamileke ethnic group. The Grassland Kingdoms extend into both the Francophone West and Anglophone North-West Regions of Cameroon."

    "text": "Heritage Nodes 14, 15 and 16 fall within the southernmost volcanic massifs of the continental portion of the CVL. Included are Mount Manengouba and Mount Cameroon, linked by the Tombel Graben. The region is extensively covered by cinder cones, explosive craters, lava flows, and scoriaceous material. The coastal sedimentary basin provides Cameroon with most of its oil currently the only significant natural energy resource tapped in the country.\nThe heterogeneity of landscapes supports a rich biodiversity across this region: a youthful volcanic environment, tropical rainforest, montane forest, mangroves, crater lakes and National Parks (e.g., Korup). The forests are home to the endangered Cross River Gorilla. Fortunately, the Limbe Botanic Garden at the southern slope of Mount Cameroon, with its 1500 plant taxa (1000 herbaceous, 500 woody trees) is becoming an important tool for education, science, conservation and sustainable tourism.\nBefore colonialism, the region was the cradle of the Sawa people comprising various ethnic groups around Mount Manengouba, Mount Cameroon and Douala. The annual Ngondo Festival forms an important platform for their cultural integration. In addition, ongoing immigration from all over the country of people in search of jobs in the industrial plantations (coffee, banana, palm oil, rubber tree, etc.) or for virgin lands for agriculture has brought settlement to the region during the colonial and post-colonial times. In consequence, the region is the most cosmopolitan anywhere in Cameroon.\nNode 14: Mounts Kupe and Manengouba ‘Twin Lakes, mountains & faith’. Mount Kupe is the highest peak (2064 m) of the Bakossi Mountains. Its granitic basement is covered by recent volcanic cones. Patches of mid-altitude and montane rainforest are preserved from place to place. The poignant words of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF, 2006) closely reflect the feeling of Bakossi people towards their mountain: ‘The wise men of the Mount Kupe rainforest area are at a loss as to what suddenly unmasked the myth that once made their forest a traditionally sacred, no-go area’.\nMount Manengouba, a polygenic volcanic complex (ca. 1.55 Ma), is a well-preserved stratovolcano (2411 m). The picturesque landscape includes concentric calderas and the famous ‘Twin Lakes’, showing a striking contrast in water colour (female-green and blue-male). The lakes are a sacred site for the Bakossi people, who consider Mount Manengouba to be their cradle: with their ancestors living in the lakes.\nNode 15: Barombi Mbo Crater Lake ’28,000-year near equatorial paleoclimate records’. This is the largest of the crater lakes (1 Ma, 4.15 km2, and maximum depth 110 m) of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. With near equatorial paleoclimate records from pollen analyses going back to 28,000 BP, the lake deposits span the critical interval from the last glacial maximum. Local populations in the vicinity have overcome the fear of Nyos-type gaseous explosions and have launched (in May 2009) a government-supported Canoe Competition on the lake.\nNode 16: Mount Cameroon ‘Geohazard to Race of Hope’ (63 Ma). Mount Cameroon is the highest peak (4095 m) in subSaharan West Africa and is the only active volcano along the continental sector of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. It erupted no less than seven times in the 20th Century: 1909, 1922, 1954, 1959, 1982, and 1999 and, most recently, in May 2000. It is a major geohazard over the local rural communities: with the threat of devastating lava flows, earthquakes and landslides. The ‘Mount Cameroon Race of Hope’—which we see as a symbolic response to the geohazard—has been run each year since 1973, and involves participants from across the world."

    "text": "They comprise the four volcanic islands, Bioko, Príncipé, São Tomé and Pagalú, making up the oceanic part of the CVL. Geologically, they comprise similar volcanic peaks; but vary a good deal in detail and age. Overall they comprise numerous basalt flows, plugs and dykes, cones and crater lakes.\n‘Bioko is a continental-shelf island that was recently connected to the African mainland, whereas Príncipé, São Tomé and Annobon are truly oceanic and have never been connected with each other or with the mainland. As a result, Bioko supports a much more diverse flora and fauna but with relatively low levels of endemism at the species level, whereas the oceanic islands are relatively depauperate because of their isolation, but rich in endemic taxa’ (Jones, 1994). The archipelago—especially with the crater-lake deposits providing ideal sites for analyses of its preserved pollen—is a unique living laboratory for the study of island biogeography, evolution and biodiversity. Africa’s Galapagos!\nNone of the three oceanic islands show any signs of habitation before their discovery by the Portuguese in 1471. The earliest settlements were those of the Portuguese—who imported African slaves from Angola, Congo and Benin. The economic evolution of the islands revolved mainly around agriculture and suffered from frequent slave revolts. A further, and hardly ideal, consequence of European colonialism and the partition of Africa is that the two central islands (São Tomé and Príncipé) constitute an independent country, whilst those at either end of the archipelago (Bioko and Pagalú) are part of Equatorial Guinea. Aside from anything else, this bears strongly on future conservation strategies.\nThe recent discovery of important oil reserves around these islands and the coastal Gulf of Guinea has given a new impetus to the economy of the islands, but has also generated new threats for potential pollution and ecosystem disaster. Here, then, is a new important challenge for cooperation and partnership between ‘those that fret and those that gamble’ – here exploiters and explorers must forge new collaborative Earth stewardship.\nNode 17: Bioko ‘Monkey Paradise?’. Bioko (1 Ma, 2017 sq km, 3011 m, pop 124,000), the biggest of the Gulf islands, consists of two volcanic massifs, with the highest reaching a stately 3011 m; and three crater lakes. The densely forested island, of unparalleled biodiversity hosts the remarkable number of 11 primate species, four galagos and seven monkeys (including the Drill, a large baboon-like monkey considered the most endangered primate in all Africa). Tragically, over the past 15 years, all seven species of monkey have become caught up in the lucrative and growing bushmeat trade—with their meat fetching higher profits than beef.\nNode 18: Príncipé ‘Einstein’s Theory of Relativity’. Príncipé (31 Ma, 136 sq km, 948 m, pop 6000) was discovered in 1472 and occupied by 1500. The volcanic peak (Pico de Príncipé), rising to 948 m above sea level, is covered by tropical rainforest and forms part of the Obo National Park. Of special historical interest is that Príncipé (virtually on the equator) was the site where Einstein’s Theory of Relativity was first experimentally tested and verified by Arthur Eddington and his team during the total solar eclipse of May 1919. This followed the final year of World War I, with Eddington, a conscientious objector, having been conscripted to alternate hazardous service.\nNode 19: São Tomé ‘Playground of Amphibians ’. São Tomé (14 Ma, 964 sq km, 2024 m, pop 137,500), named after St Thomas Aquinas (still the philosophical voice behind the Catholic Church), was discovered in December 1471 (and occupied by 1493). Paradoxically, the island is famous for the key role it has played in the slave trade. The lone volcanic peak (Pico de São Tomé) rises to 2024 m above the sea. It is the larger of the two major islands of the Democratic\nRepublic of São Tomé & Príncipé—the second smallest country in Africa in terms of population (the Seychelles being the smallest). The six species of amphibians (intolerant of sea water) found here are of the greatest scientific and conservation interest: four are single-island endemics, and two Gulf-island endemics – and how these fresh water animals colonised these islands remains a mystery.\nNode 20: Pagalú (Annobon) ‘Crater Pot’. Pagalú (5 Ma, 17 sq km, 813 m, pop 5000) is the outermost of the four Gulf islands and it is the tiniest. It comprises a central crater lake (Lago a Pot) and a succession of beautiful valleys and steep mountain slopes, covered by luxuriant vegetation (with 208 species of angiosperm, of which 14 are endemic to the island). Pagalú was discovered by the Portuguese on January 1, 1473 (and settled in 1474)—its original name (from ‘Ano bom’) being Portuguese for ‘Good Year’. There is a much symbolism and irony in this with increasing habitat destruction and species loss each year."

    "heading": "5. Summary and conclusions",
    "text": "In this brief outline of the (hi-) story of the ‘African Pole of Rotation’ (APR) Corridor, we have tried to convey how a variable geological environment has contributed to the co-evolution of a rich biodiversity; and how both have enabled the development of a diverse cultural heritage over Millennia. This encapsulates the need for collaboration and integration – coming together – to stimulate new real progress in our knowledge of interactive complex systems – consilience – something that cannot be achieved within our present tendencies for reductionism and apartheid between the natural and social sciences. In this regard, we need to seek-out colleagues in the biosciences, anthropology, archaeology, politics and history; and ‘talk’ to the public if the full potential of the African Alive Corridors concept for the sustainable development of the continent is to take root.\nWe have attempted to outline the unlimited potential along this Corridor—and by inference all other Corridors—for promoting sustainable development to the benefit of every individual (and all other species) throughout Africa. We have advocated means by which every aspect of civil society can be mobilised-through education, science and technology, administration, sport and recreation, media, tourism and related entrepreneurship – towards lifelong learning and participation by anyone living along or near the African Corridors. We have stressed the responsibility of present generations to sincerely embark on the co-curatorship of the wealth of heritage along the Corridors for the benefit of future generations. By way of examples, we have shown that the APR offers many varied opportunities for tackling, holistically problems of education, food security, health, mitigation of geohazards and exploitation of geo-resources, countering land degradation and biodiversity loss, and promoting ecotourism, entrepreneurship and management. In this regard, the APR Corridor is not unique; we have used it merely as an example – a microcosm – of what can be achieved – with consilience – along all the Corridors of Africa.\nAfrica Alive Corridors open new avenues, particularly in this crucial century of adaptation to anthropogenic climate variability and change, during which many countries across the continent are socially challenged to achieve the UN-Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The eight MDGs are intimately interlinked and collectively promote a ‘safer, healthier and wealthier’ future. In this respect the UN goals, ICSU goals, IYPE goals, and AAC goals overlap fully. For these goals to be universally achieved, they require a holistic approach, using local resources, indigenous knowledge and a cross-flow of partnerships from local to national to interna-\ntional. AAC offers a practical and collaborative approach for achieving these goals.\nWe have deliberately not dwelled on issues of implementation, on details of how to role-out further the APR and other Corridors, on how to make Africa Corridors come ‘Alive’, on how to make them happen and reach sustainability. In many cases this must now rely on local Corridor people, stakeholders to attract investors. Presently, we are in the process of developing this next stage of design and implementation, of practical operations, within Corridor 1 – the Cradle to Cradle Corridor. We hope to report on this soon in a subsequent issue of the Journal of African Earth Sciences; but much of the future of Africa Alive Corridors will be dependent on the effective use of electronic media to keep pace and assure delivery. We will be reporting on this too, initially through our websites— http://www.aeon.uct.ac.za (and soon AfricaAliveCorridors.org) – with built-in, real-time discussion modes, and subsequently perhaps with mobile phones.\nWe hope that this brief overview of Africa Alive Corridors will stimulate discourse, excitement, and above all new visions towards collaborative and even competitive ways of developing and promoting ‘Earth stewardship science’. This will require the support of our African colleagues in all 54 countries across the continent to engage in dialogue to promote a holistic network of partnerships between all sectors of the African population, young and old, including political, traditional and religious authorities and the civil society generally – true Pan-African collegiate-ship.\nEach Corridor now needs its stakeholders—those living, thriving and struggling along and flanking their Corridors—to develop their own visions and create new realities along all African Corridors— make them come ‘Alive’—and grow fresh global leadership, ultimately, to implement ‘Earth Alive Corridors’."

Present address: Departm Mandela Metropolitan University, PO Box 77000, Port E-mail address: sftoteu@yahoo.fr (S. Felix Toteu). ‘Africa Alive Corridors’ (AAC) addresses major stewardship goals in Africa through a selection of 20 heritage Corridors (varying from 1000 to 4000 km in length and 50 to 100 km wide). These include more than 400 heritage nodes (World Heritage Sites, Biosphere Reserves, biodiversity hotspots, Geoparks, etc.). AAC tracks Africa’s journey from around 4 billion years ago to the present day through these chronologically sequenced Corridors. And so, the 4-billion-year autobiography of the continent is told. It encompasses the geological, biological and anthropological/cultural history of Africa’s 54 nations – a (hi-) story without borders. The wealth of scientific and biographical knowledge archived in this network of Corridors tells the story of continental drift, mega-geohazards, climate variability and change, and the origin and extinction of biodiversity; and includes our human roots, culture and spirituality, our impact on the Earth and our potential to influence its future. In telling this story of Africa, new research avenues will be discovered and new learning methodologies will be experienced and developed and shared. In this way, the AAC provide loci along which the eight UN-Millennium Development Goals may be readily and realistically achieved. In concert, they can form the basis for a new collective endeavour – of Pan African Earth Stewardship Science. In this, the final – 2010 – phase of IYPE (the International Year of Planet Earth), we aim to make a start at bringing the ‘Africa Alive Corridors’ into real-life context. Whilst the concept of the Corridors has been formulated and presented at various international forums—most recently in Africa at the launch of IYPE in Arusha, Tanzania, in May 2008—here we present in brief their conceptual framework, and summarize the rationale behind the selection of the 20 African Corridors. Then, we describe, for the first time, how the AAC concept might evolve. To achieve the latter, we focus on an exploratory design of one Corridor (AAC 4 – through Cameroon and Nigeria) that we have named the ‘African Pole of Rotation’ Corridor. We outline its significance in Africa, and the world, and formulate an approach in forging its reality in the countries through which it passes. We show how the uniqueness of this and other Corridors, as ‘‘global heritage trails”, might translate into holistic lasting benefit for all. AAC aims to draw all 900 million Africans of every background and persuasion into co-curating, co-documenting and together keeping alive their continent’s unmatched heritage – an epic and unfolding story. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
