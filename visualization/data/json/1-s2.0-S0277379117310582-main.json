In both these southern mid-latitude regions, evidence for extensive and repeated glaciations during cold phases of the Quaternary is manifested by arrays of successively older glacial drift deposits with corresponding outwash plain remnants. In South Westland, these variably aged glacial landforms are mantled by layered (multisequal) soils characterised by slow loess accretion and pedogenesis in an extreme leaching and weathering environment. These cover-bed successions have undergone repeated coupled phases of topdown and upbuilding soil formation that have been related to fluctuating cycles of interglacial/warm and glacial/cold climate during the Quaternary. In this study, we recognise multisequal soils overlying glacial landforms in southern continental Chile but, unlike the spodic (podzolic) soil sequences of South Westland, these are of dominantly volcanigenic (andic) provenance and are very similar to multisequal soils of andic provenance that predominate in, and adjacent to, areas of rhyolitic to andesitic volcanism in North Island, New Zealand. Here we develop a soil-stratigraphic model to explain the observed occurrence of multisequal soils mantling dominantly glacial landforms of southern continental Chile. Based on proxy data from southern Chile, we propose that persistent vegetation cover and high precipitation on the western side of the Andes, during colder-than-present episodes tended to suppress the widespread production of glacially-derived loessial materials despite the pervasive occurrence of glacial and glacio-fluvial deposits that have frequently inundated large tracts of this landscape during the Quaternary. Given the lack of loess cover-beds that have traditionally assisted in the relative dating of glacial episodes prior to the Late Quaternary, surface exposure dating techniques could provide another chronological alternative to address this issue. However, there have been two main obstacles to successfully apply this dating technique in Patagonia. First, minimum exposure ages may be obtained on moraines older than the last glacial cycle due to erosion, although dating outwash plains is more robust. Second, on the wet western side adjacent to the Andes, persistent vegetation cover during both glacial and post-glacial times, as well as widespread inundation by volcanic mass-flows, appear preventive. We make a case that soil genesis within this region appears to be dominated by a constant flux of intermittently erupted Andean-sourced tephra which has continued to upbuild soils at the ground surface separated by intervals where topdown weathering processes are intensified. As already demonstrated by New Zealand studies, multisequal soil successions have a clear implied connection to coupled glacial and interglacial climate cycles of the\nThe University of Auckland,\nloway).\nQuaternary. On this basis, similar sequences in northwest Patagonia provide a relatively untapped archive to enable Quaternary glacial and environmental changes in this pervasively glaciated volcanic region to be constructed.\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

    "text": "Southern continental Chile and South Westland, New Zealand, share similar southern mid-latitude positions within the southern westerly wind (SWW) belt and are located immediately westward of north-south trending high (>2000-m above sea level) mountain ranges that form significant topographic barriers influencing precipitation in these regions. At both locations, evidence for extensive and repeated glaciations during cold climate phases of the Quaternary is manifested in the landscape by an impressive array of glacial drift deposits with corresponding outwash plains.\nIn South Westland (~43 S), densely forested, fluvio-glacial landforms and associated soil cover-bed successions have been studied in detail (Almond,1996; Almond and Tonkin,1999; Almond et al., 2001) and this research has contributed to the formulation of a robust regional glacial chronostratigraphic framework (e.g. Nathan et al., 2002; Cox and Barrell, 2007). Across the Pacific Ocean and at similar southern latitude, the configuration and internal architecture of ice lobes in southern continental Chile (northwest Patagonia) is well-known based largely from seminal glacial morphologic maps (i.e. Caldenius, 1932; Andersen et al., 1999; Denton et al., 1999a,b). In contrast to the South Westland glaciated landscape, however, the soil cover-bed stratigraphies that mantle this glacial sequence have not been documented in any detail. The closest related studies are well to the south on the east arid side of the Andes (Douglass and Bockheim, 2006). In our study, we identify the first occurrence of multisequal soils mantling these glacial landforms in southern continental Chile, and develop a soilstratigraphic model based on soil genesis analogues from South Westland (~43 S) and Taranaki-Wanganui (~39 S) regions in New Zealand, to provide new insights to better characterise and define the glacial chronostratigraphy in southern continental Chile."

    "heading": "2. Soil and loess stratigraphy",
    "text": "Soil formation is most often presented as occurring in a topdown sense, i.e., a set of processes acting on a pre-existing body of sedimentary or volcanic deposits or rock (the parent material) such that the degree and depth of alteration increases with time with a downward moving ‘front’ (Simonson, 1959). Such a scenario is clearly a simplification that nevertheless can hold true for many situations, but in aggrading landscapes where material is intermittently added to the ground surface this conceptual scheme is generally unsuitable (Nikiforoff, 1949; Raeside, 1964). Soils on surfaces incrementallymantled by loess, tephra, overbank deposits, colluvium or other materials form contemporaneously with the geological additions (of sediment, tephra, etc.), i.e. these soils formed by upbuilding (Nikiforoff, 1949). The degree of soil expression is dependent on the relative rates of geological accumulation and pedogenic alteration. Where the former dominates, the latter deposits are minimally modified and the geological material thickens without significant soil alteration. This scenario has been referred to as retardant upbuilding (Johnson and WatsonStegner, 1987). Where rates of geological accumulation are low but where environmental factors drive high rates of pedogenesis (such as in warm and moist climates) coeval geological\naccumulation and soil modification result in thick, strongly expressed soils (developmental upbuilding: Johnson et al., 1990; Lowe and Tonkin, 2010; Lowe et al., 2015). An important feature of upbuilding pedogenesis is that all depth increments of an upbuilding soil have experienced processes characteristic of surface horizons, such as melanisation, acidification, intense bioturbation and eluviation. As a surface soil horizon (typically an A horizon) becomes progressively buried by ongoing sediment or tephra accumulation it moves into a zone characterized by subsurface pedogenic processes (e.g. illuviation) and different moisture, temperature and bioturbation regimes. Moreover, features inherited from the near-surface pedogenic processes may modulate subsurface pedogenesis (McDonald and Busacca, 1990). Phases of upbuilding and topdown pedogenesis alternated during climatically modulated loess accumulation in the Quaternary. In relatively dry continental regions with extensive loess sources, loess accumulation in cold periods resulted in retardant upbuilding, which was followed by topdown pedogenesis in the warm periods when loess accumulation effectively ceased. These circumstances yielded the so-called loess-paleosol sequences of Europe, China, North America and the drier eastern side of the Andes (i.e. ChacoePampean plains and the northwest mountain environments of Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, Bolivia; see Z arate, 2003 and references therein). In maritime New Zealand, particularly on the western side of the two main islands, high rainfall results in rapid pedogenesis, and, where loess accumulation rates have been relatively low (Eden and Hammond, 2003), loess accumulation phases resulted in developmental pedogenesis. In these circumstances there is no clear distinction between loess and paleosols; all the loess is altered by pedogenesis to a greater or lesser extent and at times there is pedogenic overprinting between loess sheets (Lowe et al., 2015). On the western side of North Island multiple incremental contributions of weatherable andesitic tephra have enhanced pedogenesis. During cold phases, developmental upbuilding occurred during accumulation of mixed andesitic tephra-aeolian deposits (Sy beds of Alloway et al. (1992a), now manifested as weak-to moderatelystructured, yellowish-brown moderately allophanic Bw horizons). Occurring within intervening warm phases, developmental tephra upbuilding continued but the intensity of pedogenesis increased. This scenario resulted in the accumulation of strongly weathered andesitic tephra soil material now manifested as well-structured, reddish-brown highly allophanic Bw horizons (Sr beds of Alloway et al. (1992a)).\nOn the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island, very high rainfall rates (>3-m annually) promote rapid pedogenesis (Tonkin and Basher, 2001) and consequently the relatively thin loess sheets characteristic of the region are strongly pedogenically altered from the overprint of developmental upbuilding and topdown pedogenesis. In well-drained environments, buried soils are identified by the occurrence of repeating E-Bs horizon pairs (Almond et al., 2001) (Fig. 1). At these sites, mineralisation of organic matter from the A horizon as it becomes buried reveals a bleached horizon subsequently identified as a buried E horizon (e.g., bE in the New Zealand Soil Classification, (NZSC: Hewitt, 2010), or Eb horizon in ‘Soil Taxonomy’ (Soil Survey Staff, 2014); see Fig. 1 caption for further explanation). Further addition of loess\nresults in weathering and translocation of Fe and Al from the upbuilding A and E horizon to lower increments. The result is an upbuilding Bs horizon (Almond and Tonkin, 1999). On less welldrained fluvio-glacial outwash terraces, buried soils are identified by the occurrence of repeating buried A/O/Bh-Er horizon pairs. In the anaerobic subsoils, organic matter in the A/O horizons does not mineralise as it becomes buried and secondary Fe minerals do not accumulate because of the reducing conditions. Aluminium extracted by acid ammonium oxalate solution (Alox) is generally accepted to be associated with nanocrystalline or short-range order minerals (e.g. McKeague, and Day,1966) and is mobilised at low pH. In the presence of organic ligands, Alox precipitates at depth, particularly where it can further complex with buried organic matter. When loess addition stops or becomes negligible, topdown modification of the upbuilding soil continues with intensified translocation of Al whereby the maximum concentration of extractable secondary Al develops in the buried A and/or O horizons.\nIn drier eastern parts of both main islands of New Zealand\nwhere loess accumulation rates tend to be higher (Eden and Hammond, 2003) and away from significant tephra inputs, loess sequences take on a character more similar to the more classically described loess-paleosol sequences described for the northern hemisphere as well as for the drier, eastern side of the Andes. The boundaries between loess sheets are defined by the tops of buried soils with an fragiustalf or fragiustept form in ‘Soil Taxonomy’ (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) (Pallic Soil in the New Zealand Soil Classification, NZSC: Hewitt, 2010), namely a dense, often prismatic-structured, fragipan (Bx horizon) usually overlain by a horizon with conspicuous redoximorphic features (Bg horizon) (as defined in Soil Survey Staff, 2014) (Fig. 1). Often loess sheets are in the order of metresthick (Tonkin et al., 1974) and within a loess sheet there is a clear distinction between basal loess of minimal pedogenic alteration and the overlying soil formed in the upper part of the loess sheet. This stratigraphy represents retardant upbuilding during loess accumulation followed by developmental upbuilding in the interveningwarm phases. Nonetheless, there is evidence to indicate that the fragipan is at least partly a consequence of pedogenesis during\nthe loess accumulation phase (Kemp et al., 1998), and that topdown pedogenesis results in a range of features including formation of redoximorphic horizons, clay illuvial (Bt) horizons, gley veins between prisms in the fragipan and general degradation of the fragipan (Bruce, 1973, 1996).\nThe inferred climate control on loess accumulation (upbuilding pedogenesis: developmental or retardant), and cessation of the loess flux (topdown pedogenesis) is supported by paleobotanical studies and chronology. Direct dating of loess has typically been confounded by contamination by young carbon of samples submitted for radiocarbon-analysis (Goh et al., 1978), and problems associated with the systematics of luminescence dating (Berger et al. 2001a,b; 2002). However, tephrochronology (Palmer, 1982c; Alloway et al., 1988, 1992a; 2007; Pillans, 1988; Pillans et al., 1993; Eden, 1989; Berryman, 1992; Almond, 1996; Litchfield and Reiser, 2005; Litchfield and Berryman, 2005; Hughes et al., 2009, 2010; Vandergoes et al., 2013) has provided constraining ages for loess sheets and confirmed their deposition during cold climate phases. Pollen and phytolith-based reconstructions of past vegetation show loess accumulation occurred during times of widespread grassland and shrubland vegetation (Raeside, 1964; Kondo et al., 1994; Carter and Lian, 2000; Almond et al., 2001) whereas topdownpedogenesis occurred during periods when taller-statured vegetation, including forest, dominated. Independent well-dated pollen records (Alloway et al., 2007 and references therein) have unequivocally shown these vegetation transitions to be climatically controlled such that they have become the basis for defining New Zealand's climate event stratigraphy (Barrell et al., 2013)."

    "text": "In South Westland, six distinct moraines and associated outwash terraces were recognised (Almond, 1996, Almond et al., 2001, Fig. 2), each of which was interpreted to represent a separate glacial advance. Moraines are designated M6, M5, etc. in order of increasing age and their associated outwash terraces are correspondingly designated T6, T5, etc. Relative ages were assigned to moraines using the principle that moraines become progressively younger toward the Southern Alps because early moraines within the range of a later glacial advance are obliterated. The three oldest moraines (M1, M2, andM3) lie within Saltwater Forest and are subparallel to the coastline. The age of the youngest moraines (i.e. M6 and M5) were supported by an array of radiocarbon dates (Moar, 1980; Denton et al., 1999b) and also by the occurrence of the ~25.4 cal ka BP Kawakawa/Oruanui Tephra (KOT; Almond, 1996; Almond et al., 2001; Vandergoes et al., 2013) which has recently been identified distally within the WAIS Divide ice core, West Antarctica (Dunbar et al., 2017). Loess cover-beds thickened and the number of buried soils increased systematically with the age of the landforms they mantled. A maximum of five loess sheets and morphologically identified soil features were recognised.\nAccumulation of South Westland loess sheets has been linked via chronology and palynology to cool/cold climate conditions (Almond, 1996; Almond et al., 2001). Synchronicity of fluvial aggradation and loess accumulation points to the linking\nFig. 2. A. Glacial landforms of South Westland (modified from Almond, 1996; Almond et al., 2 Moraines are designated M6, M5, etc. in order of increasing age and their associated outwash and M3) lie within Saltwater Forest and are sub-parallel to the coastline.

Nonetheless, loess continues to accumulate in the Holocene, albeit slower and more spatially limited (Eger et al., 2011, 2013; Marx and McGowan, 2005), despite rivers being confined to relatively narrow, well-vegetated floodplains. The braided rivers issuing from the Southern Alps range front drain catchments with specific sediment yields exceeding 5000 t km 2y 1 (Hicks et al., 2011) and their braided and flood-prone channels still provide a significant loess source. At the only site of detailed study, Haast River, Holocene loess forms a narrow loess wedge (c. 1 km-wide) downwind of the predominant westerly-quarter winds (Eger et al., 2012). The rapid downwind thinning implicates the tall rainforest in ‘scrubbing’ of loess from the atmosphere. Contemporary aeolian processes provide insights into the faster and more widespread loess accumulation during stadials. At these times the broad outwash plains forming in front of the glacial termini constituted a larger source area, while other factors such as lower rainfall, shorter-stature vegetation, and stronger winds may have contributed as well."

    "text": "Dominant features of the southern continental Chile landscape are ubiquitous moraines, outwash plains and ice-carved lake basins formed by Andean piedmont glaciers during episodes of cold (glacial) episodes through the Quaternary. The extent and relativeages of glaciated landform-sediment sequences extending over the last glacial period in northwest Patagonia are well known (e.g. Andersen et al., 1999; Denton et al., 1999b). At least three ridgeforming glacial drift deposits have been recognised extending westwards from the Andean range front (Fig. 3). The two oldest deposits (locally referred to as Casma and Colegual Drift, Mercer, 1976) represent pre-last glacial drift and associated outwash plains, which become progressively more subdued in their topographic expression and have a steadily increasing thickness of layered fine-textured loess-like cover-beds (nowweakly developed soil horizons) formed from wind-borne accretion, towards the west.\nGlacial coverage during MIS 4 is based on minimum 14C ages of ~40e50 cal ka and pollen analyses from cores retrieved within Taiquem o mire (Heusser et al., 1999; Heusser and Heusser, 2006). The youngest glacial drift deposits (locally referred to as Llanquihue Drift) represent the last glaciation, and are mostly coincident with the maximum western-most extent of lakes within the Chilean Lake District. Radiocarbon dating of Llanquihue landforms show that the Andean ice lobes advanced into the moraine belt depicted in brown in Fig. 3 numerous times during cold-cool inter-stadial phases of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 and 2 (Denton et al., 1999b; Heusser et al., 1999). Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) date stage boundaries from benthic d18O records (LR04 stack) to 57 ka (MIS 4e3), ~33 cal ka BP (MIS 3e2), and ~17 cal ka BP (MIS 2e1). The chronology of glacial advance in southern continental Chile during the LGM (~33,400 to ~17,800 cal a BP) is constrained by an extensive array of 14C dates from sites tied to the former Llanquihue, Reloncaví, Ancud and Golfo de Corcovado ice lobes (Denton et al., 1999a,b; Moreno et al., 2015).

    "heading": "4. Cosmogenic dating in the Chilean Lake District",
    "text": "In Patagonia, besides sporadic 40Ar/39Ar dated lava-flows (e.g., Singer et al., 2004), or possibly OSL on associated sediments (Smedley et al., 2016), cosmogenic nuclide dating is currently the only other approach available for dating landforms older than Stage 3. However, there are two potential problems that affect the application of cosmogenic dating to older landforms. First, this technique appears to so far provide onlyminimum-limiting ages on\nmoraines older than the last glacial cycle (e.g., Stage 6 and older) due to the effect of geomorphic processes such as boulder exhumation. Dating outwash plain remnants is more robust and has allowed direct age constraints on outwash dating to Stage 8 and as old as 1 Ma (Hein et al., 2009, 2017). However, for each glacial outwash facies, the method is time consuming and relatively expensive given the amount of analyses needed (e.g., Hein et al., 2010). Second and in the context of this study, dating even LGMaged landforms in the wettest areas of the Chilean Lake District appears not to be possible, as we show here. To test the viability of cosmogenic dating in this region, given a former dense rainforest now mostly cleared for agriculture, we measured 10Be concentrations in 7 samples near the Huelmo mire (Moreno and Leon, 2003; Massaferro et al., 2014, Fig. 4). The timing of deglaciation at Huelmo and surrounding area is well-dated (Andersen et al., 1999; Denton et al., 1999a,b; Moreno et al., 2015). Specifically, at Huelmo, ice recession over the site is tightly constrained to ~19.5e19.6 cal ka.\nMoreover, as summarized below, the Termination in the region occurred ~17.8 cal ka (Fig. 4); this includes in the inner Andes, well east of Huelmo and Chilo e.\nSamples were processed using standard procedures at the University of Edinburgh, measured at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Zurich, and then calculated with the regional Patagonian rate and systematics discussed in Kaplan et al., (2011) (e.g., v.2.2 of the CRONUS calculator). We present two different sets of ages because the procedural blank run with the seven samples was above average for the laboratory (Table 1). Hence, we also show ages with the average blank value over several years (summarized in Kaplan et al., 2007). A key point is, regardless of the blank used, except for one anonymously old age (sample LD-02-03), all ages are younger than the Huelmo deglacial 14C ages (see Fig. 4), and are generally younger than the Termination age east (up-flow) of the Lake District (Moreno et al., 2015). With the higher background level, the ages are, on average, thousands of years too young. All 10Be ages presented are based on the Lm scaling (Lal,1991; Stone, 2000; Balco et al., 2008) of the high latitude, sea-level Patagonian production rate (Kaplan et al., 2011) to the specific location and elevation of the sample.\nWe offer two possibilities to explain why 10Be ages from this sector are too young. The first may relate to shielding by rainforest vegetation and its forest-floor. For stand-alone (erratic) boulders and/or those protruding from the ground surface, direct field observations indicate vegetative growth extending up from the forest floor to ultimatelywrap around and cover the top of these boulders. Moreover, the rainforest floor provides a surface where continued\nupbuilding of sediment and ash-fall material can occur. Second, since deglaciation, many areas of the Chilean Lake District have been frequently inundated by volcaniclastic mass-flows sourced from adjacent Andean eruptive centres (Andersen et al., 1999; Denton et al., 1999b; Moreno et al., 2015). In road-cuts and gravel pits, these volcaniclastic mass-flow deposits can be often observed to encapsulate and bury glacially emplaced boulders and, in some cases, glacial boulders have also been directly incorporated within the mass-flow itself during its passage across the landscape. Anomalously young 10Be ages acquired from an already well-dated site in a formerly densely vegetated hyper-humid environment highlight the difficulties associated with this technique, specifically in such settings (as noted above). This outcome clearly affirmed why a soil cover-bed approach has been a useful additional tool for inferring the age of glacial advances in this region of Patagonia."

    "heading": "5. Presence of multisequal andic soil successions",
    "text": "An important aspect that connects southern continental Chile with New Zealand is the widespread occurrence of andicdominated cover-beds. In both the Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) and New Zealand Soil Classification (NZSC; Hewitt, 2010) Andisols or Allophanic Soils (respectively) are predominantly formed from well-drained tephra or volcanic ash and, defined as containing high proportions of glass and nanocrystalline colloidal materials, including allophane and ferrihydrite along with paracrystalline imogolite (e.g. Churchman and Lowe, 2012). In New Zealand, Andisols (or Allophanic and Pumice Soils in NZSC) cover 12.5% of the country and are predominantly associated with the tephra products of rhyolitic to andesitic volcanic centres of central and western North Island (Lowe and Palmer, 2005), but allophanic Inceptisols (Allophanic Brown Soils in NZSC) can also form from the weathering products of greywacke and schist in the South Island high country (Hewitt, 2010). Typically, these soils have distinct ‘andic’ properties of high 1500 kPa (15-bar) water retention, high porosity and low bulk density, and are dominated by nanocrystalline materials chiefly allophane, ferrihydrite and metal-humus complexes (Parfitt and Clayden, 1991; McDaniel et al., 2012; Soil Survey Staff, 2014).\nIn southern Chile (36-49 S), Typical (trumaos) and Aquic (~nadis) Andisols are well expressed in areas west of, and adjacent to, volcanic centres of the Cordillera de los Andes and extend down the longitudinal Central Valley south of 36 S (FAO-UNESCO, 1971; Luzio et al., 2010; Casanova et al., 2013). Their occurrence is coincident with Holocene-aged Andean-sourced tephra deposits on fluvial and fluvio-glacial landforms. Trumaos are characterised as deep, well-drained soils (Hapludands) occurring on moderate to steep slopes whereas ~nadis are moderately deep, poorly drained soils (Placaquands) occurring on flat or depressed positions in the landscape (Casanova et al., 2013). In both southern Chile and western to central regions of New Zealand's North Island, cover-bed sections proximal to volcanic centres typically comprise predominantly tephra-derived, fine-textured soil materials separating thick and/or coarse-grained lithologically distinct tephra beds and volcaniclastic detritus that have resisted post-depositional weathering and pedogenic mixing. At medial to distal locations from volcanic sources, however, the proportion of fine-textured soil material significantly increases as tephra becomes perceptibly thinner and finer-textured. Each andic inter-bed forms part of a soil accession and represents a period of intermittent accretion of fine-grained detritus (dominantly tephra) with concomitant rapid weathering (Alloway et al., 1995) (see Section 2 above Soil and loess stratigraphy).\nIn southern continental Chile, the post-glacial andic soil succession developed on glacial, glacio-fluvial and volcanic landforms\nTable 1 Surface-exposure sample details and 10Be ages.\nSample Latitude Longitude Elevation Quartz Carrier (Be) 10Be/9Be ± 1s [10Be] ± 1s 10Be Age ± 1sa 10Be Age ± 1sb\n(DD) (DD) (masl) weight added (atoms g-1) (yrs) (yrs)\n(g) (g)\nLD-02-01 41.643 73.0662 50 31.2658 0.255198 0.1439 ± 0.01250483 67384 ± 5856 16300 ± 1400 13100 ± 1600 LD-02-02 41.6423 73.0647 60 15.8872 0.207602 0.1105 ± 0.01053817 74581 ± 4466 17800 ± 1700 11500 ± 1700 LD-02-03 41.6421 73.0659 58 25.1526 0.255099 0.1837 ± 0.01372043 110723 ± 6304 26300 ± 2000 22300 ± 2200 LD-02-04 41.6427 73.0657 57 27.8114 0.256682 0.1435 ± 0.01235303 76020 ± 4561 18200 ± 1600 14600 ± 1800 LD-02-05 41.6489 73.0624 26 23.4161 0.256781 0.1131 ± 0.01383996 68032 ± 5495 16800 ± 2100 12400 ± 2000 LD-02-06 41.6478 73.0621 43 54.7563 0.253615 0.2313 ± 0.01493313 65275 ± 3405 15900 ± 1000 14100 ± 1200 LD-02-07 41.6484 73.0625 31 22.3352 0.202555 0.1421 ± 0.01069512 70549 ± 3652 17400 ± 1300 12800 ± 1400 Average lab blank 0.257177 0.0203 ± 0.006063 LD_BLK 0.257177 0.0450 ± 0.01332\na Average laboratory blank (BI). b Individual blank (LD).\nand/or surfaces, is of dominantly volcanigenic-provenance as evidenced by the thickening towards multiple volcanic sources centred eastwards and along the Cordillera de los Andes. This situation contrasts with South Westland, New Zealand, where layered soil successions mantling glacial and glacio-fluvial landforms have completely different soil attributes on account of the quartzofeldspathic provenance of the cover-beds (no tephras nor volcanics), significantly higher precipitation (>3-m per annum) and extreme organic translocation and acid leaching conditions. Consequently, soils in this region are dominantly categorised as Spodosols (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) or Podzol Soils (NZSC; Hewitt, 2010). Layered andic soils of Wanganui-Taranaki in western North Island (see Fig. 2 inset) have soil attributes more akin to those andic soils occurring in southern Continental Chile and are similarly of dominantly volcanigenic origin. Instead of andic soils mantling glacial landforms as is the case for southern continental Chile, andic soils of western North Island typically form on uplifted alluvial and marine terraces as well as on volcaniclastic deposits adjacent to source volcanoes.\nOn the western side of the Andes soil genesis appears to be dominated by a flux of intermittently erupted Andean-sourced tephra which has continued to upbuild soils at the ground surface separated by intervals where topdown weathering processes are intensified. Alternating layers of reddish-brown (Sr-) and yellowish-brown (Sy-) soil horizons can be occasionally observed upon old drift deposits (Casma-Colegual). Sr-horizons have reddish-brown to brown hues (5YR-7.5YR) with high chroma and are characteristicallywell-developedwith a fine tomedium blockystructure, whereas the Sy-horizons are moderately to poorly developed coarse blocky structured to massive with yellow-brown hues (10YR-2.5YR) and high chroma. Sr-horizons are laterally continuous and typically uniformly thick whereas Sy-horizons are laterally discontinuous and may have erosional basal boundaries that cross-cut older andic soil horizons. A conceptual model of upbuilding (Ub) and topdown (Td) soil formation for this region is presented in Fig. 5. With increasing number of reddish-brown (Sr-) and yellowish brown (Sy-) soil horizon (Bw) couplets there is a corresponding increase in coupled Ub-Td cycles. As already demonstrated by New Zealand studies (i.e. Fig. 6), multisequal soil successions have a clear implied connection to coupled glacial and interglacial climate cycles of the Quaternary.\nIn areas bordering Lago Llanquihue and coastal regions adjacent to Seno Reloncaví, Llanquihue glacial drift deposits have complex depositional architectures (Fig. 7A and B) with diamicts and icecontact stratified sediments representing different-aged advances chaotically juxtaposed. Ice-contact sediments frequently exhibit syn-depositional deformation but in some cases, stratified\nsediments can be displaced by normal faults. Llanquihue drift and outwash gravels are identified by an eastward-thickening of finetextured post-glacial andic soil material and coarsening tephra inter-beds (Fig. 7C and D). Occasionally, late Llanquihue drift can be observed to either directly overlie earlier Llanquihue drift deposits with a sharp and wavy erosional contact (Fig. 7E), or is sometimes observed separated by thin to moderate (<0.5-m) andic soil material resting on a gravel-lag pediment atop an older drift (Fig. 7F). In the vicinity of Casma, beyond the western limit of the LGM-ice lobe, laterally discontinuous yellowish-brown sandy-textured andic material sits directly upon Llanquihue outwash deposits (Fig. 7G), indicating localised accumulation of aeolian sands directly adjacent an outwash channel. In the same vicinity, multisequal soil horizons are observed intervening between successively older outwash deposits (Fig. 7H). Frequently associated with drift and outwash deposits of this region are sequences of non-cohesive volcaniclastic mass-flow deposits, likely sourced from an ancestral Calbuco Volcano, which bury and/or erode pre-existing surfaces (Fig. 8AeC). Exposed along Ruta 5, at a locality just north of Puerto Montt, a massive to weakly stratified debris-flow deposit containing pumice clasts and bread-crusted bombs surmounts and thins out over adjacent and more elevated LGM-age moraines (Fig. 8D and E).\nOn a newly exposed road section on Ruta 5 (km-1054.2) between Puerto Montt and Pargua (41º37025.0} S; 73º16046.9}W), a multisequal soil succession with four Sr-Sy couplets overlies a highly-weathered glacial diamict (till) with a ~4.2-m-long, large diameter (1-mþ) tree-trunk mold encased within its matrix (Fig. 9A and B). At the northern end of this section, a sheet of Sy1 (of interpreted LGM-age) cross-cuts older soil horizons and thins southwards along section. At this southern point, Sy-1 is apparently overprinted above by Sr-1 top-down soil formation that penetrates into older pre-Sy1 soil horizons forming a composite profile.\nA significant point of difference between multisequal soil records from New Zealand and Chile, is that andic soil sequences in New Zealand are frequently interbedded by widespread and distinct rhyolitic tephra layers sourced from the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), situated in the central North Island, which provide opportunities for independent chronological control (e.g. Fig. 6). In southern Chile, numerous late Last Glacial to Holocene-aged tephra deposits of variable composition can be recognised westward and upwind of the Cordillera de los Andes e the strong westerly winds favour dispersal to the east and few tephras are preserved any further west than the limits of the LGM and LGIT moraines (e.g. Watt et al., 2009; Fontijn et al., 2014; Alloway et al., 2015). So far, only two widespread tephra markers (Chana and Lepue Tephras, dated ~9.6 and ~11 cal ka BP, respectively) sourced from Chait en\nFig. 6.

These soil successions form the dominant cover-beds on uplifted marine terraces in western North Island, New Zealand. C.

Both successions are punctuated by the occurrence of rhyolitic tephra horizons (indicated in red) sourced from the central North Island that have provided independent chronological control. Such successions with chrononological tie-points facilitate direct correlation to the marine oxygen isotope records (e.g. Pillans, 2017 and refs. above) that would otherwise be based on relative age constraints and counting paleosol-loess couplets back from present day. These western North Island multisequal soil successions have strong morphological resemblance with those andic soil successions occurring in southern continental Chile overlying Quaternary-aged glacial and glacio-fluvial landforms. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)\nand Michimahuida volcanoes in the Chait en sector have been recognised beyond this limit (Alloway et al. 2017a, b) but are confined to post-glacial aged uppermost andic soil material (Sr1). In the vicinity of Puerto Montt Hospital (41 26054.200S, 72 57019.500W), an older prominent weathered tephra can be identified in a woody lignite sequence occurring between two glacio-fluvial outwash deposits of LGM and pre-LGM (>45 14C ka BP) age. Two radiocarbon dates of 45,600± 2500 14C a BP (UCIAMS-145967; lignite) and 45,700± 2500 14C a BP (UCIAMS-145932; wood) from immediately beneath this tephra establish a maximum age (see Fig. 10AeC). Such exposures revealing tephra of this antiquity are rare in this region and this same tephra has yet to be recognised elsewhere within equivalent-aged andic soils or organic-rich sediments."

    "text": "Palynological investigations on ODP Site 1233 (41 0.005 S, 74 26.992W, 838-m water depth) and the Taiquem o bog (42.17 S, 73.60 W) on Isla Grande de Chilo e (see Fig. 11) yielded continuous, well-dated records of vegetation change through the last glacialinterglacial cycle in northwest Patagonia (Heusser, 1990, 2003; Heusser et al., 2006; Heusser and Heusser, 2006). Significantly, the palynology of ODP 1233 extends continuously over the last 93,000 years, spanning from MIS 5b to the present.\nThese records show similar trends through MIS 3 with a preponderance of cold-resistant southern beech (N. dombeyi type), conifers (Pilgerodendron, Podocarpus nubigena) and Poaceae, indicating a subantarctic woodland under cold and humid conditions. Poaceae increased during MIS 2 (between ~30 and ~17 cal ka BP) at the expense of Nothofagus, suggesting the establishment of a subantarctic parkland under extreme glacial conditions, followed by the spread of thermophilous trees (Myrtaceae, Lomatia) and ferns (Lophosoria) characteristic of north Patagonian rainforests at ~17.8 cal ka BP. This warming event marks the beginning of the last glacial termination and led to the establishment of closed canopy rainforests in the mainland of the Chilean Lake District and Isla Grande de Chilo e (Moreno et al., 2015; Pesce and Moreno, 2014). Subsequent warming and decline in precipitation led to the expansion of Valdivian rainforests during the early Holocene, followed by a cooling trend and increased precipitation commencing at 7.8 cal ka BP. Centennial-scale variability started at ~6 ka and led to the establishment of a mosaic of north Patagonian and Valdivian rainforest communities that persist until the present (Moreno and Videla, 2016).\nRemarkable in the ODP1233 record is the abundance and continuous presence of arboreal pollen (Nothofagus) during the last glaciation with a mean of ~60% (MIS5 b to MIS 2), accompanied by relatively modest abundance of herbs (Poaceae, 20%), other trees\nand herbs. Nothofagus abundance in the Taiquem o mire was higher (~80%) than ODP1233 between ~50 and 30 ka (MIS 3) and similar between 30 and 18 cal ka BP (MIS 2e60%), though more variable. The Taiquem omire, which was located a few kilometres fromMIS 2 moraines and a few metres west from MIS 4 glacial margins, indicates a continuous cover of predominantly arboreal vegetation during the coldest episodes of the last glaciation. These results suggest that even under extreme glacial temperature, precipitation and windiness (katabatic winds at the western end of the Golfo de Ancud ice lobe) ice-free areas in the lowlands of northwest Patagonia were vegetated by subantarctic parkland and/or scattered woodland. These conditions may have suppressed aeolian entrainment of sand or finer particles from the extensive, welldrained and active outwash plain surfaces during stadial and interstadial episodes of the last glaciation."

    "heading": "7. Discussion and conclusions",
    "text": "Here, we make a case that multisequal soil successions in northwest Patagonia provide a relatively untapped archive to reconstruct Quaternary glacial and environmental changes. Patagonia contains a geomorphic record of glaciations going back well into the Quaternary Period, and a glacial stratigraphic record as old as Miocene in age (Mercer, 1976). On the eastern, more arid, side of the Andes, cosmogenic dating (as well as OSL and K-Ar, 40Ar/39Ar) of moraines and outwash plains (Fig. 12), has revealed insight into glaciations older than the last glacial cycle, to perhaps> Stage 6 time (>130 ka), stage 8 (~200e300 ka), and as old as 1 Ma (e.g., Singer et al., 2004; Kaplan et al., 2005; Hein et al., 2009; 2017). However, using these same approaches, dating glaciations older than the LGM has been problematic, if not impossible on the wet western side of the Andes (Fig. 4) due to persistent vegetation cover\nduring both glacial and post-glacial times, as well as widespread inundation of glacial drift and associated outwash deposits by volcanic mass-flows.\nIn New Zealand, at a similar southern mid-latitude position to northwest Patagonia, an increasing number of soil horizons is recognised on successively older Quaternary-aged landforms (Fig. 12A). In South Westland, this relationship has been demonstrated for successively older moraines and associated outwash surfaces, while in Taranaki and Wanganui regions of western North Island this has been similarly demonstrated for successively older marine and fluvial terraces. Thesemultisequal soil successions have been related to coupled phases of topdown and upbuilding soil formation associated with fluctuating cycles of interglacial/warm and stadial/cold climate respectively, following stabilisation of the landform on which the soils accumulated. Based on soil genesis analogues from New Zealand, we propose a similar soilstratigraphic model for cover-bed sequences in southern continental Chile (see Fig. 12B). Up to four sets of coupled Sr- and Syhorizons reflecting four sequential cycles of Ub-Td soil formation can be observed overlying glacial drift and outwash deposits in southern continental Chile. Northwards in the vicinity of Valdivia (~40 S) even thicker successions occur with greater number of\nFig. 10. AeC.

An equivalent-aged sequence can be observed on Ruta 5 south of Pue glacio-fluvial outwash deposits above and pre-LGM till below. Such sections in northwest P\ncoupled Sr- and Sy-horizons (Fig. 9C). The basal ages of these coupled Valdivian soil sequences are unknown but there exists the opportunity to link via cover-bed sequences to dated marine terraces preserved along the coast of this region (e.g. Fuenzalida et al., 1965; Antinao andMcDonough,1999; Pino et al., 2002; Jara-Mu~noz et al., 2015) in an approach similar to that undertaken for New Zealand marine terrace sequences (e.g. Pillans, 1983, 1990a; 1990b, 2017; Berryman, 1992; Alloway et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2007).\nThe paucity of widespread loess in southern continental Chile despite the proximity of extensive piedmont glaciation and associated outwash surfaces seems perplexing but this likely indicates that prevailing environmental conditions tended to suppress both the formation and restrict the widespread mobilisation of loess in this landscape. Palynological analysis from equivalent-aged terrestrial and marine sediments during MIS 3 and 2 indicate near-continuous vegetation ground cover (scattered Nothofagus woodland) under conditions of high precipitation and variable temperature and windiness (Fig. 11). Clearly the analysis of older (>MIS-3) terrestrial palynological records will be essential for assessing vegetation associations as well as their persistence through earlier glacial/interglacial cycles. Unfortunately, such records in northwest Patagonia are both fragmentary and rare.\nminent weathered tephra is preserved within a woody lignite sequence intervening he upper (LGM) glacio-fluvial sediments are deeply incised with colluviated channel w deposit. The entire sequence is mantled by andic soil material of late last glacial to rto Montt (41 34025.400S, 73 12005.200W) Here, woody lignites intervene between LGM atagonia are rarely exposed.\nObserved multisequel soils cannot be simply explained by coupled soil formation phases of enhanced upbuilding (Ub> Td) by glacially derived wind-borne sediment during full glacial and cool climate episodes and intensified topdown pedogenesis (Td>Ub) during interglacial and/or warm climate episodes. Rather, coupled\nSr- and Sy-horizons (reflecting a Td-Ub cycle) are formed by continuous addition of intermittently erupted Andean-sourced tephra deposited to the ground surface during different climatic episodes - Sr-horizons reflecting enhanced topdown soil formation during interglacial and warm interstadials, and Sy-horizons\nreflecting reduced topdown soil formation during full glacial and cool stadials, i.e. developmental upbuilding. The colour and structure is a direct reflection of differential weathering under different climate regimes but also may be attributed to differences in Al:Si ratio of the nanocrystalline materials which have been related to mean annual rainfall and the level of Si and Fe in soil solution (Parfitt et al., 1983; Alloway et al., 1992b,c; Churchman and Lowe, 2012).\nThe recognition of multisequal soil successions in southern continental Chile and their implied connection to variations in Quaternary climate presents a tantalising opportunity for researchers to identify magnetic excursions (e.g. Blake excursion, ~115e122 ka; Icelandic basin excursion, ~190 ka; see Thorveny et al., 2004) within these cover-bed sequences as well as conduct luminescence dating in order to firmly link these layers with variations indicated from the established oxygen isotope record. Ultimately, our stratigraphic approach, which includes an appreciation of the critical role of upbuilding pedogenesis (cf. 'classical' topdown pedogenesis), will enable us to better constrain the age of this wellpreserved sequence of Andean-sourced drift and outwash deposits, the older members of which are difficult to differentiate by morphostratigraphic means and which all lie near or beyond the current limits of radiocarbon dating."

  "abstractText": "South Westland, New Zealand, and southern Chile, are two narrow continental corridors effectively confined between the Pacific Ocean in the west and high mountain ranges in the east which impart significant influence over regional climate, vegetation and soils. In both these southern mid-latitude regions, evidence for extensive and repeated glaciations during cold phases of the Quaternary is manifested by arrays of successively older glacial drift deposits with corresponding outwash plain remnants. In South Westland, these variably aged glacial landforms are mantled by layered (multisequal) soils characterised by slow loess accretion and pedogenesis in an extreme leaching and weathering environment. These cover-bed successions have undergone repeated coupled phases of topdown and upbuilding soil formation that have been related to fluctuating cycles of interglacial/warm and glacial/cold climate during the Quaternary. In this study, we recognise multisequal soils overlying glacial landforms in southern continental Chile but, unlike the spodic (podzolic) soil sequences of South Westland, these are of dominantly volcanigenic (andic) provenance and are very similar to multisequal soils of andic provenance that predominate in, and adjacent to, areas of rhyolitic to andesitic volcanism in North Island, New Zealand. Here we develop a soil-stratigraphic model to explain the observed occurrence of multisequal soils mantling dominantly glacial landforms of southern continental Chile. Based on proxy data from southern Chile, we propose that persistent vegetation cover and high precipitation on the western side of the Andes, during colder-than-present episodes tended to suppress the widespread production of glacially-derived loessial materials despite the pervasive occurrence of glacial and glacio-fluvial deposits that have frequently inundated large tracts of this landscape during the Quaternary. Given the lack of loess cover-beds that have traditionally assisted in the relative dating of glacial episodes prior to the Late Quaternary, surface exposure dating techniques could provide another chronological alternative to address this issue. However, there have been two main obstacles to successfully apply this dating technique in Patagonia. First, minimum exposure ages may be obtained on moraines older than the last glacial cycle due to erosion, although dating outwash plains is more robust. Second, on the wet western side adjacent to the Andes, persistent vegetation cover during both glacial and post-glacial times, as well as widespread inundation by volcanic mass-flows, appear preventive. We make a case that soil genesis within this region appears to be dominated by a constant flux of intermittently erupted Andean-sourced tephra which has continued to upbuild soils at the ground surface separated by intervals where topdown weathering processes are intensified. As already demonstrated by New Zealand studies, multisequal soil successions have a clear implied connection to coupled glacial and interglacial climate cycles of the The University of Auckland,",
