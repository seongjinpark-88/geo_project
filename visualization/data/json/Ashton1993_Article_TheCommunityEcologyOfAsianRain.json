    "text": "One reason for the extraordinary biological diversity which so distinguishes the evergreen forests of the lowland humid tropics from other terrestrial ecosystems could be their great age. Ecological (Bews 1927) and comparative morphological (Corner 1949) evidence has been used to argue that the flowering plants originated in the humid tropics, where many archaic forms still persist in the lowland rain forest. It has long been known that African rain forests, generally acknowledged to be less species-rich than those of other continents (Richards 1952; Meggers et al 1973), experienced massive changes in distribution owing to climatic changes during the Quaternary (e.g. papers in Meggers et al 1973). Plate tectonic (Smith and Briden 1977; Smith et al 1973) and paleontological (Muller 1972), evidence supports the views of Posthumus and van Steenis (quoted in Richards 1952, p 14) that Far Eastern rain forests may have persisted in situ at least since the Tertiary. At the same time, the favourableness of wet equatorial climates for plant growth, their equability and, in some regions such as the Far East, their comparative lack of seasonality has been held to favour survival of biological diversity (Richards 1952), perhaps under low selection pressures (Corner 1954; Fedorov 1966).\nIn recent decades these perceptions, all pointing to the relatively great stability of the southeast Asian tropics, have taken a battering. In both equatorial South America and the Far East (Flenley 1979; Morley and Flenley 1987; Whitmore and Prance 1987) major changes in rainfall seasonality are now known to have periodically occurred in late Miocene and Pleistocene times. In the latter this has been thanks both to continued mountain building and, during Pleistocene times, to the advance and retreat of epicontinental seas over the extensive Sunda and Sahel continental shelves. This realization has led to the concept of refugia: areas where both regional and point endemism and species diversity appear now to be\n501\n502 P S Ashton concentrated, and which may on that evidence have experienced less extinction, and therefore by inference less or no climatic change during the Quaternary (Brown 1987 for South America but see also Bush et αl 1992; Ashton 1972; Morley and Flenley 1987 for the Far East).\nAt the same time, evidence for occasional catastrophic modification of tropical forest has been coming in from many regions and is the subject to be reviewed in this paper. Both the kinds of catastrophes and their impacts are various and characteristic. Table 1 provides a summary of what has, so far, been mainly casual observation.\n1.1 Agents of disturbance While forests that experience frequent strong winds appear to be adapted to them, notably by their short stature and smooth canopy structure (Vaughan and Wiehe 1937; Beard 1945, 1946), the catastrophic influence' of occasional, unpredictable storm damage at the margins of the typhoon belt has long been recognized. WyattSmith (1954) described a storm-influenced forest in Kelantan, and Webb (1958) in Queensland, Australia. Such effects have been documented in detail over time in the classical studies of Whitmore (1974, 1989a).\nCatastrophic effects were apparent during the extraordinary dry season of 1982— 83, when many regions from east Asia through to Australia experienced killing droughts. The El Nino southern oscillation (ENSO) event was the strongest recently recorded. The eastern lowlands of Borneo were particularly severely affected (Leighton and Wirawan 1986), and the damage was greatly increased by maninduced fire. Without fire, high mortality was recorded among early regeneration but also, more significantly, up to 30% of emergent trees died on well-drained ridges. This mortality was highly species-specific (personal observations, April 1984).\nLandslips occasioned by earthquakes and rain storms can occur on a widespread\nCommunity ecology of Asian rain forests 503\nscale in steep juvenile topography, especially in equable and wet equatorial regions. Some of their effects have been documented in central America (Garwood et al 1979) and New Guinea (Johns 1986). Whereas wind squalls lead to tree uprooting with exposure of the mineral soil beneath, and a patchy cover of fallen litter beneath the canopy gap created, landslips strip most or all of the soil leaving a mineral surface initially devoid even of dormant seeds. Landslips can thus sharply differentiate the soil conditions of ridges and slopes and the floristic composition and dynamics of their forests (see Whitmore 1984, chapter 17.3 for further discussion). In addition, major volcanic eruptions can create new surfaces free of seeds on a much larger scale (Flenley and Richards 1982).\n1.2 Models of disturbance and biodiversity So widespread has the evidence of catastrophic events in tropical rain forests become that the existence of any areas free of them is now being called into question. The longstanding debate between those who have claimed that stochastic events create an unpredictable, non-equilibrium floristic structure in species-rich tropical forests (e.g. Fedorov 1966; Hubbell and Foster 1986), and those who envision a dominant role for probabilistic events, increasing refinement of niches, and hence an equilibrium mode in which species diversity is maintained (Ashton 1969; Janzen 1970; Terborgh 1992) is far from resolved. Rather, it is becoming sharpened. At the same time, though, the evidence for species-specific natural selection and density-dependent selection even among trees, at least among the more abundant species, continues to increase.\nHubbell and Foster (1990, 1993) showed that juveniles of a majority of species, rare as well as abundant, had higher mortality and lower growth close to mature conspecific crowns than to crowns of other species. Niche specificity has been documented among the abundant and often extensive series of closely related yet ecologically sympatric species which characterize Far Eastern lowland forests (Ashton et al 1988; Rogstad 1986; P M S Ashton 1990; S.H Rogstad, unpublished results). Coexistence of such finely differentiated ecotypes implies that physical conditions have remained equable over evolutionary time, whether their existence is the result of species specific natural selection in situ, or gradual accretion of randomly differing taxa through immigration. The prevalence not only of dioecy (Ashton 1969) but also pf outbreeding (Bawa 1974) and high genetic variability (Hamrick and Loveless 1989; Hamrick and Murawski 1991) among rain forest understorey trees implies that sex is worth the considerable cost to fecundity imposed by their spatial isolation in and beneath the canopy. It remains difficult to explain the benefits of maintaining high genetic variability in an environment which remains equable over evolutionary timescales, except by assuming high species-specific competition. Such competition, most frequently between tree species and animals or microorganisms, will then change continuously over time as immigration and differentiation proceeds.\nConnell (1978), drawing analogy between coral reefs and tropical forests, proposed that tree species diversity in rain forests will be greatest where disturbances are moderate in intensity and frequency. Low disturbance will lead to eventual dominance of the mature phase (in the sense of Watt 1947) canopy by a few species,\n504 P S Ashton while consequent isolation, predominant small size (e.g. Sanford et al 1986) and the ephemeral nature of canopy gaps will sustain high extinction rates and limited immigration opportunities, preventing the build-up of a rich pioneer flora. High disturbance will militate against accumulation of the 'climax' species (in the sense of Whitmore 1989b) which represent the majority of large trees in most rain forests; but moderate disturbance will favour species dynamics that prevent monospecific dominance in the mature phase, and also reduce the chance of extinction and increase the immigration in gaps. This prediction is relevant at scales smaller than the whole community because intermediate levels of disturbance will favour good representation of both pioneer and climax species in small samples. At a larger scale it only applies if disturbance patterns remain relatively constant over evolutionary time, thus allowing for optimal rates of immigration and speciation for pioneer and climax species to come into balance with extinction rates (MacArthur and Wilson 1967). The 'intermediate disturbance hypothesis' therefore provides an equilibrium model of forest community structure; but its proper application appears limited to an ecosystem with a more constant disturbance regime at ecosystem scale, like the coral reef. Although the developmental structure of coral reefs mandates that zones of differing intensity of disturbance always exist in contiguous balance, regimes of allochthonous disturbance are rarely likely to remain constant over time in terrestrial ecosystems.\n1.3 Anatomy of tropical forest disturbances\nForest catastrophes primarily affect the canopy of the mature phase, which, opened up, thereby affects the climate beneath and conditions for regeneration. These two effects of disturbance vary independently in their nature and intensity (Whitmore 1990, chapter 7.6). The major influence on canopy disturbance in tropical forests is the width of the gap in relation to forest stature, because the sun is nearly overhead at noon but gap width will determine the number of hours of direct sunlight that penetrates beneath. By contrast, variation in light across gaps, north to south, determines the major gradient in temperate climates on account of the comparatively low inclination of the sun during the growing season.\nAgents of canopy disturbance (table 1) create gaps of differing size. Senescence, disease, and lightning strikes cause single tree mortality; windthrows of individual emergents bring down groups of trees, and larger-scale perturbation is caused by earthquakes, drought and typhoons. Those caused by physical agents are always more frequent in some habitats than in others: lightning strikes and droughtinduced mortality are common on ridges, as are landslides on scarps, and typhoons on windward slopes and gullies. Some sheltered cove forests may never experience any such disturbances.\nAt the ground, the degree of mortality of established regeneration and the degree of soil surface scarification, besides the amount of litter, are the principal determinants of succession. This is because they determine the life history stages and consequently the ecological characteristics of the plants available for forest regeneration; and the physical conditions for seedling establishment. Landslips, volcanic eruptions, droughts, fires and uprooted trees remove established regeneration of climax species which have established in the shade of the understorey. All may also influence the character of the soil surface, particularly the\nCommunity ecology of Asian rainforests 505\ndensity of litter and presence of raw humus, both of which may be critical to seedling establishment; so may floodwater. Removal of surface soil may reduce the store of dormant seeds."

    "text": "Relative effects of different types of catastrophic events in the forests of southeast Asia and the Far East lead to some productive insights on disturbances and forest structure. My intention in this section will be to identify questions for research, rather than to give definitive answers: that can only be done by careful, quantitative description of large forest samples before events and subsequent monitoring after them (e.g. Whigham et al 1991; Lugo and. Waide 1993), for which I have no example in the region other than in small plots.\n2.1 Influence of latitude and seasonality\nMajor regional catastrophic events, which include droughts, typhoons, fire and frosts in tropical Asia, are the more influential in their effects the more rarely they occur. It is therefore at their geographical margins, where incidence is least frequent, that their influence is catastrophic. Where they occur regularly, they act as major limiting factors to which the structure and dynamics of vegetation equilibrates. The influence of widespread catastrophic events is greatest at higher latitudes within the tropics where year-to-year variability in rainfall and minimum temperature, and temperature range, peaks in continental regions, and where the hurricane zone occurs along eastern coasts (von Riehl 1954). It is least in the intertropical convergence zone along the climatic equator, particularly in oceanic and mountain regions of the Indonesian archipelago, Melanesia and southwest Sri Lanka where topography including orography assists in the maintenance of equable conditions, Nevertheless, few regions appear to be completely devoid of catastrophe, It may therefore be appropriate to ask to what extent current catastrophes, rather than past climatic events, can explain in particular floristic ecology and the species richness of both forest communities and biogeographic regions.\nIn tropical Asia, seasonal drought and winter frost independently limit the extension of tropical rain forest. The influence of both are determined by the unique climatic system of the region, which is dominated by the southeast wet monsoon off the southern oceans. This alternates with the northeast dry, winter monsoon off Continental Asia, mandating single annual wet and dry seasons of varying length.\nThe rainfall seasonality limits of evergreen rain forest are marked, in the absence of other factors, by a gradual increase in deciduousness, at first in the emergent, then in the main canopy and finally within the whole forest (Richards 1952). Deciduousness varies continuously with topography and therefore, by implication, with the duration and intensity of dry-season soil water defecits. Fully deciduous forests consist exclusively of fire-resistant species and presumably have always experienced periodic fire in nature. Nowadays, man-induced fire is almost ubiquitous in the strongly seasonal tropics. Such burning has created a sharp boundary between evergreen and moist mixed fully deciduous forest (Ashton 1991), and led to a decline of the intermediate communities into complex mosaics\n506 P S Ashton determined by their histories of man-made fire or clearance (Legris 1963 and in detailed regional studies). Here, then, is one critical interphase, between forests of very different composition and dynamics. These have different economic value, silvicultural characteristics, biomass and carbon content; their gas-exchange characteristics with the atmosphere also are likely to vary (Keller et al 1991). Formation of such forest mosaics varies according to unpredictable physical factors that may reflect global climatic change, yet this has never been the subject of rigorous or long-term research.\nPreliminary information on the change of species richness from evergreen through deciduous forests to fire-dysclimax savanna is becoming available for studies under the direction of S Sarayudh Bunyavechewin at Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand. There, in a climate with 1800 mm mean annual rainfall and five dry months, mixed evergreen forests in moist valleys contain c. 160 tree species; in adjacent moist deciduous forests include less than one hundred, while in the dry Dipterocarp savanna forest there are just thirty. Whether these differences are due to differences in constantly limiting factors or differentials in frequency of catastrophic fire or extreme soil water deficits is so far unknown.\nFrost limits both the altitudinal and latitudinal extents of tropical evergreen forest (Whitmore 1984). Frost incidence, to which seedlings are more sensitive than canopy trees, is reduced by high atmospheric humidity immediately above and also within forest canopies. Currently, catastrophic canopy mortality is occurring in some isolated montane rain forests in or at the margin of seasonal dry climates in northern Thailand (e.g. Doi Inthanon), Sri Lanka (the eastern margin of the Horton Plains) and elsewhere. It is possible that this is being induced by lower atmospheric humidity, consequent upon deforestation downslope. At the latitudinal margins of lowland rain forest in South China, pastures created by forest conversion are dominated by temperate agrostoid grasses and herbs including Viola and Corydalis (personal observation). Here, too, deforestation may increase the risk of periodic catastrophic frost mortality, but no research has yet been initiated to monitor these effects either.\nTo date, data do not exist which can permit any correlation between frost incidence in tropical forests and species richness to be ascertained. There is generally a decline of tree species richness with altitude (see e.g.. Richards 1952), but this begins at least by 1000 m ascent, well below the frost line. The only exception is where more or less a seasonal montane climates are surrounded by more seasonal lowlands as in south Asia. There, maximum species richness occurs immediately above 700 m, within the more equable climate of the cloud base (see e.g.. Gunatilleke and Ashton 1978); this zone is also associated elsewhere with maximum species richness of shrubs and epiphytes (Gentry 1982), although no quantitative data yet exist for Asian forests.\n2.2 Global changes and catastrophic events\nGlobal climatic change may effect changes in the local frequency of catastrophes, and introduce catastrophic climatic disturbances into forest unadapted to them. Regional changes in the frequency and disturbance of typhoons have occurred (e.g. Whitmore 1989a) and may be associated with global change.\nCommunity ecology of Asian rain forests 507\nNowhere can the striking difference in forest dynamics in relation to storm frequency be observed more clearly than down the eastern seaboard of the Philippine islands. Along the eastern slopes of the northern Sierra Madre of Luzon, forest composition is similar to that of climax forests on the lee of the hills inland, but structure is distinguished by short stature, and an even canopy of gnarled crowns with noticeably diffuse foliage. In 1975 I witnessed a typhoon pass through a forest east of Real, Quezon. Though there was much loss of leaf, the forest itself held firm, and few trees or branches were broken. Later that same year I witnessed the trail of destruction left by the strongest typhoon in forty years in the magnificent forests at Bislig Bay, eastern Mindanao, which are now fully destroyed by man. Swathes of climax forest were flattened and, strikingly, plantations of largeleaved pioneers, such as the South American Cecropia, were particularly badly mutilated. I have witnessed local massive windthrows in the equable wet regions in the hilly inlands of Brunei and Sarawak, Borneo, where Anderson (1964) documented occasional large-scale withthrows in the coastal peat swamps. In Asia, occasional, and therefore particularly catastrophic hurricanes occur also in peninsular Thailand and Malaysia (Wyatt-Smith 1954; see also Whitmore 1984) and on the windward slopes of the Arakan range and Chittagong hills bordering the northern Bay of Bengal.\n2.3 History of disturbance\nConfirmatory palaeontological evidence for climatic constancy over geological time requires a continuous palaeontological record, which is particularly difficult to secure in the lowland humid tropics. The strongest, albeit never confirmatory, evidence remains biogeographic. Particularly convincing are indications of coincident patterns of vicariance among species of unrelated taxa on either side of old, persisting physical boundaries, local and regional concentrations of endemism, and exceptional local and regional species richness in widespread community types, particularly those which occur in ecological island habitats. Data for the latter is so far only available in the Far Eastern tropics. They indicate that such habitats in the equable lowlands can sustain species-rich tree communities in areas as small as 100 km2 in some regions (Ashton 1984 and unpublished data). It is impossible to determine whether richness on this scale has been achieved mainly through low extinction rates or through continued immigration, although the high richness and point endemism among short-lived species of distinct floras such as that of karst limestone implies that persistence in remarkably small ecological islands remains important.\nTwo regions outstanding in these respects are the northwest Borneo lowlands, from Kuala Kapuas in Kalimantan Barat to Beaufort in southwest Sabah (Ashton 1972, 1984, 1993); and the wet southwest quarter of Sri Lanka (Ashton and Gunatilleke 1987). The former is distinguished on all three criteria, the latter only on the first two owing to lack of adjacent regions under the same climate with which to compare it. Northwest Borneo and East Kalimantan do not show striking differences in tree species richness in samples of mixed dipterocarp forest from the widespread clay udult ultisol soils. However, samples on heath forest on spodosols from the northwest contain more than twice as many species than others from the\n508 P S Ashton east; while local endemism in heath forest and mixed dipterocarp forest on yellow sand humult ultisols in the former is many times greater than the latter in some families (Ashton 1984). Both these soils, and their associated floras, are confined to island patches, mostly in the coastal lowlands. The dramatic differences between the northwest and eastern floras of Borneo could as well be explained by selective culling of species during the periodic catastrophic droughts and fire experienced in East Kalimantan as by climatic change during the Pleistocene. This is supported by the evidence of charcoal in spodosol profiles from primary forest in East Kalimantan, which has so far not been seen in the northwest. Here again is an issue ripe for long-term study.\n2.4 Small-scale catastrophe and soil type Forest communities in southeast Asia may differ in the predominant manner and frequency in which canopy gaps are formed, and these local and small scale catastrophic events may affect the overall dynamic and floristic characteristics of the forest (Ashton 1992; Ashton and Hall 1992). Such events will be most easily interpreted when other, more widespread catastrophes are rare or absent. Three groups of 0.6 ha plots were established on contrasting soils in the mixed dipterocarp forests during 1964-65 under the sponsorship of the Sarawak, northwest Borneo Forest Department. The results after twenty years of measurement have been published elsewhere (Ashton 1992; Ashton and Hall 1992) and I will merely summarize them here. The groups, of 4-5 plots each, were sited on shallow humult ultisols overlooking the coast, on deep inland humult and udult ultisols, and oxisols over basalt. Soil mineral concentrations increased in that order, and were considerably higher in the oxisols than in the rest. Soil water retaining capacity is also thought to increase in the same sequence (though data are unavailable).\nThe forests on shallow freely draining soils are shorter in stature than the other two, with relatively even canopy and few emergents. The other two forests are similar in stature; but that on deep ultisols has scattered emergents, whereas emergents in forests on basalts form an almost continuous canopy except where a gap has been formed. Each forest has a distinct flora, but differs substantially in species richness which is highest on the intermediate, deep ultisol soils, where it is concentrated in the main canopy. Species richness is negatively correlated with the population density of the most abundant species on higher nutrient udult ultisols and oxisols, but not on humult soils where it is positively correlated with concentration and spatial variability of certain soil nutrient concentrations. Gaps are small in low stature forests owing to the short trajectory of falling trees, and on humult soils where more trees die individually, standing than on udult ultisols and oxisols where more are uprooted, carrying others with them.\n2.5 Summary I have discussed these forests in some detail because we believe that the pattern of species richness in them can only partly be explained by the difference in disturbance patterns. A distinct guild of large pioneers which reach the canopy at maturity,\nCommunity ecology of Asian rain forests 509\n510 Ρ S Ashton\nCommunity ecology of Asian rain forests 511\nwhich is more species-rich and more abundant on high nutrient oxisol and ultisol soils than elsewhere, fails to offset the depression of overall tree species richness on these high nutrient soils. Low species richness in the mature phase of forest on oxisols is associated with a dense emergent overstorey composed of a small number of fast-growing light-hardwood climax species, and marked vertical stratification in\n512 Ρ S Ashton\nwhich the main canopy is poorly represented. We hypothesize that species richness on udult soils is greatest where occasional catastrophic drought periodically culls, and increases the surface roughness, of the canopy, thereby increasing the amount and spatial heterogeneity of the light beneath it as observed by Terborgh (1985). These conditions may occur on ridge tops, and also on lower nutrient clay ultisols which lack structure, are poorly drained and have shallow rooting. Conditions within the mature phase of these forests are thus optimal for survival and even regeneration of subcanopy and canopy species, while the diversity of light conditions favours diversification of the 'regeneration niche' (Grubb 1977). These differences in the gap regimes of different habitats and their associated forest types are partially independent of the vicissitudes of local climate. Provided the climate does not change, their differences may be expected to persist over evolutionary time, thereby influencing the total pool of species in each forest community type. In this case, species richness may be enhanced, rather than depressed, by rare or only moderate culling of the emergent canopy by drought-induced mortality, as Connell (1978) predicted.\nNatural catastrophic intervention occurs in Asian tropical forests on a vast diversity of temporal and spatial scales, and this diversity is habitat related, influencing forest types differentially in ways which, if understood, can be predicted. Understanding the impact of catastrophes is therefore critical to improved forest management. It can only be achieved through painstaking monitoring of representative forest samples over prolonged periods, and by recording conditions before as well as after catastrophic events. I summarize priorities for research in table 2. Hypotheses of causal relationships must be tested by experimental manipulation, and results used to design optimal silvicultural protocols. In order to better manage tree species diversity itself, samples must be large enough to monitor the demography of the vast majority of species, whose populations are dispersed at low densities. To this end, it is a particular pleasure that colleagues in several Japanese institutes, including Kyoto and Osaka City Universities, are collaborating with us at the Center for Tropical Forest Science of the Smithsonian Institution, and with scientists in a number of research institutes in tropical Asia who have taken up the challenge of initiating such research upon a regional basis. With increasing evidence of global climatic change which may have profound, even devastating, effects on the center of global biological diversity which is the tropical evergreen rain forest, this meeting of minds and hands could not have come at a more auspicious time.\nCommunity ecology of Asian rain forests 513"
