The conodont apatite δ18O record is compared to published brachiopod calcite δ18O records. Brachiopods and conodonts from different palaeocontinents show significantly different δ18O values, suggesting differences in local climatic conditions (e.g., evaporation/precipitation ratio). As a consequence, secular changes in palaeotemperature and oxygen isotope composition of Permian sea water cannot be reconstructed from records combined from different areas, but have to be based on records from a specific area. Oxygen isotope analyses of different conodont taxa suggest that Streptognathodus and Hindeodus lived in near-surface seawater and recorded surface water temperature, whereas the habitat of gondolellid genera was variable depending on sea level, with both near-surface and deeper waters as potential life habitat. The oxygen isotope record measured on conodonts from South China exhibits relative high values between 22 and 23‰ VSMOW during the glaciated Early Permian, translating into warm seawater temperature between 26 and 30 °C, assuming that the Late Palaeozoic ice volumes were comparable to the Pleistocene glacial maxima. In contrast to the earlier view that the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA) terminated in the late Sakmarian, the South China conodont apatite oxygen isotope record suggests waning of the ice sheets in the Kungurian. Ice melting is indicated by a pronounced decrease in δ18O of 2‰ VSMOW, which is interpreted as reflecting the combined effect of climatic warming and glacial ice melting. Significant temperature fluctuations (4 °C warming succeeded by 6 to 8 °C cooling) are observed during the Guadalupian–Lopingian transition, interpreted as combined climate changes induced by Emeishan volcanism and changes in habitat depth of gondolellid conodonts. Oxygen isotope values increase to 22‰ VSMOW in the Changhsingian, which suggests climate cooling and Clarkina moving to deeper waters because of the Changhsingian sea level rise. Across the Permian–Triassic boundary, δ18O values decrease from 22 to 19‰ VSMOW, parallel to the significant negative carbon isotope excursion and the eruption of the Siberian Traps. The latter is pointing to a cause–effect relationship as a consequence of the massive release of volcanic greenhouse gases derived from the Siberian volcanism and related processes.\n© 2012 International Association for Gondwana Research.

    "text": "The Permian (298.9 to 252.2 Ma) represents a transitional interval between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras in which global tectonic, environmental and faunal communities underwent dramatic changes that had a profound impact on the subsequent evolution of the Earth system. Following thefinal collision of Laurussia andGondwana in the Late Carboniferous (Stampfli and Borel, 2002), the assembly of the supercontinent Pangea was accomplished with the amalgamation of Siberia during the Uralian orogeny (Scotese, 2001). The Palaeotethys was narrowing during the Permian as a consequence of the opening of the Neotethys, a new oceanic basin that resulted from the northward-drifting Cimmerian terranes, which had split off from Gondwana (Fig. 1A). The formation of the supercontinent Pangea, as well as its later breakup, has been suggested to have played an important role in the origin of the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA) and global scale environmental changes (Link, 2009).\nIn contrast to earlier interpretations arguing that the LPIA was a single, widespread glacial event spanning the late Mississippian to Early Permian (Veevers and Powell, 1987), recent studies have shown that the LPIA can be differentiated into discrete glacial intervals separated by warmer periods of time. The Permian acme of the LPIA was dated as Asselian to early Sakmarian (Isbell et al., 2003, 2012; Fielding et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2008c), with the ice caps probably waning in the Sakmarian (Veevers and Powell, 1987; Isbell et al., 2003; Korte et al., 2005; Zeng et al., 2012). However, the exact timing of this deglaciation is still controversial since glacial deposits are found to appear intermittently in late Early and Middle Permian strata in Australia and Siberia (Fielding et al., 2008c).\nThe late Middle through latest Permian are characterized by the end-Guadalupian (259.0 Ma) and end-Permian (252.28 Ma) mass extinction events (Shen et al., 2010, 2011). Both events significantly\naffected global ecosystems, with 90% of all marine species becoming extinct, and a dramatic decline in terrestrial diversity registered during the end-Permian mass extinction (Retallack, 1995; Erwin et al., 2002). The triggering mechanisms for these mass extinctions are not clear. However, important environmental fluctuations, for example major sea level changes (Chen et al., 1998; Haq and Schutter, 2008; Wignall et al., 2009a), marine anoxia (Wignall and Twitchett, 1996; Isozaki, 1997; Wignall et al., 2009a), climate warming (Svensen et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2011; Joachimski et al., 2012, Retallack, 2013) as well as climate cooling (Campbell et al., 1992; Isozaki et al., 2007a, 2007b) or perturbations of the Earth's carbon cycle (Chen et al., 1991; Jin et al., 2000; Cao et al., 2002, 2008; Payne et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004; Xie et al., 2007; Korte et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2011) have been demonstrated to have been coincident with or to have occurred close to the mass extinction events. Interestingly, the Emeishan and Siberian Large Igneous Province are dated to have erupted during the end-Guadalupian (Zhou et al., 2002; Wignall et al., 2009b; Sun et al., 2010) and latest Permian, respectively (Campbell et al., 1992; Renne et al., 1995; Kamo et al., 2003; Mundil et al., 2004; Reichow et al., 2009; Svensen et al., 2009). The close temporal association between the volcanic events and the biotic crisis have ledmany researchers to assume a cause–effect relationship between volcanism and mass extinctions,with the volcanism resulting in the emission of greenhouse gases, destabilization of gas hydrates (Retallack and Jahren, 2008), and/or contact metamorphism of organic carbon-rich sediments (Ganino andArndt, 2009; Svensen et al., 2009), all processes that potentially could have contributed to higher atmospheric greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) levels.\nClimatic and environmental changes can be recorded in the stable isotope compositions of marine skeletons with variations in carbon and oxygen isotopes documenting changes in the global carbon cycle and palaeotemperature or ice volume, respectively. Brachiopod\ne Mountains (USA — 1), South China Block (2),, and Abadeh section (Iran — 3) (http:// apingian, location of studied sections, and modern outcrop area of Emeishan volcanic\nfter Zhang (1997) and Fang et al. (1992).\nshells composed of low magnesium calcite have been preferentially used to reconstruct Permian oxygen isotope records. However, the reconstruction of global carbon and oxygen isotope records using brachiopod shells is complicated by a potential diagenetic alteration of shell calcite, local environmental effects and the lack of temporaland spatial coverage (Grossman et al., 2008). Biogenic phosphate is an alternative proxy to reevaluate and refine the oxygen isotope signal from Permian oceans. Conodonts are tooth-like microfossils composed of carbonate-fluorapatite that represent the skeletal remains of a marine animal assumed to have been one of the earliest jawless vertebrates (Donoghue et al., 2000). They are widespread in Permian marine sediments and are used for the biostratigraphic subdivision of the Permian (e.g., Jin et al., 1997; Henderson and Mei, 2003; Shen and Mei, 2010). Due to their carbonate-fluorapatite mineralogy and the dense crystalline structure, they have a high potential to preserve primary oxygen isotope ratios (Pucéat et al., 2004). Consequently, conodont apatite has been considered as a robust proxy to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Palaeozoic ocean (Joachimski and Buggisch, 2002; Joachimski et al., 2006; Buggisch et al., 2008; Trotter et al., 2008; Joachimski et al., 2009; Buggisch et al., 2010).\nWe present a high-resolution oxygen isotope record based on conodont apatite from several low latitudinal Permian sections in South China, USA and Iran. The conodont apatite δ18O data presented here are compared with published coeval brachiopod calcite δ18O records. The Permian oxygen isotope records will be discussed in the context of ice volume and palaeoclimatic changes, as well as major volcanic and mass extinction events."

    "text": "Samples were collected from sections in South China (Early Permian to Early Triassic), USA (Middle Permian) and Iran (Late Permian). During Permian time, the South China block was located in the eastern part of the Palaeotethys (Fig. 1A). The Guadalupe Mountains (Texas, USA) were situated in the western part of Euramerica (Fig. 1A), whereas the Abadeh section (Iran) was located on the Sanandaj-Sirjan microcontinent, which was a part of the northward drifting Cimmerian terranes (Kozur, 2007; Fig. 1a). While the studied localities were located on different palaeocontinents, all were located in the low latitude tropical zone and characterized by continuously deposited marine sediments with abundant marine faunas.\nEarly Permian conodont samples were collected from the Naqing section located about 44 km southwest of the city of in Luodian Guizhou Province, Southwest China (Fig. 1B). The section is characterized by a continuous Carboniferous to Permian sedimentary succession with an abundant conodont fauna. The Permian succession of theNaqing section is dominated by dark‐grey and grey limestones with frequent silicified or cherty horizons (Mei et al., 1999; Henderson andMei, 2003) deposited in a slope setting of the Dian-Qian-Gui basin, a deep-water basin within the South China Block (Fig. 1B). Conodont biostratigraphy of the Naqing section was established by Mei et al. (2002) and refined by Henderson and Mei (2003).\nMiddle to Late Permian samples were mainly collected from South China, where Lopingian strata are represented by a complete marine depositional succession that contains highly diverse marine faunas (Jin et al., 1997; Shen and Mei, 2010). The studied Tieqiao and Penglaitan sections in Laibin, Guangxi Province (Fig. 1B) are characterized by Guadalupian to early Lopingian carbonates and radiolarian cherts that were deposited continuously in a slope to basin setting. Both sections are well-dated by means of conodont biostratigraphy (Mei et al., 1998; Jin et al., 2006a; Shen et al., 2007), with the Penglaitan section as the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of Wuchiapingian and which is considered as one of the most complete Guadalupian–Lopingian boundary sections worldwide (Mei et al., 1998; Jin et al., 2006a). Inmost other shelf or platform successions\naround theWorld, the Capitanian–Wuchiapingian regression (Haq and Schutter, 2008) resulted in erosional unconformities (Jin et al., 2006a). The Dukou section in northern Sichuan Province (Fig. 1B) exposes Lopingian slope to basin carbonates alternating with cherts. Conodont biostratigraphy indicates continuous deposition from theWuchiapingian Clarkina dukouensis conodont zone to lowest Triassic (Mei et al., 1994; Cao et al., 2010).\nChanghsingian to Griesbachian conodonts were collected from the Meishan section in Zhejiang Province (Fig. 1B), which is composed of carbonates and shales deposited in a slope setting. The Meishan D section represents the GSSP for the base of the Changhsingian (Jin et al., 2006b; X.D. Wang et al., 2006; Y. Wang et al., 2006) and the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB; Yin et al., 2001). The Shangsi PTB section in Sichuan Province (Fig. 1B) exposes siliceous limestones with interbedded shales deposited in a relatively deeper depositional setting in comparison to the Meishan section. Conodont biostratigraphy of the Shangsi section was intensively studied by Zhang et al. (1984), Li et al. (1989), Lai et al. (1996), Nicoll et al. (2002), Jiang et al. (2011) and Shen et al. (2011). Late Permian conodonts fromplatform and basin sediments were also studied from the Jiangya section in Hunan Province (Fig. 1B).\nFor comparison, the Middle Permian (Guadalupian) was sampled in the Guadalupe Mountains of West Texas/USA (Fig. 1A), where the GSSPs of the Guadalupian Series were established using the evolutionary lineages of the conodont genus Jinogondolella (Wardlaw et al., 2004). TheMiddle Permian strata exposed in the GuadalupeMountains reflect a complete facies transect from the shoreline to the basin. Lithologies comprise shallow-water and reef carbonates on the shelf, intercalated siliciclastic and platform derived carbonates on the slope, and mainly sand- and siltstones in the basin (Glenister et al., 1999; Wardlaw et al., 2000). The basinal siliciclastic deposits are considered to have been deposited continuously (Glenister et al., 1999), with the interbedded limestone units containing an abundant and well-preserved conodont fauna (Wardlaw et al., 2004). Both siliciclastic and carbonate units are prolific petroleum reservoirs in the nearby subsurface, and the entire region is referred to as the Delaware Basin.\nLate Permian conodonts were further studied from the relatively deep water/open ocean section of Abadeh in central Iran (Fig. 1A). The Late Permian and Early Triassic succession of Abadeh has been intensively investigated by means of biostratigraphy (Taraz, 1971, 1973; Kozur et al., 1975, 1978; Iranian-Japanese-Research-Group, 1981; Taraz et al., 1981; Kozur, 2004, 2005, 2007; Shen andMei, 2010), lithology (Heydari et al., 2003) and geochemistry (Korte et al., 2004, 2010). The conodont succession of the Abadeh section is considered to represent one of the most detailed zonations of the Permian–Triassic transition in the Tethys (Kozur, 2004, 2005, 2007) and considerable attention has been paid to conodont biostratigraphy due to controversial views as to whether this section represents a continuous open marine sedimentary sequence with complete conodont evolutionary series across the PTB (Sweet and Mei, 1999; Gallet et al., 2000; Kozur, 2004, 2005, 2007). The stratigraphic range of sampled intervals in sections from South China, USA and Iran is presented in Fig. 2."

    "text": "Conodonts were extracted by dissolving carbonate rocks in 10% acetic acid. After heavy liquid separation (sodium-polytungstate), conodont elements were picked from the heavy fraction under a binocular microscope. Mono-generic conodont assemblages were selected preferentially for separate analyses in samples with abundant conodont elements; multi-generic assemblages were used in samples where the abundance of conodont elements was not sufficiently high to allow mono-generic analyses (see Appendix for taxonomic composition of each sample analyzed). The conodont colour alteration index (CAI) is a proxy for the maximum thermal overprint of sediments (Rejebian et al., 1987). The CAI of studied condonts is 1\nto 1.5 in Meishan and Shangsi (Nicoll et al., 2002), 2.5 in the Abadeh section (Korte et al., 2004) and 1.5–2 in the Guadalupe Mountains. Higher CAI values are observed in the Tieqiao and Penglaitan sections (3–4), Jiangya section (4–4.5), Dukou and Naqing sections (5).\nHowever, Joachimski et al. (2009) reported no alteration of the oxygen isotope ratios of conodonts having a CAI of 1 (corresponding to ~75 °C) to 5 (corresponding to 200 to 300 °C). Buggisch et al. (2008) observed no significant alteration in δ18O up to a CAI of 7 (>300 °C) and suggested that intense heating of conodont apatite does not necessarily change the oxygen isotope composition of conodont phosphate.\nConodont apatite was dissolved in nitric acid and the PO43− group precipitated as Ag3PO4 (O'Neil et al., 1994; Wenzel et al., 2000) following the method described by Joachimski et al. (2009). Oxygen isotope analyses were performed using a TC-EA (high temperature reduction furnace) coupled online to a Thermo-Finnigan Delta Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer. 0.2 to 0.3 mg Ag3PO4 was weighed into silver foil and transferred to the sample carousel of the TC-EA. Samples and internal standards were generally measured in triplicate (Helium flow rate was 80 ml/s, reactor temperature was set to 1450 °C, column temperaturewas 90 °C). At 1450 °C, the silver phosphate was reduced and CO formed as the analyte gas (Vennemann et al., 2002). COwas transferred in the helium stream through a gas chromatographic column via a Conflo III interface to the mass spectrometer. Reproducibility of triplicate sample measurements was generally b±0.2‰ (1 std. dev.). The average oxygen isotope composition of the standard NBS 120c was 22.48±0.13‰ VSMOW (n=65). Conodont apatite oxygen isotope values are reported in‰ relative to VSMOW. All brachiopod calcite oxygen isotope values are reported in ‰ relative to VPDB. Palaeotemperatures were calculated from δ18O of conodont apatite using the temperature equation published by Pucéat et al. (2010).\nWe used the nonparametric locally weighted regression method ‘Locfit’ to calculate isotope trend lines (Loader, 1999). The locally weighted regression method Locfit produces a smoothed curve retaining local minima and maxima and yields good results, even with unevenly spaced data points. All calculations were performed with the open source statistic software ‘R’ (version 1.5.1, Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996)."

    "text": "The conodont apatite composite oxygen isotope record is based on a total of 356 analyses (Fig. 3A, B). 296 samples spanning the entire Permian were collected from various sections in South China.\nAdditional Middle and Late Permian samples were collected from the Guadalupe Mountains of West Texas/USA (n=27) and the Abadeh section/Iran (n=33), respectively. Data for the Guadalupian–Lopingian (Tieqiao and Penglaitan, South China, n=64) and Permian–Triassic boundary sections (Meishan and Shangsi; n=53) have been previously published by Chen et al. (2011) and Joachimski et al. (2012), respectively.\nThe oxygen isotope record based on conodonts from South China shows average values slightly above 22.0‰ for the Early Permian (Fig. 3A, B). Average δ18O values decrease from 22.0‰ in the Kungurian to 20.0‰ in the late Capitanian. A positive excursionwith values increasing from 19.8 to 20.8‰ is observed in the Capitanian–Wuchiapingian transitional interval. In the early Wuchiapingian, δ18O average values decrease from 21.0‰ tominimumvalues of 19.5‰, followed by a prominent increase from 19.5 to 22.0‰ in the late Wuchiapingian to early Changsingian. δ18O values for late Changhsingian and early Triassic conodonts from the well known PTB sections at Meishan and Shangsi show a significant decrease with values of 22.0‰ in the late Changhsingian, decreasing to 19‰ in the early Triassic.\nThe Middle Permian (Guadalupian) conodonts from the Guadalupe Mountains (West Texas/USA) exhibit slightly heavier δ18O values in comparison to conodonts from south China, with values ranging from 20.8 to 22.0‰ (Fig. 3B). Late Permian samples from the Abadeh section (Iran) show δ18O values of 19.8 to 21‰ (Fig. 3B). The δ18O values from Iran agree well with those from South China in the late Wuchiapingian and latest Changhsingian, but are depleted in 18O in the Changhsingian (Fig. 3B)."

    "text": "The oxygen isotope composition of biogenic calcite or apatite is dependent on temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition of the sea water in which an organism lived. Since the latter is dependent on variations in salinity and continental ice volume, oxygen isotopes can also be used to reconstruct changes in salinity and ice volume. Knowledge concerning the habitat of analyzed taxa is crucial for palaeotemperature reconstructions from δ18O, since oxygen isotope ratios of surface dwelling taxa may reflect the combined effect of temperature, salinity and ice volume, whereas δ18O of taxa dwelling at greater water depths will be determined preferentially by changes in ice volume, with temperature and salinity variations becoming minor with greater water depths.\n300 295 290 285 280 275 270 265 260 255 250\n2.2521.4520.9520.2821.0920.5929.892 270.6 268 265.8\nAge (Ma)\nB\n20\n21\n22\n23\n18\n19\n8 1\n) W\nO M S V\n‰( O\nNaqing\nAbadeh\nMeishan\nShangsi\nTieqiao\nDukou\nPenglaitan\nJingya\nGuadalupian Mts.\n295.0 290.1 282.0 270.6 268 265.8 259.0 254.1 252.2298.9\nCisuralian Sakmarian LopingianGuadalupian Assel.

    "text": "Previous oxygen isotope studies focused on the analysis of wellpreserved Permian brachiopod shells (Compston, 1960; Popp, 1986; Popp et al., 1986; Morante, 1996; Korte et al., 2005, 2008; Mazzullo et al., 2007; Grossman et al., 2008; Angiolini et al., 2009; Mii et al., 2012), mainly in order to constrain the timing of LPIA deglaciation (Fig. 4A, B). For example, Korte et al. (2005, 2008) described a 2.5‰ decrease in δ18O of Sakmarian to Artinskian brachiopods as well as bivalves from both low (Urals) and high (Australia) latitudes. A pronounced decrease in δ18O in the late Artinskian is reported as well by Mii et al. (2012), who investigated well-preserved brachiopod shells from the Sydney Basin in eastern Australia which was situated between 50 and 65° southern latitude during the Permian (Stampfli and Borel, 2002). However, the oxygen isotope ratios, especially of the Artinskian samples, reveal a very large variation of up to 6‰.\nIn contrast to the studies of Korte et al. (2005, 2008) andMii et al. (2012), no time-equivalent decrease in δ18O was observed in coeval brachiopod shells from the low-latitudinal U.S.Midcontinent (Grossman et al., 2008). The melting of the Early Permian Gondwanan ice sheets would be expected to result in a lower δ18O value for sea water and associated shell calcite. However, the compilation of published Permian brachiopod δ18O data from low latitudes shows no general trend in the oxygen isotope ratios (Fig. 4B). Most Permian δ18O values range from −0.5 to −4.5‰, with a relatively high variability of 3 to 4‰ for samples from specific time intervals (Fig. 4A, B). High δ18O values ranging from −0.4 to −0.2‰ for middle to late Asselian brachiopods from the southern Urals were one line of evidence used by Korte et al. (2005) to argue for a significant decrease in δ18O, and a deglaciation in the Sakmarian. However, coeval brachiopods from Northern Iran\n(Angiolini et al., 2009) and the U.S. Midcontinent (Mazzullo et al., 2007; Grossman et al., 2008) are characterized by lower δ18O values between −2.3 and −3.6‰ (Fig. 4B), which translates into realistic palaeotemperatures for tropical seas during peak glaciation. Angiolini et al. (2009) suggested that thehigh δ18O values registered in the southern Ural samples (Korte et al., 2005) are possibly the result of excess\nevaporation caused by regional aridity. High Sakmarian and Artinskian δ18O values measured on brachiopods from the Urals were also interpreted to represent regional aridification and excess evaporation (Grossman et al., 2008). Discrepancies in the oxygen isotope ratiosmeasured on Middle Permian brachiopods from the Delaware Basin (Korte et al., 2005) and Spitsbergen (Mii et al., 1997) similarly suggest\nregional differences in aridity. The Spitsbergen brachiopod samples were collected from higher latitudes of 45°N (Stampfli and Borel, 2002), whereas the Delaware Basin was located in near-equatorial latitudes. Brachiopods from Spitsbergen are expected to have higher δ18O values representative of lower palaeotemperatures in higher latitudes. However, the δ18O values of brachiopods from Spitsbergen are on average −3.1±0.9‰, whereas the brachiopods from the Delaware Basin have an average value of −2.1±0.9‰ (Fig. 4B). This discrepancy was interpreted by Korte et al. (2005) to reflect significantly higher evaporation rates in the Delaware Basin. In summary, the relatively large differences in the oxygen isotope ratios of brachiopods from different areas argue for significant differences in local climate conditions (e.g., evaporation/precipitation ratio). Nevertheless, a change in the oxygen isotope composition of Permian sea water due to the waning of Gondwanan ice sheets should be documented in a decrease in δ18O of brachiopod calcite. However, no general trend is visible if brachiopod δ18O values from different areas are plotted together. Therefore, reconstructions of secular changes in the oxygen isotope ratio of Permian sea water and/or of the palaeotemperature history should not be performed by compiling oxygen isotope data from different areas or palaeocontinents (e.g., Korte et al., 2005), but have to be based on continuous oxygen isotope records from specific areas."

    "text": "Conodont animals are generally interpreted to have been nektonic organisms, and knowledge of the life habitat for analyzed taxa is important to the interpretation of the oxygen isotope ratios. Streptognathodus, Mesogondolella, Jinogondolella and Clarkina are the most abundant taxa in the Permian samples analyzed. Hindeodus occurred only rarely, and was analyzed separately in cases where the abundances were sufficient to compose mono-generic samples. Since no significant difference in δ18O was observed between ramiform and platform elements of Clarkina or Jinogondolella from the same samples (taking into account an analytical reproducibility of±0.2‰), both ramiform andplatformelements were used for analysis.\nStreptognathodus is the predominant genus recovered from the earliest Permian samples in this study, and is often considered to be a Carboniferous holdover (e.g., Mei et al., 2002). Based on the distribution of conodont taxa in specific lithologies of U.S. Midcontinent cyclothems, Streptognathodus iswidely accepted to have lived in normal open-marine, warm surface waters, whereas coeval Hindeodus is considered to have inhabited more shallow environments (Heckel, 1994, 2002; Boardman et al., 1998). Mesogondolella, Jinogondolella and Clarkina are usually found in offshore, predominately basinal facies (e.g., Wardlaw and Collinson, 1984; Mei and Henderson, 2001; Kozur and Wardlaw, 2010). Analyses of coeval Early Permian Mesogondolella and Streptognathodus elements from the Naqing section (this study) yield comparable δ18O values (Fig. 3A), suggesting both taxa could live in waters with comparable temperatures. Since Streptognathodus is considered as a surface-water dwelling taxon, a similar habitat is expected for co-occurringMesogondolella.\nThe comparison of the oxygen isotope ratios of Pennsylvanian Streptognathodus and Hindeodus indicated no significant differences in δ18O, but a 0.6‰ higher oxygen isotope value of Gondolella relative to Hindeodus (Joachimski et al., 2006). A similar difference in δ18O between Hindeodus and coeval Jinogondolella or Clarkina was observed in a study on conodonts from two Guadalupian–Lopingian boundary sections (Fig. 3a; Chen et al., 2011), suggesting a shallower and warmer water habitat for Hindeodus, and potentially a deeper, cooler water habitat for Jinogondolella and Clarkina. Interestingly, oxygen isotope analyses measured on co-occurring Hindeodus and Clarkina from the PTB section of Meishan yield comparable δ18O values in samples below the PT event horizon, but a 0.8‰ difference in latest\nPermian and earliest Triassic samples (Fig. 3a; Joachimski et al., 2012). The comparable oxygen isotope ratios of Clarkina and Hindeodus indicate that both taxa were able to thrive in comparable shallow water depths during low sea level (e.g., b50 m; Joachimski et al., 2012). However, as sea level was rising in the latest Permian and Early Triassic, Clarkinamigrated to deeper and slightly cooler waters. This interpretation is consistent with the early hypothesis that Clarkina was a free-swimming taxon thriving in offshore or even deeper waters (Tian, 1993a, 1993b; Orchard, 1996; Lai et al., 2001).\nIn summary, the oxygen isotope analyses of Permian conodonts suggests that Streptognathodus, Hindeodus, and probably Early Permian Mesogondollella as well, were thriving in near-surface sea water and recorded surface water temperature, whereas the habitats of Jinogondolella and Clarkina are more difficult to constrain. The isotope results suggest that both surface and deeper water masses could be potential life habitats for gondolellid conodonts."

    "text": "In comparison to the brachiopod calcite δ18O record, the composite conodont apatite δ18O record shows generally minor variations (1–2‰) for samples from specific time intervals. However, Middle Permian conodont samples from the Guadalupe Mountains have generally higher δ18O values (21 to 22‰) compared to conodont samples from South China (20 to 21‰; Fig. 3B). This is consistent with observations made by Korte et al. (2005) showing higher δ18O values for brachiopods from the Guadalupe Mountains in comparison to brachiopods from other areas. These higher oxygen isotope ratios can be explained by higher evaporation rates and thus higher δ18O values of sea water in the Delaware basin. The evaporate component of the Artesia Group (Guadalupe shelf deposits) is well known (e.g., Kendall, 1969). Lopingian conodonts from Iran and South China also show a major difference in δ18O, with Changhsingian conodonts from South China having values ranging from 21 to 22.3‰, whereas coeval conodont samples from Iran are between 19.8 and 21‰ (Fig. 3B). This difference cannot be attributed to their different palaeolatitudes, since Iran and South Chinawere located in near equatorial positions. These examples confirm that, as indicated by the oxygen isotope ratios of brachiopod shell calcite, sea water in different areas of the Permian oceans was characterized by relatively large differences in δ18O as consequence of regional differences in the evaporation/precipitation ratio. In order to exclude this effect, the following discussion will focus on the oxygen isotope record measured only on conodonts from the South China block.\nConodont apatite oxygen isotope values are generally between 22 and 23‰ throughout the Asselian, Sakmarian and Artinskian. No significant differences are observed in the oxygen isotope ratios of coeval Mesogondolella and Streptognathodus elements, suggesting that both taxa were thriving in comparable water depths (Fig. 3A). Since early Permian conodont samples were collected from a slope setting representing fully marine conditions, evaporation and thus higher salinities cannot explain the relatively high oxygen isotope ratios. This interpretation is supported by palaeobotanical evidence that indicates humid climatic conditions for south China during most of the Permian (Cleal and Thomas, 2005; Hilton and Cleal, 2007). Consequently, the high δ18O values are interpreted as expression of the LPIA, with the formation of isotopically light continental ice masses resulting in high δ18O values of Early Permian sea water. The LPIA was suggested to have had ice volumes comparable to the Pleistocene glacial maxima (Buggisch et al., 2008; Elrick and Scott, 2010). Assuming a δ18Ow of +1‰ VSMOW for Early Permian seawater, sea water temperatures calculated from the oxygen isotope ratios of Early Permian conodonts would have been between 26 and 30 °C. Alternatively, if a δ18Ow of +0.5‰ VSMOW is assumed, reconstructed temperatures would be 24 to 28 °C. These temperature estimates seem realistic for tropical seas and are in agreement with the sedimentary record of the South China block, where the Early Permian is\nrepresented by carbonate sedimentation with abundant ‘warm-water’ taxa such as fusulinacean foraminifera, rugose corals and the occurrence of reefal buildups (Shi, 2001; X.D. Wang et al., 2006; Y. Wang et al., 2006). Additionally, oncoid‐bearing deposits are widely developed in Asselian to Sakmarian strata across the entire South China platform, indicating warm and shallow waters, and which are potentially comparable to the modern tropical environments on the Great Bahama Bank or the west Florida shelf (Shi and Chen, 2006).\nConodont apatite δ18O values began to decrease in the early to middle Kungurian with minimum values registered in the late Capitanian (Fig. 3B). The gradual 2‰ decrease as recorded by gondolellids corresponds to 8 °C warming if explained exclusively by a change in surface water temperature. If gondolellids lived in deeper waters, the 2‰ change in δ18O would preferentially correspond to a change in the oxygen isotope composition of Permian sea water and translate into a 200 m sea-level rise as consequence of the waning of continental ice masses, assuming a change in δ18O of seawater of 0.1‰ per 10 m glacio-eustatic sea-level change (Schrag et al., 1996). For comparison, Zachos et al. (2001) compiled oxygen isotope values of benthic foraminifera and calculated a 2.3‰ change in the oxygen isotope composition of sea water as consequence of the Cenozoic growth of ice sheets. Alternatively, a combination of climatic warming and waning of high-latitude ice masses could account for the relatively large decrease in δ18O. The 2.0‰ decrease is comparable to the δ18O change\nP1 P2EA\nAN\nWA\nSI\nAge (Ma\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nNaqing Meishan Shangsi Tieqiao Dukou PenglaitanJiangya\nC.\n295 290 285 280 275\n8 1\n) W\nO M\nS V\n‰( O ap at ite\n295.0 290.1 282.0298.9\nFig. 5.

This would correspond to a lower sea level of 120 m (Fairbanks, 1989; Peltier and Fairbanks, 2006) or 130 m (Yokoyama et al., 2000; Mitrovica, 2003), and 1–3 °C (Bard et al., 1997; Pelejero et al., 1999; Lea et al., 2002; Rosell-Melé et al., 2004; Barker et al., 2005; Hippler et al., 2006), or 4–6 °C cooler condition in low latitudes during the LGM (Beck et al., 1992; Guilderson et al., 1994; Stute et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1995; McCulloch et al., 1999).\nOur data suggest that the main deglaciation of the LPIA would have occurred in the Kungurian to Capitanian. This is in contrast to the widely accepted interpretation that, based on the abundance and distribution of glacial deposits, the LPIA reached its climax during the Asselian and early Sakmarian (Isbell et al., 2003; Fielding et al., 2008c; Zeng et al., 2012), and also that high latitude ice sheets melted during the later Sakmarian. Other evidence for post-Sakmarian glaciers were reported from eastern and western Australia (Fielding et al., 2008c) and Siberia (Chumakov, 1994) until the late Capitanian (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the glacial record from eastern Australia suggests that glaciation P2 (late Sakmarian to mid-Artinskian) was even larger than the preceding glacial phase P1 (Asselian to early Sakmarian), a glacial interval generally thought to represent the climax of the LPIA (Fielding et al., 2008c).

Alternate ages (top) based on recently published radiometric ages (Shen et al., 2011; Sun et al. (2010) and Mundil et al. (2004), respectively. Ro.—Roadian, Wo.—Wordian,\nindicate repeated and large-scale relative sea-level changes up to 70 m, suggesting that ice sheets were waning andwaxing during this time period (Fielding et al., 2008a). For example, small and transient Artinskian to Kungurian glacial deposits were reported from Western Australia (Mory et al., 2008). The succeeding glacial intervals P3 (late Kungurian to latest Roadian) and P4 (late Wordian to late Capitanian) reported from eastern Australia are considered to represent only regionally alpine-style glaciations containing limited ice volume (Fielding et al., 2008a; Fielding et al., 2008b; Rygel et al., 2008; Birgenheier et al., 2010), whichwould have only aminor influence on the oxygen isotopic composition of Permian seawater.\nInterestingly, a late Kungurian termination of LPIA as indicated by the conodont δ18O data agrees well with a significant decrease in the magnitude of glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations as suggested by Ross and Ross (1987; Fig. 5). In contrast, a recently published compilation of glacio-eustatic sea-level by Rygel et al. (2008) suggests sea level fluctuations of up to 120 m during the late Pennsylvanian to middle Sakmarian, and significantly minor fluctuations of 30–70 m and 10–60 m during the Middle Sakmarian and the Roadian through Capitanian, respectively (Fig. 5). However, the precise correlation between the conodont δ18O record from South China and the glacial record in Gondwana remains difficult due the lack of a well-constrained biostratigraphic correlations as well as the potential stratigraphic incompleteness of the Gondwanan successions as consequence of glacial erosion.\nThe conodont oxygen isotope record across the Guadalupian– Lopingian (G–L) transition suggests warming of about 4 °C in the late Capitanian, followedby cooling of about 6 to 8 °C across the G–L boundary and in the earliest Wuchiapingian, and again significant warming in the early Wuchiapingian. The rapid 4 °C warming and succeeding 6 to 8 °C cooling coincide with the main and final phase of Emeishan volcanism, respectively, and with relative sea level changes suggesting that the variations in the oxygen isotope ratios may be the combined effect of changes in water depth and volcanism-related climate changes (Chen et al., 2011).\nStarting from the early Wuchiapingian and lasting until the late Changhsingian, conodont δ18O values increase by 2‰. This increase in δ18O corresponds to cooling with temperatures decreasing from 32 to 23 °C if a δ18O value of −1‰ VSMOW (ice-free world) is assumed for Late Permian sea water. Cool climatic conditions in the Changhsingian were previously proposed by Beauchamp and Baud (2002), Kozur (1998), Mei et al. (2002) and Mertmann (2003), based on faunal diversity, conodont distribution, and lithological evidence as well as oxygen isotope ratios of carbonates (for summary see Table 3 in Racki andWignall, 2005). In addition, cooling is indicated by the occurrence of distinct peri-Gondwanan cool water brachiopod elements and the absence of compound corals in Changhsingian strata in southwestern Tibet (Shen et al., 2006, 2010). However, 9 °C cooling in low-latitudes seems unrealistic during non-glacial times, taking into account that the tropics were only 1 to 6 °C cooler during the Last Glacial Maximum in comparison to the Holocene (for a review see Crowley, 2000; MARGO Project Members., 2009). Interestingly, inferred cooling as indicated by the conodont apatite δ18O record coincides with the Wuchiapingian to Changhsingian transgression observed in the Tethys area and the South China block (Chen et al., 1998). As a consequence, Clarkina (or Neogondolella) may have moved to deeper and thus cooler waters. Taking a modern water temperature/water depth gradient for low-latitudinal seas, 9 °C cooling would correspond to deepening of approximately 130 to 150 m (Levitus and Boyer, 1994). Since this estimate is inconsistent with the minor sea level rise in the Wuchiapingian and Changhsingian, the Lopingian increase in the oxygen isotope ratios can best be explained as the combined effect of climate cooling and Clarkina moving to deeper/cooler waters following the sea level rise.\nThe interpretation that Clarkina was able to live in different water depths is confirmed by the oxygen isotope ratios of Clarkina and\nHindeodus from the PTB interval (Joachimski et al., 2012). Latest Permian Hindeodus and Clarkina have comparable oxygen isotope ratios, indicating that both taxa lived in identical water depths. Both taxa show decreasing δ18O values across the Permian–Triassic extinction horizon, translating into significant climate warming. However, the decrease in gondolellid δ18O is smaller in comparison to the increase measured on Hindeodus, which suggests that Clarkina was moving to deeper waters in conjunction with a sea-level rise in the latest Changshingian (Joachimski et al., 2012). Climate warming in the latest Permian coincides with both the significant negative carbon isotope excursion and the eruption of the Siberian Traps, and may be interdependent and explained by the emission of volcanic CO2 (Renne et al., 1995; Sobolev et al., 2011), thermal decomposition of pre-existing sediments induced by the volcanism (Svensen et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2011), and the destabilization of 12C-enriched methane hydrates contained in permafrost soils (e.g., Retallack and Jahren, 2008). All of these processes will have resulted in higher greenhouse gas levels, and may have contributed to the significant climate warming observed in the latest Permian."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "The compilation of brachiopod calcite as well as conodont apatite oxygen isotope data shows relatively large differences in δ18O for datasets derived from different palaeocontinents. These differences are attributed to local hydrological conditions associated with regional aridity and differences in the evaporation/precipitation ratio.\nThe conodont apatite oxygen isotope record from the South China block is used to interpret the palaeoclimate history of the Permian. The conodont taxa Streptognathodus and Hindeodus are interpreted to represent surface water dwellers recording surface water δ18O and temperature. Gondolellids, which represent the most abundant taxa in the sections studied, may have lived in different parts of the water column, and may be used to reconstruct secular changes in the oxygen isotope composition of Permian sea water and to a lesser degree to reconstruct palaeotemperature variations. This interpretation is based on the observation that the oxygen isotope ratios of gondolellids seem to co-vary with sea-level changes. During a high or rising sea level, Permian gondolellids show higher δ18O values in comparison to hindeodids. In contrast, during lower sea level and thus minimum absolute water depths, gondolellids and hindeodids show comparable isotope ratios suggesting that both taxa were living in comparable water depths.\nThe conodont apatite oxygen isotope record supports glaciated conditions in the Early Permian by showing high values between 22 and 23‰, but argues for a later deglaciation phase than is indicated by sedimentologic evidence. The δ18O decrease of 2‰ during the Kungurian to Capitanian was measured on gondolellid conodonts and is interpreted to reflect predominately the waning of high-latitude ice masses and subordinately climate warming. This suggests that post-Sakmarian ice sheets may have been widespread in Gondwana until the Kungurian. The Guadalupian–Lopingian transition interval is characterized by significant temperature fluctuations with 4 °C warming succeeding by 6 to 8 °C cooling, interpreted as combined climate change initiated by Emeishan volcanism and changes in habitat depth of gondolellid conodonts as consequence of sea-level changes. The significant increase in δ18O in theWuchiapingian to Changhsingian to values around 22.0‰ is ascribed to the combined effect of climate cooling and Clarkinamigrating to deeper/cooler waters as sea level was rising. The rapid δ18O decrease of 2‰ across the PTB indicates a dramatic globalwarming in the latest Permian and earliest Triassic, potentially caused bymassive injection of greenhouse gases to the ocean–atmosphere system as a consequence of Siberian Trap volcanism, volcanism-induced thermal decomposition of organic carbon-rich sediments and/or destabilization of methane hydrates contained in permafrost soils."
