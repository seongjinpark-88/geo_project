    "text": "During a volcanic e rup t ion silicate micropar t ic les and sulphuric gases are injected into the s t ra tosphere . The main effect of the silicates is p robab ly to heat up the s t ra tosphere by absorp t ion of thermal radiat ion (Baldwin et al., 1976; Hansen et al., 1978) , bu t t hey disappear by settling dur ing the first few m o n t h s (Mossop, 1964; Pollack et al., 1976). At the same t ime a sulphate aerosol, main ly sulphuric acid, is building up to become the d o m i n a n t aerosol (Cast leman et al., 1974; Pollack et al., 1976), the main climatic effect of which seems to be cool ing the lower t roposphe re by back-scat ter ing of solar radia t ion (Baldwin et al., 1976; Hansen et al., 1978), as previously suggested by various au thors (e.g. Humphreys , 1940; Lamb, 1970). In t rying to use condi t ions o f the past to verify these s ta tements , a serious d i f f icul ty is the short per iods of t ime, f rom which reliable ins t rumenta l records o f cl imatic t empera tures and volcanic act ivi ty are available ( two and one hund red years, respectively), including too few great volcanic events to allow a conclus ion of statistical significance. Extens ion of these records fur ther back in t ime has to be based on indirect and, therefore , less reliable evidence, for example historical informat ions .\n0377-0273/81/0000--0000/$02.50 © 1981 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company\nThe deposition of volcamc ash particles on the Greenland ice sheet is ~l~ least one order of magnitude lower than the background deposition o( continental dust ( - 6 0 ~g per kg ice) even in cases of great, high-latitude' eruptions, and it is nearly two orders of magnitudes lower than the total volcanic fallout, the bulk of which is strong electrolytes, mainly H2SO~ and sometimes also HC1 and non-acid sulphates and chlorides, probably (NH4)2SO4 and NH4C1 (Hammer, 1977, 1980). In extreme cases, e .g Eldgja, A.D. 934 {Hammer, 1980), the percentage of volcanic salts may reach some 50% of the total amount of electrolytes, but generally the acid component is dominant. The contribution of NO3- is considered negligible, because no increase of the NO3- background value (ca. 0.9 pequiv/kg ice; this work) could be detected in several cases of heavy volcanic fallout.\nThis paper aims at showing (1) that the acidity of the ice is an index of the volcanic fallout and of the volcanic activity north of 20 ° south; and (2) that long lasting volcamc activity strongly influences the global climate."

    "text": "All of the acidity data presented below have been obtained by analysis of a 404 m long ice core recovered in 1974 at Cr~te, central Greenland (71°N, 37°W). The core reaches back to A.D. 553 and has been year-byyear dated by various stratigraphic techniques (Hammer et al., 1978) with an accuracy better than -+1 yr back to A.D. 1104 to judge from the fact that strong and easily identifiable volcanic signals were found in the annual layers; A.D. 1912--13 (Katmai, 1912), 1816--17 (Tambora, 1815), 1783 (Laki, 1783), 1601--02 (unknown eruption of considerable magnitude 1601--02, according to Lamb, 1970}, and 1105 (Hekla, 1104}. The dating at A.D. 553 of the oldest layer in the core is estimated to be in error of no more than three years.\nA continuous acidity profile along the ice core was measured electrically, in the firn mainly by pH measurements, but otherwise by pulling a pair of electrodes along a clean cut surface, the current being a power function of the concentration of protons associated with strong acids (Hammer, 1980). The acidity accounts for the major parts of the conductivity of the ice in melted condition, and the method has the advantage that sea salts and carbon dioxide do not influence the measurements, which, in addition, are extremely fast."

However , an i m p o r t a n t d rawback in these calculat ions is ~'that the sign and magn i tude of AT depends crit ically on the real and imaginary parts of the refractive indices o f the added particles, their size dis tr ibut ion, and the surface a lbedo\" (Baldwin et al., 1976), which o f course stresses the need for a direct compar i son be tween volcanic activity and climatic changes prior to the ins t rumenta l epoch.\nThe excess acidi ty data given in Fig.1 mus t be expec ted to be p ropor t iona l to the volcanic con t r i bu t i on AT to the optical depth in the high nor the rn lat i tude a tmosphere . As a first app rox ima t ion we fur ther assume tha t this AT is just as relevant for compar i son with Nor the rn Hemisphere climatic t empera tu re changes as is the global averaged AT. This is o f ten imphcl t ly assumed in mode l calculat ions, where the l a t i tude-dependen t back-scat ter ing has been averaged. In order to examine the possible inf luence of volcanic activity u p o n cl imate we compare below the acidi ty record with some climatic records of p r o x y data reaching far b e y o n d the per iod of direct t empera tu re observations. Since the ice acidi ty data are more or less representative of aerosol cond i t ions in the Nor the rn Hemisphere in general, t hey ough t to be c o m p a r e d with t empera tu res of similar general validity, ra ther than data representat ive of regional cl imatic condi t ions , e.g. central England t empera tu re est imates (Fig.2a; Lamb, 1968); White Mountains , California, tree ring widths (Fig.2b, LaMarche, 1974); or the oxygen isotopic composition of Greenland ice sheet prec ip i ta t ion I (Fig.2c; Johnsen et al., 1972; Dansgaard et ah, 1975). But, if these three climatic curves are c o m b i n e d after being s tandardized 2, the result ing record (Fig.2d) may serve as a basis for a meaningfu l compar i son with the ice acidi ty record, which is shown as 50 year means in Fig.2e.\nThe Nor the rn Hemisphere t empera tu re index in Fig.2d has no t been provided with a t empera tu re scale, of course. Most o f its t rends are recognized,\n~The curve in Fig.2c is the presently best obtainable representation of the temporal 5(180) changes in Greenland ice sheet precipitation. It is based on well-dated mean annual 6(~sO) profiles along continuous ice cores from four different ice sheet locations: 1, Dye 3, south Greenland (65°N, 44°W), spans A.D. 1971--1244; 2, Cr~te, mid-Greenland (71°N, 37°W), spans A.D_ 1973--553; 3, north-central (75°N, 40°W), spans A_D. 1977-- 1411; 4, Camp Century, northwest Greenland (77°N, 61°W), time span considered A D. 1950--550. These were combined in the following way: first, a time series of 50 year mean 5-deviations from the over-all mean value was calculated for each station: second, the four Ab curves were standardized (the difference between max_ and min value in each record being set equal to one); third, the average value of Camp Century and Cr~te back to 1250 A.D. (after being standardized) was chosen as the average value back to 1250 A.D., when all four records were finally combined into a generahzed Greenland curve as shown in Fig_2c. :The curves in Fig. 2a, b and c were standardized by setting the difference between max. and min. value in each record equal to one.\n2 0 0 0 , ! ) I r i , i I 2 0 0 0\nL 1 i i I _ I m I l l\n' I / I' 1800 L [ - - - - 1800 f jl I\n' ' , '_IOOO III \" I I - F ] I I I IL l 1600\n1 4 ° ° - t l j - I '\nt rt , 1 2 0 0 - - ] ,J - - 1 2 0 0 '\n,ooo-_ V Ill ,,, F,• _- ~ooo 800 - I •' [1 [_\nCentra l ~ f~-- • - - 6 0 0 A'D\" L England Whi teMtns .

This suggests tha t fu ture cl imate models should accoun t for the lat i tudinal variat ion o f the optical dep th of volcanic aerosols, ra ther than using a global average.\nThe significant corre la t ion be tween curves 2d and 2e indicates tha t persistent volcanic activi ty nor th o f 20°S may be an i m p o r t a n t cause for climatic f luc tua t ions up to several hund red years dura t ion at mid and high latitudes. If true, a solut ion of the ex t remely impor t an t and diff icult p rob lem of predic t ing climatic changes implies a scarcely easier predic t ion of volcanic activity."
