However, the identification of the source areas of these rocks is difficult due to the lack of an integrated stratigraphic and geochemical analysis of the relationships between the two volcanic districts, and to the alteration affecting the primary products as consequence of weathering and pedogenetic processes. Here, a comprehensive, upgraded stratigraphic and geochronological review of the two volcanic districts, corroborated by new geochronological data for several eruptive units and altered deposits is presented, coupled to a complete geochemical background, achieved by means of newly determined major and trace element analyses for all the main eruptive units. A study of the alteration processes of the primary products is also presented, and the age of themain weathering and pedogenetic phases, associated to Quaternary climatic changes, are also investigated. The results are integrated with those from literature in order to construct discriminant diagrams based on selected trace elements, and allow us to characterize the primary and altered volcanic deposits in the Rome area, distinguish products of different volcanic districts, discuss the effects of different weathering processes on the mobility of some elements, and provide a reference frame for the provenance of the volcanic materials employed in ancient Roman masonry. The interdisciplinary data set and results presented here provide groundwork for volcanological, climate, pedological and archaeological provenance studies.\n+39 0651860507.\nl rights reserved.\n© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Thepyroclastic rocks of theMonti Sabatini (MS) andAlbanHills (AH) volcanic districts form the bedrock underlying the city of Rome and its surroundings (Fig. 1) (Fornaseri et al., 1963; Ventriglia, 1971; De Rita et al., 1988; Marra and Rosa, 1995). The builders of ancient Rome employed the Alban Hills and Monti Sabatini rocks as lightweight and fire resistant tuff dimension stone, or as pozzolanic aggregates for the volcanic ash-hydrated limemortars of conglomeratic concretes (Table 1; Jackson et al., 2005; Jackson and Marra, 2006; Jackson et al., 2010).\nThe identification of the lithological provenance (source area) of the Roman pyroclastic rocks requires a good knowledge of their macroscopic- and microscopic-scale fabrics, and their mineralogical and geochemical compositions. For example, a single eruptive unit may exhibit a wide range of colors, grain size, and compositional fabrics (De Casa et al., 1999; Jackson et al., 2005). These variations may depend on (a) primary geological factors such as the distance from the eruptive vent, the morphology and composition of the substrate, and the deposition mechanism of the pyroclastic flows and/or (b) secondary processes such as weathering and alteration which occur during the interaction the volcanic particles with surface and/or ground waters, either in situ as well as after erosion and re-\ndeposition. In particular, the leaching of volcanic glass and dissolution of leucite in the Roman pyroclastic rocks over thousands of years were accompanied by processes of illuviation and translocation of interstitial fluids, and the precipitation of authigenic minerals such as opal, clay (mainly halloysite), and zeolite (mainly analcime, phillipsite and chabasite) (Jackson et al., 2010). These processes show significant variations at various localities within the same eruptive unit, and they result in substantial alteration of the major and trace element composition of the erupted materials. However, some trace elements, such as Ti, Zr, Y, Nb, are considered to be immobile or less mobile of other elements, such as Si, Na, K, Al, Rb, Sr, during leaching and alteration (Cann, 1970; Pearce and Cann, 1971, 1973; Floyd and Winchester, 1975; Pearce, 1996; Duzgoren-Aydin et al., 2002). Indeed, nominally ‘immobile’ elements have been used to classify altered volcanic rocks (e.g., Kaan and Göncüoglu, 2009) and evaluate the effects of the pedogenesis on volcanic materials (Little and Lee, 2009).\nA series of recent publications provide petrographic criteria for the identification of the principal volcanic rocks of the Monti Sabatini and Alban Hills volcanic districts, which builders employed in Rome as dimension stone (Jackson et al., 2005; Jackson andMarra, 2006), and as coarse aggregate (caementa) and pozzolanic aggregate (harenae fossiciae) of concretes andmortars (Jackson et al., 2007, 2010). However,\ne location of the Latial and Campanian volcanoes is shown in the inset.\nTable 1\nVOLCANIC DEPOSIT (1) DISTRICT AGE (ka) (1) HISTORICAL NAMES (7) ARCHAEOLOGICAL NAME (8) (9)\nUSE (8) (9) (10)\nAlbano Crater pyroclastic-flow unit e (2) AH 36±1(4) Peperino di Marino, Peperino albano Lapis Albanus, Peperino\nDimension stone\nCapo di Bove leucititic lava flow AH 277±1 Capo di Bove lava flow Selce Paving slabs, Coarse aggregate Castiglione Crater pyroclastic-surge deposit AH 285±5 (5) Peperino di Gabi Lapis Gabinus, Peperino, Sperone Dimension stone Tuscolano–Artemisio scoria cone deposits: AH 365–351 (6) Welded scoria Lava Spero Sperone Dimension stone Zeolitic tuff Tufo marrone dell'Artemisio Tufo di Tuscolo Dimension stone Villa Senni Eruptive Unit (3): AH 365±4 (6) Pozzolanelle, Pozzolane superiori, Pozzolane grigie Fine aggregate Upper pyroclastic-flow unit Tufo Lionato, Tufo Rosso Litoide Tufo dell'Aniene Dimension stone, Lower pyroclastic-flow unit Coarse aggregate, Fine aggregate Pozzolane Nere pyroclastic flow AH 407±2 (6) Pozzolane Nere, Pozzolane delle Tre Fontane Tufo di Monteverde Fine aggregate?

Marra et al. / Earth-Science Reviews 108 (2011) 115–136\nmacroscopic andmicroscopic features sometimesmay not be sufficiently diagnostic to unequivocally determine the lithological provenance of sand- to fine gravel-sized particles of pozzolanic aggregate, in particular light-colored, pumice clasts (Jackson et al., 2009; Lancaster et al., 2010; Jackson et al., in press; Lancaster et al., in press). X-ray diffraction analyses, which reveal the primary volcanic and secondary authigenic mineral assemblages of the aggregates, and bulk chemical analyses provide important information, but often these are not sufficiently diverse to identify the provenance (Lancaster et al., 2010,in press).\nRadioisotopic dating using 40Ar/39Ar methods have been shown to be a powerful tool for the identification of diverse eruptive deposits of the Latial volcanoes (e.g. Karner et al., 2001a, 2001b; Marra et al., 2003; Freda et al., 2006; Giaccio et al., 2009). Even so, this dating method is not suitable for analysis of the volcanic aggregate of the ancient mortars, where millimeter-sized pumice clasts are distributed through a fine-grained binding matrix.\nIn the last decades, the development of X-Ray and spectrometry techniques has encouraged a more thorough characterization of different volcanic products through, for example, the laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LS-ICP-MS) method, introduced in the 1990s, which accurately determines a wide range of trace elements compositions (Pollard et al., 2007). Recently, Peccerillo (2005) provided a large reference database for the geochemical compositions of the products of the volcanic districts of Italy and Lancaster et al. (in press) showed that the relative abundances of immobile elements such as Zr/Y and Nb/Y ratios, among others, may represent geochemical signatures that discriminate among different volcanic products. The comparison of these ratios appears to give an accurate representation of provenance to a specific volcanic area and, sometimes, to a single eruption unit. Unfortunately, only sparse trace element data, mainly on lava flows, were available for the products of the Monti Sabatini and Alban Hills volcanic districts. More recently, Sonck-Koota et al. (2008) provide trace element characterization of several Alban Hills and Monti Sabatini volcanic rocks employed in Roman masonry. Other trace element data for the primary volcanic deposits of Alban Hills and Monti Sabatini are in Boari et al. (2009), Lancaster et al. (in press), and Sottili et al. (2004).\nIn this study, we provide new trace element data for the five major pyroclastic-flow deposits of the Alban Hills and for twelve pyroclasticflowandair-fall deposits of theMonti Sabatini. Furthermore,weprovide geochemical data for some distal and partially reworkedMonti Sabatini fallout deposits that we compare to those for the primary products in order to characterize the trace element signature of tephra affected by reworking, pedogenesis and illuviation processes. Finally, we integrate our data with those reported in published literature to construct comprehensive diagrams using the so-called ‘immobile’ trace elements (Zr, Nb, Y, Th, and Ta) in order to (a) characterize the primary and weathered volcanic deposits in the Rome area, (b) discuss the effects of weathering and alteration processes on these supposed 'immobile' elements, and (b) provide a reference frame for the lithological provenance of the volcanic materials employed in ancient Roman masonry, with particular attention to the pumice deposits."

The complex aggradational series of pyroclastic rocks, and reworked epiclastic deposits derived from their erosion and redeposition, emplaced mainly between 561 ka and 285 ka (Fig. 2) during the explosive activity of the Alban Hills and Monti Sabatini volcanoes (Marra and Rosa, 1995; Karner et al., 2001a; and references therein). These are part of the Roman Co-magmatic Region (Washington, 1906), a large area of potassium-rich volcanism, which also includes the Latial volcanic districts of Vulsini, Vico and Ernici, and the Campanian districts of Roccamonfina, Ischia, Campi Flegrei and Vesuvius (Fig. 1). The products of the Latial volcanoes are mafic to felsic rocks belonging to the potassic series (KS) and to the highly potassic series (HKS) (Conticelli and Peccerillo, 1992), and have major, trace element compositions, and radiogenic isotopic signature different from the Campanian volcanoes (Peccerillo, 2005).\n118 F.

    "text": "The Alban Hills products range in composition from K-foidite to tephrite and tephriphonolite (Trigila et al., 1995; Marra et al., 2003; Freda et al., 2006; Gaeta et al., 2006; Giordano et al., 2006; Marra et al., 2009). They are characterized by low SiO2 (≤ 45 wt.%) and by a modal assemblage consisting of clinopyroxene and leucite, with accessory biotite. Sanidine and plagioclase are lacking. The Alban Hills volcanic activity took place in three main phases marked by different eruptive mechanisms and magma volumes (De Rita et al., 1988, 1995; Giordano et al., 2006). The Tuscolano–Artemisio phase (volumes in the order of tens of km3) produced five geochronologically distinct, large pyroclastic flow sequences in the time span 561–351 ka (Karner et al., 2001a; Marra et al., 2009), accompanied by minor effusive activity (Fig. 2). An early phase of activity (Marra et al., 2009), which emplaced the Tufo Pisolitico di Trigoria, the Tufo del Palatino, and Tufo di Acque Albule pyroclastic-flow deposits, was characterized by hydromagmatic features (Palladino et al., 2001). Later, larger pyroclastic eruptions had a drier character, and emplaced the Pozzolane Rosse and Pozzolane Nere pyroclastic flows and the Villa Senni Eruptive Sequence, which includes the Tufo Lionato and Pozzolanelle pyroclastic flows (lower and upper flow units; Freda et al., 1997). The Tuscolano–Artemisio caldera and associated scoria cones developed at the end of this phase of activity, from ca. 365 to 351 ka (Figs. 1 and 2; Marra et al., 2003). An intermediate, less energetic phase, characterized by strombolian activity at the central Monte delle Faete edifice and effusive eruptions and subordinate\nFig. 2.

Large leucititic lava flows (Trigila et al., 1995; Boari et al., 2009) erupted during this phase, including the Capo di Bove lava flow (277±2 ka, Karner et al., 2001a); hydromagmatic surge eruptions occurred at the Castiglione crater (ca. 285 ka, Marra et al., 2003). A ca. 50 ka-long dormancy preceded the start of the late hydromagmatic phase (ca. 200–36 ka; Marra et al., 2003; Freda et al., 2006; Giaccio et al., 2009), which was dominated by maar and tuff ring forming eruptions (Fig. 2). The Albanomaar hosted themost recent and voluminous activity of this phase between 69 and 36 ka (Funiciello et al., 2003; Freda et al., 2006; Giaccio et al., 2007; D'Ambrosio et al., 2010)."

    "heading": "2.2. The eruptive products of the Monti Sabatini volcanic district",
    "text": "With respect to the Alban Hills volcanics, the Monti Sabatini products have a higher SiO2 content (≥50 wt.% versus ≤45 wt.% of Alban Hills), spanning in composition from trachybasalts to trachytes and phonolites, and display a higher degree of vesiculation of the scoria. They are characterized by a mineralogical assemblage of sanidine, leucite, and clinopyroxene; plagioclase is generally scarce in the explosive products (Scherillo, 1941; Cundari, 1979; Campobasso et al., 1994; Conticelli et al., 1997; Sottili et al., 2004; Masotta et al., 2010).\nThe Monti Sabatini activity was characterized by a more continuous character than that of the Alban Hills, and developed contemporaneously in different areas (Figs. 1 and 2; Karner et al.,\nnic districts showing the units for which geochemical data are provided in this study (2009), Sottili et al. (2010)). Relationships with the sedimentary deposits of the Paleoe data (two sigma errors) as follows: 1) Freda et al., 2006; 2) Marra et al., 2003; 3) from al., 2001a; 6) Sottili et al., 2010; 7) Karner and Renne, 1998: 7) Cioni et al., 1993.\n119F. Marra et al. / Earth-Science Reviews 108 (2011) 115–136\n2001a; Sottili et al., 2004). Moreover, the location of the climactic eruptive phases migrated through time. The early volcanic activity (ca. 582 to 410 ka, Fig. 2; De Rita et al., 1983; Karner et al., 2001a) took place mainly at the Morlupo and at the Southern Sabatini centers (Fig. 1; Sottili et al., 2004), and it was characterized by pyroclastic flows and subplinian to plinian fallout deposits. The major eruptive activity began at 582±2 ka with the First Ashfall Deposits (FAD of Karner et al., 2001a), which underlie the Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina pyroclastic flow deposits along the Tiber River Valley north of Rome, and are also exposed at km 13.2 of Via Tiberina (Fig. 1). Within the City of Rome, the FAD deposits have a thickness of 10–20 cm; they are buried by the younger Alban Hills rocks and have been found only in boreholes (Karner et al., 2001a). During the early activity, the emplacement of the lower and of the upper Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina (561±2 ka, 548±8 ka, Fig. 2; Karner et al., 2001a) occurred, followed by several other pyroclastic deposits flowing along the Tiber River Valley and reaching Rome. Among these, the weakly lithified tuffs of Tufo Giallo di Prima Porta (513±6 ka, Karner et al., 2001a) and the Grottarossa Pyroclastic Sequence (514±10 ka, Karner et al., 2001a) interfingered with Alban Hills products and sedimentary, epiclastic deposits of the paleo-Tiber, now exposed on the Capitoline and Palatine Hills (Valle Giulia Formation; Fig. 2; Karner et al., 2001b; Corazza et al., 2004; Jackson and Marra, 2006). These eruptions terminated the activity at Morlupo crater. Subsequently, a new eruptive phase took place at the southern Sabatini volcanic center (Sottili et al., 2004), emplacing the thick succession of Tufi Terrosi con Pomici Bianche fallout deposits from 507±4 to 496±4 ka (Fig. 2; Karner and Renne, 1998; Marra et al., 2009). Four large pumice fallout deposits, Falls A through D (Sottili et al., 2004) erupted during this period (Fig. 2). Fall A and B accumulated in up to ca. 50 cm thick deposits in the area of Rome, with characteristic, discontinuous lenses of pumices known with the local name of Granturco (Fornaseri et al., 1963; Marra and Rosa, 1995; Karner et al., 2001a). Fall D preceded the important Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere pyroclastic-flow eruption (449±2 ka; Karner et al., 2001a), which was followed by a succession of pumice and scoria fall deposits (Tufi Stratificati Varicolori di La Storta; Corda et al., 1978) emplaced in the western and southern areas of the Monti Sabatini district (Fig. 2). Karner et al. (2001a) reported radiometric ages of 416±12 and 410± 2 ka for two pumice fall horizons intercalated with the paleo-Tiber sediments of San Paolo Formation in Rome and in Ponte Galeria (Fig. 2), respectively, and correlated them to the Tufi Stratificati Varicolori di La Storta.\nBetween 320 and 200 ka, the eruptive activity concentrated in the Sacrofano and Lake Bracciano areas (Fig. 1; Sottili et al., 2010; De Rita et al., 1996). Effusive activity was accompanied by major explosive events, including the Tufo di Bracciano (ca. 312 ka; Sottili et al., 2010) and Tufo Giallo di Sacrofano (285±2 ka, Karner et al., 2001a) pyroclastic-flow eruptions (Fig. 2). Finally, from ca. 170 to 86 ka (Sottili et al., 2010), the late Monti Sabatini eruptive phase was characterized by dominant hydromagmatic and subordinate strombolian and effusive activity from several monogenetic tuff rings and scoria cones mainly between the Bracciano and Sacrofano depressions (Figs. 1 and 2)."

    "heading": "2.3. Components of the ancient Roman mortars",
    "text": "Early mortars of republican era concrete constructions in Rome, spanning about 380 BCE to 70 BCE, have aggregates mainly composed of sedimentary and reworked volcanic sands and gravels eroded from the tuff and granular ash deposits of the Roman landscape (Jackson et al., 2010, and references therein). These are mainly the Valle Giulia, San Paolo, and Aurelia Formations (Fig. 2; Marra and Rosa, 1995; Corazza et al., 2004), which represent the ‘ashy-gray type’ of Van Deman (1912). Therefore, these earlymortars contain diverse volcanic deposits, as well as loose crystals of volcanic\n(clinopyroxene, sanidine, leucite, biotite) and sedimentary origin, mainly quartz and calcite. By late first century BCE, Augustan age mortars consistently contained pozzolanic aggregate excavated from a reddened, intermediate alteration facies of the Pozzolane Rosse pyroclastic flow (Table 1) characterized by a peculiar reddish color (‘dusky-red type’ of Van Deman (1912)). Altered scoriaceous ash from the middle and lower horizons of Pozzolane Rosse are the principal pozzolanic constituents of the mortar of the wall concretes in the Imperial era monuments. This aggregate mixture produces distinct alkali- and alumina–calcium–silica–hydrate cement microstructures, including strätlingite (Jackson et al., 2009), which increases the durability and compressive strength of cements. Roman builders selectively employed this aggregate mix in the concrete elements of the Imperial Age monuments. The mortars of some imperial era vaulted concrete ceilings contain this mixture of Pozzolane Rosse with feldspar-bearing pumices, as described for the Forum and Markets of Trajan (Jackson et al., 2009). Indeed, the earliest example of pumices added to the Pozzolane Rosse occurs in the Forum of Caesar mortars (46–44 BCE) (Jackson et al., in press). Builders' formulations of concretes also included the addition of lightweight vesicular lava coarse aggregate in the barrel vaults of the Forum of Caesar and numerous imperial era vaulted structures (Amici, 1991; Lancaster, 2005). These concretes were apparently formulated to reduce the specific weight of the vaulted ceilings and the lateral thrust on the supporting walls. Although a Monti Sabatini provenance for some whitish vesicular lava occurring at Dioclethian Baths and in the Temple of Minerva was hypothesized since the beginning of the 20th century (De Angelis D'Ossat, 1945), recent work based on trace element data has demonstrated a Vesuvian origin for them, as well as for a white pumice employed in the concretes of Colosseum (Lancaster et al., in press). However, the provenance of most of the observed pumices remains unknown. The geochemical dataset for the major pumiceous deposits of the Monti Sabatini provided in this paper is aimed at giving the groundwork for their identification."

    "text": "Samples from the Roman sections of Castel di Leva (CDL) and Tenuta di Capannacce (TDC) were analyzed by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF) to determine the concentration of major and selected trace elements at the Michigan State University (Tables 2 and 3). Castel di Leva and Tenuta di Capannacce bulk samples were mixed with powdered Li2B4O7 flux with a sample/flux ratio of 4:9, and fused into glass discs. The same discs were then used for both wavelength-dispersive X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy on a Bruker S4 Pioneer (for major elements) and laser ablation ICP-MS (for trace elements). Bulk samples from Tor Carbone (TC, Table 4) and four extra samples from Tenuta di Capannacce (Table 3) were analyzed at Activation Laboratories, Canada. Samples were mixed with flux with a sample/flux ratio of 1:9, and fused into glass discs for wavelength dispersive XRF on a Rigaku 3270 for major elements and zirconium. Samples from Monti Sabatini (FAD, LTGTV, UTGVT-C, TGPP-a, TGPP-sc, GRPS-b, Fall B-GR, Fall B-VT, Fall E, TC 05p, SP-PG, SP-CH, 310 ka, TGS), Tufo di Tuscolo, Tufo del Palatino and Tufo Pisolitico di Trigoria (Table 5) were also analyzed at Activation Laboratories in Canada with the abovementioned methodology. Wet chemical techniques were used to measure the loss on ignition (LOI) at 900 °C. International rock standards have been used for calibration and the precision is better than 5% for Rb and Sr, 10% for Ni, Zr, Nb, Ba, Ce and La, and 15% for the other elements. 40Ar/39Ar age determinations on four samples were performed at the rare Gas Laboratory of Wisconsin-Madison University, following the procedures of Smith et al. (2008). The results are summarized in Table 6.\n120 F.M arra et al./ Earth-Science Review s 108 (2011) 115 –136\nSample CDL-16 — rewkd. MS ash/soil\nCDL-17 — rewkd.

    "text": "To provide a reference database for pozzolanic aggregates employed in the ancient mortars and in order to investigate the effects of weathering on the trace element composition of the volcanic deposits, we have performed a stratigraphic and geochemical study of Pozzolane Rosse (PR), Pozzolane Nere (PN), and Pozzolanelle (PL) granular volcanic ash deposits and their interbedded paleosols in three modern quarry sections at Castel di Leva (CDL, Fig. 3), Tenuta di Capannacce (TDC, Fig. 4), and Tor Carbone (TC, Fig. 5). To give an overview of the Alban Hills trace element compositions we provide 26 analyses on the Pozzolane Rosse, 8 analyses on the Pozzolane Nere and one analysis each for the Pozzolanelle, Tufo del Palatino, Tufo Pisolitico di Trigoria, and Tufo di Tuscolo eruption units (Fig. 2; Table 2–4). We integrate our analyses to those of Freda et al. (1997), Sonck-Koota et al. (2008) and Boari et al. (2009), for Pozzolane Rosse, Pozzolane Nere and Villa Senni Eruption Unit. In addition, we include data from Boari et al. (2009) on 6 lava flows erupted during the Tuscolano–Artemisio phase and on 14 lava flows of the Faete Phase of activity. Finally, data for Lapis Gabinus and Lapis Albanus from Sonck-Koota et al. (2008) extend our database to the intermediate and late Alban Hills hydromagmatic phases of activity (Marra et al., 2003).\nTo provide a reference database for the so far unidentified pumice employed in ancient Romanmortars (Jackson et al., 2009, in press) we have sampled and analyzed for trace element composition the largest pumice deposits associated with the explosive activity occurring at Monti Sabatini from 582 to 285 ka (Fig. 2; Table 4). Trace element data for three pyroclastic-flow deposits erupted during the early Monti Sabatini activity, that is, upper Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina, Tufo Giallo di Prima Porta and Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere, are reported in Sonck-Koota et al. (2008). To complete the Monti Sabatini geochemical dataset we give the trace element compositions for the lower Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina and the Grottarosa Pyroclastic Sequence (Table 4). Finally, we sampled some distal pumice occurring in epiclastic deposits to compare their trace element compositions to that of the primary equivalents, in order to investigate the effects of weathering on their geochemical signature."

    "text": "Figs. 3–5 illustrate the stratigraphic and geochemical features of Pozzolane Rosse, Pozzolane Nere, and Pozzolanelle granular volcanic ash deposits and their interbedded paleosols in three modern quarries at Castel di Leva (CDL), Tenuta di Capannacce (TDC) , and Tor Carbone (TC) (Fig. 1) (Jackson et al., 2007, 2010). Although it is not known the possible exploitation of these quarries in ancient times, they are the largest ones among those that are closer to Rome, and are located north to south, covering a wide distribution area of the pyroclastic flows. These volcanic deposits are massive, poorly sorted, pyroclastic flows composed of weakly to moderately vesicular, sand- to fine gravel-sized palagonitic glass fragments and, for Pozzolane Rosse, scoriae with mm-sized leucite and analcime, subordinate clinopyroxene and biotite crystals, as well as variable proportions of lava lithic fragments and occasional sedimentary, xenolithic clasts. The pyroclastic flows are separated by complex epiclastic horizons developed during nearly absolute volcanic dormancies of ~50 kyr at Alban Hills (Marra et al., 2009). These are composed of paleosols at the top of the pyroclastic flow deposits, as well as accretionary soils developed during the accumulations of mixed primary Monti Sabatini ashfall, as recorded by the presence of sanidine crystals and sideromelane ash (Jackson et al., 2007, 2010), and colluvial or re-deposited ash eroded from the local Alban Hills pyroclastic deposits. The Pozzolane Rosse pyroclastic-flow deposit crops out at the base of these successions and is overlain by variable, partially reworked volcaniclastic deposits."

    "text": "The micromorphological features of the Pozzolane Rosse at Castel di Leva illustrate three different alteration facies (Jackson et al., 2010): (a) an upper, strongly pedogenized horizon characterized by intense weathering, which produced strong dissolution of leucite and dense, illuvial halloysite surface coatings; (b) a transitional Bt to Bw soil horizon has opal and limpid translocated halloysite surface coatings; (c) a lower C horizon with opal and in situ crescent halloysite, presumably altered in ground water (Fig. 3). A vertical section of thirteen samples (CDL #18 to 30) (Table 2) were collected in the exposed, 6 m thick Pozzolane Rosse deposit of Castel di Leva (Fig. 3).

Sanidine crystals from PS1 deposit yield a stratigraphically inconsistent age of 495±21 ka (Table 6), which is older than the underlying, 456±3 ka Pozzolane Rosse. This may reflect the colluvial reworking of the PS1 ash, derived from older Monti Sabatini ashfall deposits.\nFive samples (# CDL 10–14, Fig. 3, Table 2) have been collected in the Pozzolane Nere, and one (#CDL 09) in the co-ignimbritic ashcloud deposit at the top of the pyroclastic flow, which is deeply weathered with strong leaching and dissolution of leucite (Jackson et al., 2010). A thick paleosol composed of reworked Monti Sabatini\nfallout ash and altered Pozzolane Nere colluvial ash (PS2, Fig. 3, samples # CDL 03–08, Table 2) separates the Pozzolane Nere and Pozzolanelle pyroclastic-flow deposits (Jackson et al., 2010). It is overlain by a 15 cm thick laminated ash layer representing the basal fallout deposit of the Villa Senni eruptive sequence (VS-c horizon, Marra et al., 2009; sample # CDL 02, Table 2), and followed by a reworked breccia layer (sample # CDL 01, Table 2), containing rounded, palagonitized fragments of the underlying Pozzolane Nere deposit. The Pozzolanelle massive pyroclastic-flow deposit (Fig. 3; Villa Senni upper flow unit, Freda et al., 1997) terminates the volcanic succession.\nTable 6 Radiometric Age of selected samples.\nSample Location Unit Experiment Material K/Ca N 39Ar % MSWD Age (ka)±2 σ\nDSL TDC 12 Tenuta di Capannacce Tufi Stratificati di La Storta UW75E55 biotite 3.537 10 of 10 100.0 0.23 395.0 ± 19.2 SP CH pumice Capitoline Hill San Paolo Formation UW75E59 sanidine 30.494 10 of 10 100.0 1.15 414.8 ± 6.0 CDL-PS1 Castel di Leva Mixed airfall and colluvial deposit UW75E58 sanidine 23.271 6 of 6 100.0 0.74 494.9 ± 21.6 Fall B Isola Farnese Tufi Terrosi con Pomici Bianche UW75E60 sanidine 28.129 10 of 10 100.0 0.21 491.2 ± 14.1\nAll ages calculated using the decay constants of Steiger and Jäger (λ40K=5.543 × 10−10 yr−1).

Nine samples were collected vertically in the Pozzolane Rosse with an average 20 cm spacing towards the top of the deposit (samples # TDC 01–05, Table 3), and a 1 m spacing in the lower portion (samples # C14, C11, C09, C04, Table 3). A 160 cm thick layer of colluvially reworked, mainly Monti Sabatini ashfall, sanidine-bearing soderomelane ash containing rounded altered Pozzolane Rosse scoria clasts in the lower portion (TSVLS, A1, Fig. 4; samples # TDC 06–09, Table 3), unconformably overlies the Pozzolane Rosse. A 5 cm thick gray lapilli layer marks the transition to a 50 cm thick primary Monti Sabatini ashfall deposit (TSVLS, A2, samples # TDC 10–11, Table 3). This, in turn, is covered by a 15 cm-thick fallout layer of dark scoria (DSL; sample # TDC 12, Table 3) composed of mmto cm-sized dark gray, sanidine-bearing scoria within a dark gray ash matrix. Biotite crystals picked out from dark scoria clasts of the fallout layer have been dated for this work, yielding an average age of 395± 19 ka (Table 6). Based on the age of the overlying Pozzolane Nere deposit (407±2 ka, Karner et al., 2001a), the age of the DSL fallout\ndeposit can be further constrained between 405 and 414 ka. Age and stratigraphic position correlate this layer with the Tufi Varicolori di La Storta succession. In particular, the DSL macroscopic features are similar to those of the second plinian fallout deposit (Fall F) that occurs above the Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere in the southern Monti Sabatini sector. A strongly pedogenized, dark orange, 100 cm thick layer of aggradational, sideromelane ash with occasional yellow pumice (PS in Fig. 4, samples # TDC13–15, Table 3) occurs on top of this succession, and it is overlain by the massive Pozzolane Nere pyroclastic-flowdeposit. Two sampleswere collected in the Pozzolane Nere at this location (samples # TDC 16–17, Table 3), where the ash matrix, which form about 80 vol.% of the deposit, has been strongly altered to poorly crystalline clay minerals."

PR: Pozzolane Rosse; PN: Pozzolane Nere; PL: Pozzolanelle.\nRosse (PS1A in Fig. 5) consists of a 1.5 m thick accretionary, colluvial deposit, composed of reworked Pozzolane Rosse scoria and a fine matrix of mixed colluvial Pozzolane Rosse ash and sanidine-bearing fallout ash fromMonti Sabatini. This grades upward into sideromelane ash with sanidine crystals and pedogenic halloysite surface coatings (PS1B in Fig. 5). This layer is partially eroded and a volcaniclastic deposit filling the paleoincision unconformably overlies the Pozzolane Rosse. The volcaniclastic deposit (SP in Fig. 5) is mainly composed of reworked Pozzolane Rosse scoria, aphyric to sanidine-bearing pumice, and sub-angular to sub-rounded lithic lava fragments. SP is stratigraphically and chronologically equivalent to the sedimentary deposit associated with Glacial Termination V, which is represented in this area by the San Paolo Formation (Karner and Marra, 1998).\nAn approximately 50 cm thick layer of brown re-worked, sanidine bearing fine ash (PA in Fig. 5) with abundant mm-sized light colored\npumice and scoria clasts eroded from the underlying Pozzolane Rosse underlies the San Paolo deposit. This ash contains sand-sized sanidine, mudstone clasts and occasional quartz sand. The pumices are aphyric to subaphiric with very tiny clinopyroxene and/or sanidine crystals. Most have sub-rounded contours. The pumice clasts have been extracted from the ash matrix and analyzed for selected trace elements (sample TC05p, Table 5). This pumice-rich ash may represent a sudden influx of fallout material erupted from the Monti Sabatini volcano that was fluvially reworked together with the altered Pozzolane Rosse ash. Based on its stratigraphic position, it predates the aggradation of the San Paolo Formation, which is constrained between 437±8 ka and 407±2 (Karner and Marra, 2003).\nThe location of three samples collected at Tor Carbone in the Pozzolane Rosse, Pozzolane Nere and Pozzolanelle pyroclastic-flow deposits by Sonck-Koota et al.

FAD crops out at the base of the volcanic succession at km 13.2 of Via Tiberina, near several ancient Roman quarries. It is a 2 m thick stratified deposit, with alternating, lapilli-sized white pumice (sample FAD, Table 5), which is concentrated in the lower, 1 m thick portion, and gray scoria within a yellowish ash matrix. One sample of the Lower Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina pyroclastic-flow deposit (sample LTGVT, Table 5) also comes from the same location. This is a fine ash-flow deposit with accretionary lapilli and dispersed white pumice, cropping out between FAD and the Upper Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina.\nAmong the four fallout deposits in the Tufi Terrosi con Pomici Bianche, Fall B is the most dispersed to the SE (Sottili et al., 2004), and it crops out below the Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere along Via Flaminia, between Prima Porta and Grottarossa, and below the Pozzolane Rosse in several localities throughout Rome. One sample comes from Grottarossa (sample FALL B-GR, Table 5), where large quarries of Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere were active in Roman times, and another comes from a distal facies at Via Tiburtina km 9.7, to the northeast of Rome (sample FALL B-VT, Table 5). In addition, one sample of a pumice-rich, distal pyroclastic-flow deposit of Tufo Giallo di Sacrofano (285±2 ka, Karner et al., 2001a) (sample TGS, Table 5) was collected in Via di Santa Agnese, near km 1 of Via Nomentana to the north of Rome. This pyroclastic-flow deposit caps the sedimentary deposits of Aurelia Formation in northern Rome (Marra and Rosa, 1995), andmay represent a possible source of pumice in the city (Penta, 1956). The proximal facies of the Tufo Giallo di Sacrofano is exposed at the top of the volcanic succession cropping out in Riano, near large Roman quarries for Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina (Jackson et al., 2005; Jackson and Marra, 2006). Here we have sampled an older pumice layer (Magliano Romano Plinian fall deposit, 310±5 ka, Sottili et al., 2010; sample MRPF, Table 5) cropping out below the Tufo Giallo di Sacrofano and above Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina. To complete the dataset for the Monti Sabatini major pyroclastic-flow deposits, and to verify the range of compositions recorded for Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina and Tufo Giallo di Prima Porta by Sonck-Koota et al. (2008), we analyzed two samples of the Tufo Giallo di Prima Porta (sample TGPP-pf bulk pyroclastic flow, and sample TGPP-sc selected juvenile scoria clasts, Table 5), one sample of the upper, pumiceous horizon (TGVT-unit c, Karner et al., 2001a) of Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina from near Grottaoscura (sample TGVT-c, Table 5), and one sample of Grottarossa Pyroclastic Sequence-unit b from Grottarossa (sample GRPS-b, Table 5)."

In addition, pumice from a fallout deposit (sample Fall E) that crops out above the Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere pyroclastic flow deposit was sampled in Prima Porta north of Rome. This is the first large fallout deposit of the Tufi Stratificati Varicolori di La Storta (TSVLS) succession and, based on the stratigraphically inferred age, it may correlate with the pumice layers\nwithin the sediments of the San Paolo Formation in Ponte Galeria and in Rome (Fig. 2). Another Monti Sabatini distal fallout layer from the Tenuta di Capannacce quarry (sample TDC 12, Table 3) correlates with a fallout layer (Fall F, Fig. 2) overlying the Fall E within the TSVLS succession, in the southern Monti Sabatini sector."

    "text": "Because several samples show microscopic (e.g. zeolite, clay) and geochemical (e.g. high LOI) evidence of alteration, in the following, we will not use some major and trace elements (e.g. Na, K, Si, Al, Ca, Fe, Rb, Sr) to classify and compare these samples because the concentration of such elements may significantly change during weathering (Floyd and Winchester, 1975; Duzgoren-Aydin et al., 2002). Therefore, classical classification and/or discrimination diagrams (e.g. SiO2 vs. Na2O+K2O; Le Bas et al., 1986) cannot be used for altered and/or contaminated volcanic rocks. Leaching of cations prevails in the early stages of weathering, whereas chemical exchange and adsorption onto clay dominate in the advanced stages. With the aim to compare the analyses of the collected samples we will utilize the ‘immobile’ trace elements Nb, Zr, Ti, Y, Th, Ta, whose concentration is supposed do not significantly vary during water-dominated and/or early diagenetic processes (Floyd and Winchester, 1975)."

In particular, all the thirteen bulk-samples of Pozzolane Rosse (#18–30) have rather consistent Zr/Y between 12 and 10.5 and Nb/Y between 0.7 and 0.85. Remarkably, these ratios cluster tightly together despite the different hydrolyitic and illuviation processes affecting the alteration facies (Fig. 3). However, the two uppermost samples (#18–19) are shifted upwards indicating higher Zr and Nb content, which is not paralleled by a proportional increase in Y (Table 2). A similar displacement occursd in the Th/Ta vs. Nb/Zr diagram of Fig. 6a' for these samples (# 18–19) with respect the lower Pozzolane Rosse section (# 20–30). Fig. 7 illustrates the increases in Zr content that occur at the top of the Pozzolane Rosse and Pozzolane Nere deposits in Castel di Leva, and at a lesser extent at the top of Pozzolane Rosse in Tenuta di Capannacce, where the uppermost, more altered portion of Pozzolane Rosse is probably eroded.\nThe Pozzolane Nere samples in Fig. 6a–a' are characterized by higher Zr/Y and Nb/Y. In contrast towhat observed for the upper portion of the Pozzolane Rosse deposit, where the most altered samples do not show significant compositional variations, the uppermost Pozzolane Nere sample (#09) from the reworked, strongly altered facies plots far away from the field defined by the other five Pozzolane Nere samples (#10–14). Note, however, that the shift of the sample #09 from the other Pozzolane Nere samples is less evident in the Th/Ta vs. Nb/Zr diagram of Fig. 6a'. Indeed, sample #09 hasmuch higher values of Nb/Y, Zr/Y, and lower valuesofNb/Zrwith respect to the lower PozzolaneNere scoria. This indicates an enrichment of Zr probably due to illuviation processes, as discussed in the following sections.\nThe basal fallout deposit of the Villa Senni eruptive sequence at Castel di Leva (sample #02) plots midway between the Pozzolane Rosse and the Pozzolane Nere fields in both diagrams of Fig. 6a–a'. This is consistent with a distinct compositional field for this eruption unit. In comparison, the overlying breccia (sample #01) displays a composition quite similar to that of Pozzolane Nere, consistent with the petrographic observations of abundant inclusions of reworked Pozzolane Nere scoria.\nSamples of the complex colluvial Monti Sabatini ash (#15–17), which includes at its base altered, reworked scoria clast of the underlying pedogenized Pozzolane Rosse, do not show different\ncomposition with respect to Pozzolane Rosse in the Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y diagram (Fig. 6a). Even so, samples #15 and #16 plot in a distinct position in the Th/Ta vs. Nb/Zr diagram (Fig. 6a’), whereas the underlying sample #17 displays ratios quite similar to those of Pozzolane Rosse. This is probably the result of the presence of abundant Pozzolane Rosse scoria inclusions in the lowermost sample\nwith respect to the upper ones. However, this may also reflect a progressive depletion in Th due to hydrolytic leaching, as illustrated below.\nConsistent to the hypothesis of a depletion in Th for the upper, most altered portion of the ashfall deposits, samples #05–03 from the PS2 horizon (Fig. 3) plot lower in the Th/Ta vs. Nb/Zr diagram with\nrespect to samples #06–08 (Fig. 6a'). However, these latter samples are also supposed to contain more inclusions from the overlying Pozzolane Nere deposit, consistent with their position closer to the Pozzolane Nere field in the Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y diagram (Fig. 6a). Indeed, a progressive shift from higher to lower values for both Zr/Y and Nb/Y parallels the increase in height in the statigraphic section for samples\n#08 through #03, with only a small inversion for samples #05 and #06. This suggests that the wide trace element compositional field defined by the samples of this stratigraphic horizon may reflect a change in the composition of the pyroclastic material, as well as a progressively increasing degree of pedogenic alteration, as both are indicated by petrographic observations.\n130 F. Marra et al. / Earth-Science Reviews 108 (2011) 115–136\nFig. 7 shows the Zr and TiO2 variations within the pyroclastic-flow deposits and the interbedded pedogenized ash layers at Castel di Leva and Tenuta di Capannacce sections. These two elements are generally considered an index of uniformity of pre-pedogenic parent material (Ashley and Driese, 2000; Driese et al., 2000). The Zr and TiO2 contents progressively decrease from the lower portion toward the upper, more altered portions of the pedogenized ashfall horizons at Castel di Leva and Tenuta di Capannacce. Such depletion may be due to leaching during pedogenesis of these horizons, and consequent translocation of Zr into the underlying altered upper portion of the pyroclastic-flow deposit, giving enrichment in Zr (and TiO2). This chemical trend and its related weathering processes have been recognized in other volcanic–pedogenetic settings, such as in the Loboi Plain, Kenya (Driese et al., 2004) and at Mt. Meru, Tanzania (Little and Lee, 2009)."

However, also at Tenuta di Capannacce, the samples collected in the upper horizon of the deposit (samples #01–05) show a higher Zr content (Table 3), and plot in the upper Pozzolane Rosse compositional field. The samples collected in the lower intermediate and the least altered facies (#C07, #C11 and #C14 are) plot in the lower area of the Pozzolane Rosse compositional field. One Pozzolane Rosse sample (#C09) shows strongly divergent trace element in both diagrams of Fig. 6b–b'. It comes from the middle horizon of the deposit, so that its geochemical signature is not attributable to a different degree of alteration, and therefore appears to be a clear anomaly.\nTwo samples from the base of the Pozzolane Nere pyroclasticflow deposit (samples #16–17) have Zr/Y, Nb/Y, Th/Ta and Nb/Zr (Fig. 6b–b') that are quite consistent with the Pozzolane Nere samples from Castel di Leva. The sample #12, which comes from the primary Monti Sabatini fallout deposit (DSL of 410±5 ka, Fig. 4; Table 6) shows a geochemical signature different from that of the analyzed Alban Hills samples, with highest Zr/Y and the lowest Nb/Zr. The samples (#06–15) for which petrographic observations confirm a mixture of Monti Sabatini air-fall ash and subordinate, reworked Alban Hills pyroclastic material, plot within a definite area in between the field of the Pozzolane Rosse samples and sample #12. Samples #13 and #14 from the strongly pedogenized layer (PS in Fig. 4) display the lowest Th/Ta (Fig. 6b') with values quite similar to the analogous samples from the PS1 horizon in Castel di Leva section (CDL #15–16 in Fig. 6a'). These data appear to support the hypothesis that hydrolysis and illuviation processes may cause depletion in Th. In contrast, trace element composition of sample #15, which is collected within the paleosoil at the base of the Pozzolane Nere pyroclastic flow deposit, may result from contamination through translocated movement of fine ash from the overlying deposit, as suggested by its shifted position towards the Pozzolane Nere field in both diagrams of Fig. 6b–b'. Fig. 7a shows that also at Tenuta di Capannacce the colluvial aggradational ash deposit overlying the Pozzolane Rosse is characterized by decreasing values of Zr and TiO2 with increasing stratigraphic height, whereas the Pozzolane Rosse pyroclastic-flow deposit displays higher values. As previously discussed for the Castel di Leva section, such depletion of Zr and TiO2 in the ash horizonmay result from illuviation processes, causing translocation and enrichment in the upper, pedogenized portion of the pyroclastic-flow deposit."

The large misfit for the other samples (#01 and #04) seems independent from the weathering degree since it is observed for the facies with greatest alteration (sample #04), as well as for the least alteration facies (sample #01). Moreover, the Zr/Y and Nb/Y values of sample #04 are quite similar to those reported for a Pozzolane Rosse bulk sample in Boari et al. (2009) (Fig. 6c). Possible weathering of this latter sample is not reported. Therefore, the Zr/Y and Nb/Y of Boari et al.'s and TC #04 samples possibly reflects the range of compositional variability of the less altered Pozzolane Rosse eruptive unit (see Fig. 8a). In contrast, similarly to the samples from the pedogenized layers, it is likely that alteration processes affect the Th content of the sample TC #04 and, probably, of the sample TC #03.\nSignificantly, the Zr/Y and Nb/Y values of the PA pumice sample (TC05p; Fig. 6c) are quite similar to those of the other primary fallout deposit (DSL, sample TDC #12) collected at Tenuta di Capannacce (Fig. 6b). In contrast, the Th/Ta of PA altered pumice (Fig. 6c') is quite different from sample TDC #12 (Fig. 6b'), and appears to support the hypothesis that Th andTa should not be considered ‘immobile’ elements when exposed to hydrolytic processes, at least in the Roman area.\nThe Zr, Nb and Y data reported in Sonck-Koota et al. (2008) for Pozzolane Rosse, Pozzolane Nere and Pozzolanelle sampled at the same outcrop in Tor Carbone (Fig. 5), are also plotted in Fig. 6c. Pozzolane Rosse and Pozzolanelle plot within, or close to, the field defined by the correspondent samples from Castel di Leva and Tenuta di Capannacce sections. In contrast, the Zr, Nb and Y values of Pozzolane Nere at Tor Carbone are clearly out of range. Indeed, the Pozzolane Nere sample collected at Tor Carbone by Sonck-Koota et al. (2008) comes from a lithified facies at the base of the deposit, which does not occur in Castel di Leva and in Tenuta di Capannacce. Therefore, it is possible that the argillic alteration process responsible for the lithification of the Pozzolane Nere at Tor Carbone may be responsible for the hydrolytic leaching of Zr and Nb."

    "heading": "5.4. Alban Hills products",
    "text": "The Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y diagram for the Alban Hills rocks is shown in Fig. 8a, where a well-constrained compositional field is defined by the products of the different eruptive phases. Remarkably, this field extends well outside of the area previously attributed to the Latial volcanics, and partially overlaps that of the Campanian magmatic region. However, the reported analyses are on bulk samples, and the Alban Hills field in Fig. 8a cannot be considered representative of differentiation processes of the magmatic system since hydrolithic processes may affect the relative concentration of the ‘immobile’ elements, as evidenced in the previous sections. On the other hand, this diagram may represent an useful tool to discriminate volcanic products of different eruptive units in the area of Rome and/or rocks utilized as aggregate in ancient concretes and mortars. Each of the different eruptive units defines a compositional field only partially overlapping those of the other units (Figs. 8a–b and 9). This is well depicted in the Th/Ta vs. Nb/Zr diagram (Fig. 8b), where the partial overlapping of the different units is limited to the four ‘outlier,’ Pozzolane Rosse samples. Moreover, it is worth noting that, on the basis of the Th/Ta and Nb/Zr values, the Alban Hills products are clearly separated from those of the Campanian region (Fig. 8b). The lava flows of the Faete Phase of activity (LVb, Fig. 8a,b) constitute the less differentiated, end-member in the Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y diagram for Alban Hills (e.g. Monte Mellone lava flow, 308±4 ka, Marra et al., 2003; Gaeta et al., 2006). The lava flows associated to the Pozzolane Rosse eruption cycle, either the Vallerano Lava flow (457±5 ka) as well as the lava flows erupted during the final stages of the eruption cycle, which are considered to span ca. 15 ka after the climactic phase (Marra et al., 2009) (LVa–a', ca. 457–442 ka), define a distinct, more\ndifferentiated field. This suggests that the linear trend observed in the diagram of Fig. 8a reflects a feature of the Alban Hills magmas. Finally, a younger lava flow associated to the final stages of the Pozzolane Nere eruption cycle (LVa\"; ca. 407–399 ka) displays a more differentiated composition with respect to the other lava flows, which is consistent with a possible differentiation trend associated to the coeval Pozzolane Nere pyroclastic flow.\nThe products of the early Tuscolano–Artemisio phase of activity (Tufo Pisolitico di Trigoria, 561±2 ka and Tufo del Palatino, 530± 2 ka, Marra et al., 2009), as well as those of the most recent eruption phase (Peperino Albano, 36±1 ka, Freda et al., 2006), are well aligned on the Alban Hills trend (Fig. 8a). While the first ones display high evolution degree, consistent with an intermediate position in the TAS diagram between Pozzolane Rosse and Pozzolane Nere (Marra et al., 2009), the Peperino Albano plots close to the less evolved compositions, in agreement with petrological data indicating the primitive composition of the magma feeding the pre-eruptive system of the Albano Maar (Freda et al., 2006).\nThe Pozzolane Nere eruption unit (407±2 ka) appears the most differentiated product among those of Alban Hills (Marra et al., 2009). This is consistent with the highest Na2O content of these products, being Na the better marker of differentiation of the Alban Hills magmas (Gaeta et al., 2006). In contrast, the higher SiO2 content yielded by several bulk samples analyzed in this study (~51 wt.%, Tables 2 and 3) is not supported by data reported for the Pozzolane Nere glass in Marra et al. (2009), and it cannot reflect the original magmatic signature. These anomalously high SiO2 contents are the likely consequence of local enrichment due to illuviation and translocation processes, as described in the previous section. Similarly, enrichment in Zr and Nb due to intensive illuviation may contribute to the high Zr/Y and Nb/Y of the Pozzolane Nere samples. When the results for the Pozzolane Nere collected at the Tor Carbone section by Sonck-Koota et al. (2008) are considered (Fig. 8a), the possibility that a very large variability of Zr/Y and Nb/Y depending on the local weathering condition may occur, has to be taken into account.\nThe composition of the Pozzolane Rosse pyroclastic-flow deposit (red dashed line in Fig. 8a) partly overlaps that of the coeval lava flows (LVa–a'). However, most of the Pozzolane Rosse samples plot higher in the Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y diagram, so defining a characteristic field (Fig. 9c) that tends to deviate from the main, Alban Hills compositional trend. The Pozzolane Rosse samples that have higher Zr/Y and a nearly constant (0.7–0.75) Nb/Y values are those collected in the highly alterated facies (see previous paragraph), suggesting a possible effect of weathering in enlarging the compositional field of each eruptive unit. Based on this observation, samples Castel di Leva #18 and 19 have not been included in the Pozzolane Rosse field in Figs. 8b and 9c.\nThe products of the Villa Senni eruption display thewidest range of compositional variability in the diagrams of Fig. 8, largely overlapping the Pozzolane Rosse field. However, when the samples collected in the lithic-rich breccia layer (Freda et al., 1997) are considered, these samples plot within a restricted field (see Figs. 8 and 9). This fact suggests that the larger scattering of the samples from the lower and the upper pyroclastic-flow deposits (Tufo Lionato and Pozzolanelle) may result from the higher degree of alteration of the pyroclastic-flow depositswith respect to the breccia layer. Indeed, these latter contain a larger amount of lava lithic blocks and are matrix-poor, which usually is the fraction of thedepositwhere zeolitization processes concentrate.\nFig. 9 clearly shows that when altered samples are considered in provenance studies, the identification of single pyroclastic units may be problematic, if limited to the geochemical data alone."

There is not evidence of distinct compositional fields allowing the recognition of the different Monti Sabatini products. All the primary, white pumice fallout deposits plot within a quite homogeneous field (A in Fig. 10a) characterized by Zr/Y and Nb/Y values distinctively higher than those of the Alban Hills products. Only one sample (Fall A collected in Isola Farnese, Lancaster et al., in press) displays a Zr/Y and Nb/Y value significantly lower than that of the samples collected inmore proximal locations. Although the LOI (loss on ignition), which may be considered an indicator of the weathering, of the sample of Fall A collected in Isola Farnese (LOI=6.24 wt.%) is not different from that of the other samples of Fall A (Table 5), a major role of the process of zeolitization in decreasing the Zr/Y and Nb/Y values is inferable when the distribution of the samples as a function of the degree of lithification and pedogenization is analyzed (Fig. 11). Indeed, the thoroughly\n133F.

Deposition or redeposition under water, as well as pedogenic processes, are conditions favoring zeolitization. Consistently, all the strongly zeolitized, lithified pyroclastic-flow deposits (Upper Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina, Grottarossa Pyroclastic Sequence unit b, Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere) plot within the field B of Fig. 10a, with the exception of Tufo Giallo di Prima Porta reported in Sonck-Koota et al. (2008). However, two samples of this unit analyzed for this study show different compositions: one bulk sample (TGPP-pf) of the moderately lithified facies (Karner et al., 2001a) plot at the lower margin of field A in Fig. 10a, close to the poorly lithified lower Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina sample, whereas one sample of gray scoria clasts included within the pyroclastic-flow deposit (TGPP-sc) plots within the field B. This suggests that these two pyroclastic-flow deposits are affected by a relatively lower zeolitiza-\ntion degree with respect to the upper TGdVT, GRPS-b and TRaSN pyroclastic-flow deposits, whose strong lithification makes them suitable for production of dimension stones. By contrast, consistent with their intermediate position in the diagram of Fig. 10a, neither Tufo Giallo di Prima Porta and lower Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina were never exploited to produce dimension stones by the Romans builders.\nRemarkably, the basal white pumice fallout deposit of Tufo Giallo di Prima Porta, as well as one sample of the pumice occurring within unit c of the upper Tufo Giallo della Via Tiberina, have Zr/Y and Nb/Y values consistent with those of the other white pumice deposits (Fig. 10a). Also, it is noteworthy that all the gray scoria deposits of Tufi Terrosi con Pomici Bianche, which are characterized by phonotephritic to tephriphonolitic compositions, plot outside of field A and B of Fig. 10a. In fact, these gray scorias have a lower degree of evolution with respect to the white pumices, which are trachytic in composition (Sottili et al., 2004).\nti Sabatini Volcanic District.

Marra et al. / Earth-Science Reviews 108 (2011) 115–136\nThe Monti Sabatini Dark Scoria Layer (DSL) and the samples of the of pedogenized ash intercalated in Tenuta di Capannacce plot within the field B of Figs. 10 and 11, along with the samples collected in the upper, more pedogenized portion of the ash-fall deposit of Castel di Leva. It is important to note that the Tufi Terrosi con Pomici Bianche (ca 507–492 ka) and the Tufi Stratificati Varicolori di La Storta (ca 415–410 ka) emplaced during periods of high stand of the sea level, which reflects warm and humid conditions of the marine isotopic stages (MIS) 13 and 11, respectively (Fig. 12). MIS 13 was characterized by two substages (13.3, 13.1, e,g, Bassinot et al., 1994) spanning the interval 520–480 ka, a time interval overlapping the emplacement time of Fall A (507±4 ka, Karner and Renne, 1998), Fall B (492±14 ka, this work), and Fall C (496±4 ka, Marra et al., 2009). Consistent with their age and the occurrence of a warm and\nFig. 12. Relationships among the Monti Sabatini and the Alban Hills eruptive activity, maj isotopes curve from Bassinot et al. (1994); abbreviations as in the text.\nhumid interstadial, these pumice fallouts are intercalated within a thick succession of incipiently to strongly pedogenized ash (tufi terrosi=earthy tuffs; see Fig. 2). Therefore, the large compositional variability of the Zr/Y and Nb/Y values of Fall A (Fig. 10a) may be due to the different degree of pedogenization that affects the deposit, depending on the local environmental conditions. Similarly, DSL (sample TDC #12 in Fig. 4; 410±5 ka) is intercalated within an incipiently (samples TDC #07–11, Fig. 4) to deeply (samples TDC #13–15) pedogenized ash deposit emplaced during the long-lasting MIS 11, spanning the interval 437–407 ka (Karner and Marra, 2003). In contrast, the pedogenesis of the paleosol PS2 in Castel di Leva (Fig. 3) occurred in the time span 407–366 ka (bracketed by emplacement of Pozzolane Nere and Pozzolanelle), an interval only partially overlapping with warm and humid conditions of the final stages of MIS 11 (Fig. 12). This is consistent with the observation that only the upper portion of this ash deposit (samples CDL #03–06, Fig. 3) underwent deep alteration processes possibly responsible for the depletion in Zr and Nb evidenced in Figs. 6a and 11.\nAll the above considerations suggest that the recognition of the different Monti Sabatini pumice deposits based on their Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y signature may result problematic. Indeed, when a relevant number of analyses for the same unit is considered, as in the case of Fall A, the position in the diagrams seems more dependent on the process of weathering affecting the different deposits at different locations rather than from the original magma composition. In any case, a rather homogeneous composition for different pumice deposits is inferred from data presented in this paper. In particular, eruptive units of different age as FAD (582±2 ka), unit c of lower TGdVT (548± 5 ka), basal fallout of TGPP (415±4 ka), Fall B1 (491±6 ka), Fall E and Ponte Galeria San Paolo Formation pumice (ca. 410 ka), Magliano Romano plinian fallout (310±5 ka) and the Tufo Giallo di Sacrofano (285±2 ka) plot within a very restricted field (A' in Fig. 10a). The combined use of the Th/Ta vs. Nb/Zr diagram is also of apparently little help (Fig. 10b). However, this last diagram seems a very good discriminating tool to differentiate the Monti Sabatini pumices from those of the Campanian region. Moreover, the pumice deposits associated to the younger eruptive cycle at 310 ka (Magliano Romano plinian fallout and Tufo Giallo di Sacrofano) are characterized by Th/ Ta values higher than those of the early, 582–410 ka old eruptive\nor Paleo-Tiber sedimentation phases (yellow bars), and paleoclimatic events.

Finally, the two lithified pyroclastic-flow deposits for which data are available (GRPS-b and TGPP-pf) plot between the products of the younger phase and those of the early phase of activity. More data, either repeated analyses, as well as analyses on selected portions of the deposit (e.g. juvenile scoria, unaltered glass), are necessary in order to better investigate whether the different pyroclastic-flow deposits display distinctive trace element signatures, as well as these should be considered representative of the original magma composition."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "Results of this work show that a characterization of the different eruptive units based on selected trace element signature of their deposit is possible, and represents a useful tool for the identification of even altered volcanic rocks. The Zr/Y–Nb/Y and Th/Ta–Nb/Zr diagrams presented in this paper, handled with the necessary caution, can be used to classify and determine the provenance of several volcanic materials employed in the production of ancient concretes and mortars, and have therefore important application in archaeology. Moreover, this study gives insights on the effects of the weathering processes on the concentration of supposed immobile elements, providing useful information for future geochemical studies. Finally, the presented geochemical dataset fills a gap of knowledge on the products of the Monti Sabatini and Alban Hills volcanic districts, providing a background for the development of the petrological studies on this volcanic region.\nThe data presented in this study suggest that the Alban Hills volcanic products and, in particular, the three Pozzolane Rosse, Pozzolane Nere and Pozzolanelle pozzolana pyroclastic-flow deposits display distinct Zr/Y and Nb/Y values, which mirror the original magma composition and the post-deposition weathering processes. The Monti Sabatini pumice deposits show a distinct geochemical signature from that of the pyroclastic-flow deposits of the Alban Hills. However, the compositional homogeneity of the Monti Sabatini products does not allow the distinction of the different eruptive units. The Monti Sabatini geochemical variability appears as mainly due to weathering processes (pedogenesis and lithification). In particular, a close relationship between age of deeply pedogenized deposits and warm, humid isotopic interstadial periods has been found. Th/Ta and Nb/Zr allow us to discriminate the products of Monti Sabatini and Alban Hills from those of the Campanian volcanoes, and useful discrimination tools are proposed in this study to separate, among the Alban Hills products, the Pozzolane Rosse pyroclastic-flow deposits from those of the Pozzolane Nere, and Villa Senni.\nA distinct position in the Zr/Y vs. Nb/Y plot, coincident to that of the sedimentary reworked pumice deposits and of the strongly pedogenized, distal ashfall deposits, characterizes the strongly lithified Monti Sabatini pyroclastic-flow deposits, so suggesting the major role played by zeolitizzation processes on the depletion of supposed ‘immobile elements’ (Zr and Nb).\nIn general, the trace element signature of the studied volcanic units shows a relatively large variability with respect to the original Zr/Y and Nb/Y of the magma. Such variability is likely due to different type and degree of alteration, depending on the environmental conditions.\nTwo possible, opposite, effects of weathering on the relative abundances of Zr, Nb and Y are recognized:\na) intense hydrolytic leaching and lithification processes characterized by the formation of zeolites (mainly chabazite and phillipsite) cause a depletion of Zr and Nb in the volcanic rock; b) illuviation processes associated to pedogenesis may cause the transolcation of Zr and Nb from the soil horizon into the underlying pyroclastic-flow deposit, with formation of halloysite\ncoatings. This translocation increases the Zr and Nb content in the upper portion of the tephra layer(s).\nTherefore, even if trace element ratios allow us to discriminate most of the studied products, the effects of the hydrolytic leaching and illuviation processes should be taken into account in the archaeological stratigraphic, and geochemical investigations aimed to find the source areas of the mortars of ancient Rome."
