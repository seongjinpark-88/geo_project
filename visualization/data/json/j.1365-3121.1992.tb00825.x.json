  "abstractText": "New C02?He data from the East Sunda Arc (Indonesia) confirm earlier observations that arc volcanic gases have higher C02/3He ratios than MOR environments. On average, > 80% of arc volcanic C02 is recycled, exogene carbon. Addition of a few percent of carbonatebearing sediments to the mantle wedge explains much of the carbon abundance and carbon isotopic data of arc gases, but can not explain the He isotope observations. The C02j3He in arc volcanoes is not strongly dependent on the composition of modem trough sediments (e.g. deep sea clays vs carbonate-rich sequences), and a l a t e veins in the hydrothermally altered subducted slab may provide a contribution to the recycled carbon flux of, arcs. The sum of globally deep-subducted sediment and slab carbon exceeds the estimated arc C02 flux, and approximately 3.5 teramole of carbon may return annually to the mantle in convergent zones. The modem combined processes of MOR volcanism, slab alteration, and subduction volcanism do not produce a substantial carbon flux into the exosphere, and rate-changes in ocean floor spreading are unlikely to cause major changes in atmospheric C02 as a result of changes in the volcanic C02 fluxes. Intense pulses of flood basalt volcanism, however, may alter the C02 contents of the atmosphere over the course of a millenium or so, and influence global climate. Terra Nova, 4,363-373, 1992.
