    "text": "The Huqf Supergroup of the Sultanate of Oman provides important information on the geological evolution of the Arabian– Persian Gulf region during a protracted period of continental dispersal and reassembly on the periphery of the Gondwanan supercontinent during the Neoproterozoic, and also provides important constraints on the nature of extreme climate swings during this critical period in the evolution of Earth's biosphere. The Huqf Supergroup spans the period ca. 725–540 Ma, and is composed of three groups. The Abu Mahara Group (ca. 725 to b645 Ma) hosts two glacial successions separated by an interval of nonglacial, deep to shallow marine sedimentary rocks. The base of the overlying Nafun Group (ca.b645–547 Ma) is marked by a transgressive post-glacial carbonate, which initiates an overstepping of basement-cored structural highs and the deposition of an extensive blanket of carbonate and siliciclastic stratigraphy. The Ara Group (ca. 547–540 Ma), which is known mostly from the subsurface, comprises carbonates, evaporites and organic-rich shales, with interbedded ashes, deposited in a large number of N–S trending troughs and platforms.\nThe three groups of the Huqf Supergroup correspond to three phases of basin development. The Abu Mahara Group was deposited on an eroded crystalline and metasedimentary basement. An early stage of basin formation preserved b1.5 km of marginal to deeper marine sedimentary rocks, including an older Cryogenian glacial succession infilling erosional palaeovalleys. Renewed tectonic subsidence associated with submarine volcanism allowed the preservation of a N1 km-thick, cyclical, rift basinfill of glacial and non-glacial sedimentary rocks representing a younger Cryogenian icehouse epoch. Progressively older source areas were exhumed during the interval ca. 725 to b645 Ma, with unroofed 800+ Ma granitoid plutons providing the bulk of sediment, supplemented by syn-extension volcanics, and eventually by distant Meso- and Palaeoproterozoic sources.\nThe wide extent of the Nafun Group, basin-wide correlation of major lithostratigraphic units, and its modest thickness (∼1 km) suggest a period of thermal contraction following Abu Mahara rifting. The Oman area was probably a region of slightly stretched continental lithosphere (which passed to the NE into a passive continental margin), occupied by a continental margin rim basin during deposition of the Nafun Group. The Nafun Group bears little resemblance to the coeval small basin-fills choked with calcalkaline volcanic detritus in the Arabian Shield, but the correlation of the Nafun Group with the Jibalah Group indicates that the contiguous continental rim basin extended from Oman across the tectonically deformed eastern fringe of the Arabian–Nubian Shield. Inundation of the Arabian Shield area and incorporation within the Nafun basin was probably facilitated by extensional collapse and tectonic escape. Sources for 600–640 Ma zircons, found in the Nafun Group, can readily be identified in the Arabian– Nubian Shield.\nRenewed volcanism, compartmentalization of the basin by N–S trending structural highs and troughs, and an increase in sediment accumulation rates, typifies the Ara Group. The Ara Group deposits formed part of an extensive, latitudinal evaporite belt, with a depocentre translated outwards relative to the Nafun basin, suggesting continuing tectonic progradation of the eastern margin of the Arabian–Nubian Shield. Subduction of ocean floor along the former passive continental margin along the periphery\nE-mail address: philip.allen@imperial.ac.uk.\n0012-8252/$ - see front matter © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Coeval calc-alkaline plutons and rhyolitic to andesitic volcanics are found in the Central Iranian Terrane.\nNeoproterozoic glaciations are recorded in the rift and passive margin stratigraphy predating the final amalgamation of continental fragments into greater Gondwana. In Oman, glaciation was contemporaneous with the development of an Andean-type orogen in the Arabian–Nubian Shield while passive margin basins continued to subside in northern Iran, India and South China. The elevated topography associated with the Andean-type orogen together with passive margin mega-escarpments may have promoted nucleation of ice caps that sourced marine-terminating valley glaciers and ice streams. However, the triggering of Cryogenian glaciation must ultimately be related to the biogeochemical cycles operating on a planet with a nascent land biota, lack of calcifying plankton and reduced solar luminosity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The Sultanate of Oman contains relatively small but exquisite outcrops of Neoproterozoic rocks that provide critical information for the evaluation of palaeogeography and palaeoenvironments, and for the testing of ideas on the forcing mechanisms for extreme climate change in deep time. In addition, information from surface outcrop studies can be supplemented by an extensive database from well penetrations and geophysical surveys throughout the buried salt basins of the Oman interior. The combination of detailed sedimentological studies of outcrops and subsurface data generated by Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), backed up by an improving geochronological and chemostratigraphic database, makes the OmanNeoproterozoic an important piece in the global Neoproterozoic jigsaw. However, throughout the history of subsurface exploration and geological mapping in Oman, the basin evolution and controlling geodynamics for the Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian interval has remained speculative. There are a number of possible reasons for this: (1) seismic quality beneath the salt of the latest Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Ara Group is poor; (2) deep well penetrations were disappointing, and core recovery was meagre; (3) the geochronological dating of the succession was until recently poorly constrained. The development of carbonate ‘stringer’ plays associated with Ara Group salt basins has renewed commercial interest in the Precambrian of Oman. A number of in-house PDO reports incorporating new seismic interpretations and core descriptions, University-led field studies and consideration of analogous deposits worldwide now provides a much-improved sedimentological, stratigraphic, geochronological and tectonic database allowing a re-evaluation of the Neoproterozoic evolution of Oman and surrounding area in terms of regional tectonics and basin development."

    "text": "The evolution of the Oman area needs to be placed in the wider context of the break-up of Rodinia, the opening and closing of the Mozambique Ocean, the accretionary events that led to the formation of the Gondwanan super-assembly, and the subsequent evolution of its collisional belts and forelands. Neoproterozoic rocks (Fig. 1) are found within and along the periphery of a number of megasutures that stitch together the supercontinent of Gondwana. The megasutures represent the deformed igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary products of orogenesis as successive continental fragments joined the core of western Gondwana in the ca. 100 Myr preceding the Cambrian. The reconstruction of Gondwana at the end of the Neoproterozoic shown in Fig. 1 illustrates two major megasutures: one marking the coalescence of South America and West Africa with the remainder of Africa (northern African, Congo and Kalahari cratons), and the other marking the coalescence of India, east Antarctica and Oman–Iran–Afghanistan with Africa. These two great megasutures are linked by the Damaran–Zambezi megasuture that wraps around the northern margin of the Kalahari craton. It is immediately clear that a great many Neoproterozoic basins are implicated in the rifting, drifting, oceanic closure and subduction/collision events associated with these major megasutures.\nThe plate tectonic reconstruction generally accepted for the end of Neoproterozoic time (543Ma) (Fig. 1, based on de Wit et al., 1988; Powell et al., 1994; Unrug, 1997; Dalziel, 1997; Meert and van der Voo, 1997; PLATES Project, 1999; Kusky et al., 2003) shows Oman joined to the Arabian–Nubian Shield, India–Madagascar joined to the East African Orogen, and Australia–Antarctica joined to the southern extension of theMozambique Belt, to form one large Gondwanan assembly, with its outer margin marked either by the subduction of oceanic lithosphere\n141P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\n(Kusky et al., 2003; Ramezani and Tucker, 2003) or by a trailing edge passive margin (Jiang et al., 2003a). The Malagasy andKuunga orogenies (ca. 530Ma) are thought to represent the latest accretion events when Azania (a terrane now comprising northeastern Africa, Fig. 1) (Collins and Windley, 2002; Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005) and Antarctica–Australia joined the supercontinent (Meert and van der Voo, 1996), synchronous with the Delamerian Orogeny of Australia (Powell et al., 1994). However, the timing of the accretion of Oman into the Arabian–Nubian Shield has remained problematical, since few reliable palaeomagnetic data are available for Oman over the time interval 750–540Ma. In addition, the location of the suture along which the Omani crust was\njoined to the Arabian–Nubian Shield has never been documented, leading Windley et al. (1996, p.131) to ask “what lies to the east of the Arabian Shield”? Two endmember possibilities are shown in Fig. 1. TheOmani crust may be sutured along a line running just to the east of the easternmost of the Arabian terranes (Fig. 2). Alternatively, the tectonic join may be represented by a zone of deformation defining the western edge of the South Oman Salt Basin (Fig. 3).\nKilner et al. (2005) reported palaeomagnetic data that passed fold and reversal tests from Oman, which gave the Muscat region a palaeolatitude of 13° in the late Neoproterozoic. They recognized a remnant magnetization that was acquired between deposition and a period\n142 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nof deformation in the Cambrian–Ordovician (Blendinger et al., 1990; Gass et al., 1990), and argued (p. 415) that the magnetization was acquired at deposition since a similar pattern of reversals occurs at the same stratigraphic level in widely separated locations in the north, centre and south of Oman (Fig. 3). Subsequent work, however, points strongly to different ages for these stratigraphic sections (Allen and Leather, 2006; Rieu et al., 2006, 2007a) (see below). The difference between the Oman palaeopoles and those of Gondwanan terranes (Meert, 2003) suggested to Kilner et al. (2005) that Oman did not accrete with the ‘African’ terranes comprising greater Gondwana until after ca. 600 Ma — the approximate age of the youngest stratigraphy sampled\nfor palaeomagnetism. Kempf et al. (2000) recovered a Precambrian pole position from the south of Oman (implying a palaeolatitude of 9°) but noted a similarity with published poles from Gondwana (Congo, India, Australia) at ca. 550 Ma, which was thought to be the depositional age. The rocks in south Oman providing the low palaeolatitude are ca. 700 Ma in age, not 550 Ma (Rieu et al., 2006, 2007a), which suggests that either the south of Oman was in low palaeolatitudes at ca. 700 Ma and experienced similar palaeolatitudes at 550Ma, or that the magnetization was acquired during a later event close to 550 Ma, when Oman and the adjacent parts of Gondwanawere indeed situated in the tropics on the basis of their common evaporitic sedimentary facies, as\n143 P.A .

Geological evidence cited in this paper indicates an earlier accretion of Oman into themegasuture forming the eastern border (in present-day coordinates) of Gondwana. Currently, the palaeomagnetic data described by Kempf et al. (2000) and Kilner et al. (2005) have not yet been accounted for with a coherent explanation that incorporates the full range of geological observations.\nThe nature of the periphery of greater Gondwana at the dawn of the Phanerozoic is unclear. Arc magmatism, with peri-Gondwanan plutons located in Central Iran, Himalayas, Tibet and Turkey (Kusky et al., 2003; Ramezani and Tucker, 2003), is thought to have accompanied the subduction of a proto-Tethys oceanic plate around the north to northeast (in present-day coordinates) margin of the supercontinent. U–Pb ages of volcanics, gneisses and garnet–amphibolites from Central Iran, for example, indicate subduction-related magmatism between 548 and 526 Ma (Ramezani and Tucker, 2003). Consequently, in this scenario, by the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary (543Ma), we haveOman locked in a position between the Arabian–Nubian Shield, against which it was sutured, and a subducting ocean plate with an associatedmagmatic arc. Alternatively, the outer margin of Gondwana may have passed via stretched continental lithosphere into the proto-Tethys Ocean, with no magmatic arc and subduction zone. The wide distribution of salt basins across the Arabian, Persian Gulf and Iranian regions in the Early Cambrian (Zharkov, 1984; Edgell, 1991), stretched out along a palaeolatitude of approximately 30°S (Fig. 2), therefore either reflects (i) aridity in the rainshadow of a peri-Gondwanan arc or remnant topography of the East African orogen, with connection to the ocean through a corridor in the north of the Arabian plate, or (ii) a broad zone of evaporite deposition in an epicontinental to passive margin setting. The major questions in the geological history of the region therefore concern the age of accretion of outlying east Gondwanan terranes into the Arabian–Nubian Shield and the Mozambique Belt, presumably by closure of the once extensiveMozambique Ocean. To what extent is the geological history of Oman separate from that of the Arabian–Nubian Shield? And what does the plate tectonic and basin evolution of Oman imply for the occurrence of Neoproterozoic glaciation?\nIn this paper, I survey the regional geology of the eastern margin of Gondwana over the time period from major crustal growth at N820 Ma, to the widespread development of salt basins in the earliest Cambrian. I summarize aspects of the geological history of two groups of terranes that underwent contrasting histories in the period ca. 825–540 Ma: (i) the terranes that became accreted to the East African Orogen at an early stage along a long-term convergent boundary, and\n(ii) the terranes that spent a considerable part of their Neoproterozoic history in a subduction-related, then rift and drift phase following the break-up of Rodinia, and which accreted to the Gondwanan super-assembly at a later stage. These outlying blocks are sometimes referred to as Eastern Gondwana (McWilliams, 1981), though the constituent plates may have acted independently until final amalgamation into greater Gondwana (Meert et al., 1995; Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005). The Huqf Supergroup of Oman is placed in this geotectonic framework, and the implications for the occurrence of climatic extremes are examined."

    "heading": "2. The Huqf Supergroup of Oman and its basement",
    "text": "The Huqf Supergroup of Oman crops out in northern Oman (Jabal Akhdar), east-central Oman (Huqf area) and southern Oman (Mirbat area of Dhofar) and is penetrated by many boreholes in the salt basins of the Oman interior (Fig. 3). A large amount of work on the subsurface, mostly carried out or sponsored by Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), and field studies by university groups on surface outcrops, partly funded by PDO, has been carried out over the last decade. It is now recognized that the Huqf Supergroup provides key information on basin development, climate change and evolution of the biosphere over the Neoproterozoic era.\nPrecambrian sedimentary rocks have been known in Oman since early surveys of the Dhofar area of southern Oman (Carter, 1852; Lees, 1928), when the Mirbat Sandstone was recognized. Iraq Petroleum Company geologists proposed a four-fold division of the sedimentary rocks in the Huqf area, adopted by Henson and Elliot (1958), Morton (1959) and Beydoun (1960, 1964), who recognized the succession to be composed of First and Second Clastic Groups and First and Second Dolomite Groups. Glennie (1977) was first to refer to the Huqf Group. Gorin et al. (1982) labelled the siliciclastic–dolomite alternations the Abu Mahara, Khufai, Shuram and Buah Formations. In the Jabal Akhdar of northern Oman, Kapp and Llewellyn (1965) defined the Mistal, Hajir, Mu'aidin and Kharus Formations, which were correlated with the Huqf succession of east-central Oman by Tschopp (1967). Glennie et al. (1974), Kapp and Llewellyn (1965) and geologists of the Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (Beurrier et al., 1986; Rabu et al., 1986) recognized and mapped the Mistal Formation (syn. Mistal Conglomerate Formation) as the oldest exposed Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in the Jabal Akhdar. Rabu et al. (1986) divided the Mistal Formation into four members, in ascending order, the Ghubrah, Saqla, Fiq and Amq\n145P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nMembers. In an attempt to streamline stratigraphic nomenclature across the surface outcrops and subsurface well penetrations of the salt basins, PDO geoscientists (PDO internal reports, Loosveld et al., 1996) redefined the Abu Mahara Group as comprising a lower diacmictite-rich Ghadir Manqil Formation and an upper Masirah Bay Formation, and raised the status of the succession to Huqf Supergroup, comprising Abu Mahara, Nafun and Ara Groups (Glennie et al., 1974; Gorin et al., 1982; Hughes-Clark, 1988; Wright et al.,\n1990). McCarron (2000) referred to the distinctive carbonate capping the diamictites of the Fiq Member as the Hadash Formation, based on the name of the village close to its type locality above Wadi Mistal in the Jabal Akhdar. When the basin evolution of the Huqf Supergroup was better appreciated, the term Abu Mahara Group was restricted to the stratigraphy below the transgressive Hadash Formation carbonate (Leather et al., 2002; Allen et al., 2004; Allen and Leather, 2006), and the Masirah Bay Formation assigned to the Nafun\nnd Mirbat (Dhofar) areas. Current usage is shown in stipple.\n146 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nGroup. The two ‘grand cycles’ of the Nafun Group (Allen and Leather, 2006) are currently referred to as Nafun I and Nafun II. This varied use of nomenclature has undoubtedly led to confusion. Fig. 4 is the key to different usages."

    "heading": "2.1. Basement in Oman and neighboring regions",
    "text": "The non-sedimentary basement beneath the Huqf Supergroup is poorly exposed in Oman. No basement rocks are found in the Jabal Akhdar. Crystalline basement is exposed in south Oman in the Mirbat region (Platel et al., 1992a) and on the Al Hallaniyah Islands (Platel et al., 1992b), and in small outcrops in the\nnorth of the Huqf area of east-central Oman (at Al Jobah, Allen and Leather, 2006) and near Sur in the Jabal Ja'alan (Roger et al., 1992) further to the north (Fig. 3). Most knowledge on the pre-Huqf Supergroup geological history of Oman is derived from the Mirbat area (Figs. 5, 6), recently summarized by Mercolli et al. (2006). Four major units are recognized: (1) the Juffa Group is composed of metasedimentary mica-gneisses and amphibolites with a N1300 Ma (Mesoproterozoic) siliciclastic sedimentary protolith; (2) the Sadh Group comprises highly deformed and metamorphosed banded gneisses intruded by slightly deformed diorites and tonalities (Mahall Complex); (3) The Tonalite Group is composed of three large calc-alkaline plutons dated\nwith tholeiitic dyke swarm orientation fromWorthing (2005). Location\n147P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\n780–800 Ma; (4) the Granite Group comprises different types of dykes and small intrusive bodies including the Pegmatite Complex (770–750 Ma), and the Mirbat Granodiorite, Leger Granite and Shaat Dyke Swarm (750–?700 Ma).\nIn the Mirbat area, a phase of accretion of juvenile Neoproterozoic crust (N900 Ma) was followed by extensive calc-alkaline magmatism, amphibolite facies metamorphism and intense deformation culminating at ca. 800 Ma. Worthing (2005) believed the NW–SE orientated calc-alkaline Shaat Dyke Swarm to originate from subduction-modified lithospheric mantle, mobilized by crustal extension. The dykes appear to be similar in orientation and geochemistry to a dyke swarm (ca. 700Ma) in the Al Bayda island-arc terrane of Yemen described below (Windley et al., 1996). Late stocks such as the Mirbat Granodiorite (and most likely the Leger Granite) (Fig. 5) must have been exhumed by the time of deposition of the oldest sedimentary rocks of the Mirbat Group (Kellerhals and Matter, 2003; Rieu et al., 2006, 2007a). Worthing (2005) suggests a second phase of dyke injection at ca. 600Ma recorded on theAl Hallaniyat Islands, coeval with a younger set of Al Bayda dykes in Yemen.\nThe closest basement outcrops to Mirbat are the gneissic and island arc terranes of Yemen (Figs. 3A, 7) (Windley et al., 1996;Whitehouse et al., 1998), which can be traced southwards into Somalia (Whitehouse et al., 2001). The gneiss terranes (Abas, Al-Mahfid), which are dominated by late Archaean to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses with belts of supracrustal rocks, are intercalated with island arc terranes: (i) the Al-Bayda terrane mentioned above, comprising greenschist grade metavolcanics, ophiolites, intrusive post-tectonic granitic plutons and undeformed basaltic andesite and rhyolite dykes along its eastern terrane boundary (Ba-Bttat, 1991), and (ii) in the east, the Al-Mukalla terrane, which contains unmetamorphosed or low-grade sedimentary rocks (siliciclastics and limestones of the Ghabar Group (Beydoun, 1966), intruded by late granites (K–Ar date of 562 Ma, Greenwood and Bleakley, 1967).\nAlong the western edge of the Al Bayda terrane, BaBttat (1991) described dyke swarms (Mukeras dyke swarms) with an earlier NE–SW set (709±21 Ma K/Ar, 694±21 Ma Ar/Ar), and a minor later swarm (E–W to NW–SE, 587±18 Ma). Near its eastern terrane boundary, the Al Bayda terrane contains a NW-trending dyke\n148 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nswarm dated 693±12 Ma (Ar/Ar), and a minor E–W dyke swarm dated 585±11 Ma (Windley et al., 1996). K–Ar and 40Ar–39Ar dating methods reveal an E–W trending rhyolite dyke to be 614±11 Ma, whereas the host granite for the dyke swarm is 740±22 Ma (Whitehouse et al., 1998). The age of the host granite overlaps with U–Pb dates for granitoids in neighboring gneiss terranes. A ca. 760 Ma Neoproterozoic event is recognized throughout the Yemeni terranes, including the crystallization age of young granitoid sheets in the AlMahfid terrane. The magmatism at ca. 760 Ma, combined with the age of undeformed, post-accretion Al Bayda dykes and their host granite, suggest that the terranes were most likely assembled in the period 760– 720 Ma. After collisional assembly, crustal extension allowed the injection of a dyke swarm in the period ca. 715–615 Ma. The consistent pattern in the basement geology of Mirbat and Yemen is orthogneisses intruded by calc-alkaline plutons (820–760 Ma), cut by later (b715 Ma) dyke swarms intruded under different (extensional) regional tectonics. The dykes at Mirbat do not cut the unconformably overlying sedimentary Mirbat Group (Section 2.2), as recognized by Qidwai et al. (1988), so the Mirbat Group sedimentary rocks must be younger than the 696–744 Ma age of the dykes\nderived from Sm–Nd and Rb/Sr dating (Worthing, 2005). There is no evidence that theMirbat crust evolved separately or independently to the Yemen and Saudi terranes in the period up to ca. 700 Ma."

    "heading": "2.2. The Abu Mahara Group",
    "text": "Neoproterozoic glacial deposits are found in the Abu Mahara Group (Figs. 8–10). The Abu Mahara Group is found principally in the Jabal Akhdar of the Oman Mountains (Fig. 8a), occupying the core of a major E–W oriented anticline. Partly coeval rocks are found in Dhofar (southern Oman), where they are preserved in a small outcrop belt above metamorphic basement and below a sub-Cretaceous unconformity (Figs. 5, 8b, 9). In contrast, the Abu Mahara Group is absent from the Huqf area of east-central Oman (Figs. 8c, 9). The Group has been penetrated by a limited number of boreholes in the salt basins of Oman, and has been imaged on seismic reflection profiles, which show it to be confined to large N–S oriented basins that have been interpreted as rifts (Loosveld et al., 1996). This rift interpretation is supported by sedimentological and stratigraphic evidence derived from field studies. In the Jabal Akhdar, the sedimentology of the glacigenic Fiq\n149P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nFormation indicates sediment derivation from two opposing margins (Leather et al., 2002; Allen et al., 2004). The intervening basin has the same scale and orientation as the structurally confined basins imaged on seismic. In addition, there is a very clear overstep of basement-cored margins at the stratigraphic level of the Hadash Formation– the cap carbonate of the Fiq glacials– which marks the change from structurally confined Fiq sedimentation to the unconfined, extensive sedimentation of the Nafun Group (Allen et al., 2004) (Fig. 11). Such a stratigraphic geometry is typical of the transition from\nfault-controlled to thermal subsidence on a piece of stretched continental lithosphere (Allen and Allen, 2005). However, basement palaeotopography, presumably influenced by the underlying tectonic fabric, strongly influenced sedimentation patterns, thicknesses and progradation patterns during deposition of the overlying Nafun Group (see below, Fig. 11) (Cozzi et al., 2004a,b; Cozzi and Al Siyabi, 2004; Allen and Leather, 2006) and, most likely, during deposition of the Ara Group.\nThe phase of sedimentation responsible for the Fiq Formation was preceded by a period of extrusive\n150 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nbasaltic volcanism, represented by the Saqlah Member) (Rabu et al., 1993; Le Guerroué et al., 2005). Although the Saqlah volcanics and volcaniclastics and the Fiq glacigenic and non-glacial sedimentary rocks can be attributed to a continental rift basin, the stratigraphy below the Saqlah Member is far less well constrained. This is partly because less attention has been paid to these rocks, partly that outcrops are more sporadic, and partly because pre-Saqlah/Fiq stratigraphy in the Jabal Akhdar region has been affected by an intense deformation. In the Mirbat area of southern Oman, however, relatively undeformed AbuMahara-equivalent rocks occur above an irregular crystalline basement incised by deep palaeovalleys (Figs. 8b, 9, 10) (Kellerhals and Matter, 2003; Rieu et al., 2006). The Mirbat succession is therefore critical to understanding the geological history of Oman before the deposition of the Fiq Formation.\nThe Nafun Group extends far beyond the confines of the Abu Mahara basins, with the transgressive, 13C-depleted Hadash carbonate at its base (Fig. 10). The cap carbonate oversteps basement-coredAbuMahara basin margins, as seen in the Huqf area, where the\ncarbonate rests via an unconformity lined with silcrete upon felsic ignimbrites and tuffs dated 802 Ma and granitic basement dated 822 and 825 Ma (Allen and Leather, 2006). Over basement highs, therefore, the unconformity beneath the Nafun Group stretches from ca. 800 Ma to the onset of deposition of the Nafun Group, whereas in the Abu Mahara basins, the stratigraphic succession is more complete and locally (as at Mirbat) apparently conformable (Fig. 8)."

    "text": "The ca. 1 km-thick Nafun Group consists of two siliciclastic to carbonate couplets, which are reminiscent of the ‘grand cycles’ of Aitken (1966). The marine shales, siltstones and wave-tidal sandstones of the Masirah Bay Formation (Allen and Leather, 2006) pass gradationally upwards into the progradational carbonate ramp of the Khufai Formation (Wright et al., 1990; McCarron, 2000). The second couplet consists of the shales, siltstones, very fine sandstones and thin carbonates of the Shuram Formation (Le Guerroué et al., 2006a,b,c), which pass gradationally\n151 P.A .

Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nupwards into the progradational carbonate ramp of the Buah Formation (Cozzi et al., 2004a,b). Although there are no radiometric dates from the Nafun Group that directly constrain depositional ages, Le Guerroué et al. (2006b) interpolated the approximate ages of formation boundaries using two tie points: (i) the age of the overlying Ara Group (see below), and (ii) the presumed age of the underlying glacigenic Fiq Formation and Hadash cap carbonate as 635 Ma, assuming that the Fiq glaciation ends at the same time as equivalents in South China (Condon et al., 2005) and Namibia (Hoffmann et al., 2004), and that there are no major stratigraphic gaps in the Nafun succession. By fitting a curve for the thermal subsidence following stretching of the lithosphere, and by incorporating palaeobathymetric changes and decompaction (Allen and Allen, 2005), Le Guerroué et al. (2006b) proposed that the first ‘grand cycle’ extended from 635Ma to 601±8 Ma, and the second from 601±8 Ma to 542Ma, and that stretch factors varied from ca. 1.2 to 1.8. The major negative excursion in δ13C that characterizes the second ‘grand cycle’ can now be attributed an age range of ca. 600–550 Ma, which is potentially of use in global correlation. Other workers (Condon et al., 2005; Fike et al., 2006) prefer to place a stratigraphic gap at the boundary between the two grand cycles of the Nafun Group, that is, between Nafun I and Nafun II.\nIn regional seismic lines across the salt basins of Oman (PDO), the Nafun Group appears as an extensive sheet above the structurally confined Abu Mahara Group. The supra-regional extent of the Nafun Group is more difficult to assess, since geochronological control is lacking and lithostratigraphic correlation is therefore prone to error (as in early correlations across the Arabian–Persian Gulf area by Edgell (1991) and Husseini (1988), who erroneously correlated the Nafun Group of Oman with the Hormuz Series of Iran). Nevertheless, the stratigraphy in the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran (located in Fig. 2) shows similar large-scale siliciclastic to carbonate couplets to those that typify the Nafun Group of northern Oman (Stöcklin et al., 1964, 1965; Ruttner et al., 1968; Wolfart, 1981; Kimura et al., 1997), and salt domes in the Persian Gulf area have erupted blocks of stromatolitic limestone that have been likened to the Khufai Formation (NafunGroup I) ofOman (Kent, 1970; Edgell, 1991). The Nafun Group also bears strong lithological and chemostratigraphic similarities with the carbonate-dominated Bilara Group, Marwar Supergroup of west Rajasthan (India), including the presence of two major excursions in carbon isotopic ratios (Pandit et al., 2001; Cozzi and Rea, 2006). It is therefore reasonable to infer that the Nafun Group extended far beyond its present distribution in Oman towards the north and east, but the possible\nextension of the Nafun Group to the west remains speculative. Nicholson and Janjou (2003) suggest correlatives in the Jibalah Group of the Arabian Shield (see Section 3.1), which is in part younger than 600 Ma based on U–Pb dating of detrital zircons, and is assigned an age of ?580–560 Ma by Johnson (2006). If this connection between the Nafun Group of Oman and the Jibalah Group of northern Arabia holds, it implies that the Nafun basin extended far to the west and northwest of Oman, unconformably covering the accreted island arc terranes of the Arabian–Nubian Shield, and showing that the Arabian–Nubian Shield and Oman occupied the same piece of continental crust during the Ediacaran period (635–543 Ma)."

    "text": "Whereas the Nafun Group appears to be an extensive sheet of post-rift stratigraphy, albeit with facies changes influenced by underlying basement structure (Fig. 11), the overlying Ara Group marks a major change in basin mechanics. In the Jabal Akhdar, the Buah Formation is overlain by the Fara Formation (Rabu, 1988), comprising pelagic resedimented carbonates, cherts, finegrained turbidites and volcaniclastics, such as welded ignimbrites (Fig. 8a). The change from the Buah Formation of the uppermost Nafun Group to the Fara Formation of the Ara Group therefore represents a significant basin deepening. One Fara ignimbrite has yielded a U–Pb age of 544.5±3.3 Ma (Brasier et al., 2000), and more recent dates (Bowring et al., in press) (see Section 4.1) confirm that the Fara Formation is Early Cambrian in age. However, the Ara Group is better constrained from subsurface penetrations. Interbedded ashes have yielded dates of 542.6±0.3 Ma and 542±0.6 Ma from within the middle Ara Group (Amthor et al., 2003), below which the small shelly fossils Namacalathus and Cloudina become extinct. Seismic reflection surveys and borehole penetrations show that the Ara Group is characterized by basins showing major facies changes between elevated shoulders focussing carbonate production, and deep troughs in which salts and black shales accumulated (Amthor et al., 2003; Schröder et al., 2003). A Bouguer anomaly map of Eastern Arabia suggests that the basement structure is dominated by N- to NNE-trending highs and lows with a wavelength of 50–100 km. This pattern of basins and basement uplifts may represent structure produced during the Ara Group phase of structural compartmentalization, with salts concentrated in topographic lows between N-trending structural highs (similar trending structures on the Saharan margin of the\n154 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nArabian–Nubian Shield have been related to post550 Ma extensional collapse (Abdelsalam et al., 2003)). If so, it demonstrates that the entire area from the Ma'Aqala Axis southeastwards via the Qatar Arch to the eastern coast of Oman acted as one tectonic province. This is strongly supported by the distribution of Ara-Hormuz salt (Figs. 2, 3) (Kent, 1979; Gorin et al., 1982; Zharkov, 1984; Edgell, 1991; Bahroudi and Koyi, 2003), which stretches discontinuously from the Persian Gulf and Zagros to the Punjab of northern India. Stöcklin (1968) suggested that the northeastern edge of the salt basin was fixed by an ancestral Main Zagros Reverse Fault, since salt is conspicuously absent in the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran yet present in the Derenjal Mountains and Kernan areas of central Iran (Huckriede et al., 1962; Ruttner et al., 1968; Wolfart, 1981), which implies that the continental margin at the time of evaporite deposition lay yet farther to the north or northeast. The extensive region of evaporite deposition runs along a palaeolatitudinal zone that palaeomagnetic reconstructions indicate was subtropical (between the equator and ca. 30°S) (Dalziel, 1997). One can be certain that at this stage (ca. 540 Ma) the various small continental fragments from Iran to India had been neatly assembled on the edge of the vast Gondwanan supercontinent.\nThe Ara Group is unconformably overlain (via the socalled Angudan unconformity, 530 Ma, Loosveld et al., 1996) by a regional sheet of Cambrian–Silurian sedimentary rocks known as the Haima Supergroup (Millson et al., 1996; Molyneux et al., 2006). The Haima represents the peneplanation of the Arabian plate, the formation of extensive intracratonic basins (‘interior sags’) and the Early Palaeozoic evolution of the northern (in present-day coordinates) continental margin of Gondwana. Along the western edge of the South Oman Salt Basin, thrust structures of the Western Deformation Front (Fig. 3) repeat the Huqf Supergroup, but are erosionally truncated by the Angudan unconformity, demonstrating that the contractional deformation immediately pre-dates the basal Haima (late Early Cambrian). In some locations, continental siliciclastics derived from the west (Nimr Group) signify the onset of tectonic uplift and the generation of sediment source areas in the west before the formation of the Angudan unconformity. Different views have been expressed about the nature of the deformation during the Ara, including regional extension (Gorin et al., 1982; Loosveld et al., 1996), versus compression, thrusting and flexure (Immerz et al., 2000). A strong component of strike–slip would be in accord with views of late tectonic escape from the compressional megasuture (Quick, 1991; Abdelsalam and Stern, 1996).\nGlacigenic deposits are found in the Abu Mahara Group at two different stratigraphic levels (Fig. 8). The younger Cryogenian glacigenic sedimentary rocks are found in the cyclical Fiq Formation exposed in the Jabal Akhdar (Leather et al., 2002; Allen et al., 2004). The older Cryogenian glacigenic deposits are found in the Ayn Formation of the Mirbat Group of Dhofar where they occur as several thick palaeovalley-fills above metamorphic basement (Kellerhals and Matter, 2003; Rieu et al., 2006, 2007a), and in the poorly understood Ghubrah Formation of the Jabal Akhdar (Rabu et al., 1986; Brasier et al., 2000). The younger glaciation took place during a time of approximately E–W extension, whereas the older occurred during a period of deep marine (Jabal Akhdar) to basin margin (Mirbat) sedimentation under unknown basin-forming mechanisms. No further glacial deposits are found during the expansion of sedimentation represented by the Nafun Group, or during the stage of basin compartmentalization that started shortly before the Precambrian– Cambrian boundary (Ara Group)."

    "text": "The geological evolution of the East African– Arabian megasuture provides an important backdrop for the consideration of the Huqf Supergroup basins. The review that follows provides a summary of tectonic events in the East African orogen, focussing on the Arabian–Nubian Shield and its post-amalgamation sedimentary basins.\nIn Arabia–Nubia, the period from ca. 870 Ma to 740 Ma was a time of ocean crust generation in the Mozambique Ocean, accompanied by the formation of\n155P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nisland arcs and their igneous complexes (Figs. 12, 13). These island arcs and associated oceanic plateaux, which may have been generated by mantle plumes (Stein, 2003), were swept into subduction zones during accretion as the Mozambique Ocean was closed (Stern, 1994; Stern et al., 2004), starting at ca. 780–760 Ma (Johnson and Woldehaimanot, 2003) and continuing until ca. 630 Ma, representing the completion of collision (Meert, 2003), with final amalgamation of the various components of the Arabian–Nubian Shield occurring along the Keraf Suture of Sudan (Abdelsalam et al., 1998). Final collision took place some time after the emplacement of subduction-related dykes dated 632 Ma in southern Israel (Katz et al., 2004), most likely at 620±10 Ma (Cosca et al., 1999).\nThe ophiolites, representing ocean crust, indicate MORB and backarc origin, and formed during ocean basin creation associated with the dispersal of fragments following the break-up ofRodinia (Abdelsalam and Stern, 1996). Island arc-related rocks (dated 900–700 Ma), including granodioritic plutons (Stoeser and Camp, 1985; Quick, 1991) are found throughout the Arabian–Nubian Shield. Pieces of accreted crust are now stitched together by linear deformed belts containing ophiolites, such as the Nabitah Belt (Stoeser and Stacey, 1988; Johnson and Kattan, 2001; Nehlig et al., 2002) (Fig. 12B). There is a strong diachroneity of terrane accretion (Fig. 13), the western terranes being accreted at an early stage (780– 700 Ma, Johnson, 2003; Hargrove et al., 2006), the large Afif terrane at 720–680 Ma (Johnson and Kattan, 2001), and the eastern terranes such as Ar Rayn still later (650– 640 Ma) (Stacey et al., 1984; Johnson and Woldehaimanot, 2003). Suturing of arc terranes and older pieces of continental crust such as Afif and Ar Rayn (Stern, 2002), which Stoeser andCamp (1985) refer to collectively as the ‘Ar Rayn collisional orogeny’, was therefore complete by about 640 Ma.\nThe final suturing in the Arabian–Nubian Shield, and the termination of arc–arc accretion, preceded or was coeval with 655–610 Ma high-grade metamorphism in the East African Orogen (Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique), which is thought to have been caused by the collision of Azania with East Africa at ca. 630Ma (Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005). It is noteworthy that the accretion of volcanic arc terranes, obduction of oceanic crust and suturing of older continental fragments in the Arabian–Nubian Shield took place at the same time as the Cryogenian glaciations recorded in the Huqf Supergroup.\nThe main phase of closure and coalescence was followed by transpressional and extensional tectonics along the megasuture from Madagascar to Arabia, but\nthe timing of tectonic events along the megasuture differs in detail. In Arabia, early compressional folding was overprinted by sinistral transpression along N–S trending strike–slip faults active at 700–650 Ma (Quick, 1991). Similar features are found along other sutures in Sudan and Egypt, where the late overprint of strike–slip deformation began at ca. 670 Ma (Abdelsalam and Stern, 1996). Island arc sutures are also cut by sinistral N- and NW-trending, so-called Najd structures (Fig. 6), whose timing of movement may extend over the period 650–550 Ma (Al-Husseini, 2000). Awide range of data indicate crustal extension following suturing of island arc terranes: lower crustal extensional shear zones in northern Arabia, bimodal dykes in the Eastern Desert of Egypt feeding major surface rhyolitic eruptions, postaccretion, undeformed dyke swarms in the Al-Bayda terrane of Yemen (see Section 2.1), and mantle-derived granites intruded into already-thinned crust at 600– 580 Ma and continuing until ca. 540 Ma, marking the end of this tectonic episode.\nIn central Madagascar, alkaline granites dated 630± 3 Ma were intruded at mid-crustal levels in a post/latecollisional period of extensional collapse (Nédelec et al., 1994, 1995; Paquette and Nédelec, 1998). Early tectonic fabrics were rotated by sinistral transpression during the period 630–561 Ma, followed by the intrusion of posttectonic, calc-alkaline granites, such as the Carion Granite dated 532 Ma, and dyke swarms (Ambatomiranty; 561± 12 Ma). In the East African Orogen in northeast Ethiopia and Eritrea, 850 Ma high-grade metasediments and orthogneisses reached very high PT conditions, suggesting crustal thicknesses of 70 km at the peak of orogenesis. However, rapid exhumation took place between 640 Ma and 545 Ma, which Beyth et al. (2003) attributed to extensional collapse of the orogen. In summary, the period from 630 Ma to 550 Ma was characterized by extension and sinistral transpression in the Madagascar–Ethiopia section of the East African Orogen.\nAt the western margin of the Arabian–Nubian Shield, Abdelsalam et al. (2003) recognized a phase of early shortening (700–650Ma), collision of the Saharan craton with theArabian–Nubian Shield (650–590Ma), followed by sinistral strike–slip faulting (590–550 Ma), and extensional shear zone formation related to extensional collapse (post 550Ma). In the Sinai (Wadi Kid area), there is also evidence of the formation of metamorphic core complexes (Blasband et al., 1997; Blasband et al., 2000), the doming and mylonitic shear zones (620–580 Ma) occurring along with widespread emplacement of postorogenic plutons during a period of late extension postdating orogenic collapse (Brooijmans et al., 2003; El Shafei and Kusky, 2003). Previously thickened crust is\n156 P.A . A llen / E arth-Science R eview s 84 (2007) 139–185\n157P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nthought to have undergone NW–SE extension, forming metamorphic core complexes, late-orogenic extensional basins and major strike–slip zones. In Jordan, late- and post-orogenic intrusives are common (Jarrar et al., 2003). The main crust-forming stage in this northeastern extension of the East African Orogen took place between 640 and 600 Ma (represented by the Aqaba suite), with melts thought to have been generated in a subduction zone. The volumetrically less important Araba suite (560–600 Ma) cross-cuts a regional unconformity and was generated from within the plate, possibly related to extension. Blasband et al. (2000) believe that lateorogenic extensional collapse took place throughout the Arabian–Nubian Shield.\nCombining these datasets, it is clear that the entire area from Arabia to Madagascar underwent a period of extensional shear zone and gneissic dome development, sinistral transpression and intermontane basin development over the period 620–630 Ma to ca. 550 Ma. Dyke swarms (mostly felsic) and intrusion of anorogenic granites suggest a period of igneous activity at 550– 530 Ma, perhaps linked to crustal thinning or to subduction of proto-Tethyan oceanic crust. The entire scenario is consistent with overall transpressional and extensional collapse tectonics, culminating in a phase of plutonism and, especially, felsic volcanism.\nJohnson (2003) describes a series of sedimentary basins that developed in the Arabian–Nubian Shield\n158 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nafter the main phase of terrane accretion but before the formation of an Early Palaeozoic passive margin along the northern edge of Gondwana (Fig. 12C). These basins are deformed, but barely metamorphosed, and contain volcanic-rich sedimentary fills deposited over the time range 670–540 Ma. They rest unconformably on the juvenile, volcanic arc rocks that comprise the older terranes of the Arabian–Nubian Shield. The basins are overlain unconformably by Palaeozoic passive margin rocks and are intruded by late- to post-orogenic granitoids. These basins formed when other parts of the East African Orogen were undergoing high-grade metamorphism (Madagascar), major exhumation (Tanzania) and extensional shear zone development (Sinai, Eastern Desert, Egypt).\nJohnson (2003) refers to the basins that formed after the phase of island arc accretion in the Arabian–Nubian Shield as post-amalgamation basins. The Murdama basin (Fig. 12C) (b670 to N650 Ma according to Cole (1988) andCole andHedge (1986), andb655–620Ma according to Johnson (2006)) is the largest (70×103 km2) of the post-amalgamation basins, though it is now represented by several basin remnants. It overlies igneous rocks up to granulite facies metamorphic grade, implying that its basement was uplifted and eroded by 10–15 km prior to deposition of the Murdama sedimentary fill, synchronous with the Nabitah Orogeny. The basin is thought to have extended N600 km along its strike, and 120 km across— the dimensions of a foreland basin or large intracontinental depression. The basin-fill is b8 km thick, and is dominated by andesitic detritus, with marine carbonates along the east of the basin. Cross-cutting granitoid plutons fix its youngest age as N650Ma, (Cole and Hedge, 1986). The termination of deposition and folding of the basin-fill at 640–650 Ma may be related to further suturing and strike–slip (Najd) deformation. It is worth noting that deposition in the Murdama basins was most likely contemporaneous with or immediately preceded the filling of the glacigenic Fiq basins of the Huqf Supergroup, but there are no reports of glacial sedimentary rocks in the Murdama basins. The partly coeval Abt Formation schists of the Ar Rayn terrane (Fig. 12C) may be distal equivalents of the Murdama Group, deposited in a basin that deepened eastwards fringing the accreted arcs of Arabia. It is unknown whether this basin extended farther eastwards to include the Oman area.\nThe Bani Ghayy Group (Agar, 1986) is found in relatively small (20–50 km wide, ∼350 km long) faultcontrolled basins with fills b6 km thick, located south and southwest of the Murdama basins across the western margin of the Afif terrane (Fig. 11C). The crystallization age (U–Pb SHRIMP) of a rhyolite flow in the Bani\nGhayy basin-fill constrains its age as ∼650 Ma, while other estimates suggest 630–610 Ma (Stacey and Agar, 1985; Agar, 1986) and 630–620 Ma (Johnson, 2006) for the Bani Ghayy Group. It is therefore approximately the same age or slightly younger than the Murdama Group. The basin-fill is dominated by marginal conglomerates passing laterally into basin-centre turbidites, with bimodal volcanics and volcaniclastics (b1 km thick) and locally developed limestones (b1 km thick) (Pellaton, 1984; Agar, 1986). These rocks are interpreted to have been deposited in narrow fault-bounded grabens filled with predominantly subaqueous sediment gravity flows and marine carbonates. Later deformation is dominated by E–W shortening. The overall character of the basins is suggestive of relatively small fault-controlled basins in a volcanically active Basin-and-Range type setting (Agar, 1986). No evidence for glaciation has been reported.\nThe Jurdhawiyah Group (Fig. 12C) is found in a small number of fault-controlled intermontane or pull-apart basins, and rests unconformably on the Murdama Group. Intrusive granitoids (∼620–615 Ma and 585–570 Ma) constrain the Jurdhawiyah Group basins to be older than 620 Ma (Cole and Hedge, 1986), and the unconformable relationship with the Murdama Group constrains the oldest age to be ∼650 Ma. Johnson (2006) cites the age range to be somewhat younger (610–595Ma). The basinfills are again dominated by continental coarse siliciclastics, volcanics and volcaniclastics, but no limestone occurs (Cole, 1988). The Hibshi Basin (632±5 Ma) is a northeastern equivalent of the Jurdhawiyah basins (Fig. 12C), and is similar lithologically, being dominated by volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks derived from two distinct volcanic centres, and continental siliciclastic rocks (Williams et al., 1986). It is N5 km thick, in a fault-controlled basin 2–30 km wide and 100 km long. It is intruded by plutons dated ca. 620–615 Ma, thereby constraining its minimum age. The Jurdawiyah and Hibshi basins are quite unlike anything reported from the Huqf Supergroup of Oman, probably since they were strongly influenced by strike–slip deformation and volcanicity unseen in Oman.\nThe Jibalah Group (Fig. 12C) is found in a number of small, disconnected basins located at releasing bends in NW-trending Najd faults (Delfour, 1970; Hadley, 1974; Husseini, 1989). There is debate concerning the size and nature of the depositional basin of the Jibalah Group, Nicholson and Janjou (2003) arguing that the basin was formerly much more extensive and has been dissected tectonically after deposition. There are fewpublished dates of the Jibalah Group, but in the Jifn Basin (NE Arabian Shield) it must be between 625±4 Ma (U–Pb zircon date\n159P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nfrom beneath basin) and 576±5 Ma (U–Pb on later dyke) (Kusky and Matsah, 2003), and recently reported detrital zircons show that it must in part be b600 Ma (Nicholson and Janjou, 2003). The Jibalah Group is therefore a timecorrelative of the Nafun Group of Oman and is lithologically similar (Nicholson pers. comm.).\nThe Hammamat Group (Grothaus et al., 1979) is found in the Eastern Desert of Egypt (Fig. 12B) and is closely associated with the Dokhan Volcanic Series (602±9 Ma to 593±13 Ma) (Wilde and Youssef, 2002); it is synchronous with the intrusion of an important NE– SW felsic and mafic dyke swarm in the Eastern desert (dated 620–550 Ma) which no doubt fed surface eruptions. Taking a broad range of geochronological data the Hammamat Group must be younger than 593± 13 Ma (U–Pb SHRIMP on upper part of Dokhan Volcanic Series, Wilde and Youssef, 2002) and older than the granitic pluton that intrudes it (579 Ma U–Pb model age). Consequently, Willis et al. (1988) favoured a depositional age of ca. 590 Ma. Wilde and Youssef (2002) have interpreted these b4 km-thick ‘molassic’ basins as very extensive, with continental-scale north to northwest-flowing river systems, rather than isolated and fault-bounded, on the basis of detrital zircon populations, which require distant sources. However, the rapid lateral facies changes and coarse grain size of the Hammamat Group suggest fault-bounded, narrow depocentres in intra-arc settings (Holail and Moghazi, 1998). The Hammamat basins are coeval with part of the Nafun Group, but form part of a depositional system routing sediment onto the Saharan craton. By ca. 590 Ma, one must envisage river systems flowing northwards, connecting a series of fault-controlled basins, on the western flank of the Arabian–Nubian Shield, and perhaps passing westwards into a broad terrestrial fringe analogous to a flexural foreland basin. Stern et al. (1984) and Stern and Hedge (1985) argued for a change of tectonic regime in the North-Eastern Desert of Egypt after 610± 10 Ma, from compressive, subduction related to N–S or NW–SE extension, with the Dokhan Volcanic Series and Hammamat Group representing this phase of extension (Willis et al., 1988).\nThe phase of arc formation and terrane accretion in the Arabian–Nubian Shield never produced high topography, since these terranes were below sea level, and subsequently escaped the high-grade metamorphism that typifies the granulites of Tanzania and Madagascar. The presence of shallow marine carbonates in the Murdama and Bani Ghayy basins show that a seaway had invaded the northeastern Arabian–Nubian Shield by 670–630 Ma, so the topography of the shield is unlikely to have been great. It is therefore surprising that more\nglacigenic rocks from the older Cryogenian have not been found in the Arabian–Nubian Shield (Stern, 2005). After 630Ma, much of Arabian-Nubian Shield may have been above sea level, reducing the preservation potential of later Cryogenian glacial deposits (Stern et al., 2006). Stern (2005) speculated that younger Cryogenian glacial deposits are not found in the Arabian–Nubian Shield because the region was subaerial from about 630Ma, but that the ‘Main Erosion Phase’ (Garfunkel, 1999), which caused deep exhumation during the interval 630– 600 Ma, may have been caused by a regional ice cover rather than by extensional collapse (Blasband et al., 2000). It is likely that elevations remained relatively low through to the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary (Cole, 1988), since tectonics following the completion of collision at ca. 630 Ma were dominated by strike–slip and extensional collapse rather than by large amounts of shortening. The period of erosion (N600 Ma) recognized in the northernmost Arabian–Nubian Shield (Stern, 2005) may correlate with the boundary between Nafun I and Nafun II in the Huqf Supergroup of Oman.\nThe most convincing glacigenic deposits so far described are the diamictites of the Tambien Group, a deformed metasedimentary unit in Ethiopia. The Group comprises mostly carbonate, but also diamictites interpreted as glacigenic in the Negash synform (Miller et al., 2003; Beyth et al., 2003; Alene et al., 2006; Avigad et al., 2007). Although the age is uncertain (younger than∼800 Ma basement and older than intrusive∼610Ma granites), the diamictites are thought to be 720–750Ma on the basis of the Sr and C isotopic compositions of Tambien Group carbonates (Miller et al., 2003). Glacigenic sedimentary rocks may also be represented by the Atud diamictites of the Eastern Desert (Egypt) where they occur in a deepwater assemblage associated with ophiolites (Stern et al., 2004; Stern et al., 2006), and by the possibly correlative Nuwaybah Formation (Zaam Group) of NW Arabia (Davies, 1985). The Atud conglomerate is older than an intrusive granodiorite dated 674±13 Ma (Rb–Sr whole rock, Stern andHedge, 1985) and younger than associated ophiolites (746±19 Ma (Kröner et al., 1992))."

    "text": "In contrast to the Arabian–Nubian Shield, the Neoproterozoic of northern India and South China was dominated by the evolution of subduction-related to passive continental margins (Kumar, 1985; Li et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2003a,b; Zhou et al., 2006) (Fig. 14).\nThere are contrasting views on the magmatic and tectonic history of the South China plate associated with\n160 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nand following the break-up of Rodinia. Although Neoproterozoic magmatism has been attributed to a mantle plume that heated the Rodinian supercontinent prior to break-up (Li et al., 1999, 2003), others suggest that the igneous assemblage along the eastern and northern edges of the Yangtze block (Panxi–Hannan arc) is best explained by formation in an island arc setting (Guo et al., 1985; Zhou et al., 2002; Druschke et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2006). Abundant granitic and metamorphic complexes are associated with calc-alkaline volcanic rocks (basalt, andesite, rhyolite) dated 822 Ma. Samples from theKangding gneissic complex provideU– Pb SHRIMP ages of ca. 800 Ma, and geochemical signatures are strongly suggestive of formation in a subduction-related magmatic arc (Zhou et al., 2002). Similarly, the Xuelongbao plutonic complex along the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, dated ca. 750 Ma, contains geochemical features indicating derivation from partial melting of a subducted oceanic slab (Zhou et al., 2006). The arc and subduction zone bordering the west of the Jangtze block swung to the north of the block, since the Bikou terrane of the southwest Qinling Mountains contains a volcanic assemblage (Bikou Group) attributed to subduction-related magmatism (ca. 846–776 Ma, SHRIMP U-Pb, Yan et al., 2004; ca. 853–761 Ma, conventional U–Pb, Zhao et al., 1990) and a correlative deep marine turbidite succession (Hengdan Group) containing detrital zircons dated 850–700 Ma, with a peak at ca. 770 Ma (Druschke et al., 2006), thought to have been deposited in a forearc basin (Pei, 1992). There is therefore convincing evidence for subduction of an oceanic plate beneath the western and northernmargins of\nthe South China block, at least in the period 850–700Ma. Subduction-related magmatism was probably widespread in the middle Neoproterozoic, since an analogous volcanic arc existed in Greater India (India, Seychelles, Madagascar) (Handke et al., 1999; Torsvik et al., 2001; Tucker et al., 2001). Younger mafic dyke swarms intruding the Bikou terrane dated ca. 689 Ma (SHRIMP U–Pb) and 660–652 Ma (40Ar/39Ar) (Yan et al., 2004) may be related to rifting that led to the development of a late Neoproterozoic to Early Palaeozoic passive margin bordering the South China plate. If so, the transition from an ocean-continent subduction margin to extension and passive margin development happened younger than envisaged by Li et al. (1999, 2003), at a time more recent than 700 Ma. Zhou et al. (2002) suggested that the end of subduction may have been caused by the subduction of a mid-ocean ridge beneath the Yangtze block.\nIgneous rocks along the eastern margin of the Yangtze Block are also considered part of an arc assemblage (Guo et al., 1985). Early Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Banxi Group overlie 819±7 Ma granites (Ma et al., 1984) in the Yangtze Gorge area. Volcanic rocks associated with the shales and turbidites of the Banxi Group have been dated as 748±12 Ma (Ma et al., 1984) and have been associated with rifting of the Yangtze block, but by analogy with the Bikou terrane of the northern Yangtze area, the Banxi Group may have been deposited in a deep marine forearc setting related to subduction of ocean crust along the eastern flank of the continental block.\nWang and Li (2003) suggested multiple phases of rifting in the basins of the Yangtze craton, starting at\ne end of the Ediacaran, showing the latitudinal evaporite belt outboard ang et al.

Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\n820 Ma after a period (830–820 Ma) of bimodal magmatism and crustal exhumation, with further phases at 800 Ma, a major rift phase at 780–750 Ma, and a final phase prior to a rift-drift transition that took place during deposition of the Chang'an–Nantuo glacigenic succession (Fig. 15), with no volcanism. These two earlier phases may be related to subduction and back-arc extension of the Trans-Yangtze Basin, located between magmatic arcs in the west and north (Panxi–Hannan arc) and southeast (Jiangnan arc) (Zhou et al., 2002). The Nanhua Rift in the southeast and the Kangdian Rift in the west of the Yangtze block allowed thick Neoproterozoic sedimentary successions to accumulate. The multiple rifting phases were followed by a carbonate-dominated sag phase, which extended to the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary. The similarities between South China and the Adelaide rift system of southeastern Australia (Powell et al., 1994; Preiss, 2000) prior to the end of the Cryogenian (Elatina, Nantuo) suggests that it may have been situated adjacent to eastern Australia at the time of Rodinian assembly, but broke away by the end of the protracted rifting episode between 750–690 Ma (Wang and Li, 2003).\nThe equivalent rift-passive margin Neoproterozoic succession in northern India is the Krol Group, which was deposited on a passive margin that deepened to the north (Figs. 14, 15). The post-rift passive margin stratigraphy includes extensive post-glacial carbonates passing into slope and basinal shales, with no evidence of subsequent tectonism or magmatism.\nIn the Lesser Himalaya, the Early Neoproterozoic Simla Group consists of locally tuffaceous, siliciclastic sandstones and minor basalts, unconformably overlying Mesoproterozoic metamorphic rocks. The laterally equivalent Malani igneous suite gives ages of 771±2 and 751±3 Ma (Torsvik et al., 2001), which provides the approximate age of deposition of the Simla Group, and granitoid plutons intruding metamorphic basement have yielded a date of 823±5 Ma (Singh et al., 2002). The Simla Group is overlain unconformably by glacigenic diamictites, sandstones and siltstones of the Blaini Formation (Fig. 15), which has been divided into a lower diamictite-rich unit composed of 3 to 4 massive diamictites with intervening mudstones/siltstones (ca. 200 m thick in total), a middle unit dominated by siltstones, sandstones and ferruginous shale (b500 m), and an upper diamictite-rich unit (300 m) with an erosional unconformity at its base. As in the underlying Simla Group, stratigraphic thicknesses increase to the NW in the direction of deepening of water depths. In South China, the Chang’an, Datangpo (Xiangmeng) and Nantuo Formations (200 m to N1 km thick) are\nequivalent to the lower, middle and upper units of the Blaini (Fig. 15). The Datangpo is locally manganeserich, ferruginous and dolomitic, and the Nantuo rests on an erosional unconformity (Jiang et al., 2003a), making the similarities with northern India compelling. Although precise ages for the Chang'an and Datangpo Formations are lacking, the top of the Nantuo has recently been attributed an age of 635.2±0.6 Ma (Condon et al., 2005). The Chang'an and the lower unit of the Blaini may form part of a thick late Cryogenian succession, with an intra-glacial erosional unconformity, or may span a much longer time interval to include a distinct, earlier Cryogenian glacial epoch, an hypothesis preferred by Jiang et al. (2003a).\nThe Ediacaran successions in both the Lesser Himalayas and South China start with a cap carbonate deposited directly on top of the Blaini/Nantuo glacigenic diamictites. In northern India, the thin cap carbonate is overlain by the siliciclastics of the infraKrol Formation and subsequently the 1 km-thick carbonate-dominated Krol Group (Fig. 15), with strong platform to basin facies transitions to the NW (Jiang et al., 2003b). In China, the siliciclastic-dominated Doushantuo Formation passes up into the carbonatedominated 1 km-thick Dengying Formation (Fig. 15), with strong lateral facies transitions from platform to basin to the south. The approach of the Early Cambrian is marked by the occurrence of phosphorites in condensed stratigraphic intervals and small shelly fossils (which are known to become extinct at 542 Ma in the Oman subsurface, Amthor et al., 2003) in the basal Tal Group in India and the Shuijintuo and Nuititang Formations in China. The close correspondence between the northern Indian and South China Ediacaran successions is conclusive, demonstrating coeval deposition on continental margins facing oceans situated in present-day coordinates to the N or NW in India and to the SW–SE in South China (Fig. 14). The age range and completeness of the post-glacial successions is open to debate. The fact that the stratigraphy can be correlated between the two successions in detail, including the recognition of 7 sequence boundaries (Jiang et al., 2003b), suggests that a more or less continuous succession is present, presumably reflecting accommodation generated by thermal relaxation following extension of the continental lithosphere. Whereas passive margin formation was arrested in northern India, demonstrated by a major unconformity that causes Permian to rest on Tal Group, in China, the passive margin continued to develop through the Palaeozoic, which suggests that from the Early Cambrian the two plates evolved separately. The simplest\n162 P.A . A llen / E arth-Science R eview s 84 (2007) 139–185\n163P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nexplanation is that India accreted to the eastern margin (in present-day coordinates) of Gondwana and experienced continental scale uplift and erosion in the Early Palaeozoic, whereas South China did not accrete, and drifted away, perhaps to a position adjacent to East Antarctica and Australia (Torsvik et al., 2001).\nThe possible correlation of Oman with the Adelaide rift basin warrants a closer look at the Australian stratigraphy. Powell et al. (1994) discriminated four tectonic regimes; (1) the formation of an epicontinental, rift basin system in the early Neoproterozoic, starting 830 Ma, with some mafic volcanics, (2) mid-Neoproterozoic (∼700 Ma) continental break-up, with the accumulation of Sturtian glacigenic deposits in rift basins, and development of a passive margin wedge comprising siltstones, sandstones and carbonates and Marinoan glacial deposits, facing the east in present-day coordinates, (3) latest Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian (600– 540 Ma) renewed rifting, related to dextral shear between northern and southern Australia, while a passive margin persisted in southern Australia and (4) Middle to Late Cambrian convergence and shortening of the passive margin in the Delamerian Orogeny, with shortening advancing from the Pacific Ocean margin, causing the shedding of siliciclastics back towards the continent, reversing the palaeoslope of the Early Cambrian.\nFurther correlations are possible with sections in Iran. In central Iran the ca. 2 km-thick Tashk Formation represents predominantly marine (outer shelf) environments close to centres of basaltic lava and pyroclastic eruptions. The Tashk Formation is younger than the 627 Ma age of detrital zircons in tuffaceous rocks near its base, and older than the 533 Ma intrusive Ariz granodiorite (Talbot and Alavi, 1996), so is timeequivalent to the Nafun Group of Oman. The 548– 526 Ma orogenic episode recognized in central Iran is consistent with docking of this microplate into the Gondwanan assembly at this time. In the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran, however, the carbonate– shale stratigraphic succession bears strong resemblance to those of northern India and South China (Fig. 15). A negative carbon isotopic excursion in the Chapoghlu Formation (Lower Shale) (Brasier et al., 1990; Kimura et al., 1997) may correlate with the Shuram excursion at the base of Nafun II in Oman (Le Guerroué et al., 2006a, b). Irrespective of details of correlation, the succession is indicative of shallow to deep marine, carbonatedominated stratigraphy consistent with deposition on a non-magmatic continental margin facing northwards in Neoproterozoic coordinates. The Alborz succession apparently lacks both glacigenic rocks beneath the Ediacaran, and volcanics and salts in the earliest\nCambrian, equivalent to the Rizu–Desu and Hormuz Series of central Iran and Persian Gulf region (Wolfart, 1981) and Ara Group of Oman. This suggests both an earliest Cambrian facies change from evaporitic to open marine to the north and a localization of subductionrelated magmatism to certain sectors of the long continental margin situated outboard of the East African Orogen.\nThe affinity of the Oman area over the period 850– 540 Ma is illustrated in the two time lines in Fig. 16. The basement geology of Oman, and its similarities to the Neoproterozoic terranes of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, indicates that the Oman crust was formed in a subduction-related magmatic arc tectonic environment (Section 2.1). In Yemen, accretion of these arc terranes reached a climax at ca. 760 Ma, followed by crustal extension, indicated by dyke swarms dated ca. 720 Ma and younger. Granitoid intrusives (710–740 Ma) cooled and were exhumed and eroded before deposition of the unconformably overlying Mirbat Group. Other Arabian terranes continued to be accreted until ca. 630 Ma. The Abu Mahara basins therefore formed at the same time as post-accretion extension of thickened crust in the Yemen area, in a Basin-and-Range type phase of tectonics, but contemporaneously with continued convergence and accretion of predominantly juvenile terranes in the Arabian area. In Arabia, calc-alkaline volcanics and intrusives are erosionally overlain and faulted against post-amalgamation basins that evolved as pull-aparts and intermontane basins, with foreland basins and marine troughs in the east and west. Important NW– SE (Najd) strike–slip deformation facilitated tectonic escape. Interestingly, deposition in the Abu Mahara basins of Oman terminated at about the same time as accretion tectonics were completed in the Arabian– Nubian Shield.\nThe affinity of Oman following the final stages of suturing in the Arabian–Nubian Shield (630–650 Ma) is different. From this time until the Early Cambrian, Oman acted in a pivotal position between the collapsing Andean-type orogen rimming the perimeter of Gondwana, and the outlying terranes of East Gondwana. It is envisaged that during the Ediacaran period the geological evolution of the Oman area was yoked geodynamically (see Section 5) to both the passive margins identified in northern Iran (Alborz), northern India and South China, and the accreted terranes of the Arabian– Nubian Shield. The tentative correlation of the Nafun Group with both the Jibalah Group of the Arabian– Nubian Shield, and more definitely with the passive margin stratigraphy of the Alborz Mountains, Lesser Himalaya and South China, emphasizes this connection.\n164 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nBy 540 Ma it is certain that Oman, Iran, Pakistan– Afghanistan and India all formed one contiguous evaporite belt inboard of the continental margin of greater Gondwana. Subduction, which was initiated along at least parts of this margin, as in central Iran, was the driving force for further magmatism and basin tectonics in the Ara Group.\nIn the following section, zircon geochronology is used to further constrain this palaeogeographic sketch of Oman."

    "text": "Previous studies (Brasier et al., 2000) provided aU–Pb date on zircons recovered from a tuffaceous ash interbedded with thin (cm-scale) sandstones and thick,\ncleaved diamictites in Wadi Mistal, which has been mapped (Rabu, 1988; Rabu et al., 1993) as belonging to the Ghubrah Member of the Mistal Formation. McCarron (2000), Leather (2001) and Brasier et al. (2000) all referred to this stratigraphic unit as Ghubrah Formation, the lowermost exposed unit of the Abu Mahara Group. The sample yielded an intercept age of 723+16/−10 Ma. Resampling and analysis by Bowring et al. (in press) revealed a zircon population of uniform colour and size, and good crystal forms lacking any obvious evidence of reworking. Furthermore, of the 25 crystals analysed, 22 defined a discordia with an upper intercept age of 713.7± 0.5Ma, whereas the final 3 grains are variably discordant, perhaps due to a small xenocrystic component. The lack of an admixture of older zircons, compared to their abundance in nearby detrital beds (sandstone clast and diamictite matrix, see below), suggests that 714 Ma is a good estimate of the depositional age of the tuffaceous ash. This is a rare and valuable constraint on the age of a Neoproterozoic glaciation since the tuffaceous ash is interbedded with glacial diamictites.\nA number of detrital zircons have been analysed from the same Ghubrah Formation locality in Wadi Mistal (Fig. 17). The sandstone clast yielded 5 grains in the age range of 812–826 Ma, and a sample of sandy diamictite matrix yielded 3 grains dated as 755Ma (Bowring et al., in press).\n165P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nRieu et al. (2007a) sampled a graded siltstone 1 m above the thin tuffaceous ash yielding the 713.7± 0.5 Ma date. Of the 79 zircon ages compiled (selected as b25% discordant and 2σ errors b10% for 235U/207Pb and 238U/206Pb), 18 passed a stricter filter (b10% discordant and 2σ errors b20% for 235U/207Pb and b10% for 238U/206Pb). These most concordant data yield a youngest subpopulation with a peak at 710 Ma, which is in excellent agreement with the age of the underlying tuffaceous ash. An older sub-population, which makes up 10% of all analyzed zircons, ranges from 750 to 910 Ma, but only 2 grains pass the stricter filter, with ages at 810 Ma (Fig. 17). The weakness of Rieu et al.'s (2007a) dataset is clearly that it is hazardous to infer the detrital geochronology of the entire Ghubrah Formation from samples collected from several lithologies at just one locality, and further sampling and analysis is required. With the data currently available, we infer an exclusively Neoproterozoic juvenile source for the Ghubrah zircons, with a syndepositional crystallization age of 714 Ma and a detrital contribution from older sources aged 755–826 Ma. The ca. 755 Ma\ncrystals may represent magmatism associated with the beginning of continental extension responsible for the Ghubrah basins, or derivation from ca. 760 Ma intrusives associated with the welding together of arc and gneiss terranes to the west (Yemen, see Section 2.1). The older zircons (ca. 810–825 Ma) have identical ages to basement rocks exposed at Al Jobah (Allen and Leather, 2006; Bowring et al., in press) at the northern end of the Huqf region and to the ages of peak metamorphism and magmatism in the gneisses of Mirbat (Section 2.1) (Mercolli et al., 2006). This implies that by 714 Ma granitoid plutons and/or gneiss complexes had been exhumed in the source regions for the Ghubrah basins.\nA number of attempts have been made to date the volcanic and volcaniclastic Saqlah unit at the base of the Fiq Formation. Bowring et al. (in press) analyzed a sample from the Saqlah in Wadi Mistal, recovering 7 zircons, 3 of which yielded an age of ca. 750 Ma and 4 of which yielded ages in the range ca. 800–830 Ma. Further samples of ashy material yielded 3 grains (782, 786, 826 Ma) and 6 grains (750, 752, 756, 792, 800,\ns of zircon ages derived by LA-ICPMS, reported in Rieu (2006).

Note the tratigraphy and the appearance of Meso- and Palaeoproterozoic sources\n166 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\n818 Ma), indicating reworked zircons from sources indistinguishable from those of the Ghubrah. Rieu et al.'s (2007a) dataset comprises 95 analyses, 28 of which pass the stricter test. These most concordant analyses give a main peak at 860 Ma, and subpopulation peaks at 730, 815 and 910 Ma. Three zircons give ages of 721±25 Ma, 725±19 Ma and 740±24 Ma, but the error bars warn against over-interpretation. It is perfectly possible that these young zircons were derived from igneous rocks associated with the accretion of island arc and gneissic terranes in the Arabian–Nubian megasuture (ca. 760 Ma), late post-tectonic plutons such as those of the Mirbat area (Section 2.1, Figs. 5, 6) (ca. 700–750 Ma), or the start of continental extension at ca. 720 Ma. The older zircons reveal the same sources of plutons formed during a major period of subductionrelated crustal growth at N800 Ma. Although disappointing in not providing a syndepositional age for the Saqlah, the results confirm older syn-Ghubrah and juvenile Neoproterozoic basement sources.\nBowring et al. (in press) analysed a turbiditic sandstone from the Fiq Formation collected from the northern part of Wadi Mistal. Of 12 single grains analysed, one grain was ca. 920 Ma, ten grains were in the range 810–860 Ma and 1 grain yielded an age of ca. 664 Ma. A further sample of an ashy sediment interbedded with dropstone-bearing laminites and diamictites from core recovered from the Lahan-1 well (Fig. 3), thought to be equivalent to a position very near the top of the Fiq, since it is overlain by a carbonate unit with isotopic characteristics identical to those of the Hadash Formation of Wadi Mistal, yielded zircons with ages in the range ca. 645–718 Ma, with significant scatter. Only 5 young grains grouped around 645 Ma were present. Consequently, it is safe to merely conclude that the top of the Fiq Formation must be younger than 645 Ma. It is noteworthy that the Fiq samples analysed by Bowring et al. (in press) did not identify older zircons since the focus was on dating the youngest zircons available, but Rieu et al.'s (2007a) larger dataset of 307 analyses, 167 of which passed the stricter filter, reveals important Mesoproterozoic (1%), Palaeoproterozoic (5%) and even Archaean (b1%) components. Samples were combined from Wadi Sahtan and Wadi Mistal. Main peaks of the most concordant data are at ca. 790– 810 Ma and ca. 840–860 Ma, with secondary peaks or shoulders at ca. 700–720 Ma and ca. 750 Ma. The youngest zircon that passes the stricter filter has an age of 675±17 Ma, but it is 6.8% discordant, which combined with the large error bars deters us from over-zealous interpretation. Combining the Bowring et al. (in press) and Rieu et al. (2007a) data, we can\nconclude that the depositional age of the glacigenic Fiq Formation must be younger than 645 Ma, but that the formation mostly contains detrital zircons derived from the same Neoproterozoic sources as seen in older parts of the Abu Mahara Group, with two additional components; (i) first cycle derivation of very old sources, suggesting progressively deep exhumation/ unroofing of accreted terranes in the catchment areas of the Fiq basins, or inheritance of older zircons derived from Neoproterozoic terranes (Hargrove et al., 2006); (ii) minor magmatic sources (N645 Ma) that are most likely contemporaneous with Fiq basin development, and which may in fact be the reworked grains from Saqlah volcanism marking the onset of Fiq rifting."

    "text": "There is now a convincing case (Bell, 1993; Loosveld et al., 1996; Rieu et al., 2006, 2007a) that the Mirbat Group is Abu Mahara in age, spanning the time interval from an older Cryogenian glacial epoch (Ayn) to a younger Cryogenian glacial epoch (Shareef).\nA pegmatitic vein from basement immediately (3 m) below and erosionally truncated by the Mirbat Group has yielded 4 zirconswith aweightedmean 207Pb/206Pb age of 810.6±0.6 Ma (Bowring et al., in press), which is indistinguishable from the ages of the gneiss complexes at Mirbat (Mercolli et al., 2006). The unfoliated Leger Granite is erosionally overlain by the sub-Cretaceous unconformity, so its age relationship with the Mirbat Group cannot be directly ascertained. Pebbles of a similar lithology to the Leger granite are found in Ayn diamictites, suggesting but not proving that it must have been emplaced and exhumed prior to deposition of the Ayn Formation. Nine single grains give aweightedmean 206Pb/238U age of 725.9±0.4 Ma. If the Leger Granite is pre-Ayn in age, the Mirbat Group cannot be older than 726 Ma.\nSamples of coarse sandstones and siltstones just 4 m above the base of the Ayn Formation were analysed by Bowring et al. (in press) (Fig. 18). The sandstone provided 2 nearly concordant zircons with a 207Pb/206Pb date of 747±2 Ma, while the remainder of the zircons range from 777 to 832 Ma. The siltstone has 2 grains dated at 828 and 844 Ma. The older zircons therefore indicate the age of nearby basement, and the younger zircons show that the Ayn cannot be older than 747 Ma. Unfoliated rhyolite porphyry clasts from diamictites near the top of the Ayn Formation, 20 m below the cap carbonate, were sampled. Two zircons give an identical age of 802Ma,which is the same as the age ofwelded tuffs at Al Jobah (Allen and Leather, 2006), suggesting that felsic volcanism was widespread in Oman at ca. 800 Ma.\n167P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nRieu et al. (2007a) sampled stratigraphic intervals in the Ayn, Arkahawl, Marsham and Shareef formations. Three Ayn diamictites were sampled from Wadi Autunt. The Arkahawl sample, which comes from turbiditic sandstones in Wadi Hinuna, and 2 samples taken from the Marsham Formation at Jabal Shareef, have been pooled in Fig. 18. The Shareef Formation diamictites were sampled above Jabal Shareef and in a correlative section 3 km to the northeast.\nAll stratigraphic units within the Mirbat Group have similar detrital zircon populations, dominated by juvenile Neoproterozoic sources. Using the stricter filter, main peaks in the Ayn Formation are revealed at ca. 722, 810 and 840Ma. The first subpopulation (4 grains, mean age 722±19 Ma) is similar to late igneous intrusions in nearby basement based on Rb–Sr, K–Ar and Sm–Nd whole rock and mineral analyses (Gass et al., 1990; Worthing, 2005; Mercolli et al., 2006) (Fig. 6). The latter two sub-populations also match with the age of igneous and metamorphic basement rocks (Mercolli et al., 2006). The same local basement is implicated in the ca. 810 and\n840 Ma peaks in the detrital zircons from the Arkahawl and Marsham formations. The Shareef is dominated by zircons with a peak at 870Ma and only a small ‘shoulder’ at 810 Ma.\nThe Negash diamictite of the Tambien Group, Ethiopia, which is thought to represent an older Cryogenian glaciation, is also dominated by local sources of detrital zircons, the youngest of which are ca. 740 Ma (Avigad et al., 2007).\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, the Mirbat crystalline basement is cut by an important NW–SE trending dyke swarm (Worthing, 2005). Their undeformed nature shows that they are post-tectonic, and probably reflect a period of continental extension following the main magmatic, metamorphic and deformation events responsible for the Juffa, Sadh and TonaliteGroups (Fig. 6). Since these dykes never cut the unconformably overlying Mirbat group sedimentary rocks, their age constrains the maximum age for theMirbat Group.Unfortunately the Sm/Nd three point isochron age (757±61 Ma) and the Rb/Sr whole rock isochron age (655±89 Ma) both have large uncertainties.\n168 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nTaking the overlapping errors gives an age of dyke emplacement of between 696 and 744 Ma, which corresponds well with the age of the older set ofMukeras dykes in the Al Bayda terrane of nearby Yemen (Ba-Bttat, 1991).\nThe combination of data on the youngest zircons from the Mirbat Group and the ages of late plutons and dykes in the Mirbat basement constrains the age of the older Cryogenian glaciation in the Mirbat area. The Ayn Formation glacigenic deposits must be younger than the Shaat dyke swarm (696–744 Ma), the youngest detrital zircons in the Ayn Formation (722±19Ma, zircon U–Pb LA-ICPMS), and (probably) the age of late unfoliated stocks such as the Leger Granite (725.9±0.4Ma). This is perfectly consistent with the age of the Ghubrah glaciation in the Jabal Akhdar (713.7±0.5 Ma), suggesting that they may be roughly synchronous, while leaving open the possibility that the Ayn glacial sedimentary rocks may be considerably younger. The fact that there is a second, younger glacial diamictite represented by the Shareef Formation is strong support for an older Cryogenian assignment for the Ayn Formation."

Although the Masirah Bay Formation sample (n=80) is dominated by Neoproterozoic grains, there are significant contributions from Palaeoproterozoic (b10%) and Mesoproterozoic (b1%) sources. After applying the stricter filter, a major peak is clear at ca. 825 Ma, with a small shoulder at ca. 800 Ma, which matches the age of granodiorites and felsic volcanics in basement exposed in the north of the Huqf region and the ages of gneisses and intrusions in the crystalline basement at Mirbat. Two ‘young’ zircons pass the stricter filter, yielding ages of 606±9 Ma and 664±16 Ma. The base of the Masirah Bay Formation is therefore younger than 645 Ma, and the top cannot be older than approximately 606±9 Ma.\nDetrital zircon ages from the top of the Khufai Formation in the Huqf area and base of the Shuram Formation in the Jabal Akhdar, derived by SHRIMP (Le Guerroué et al., 2006b), show 90% Neoproterozoic and 10% Palaeoproterozoic sources.

The peaks of 720Ma and older coincide with basement, late pluton and dyke ages known in theOman region, but the 600–640Ma age range is more problematical. Worthing (2005), however, identified a younger generation of basaltic to rhyolitic dykes in the Al Hallaniyat (617±3.5 Ma 39Ar–40Ar plateau age) and Mirbat (604±24 Ma K/Ar, Gass et al., 1990) areas dated as approximately 610 Ma, which can be matched with a younger set of dykes in the Al-Bayda terrane of Yemen (Windley et al., 1996).\nThe young sub-population of zircons from the Huqf area has a mean U–Pb SHRIMP age of 609±7 Ma, with the youngest grain dated as 600 Ma (Le Guerroué et al., 2006b). This suggests that the base Shuram must be younger than 609±7 Ma. These young zircon sources, which mostly post-date the deposition of the Fiq Formation, may have been the ca. 610 Ma dykes of Al Hallaniyat Islands–Mirbat–Al Bayda described above. Coeval post-tectonic granites in northern Ethiopia (Miller et al., 2003; Avigad et al., 2007) dated 610 Ma, and the granitoids of the Timna igneous complex of the northern Arabian–Nubian Shield (Beyth et al., 1994) dated 610–625 Ma, and the voluminous volcanics of the Dokhan (Eastern Desert) (Moghazi, 2003) and Timna and Aqaba suites (Israel, Jordan) (Beyth et al., 1994) would be richer but more distant sources of zircons for the Nafun Group of Oman. This ca. 610 Ma phase of igneous activity has been attributed to regional extensional collapse of the Arabian Shield (Windley et al., 1996; Moghazi, 2003; Worthing, 2005).\nPre-Neoproterozoic sources show up in all samples of the Nafun Group, and in the Fiq Formation in the Jabal Akhdar, yet no known basement rocks of this age are found in Oman. One possibility is that Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean inheritance may occur in younger igneous rocks (Hargrove et al., 2006). The other, perhaps more likely, possibility is that Archaean–Palaeoproterozoic zircons were derived by erosion from farther afield. For example, the Afif terrane of the Arabian–Nubian Shield contains gneisses dated 1.6–1.8 Ga and 2.4–2.6 Ga (Agar et al., 1992), and the nearby Khida area contains granites dated 1630–1660 Ma (Stacey and Hedge, 1984; Whitehouse et al., 2001). Similarly aged granitoids in northern Somalia have ages of 1.4–1.8 Ga (Kröner and Sassi, 1996). Yemen has yielded Archaean ages of ca. 2.6– 3.0 Ga (Whitehouse et al., 1998). Sedimentary basin-fills in the Arabian–Nubian Shield, such as the Hammamat Group (Wilde and Youssef, 2002) have pre-Neoproterozoic zircons (1.8–2.0, 2.3–2.6Ga) similar in age to those of the Nafun Group, suggesting that source regions of this age were widely exhumed by the Ediacaran period, providing zircons for transport to both west (Hammamat\n169P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nof Egypt) and east (Nafun Group of Oman) (see also Squire et al., 2006). More distant sources include gneisses in Sudan (1.2, 1.7, 2.0, 2.4, 2.6 Ga; Stern et al., 1994), and granitic basement of the Indian Shield (Wiedenbeck et al., 1996; Mondal et al., 2002).\nThe combination of the occurrence of pre-Neoproterozoic detrital zircons in Fiq and younger stratigraphy in the Huqf Supergroup, together with the occurrence of young (640–600 Ma) zircons in the Nafun Group, suggests exotic sources beyond Oman. The most plausible sources for the pre-Neoproterozoic zircons are the basement terranes of the eastern part of the Arabian– Nubian Shield, Yemen and northern Somalia, or the Indian Shield. The young zircons were probably supplied from igneous centres located in the west (Dokhan), north (Timna, Aqaba) or southwest (northern Ethiopia) of the Arabian–Nubian Shield, or from the dykes of the Al Bayda–Mirbat–Al Hallaniyat Islands area. This corroborates the idea that the docking of the Omani continental crust with the Arabian–Nubian Shield had taken place by approximately 650 Ma, when we can first discern exotic sources in the stratigraphy of the Huqf Supergroup.\nUnfortunately, the boundary between the Omani crust and the Ar Rayn terrane is obscured by Phanerozoic cover and unconsolidated Recent deposits in central Arabia.\nFig. 20 gives a summary of detrital zircon geochronological results in terms of sources and sinks."

In the Huqf area, the main period of plutonism was followed by exhumation and the emplacement of subaerial volcanics by 800 Ma, after which a silcrete duricrust developed on a terrestrial surface. In Dhofar, where magmatism continued intermittently until 726 Ma, the main period of exhumation must directly precede the deposition of the oldest Mirbat Group at b726 Ma. Subduction-\nrelated magmatism is well established on the basis of petrology-geochemistry in Dhofar and associated terranes of Yemen (Whitehouse et al., 1998; Mercolli et al., 2006).

The exhumation of plutons and the injection of post-tectonic dykes into brittle gneisses indicate a major, perhaps regional (Stern et al., 2006), phase of uplift and erosion at ca. 720 Ma.\nP.A .

As tectonic subsidence continued, basin water depths increased in the post-glacial period, allowing the preservation of turbidite complexes (Arkahawl Formation).Gradual shallowing is thendemonstrated by the occurrence of storm, shoreface, beachface and finally fluviatile deposits (MarshamFormation). In regions of greater tectonic subsidence, as in the Jabal Akhdar of northern Oman, deep-water shales, turbidites and thin ashes are interleaved with thick glacigenic rain-out diamictites in the Ghubrah Formation. If the Ayn glacial sedimentary rocks are coeval with the Ghubrah Formation of the Jabal Akhdar, the older Cryogenian glacial epoch extended between b726 Ma and just younger than 714 Ma, a period of a maximum of 12 Myr. If we allow some millions of years for the 726 Ma Leger Granite to be exhumed, a reasonable estimate of the Ayn–Ghubrah epoch is approximately 10 Myr. No direct age date is available for the base of the Shareef Formation.Wemerely know that the supposedly coeval Fiq Formation is b645 Ma in its upper part in the Jabal Akhdar, but this does not mean that the base of the Fiq is N645 Ma in the Jabal Akhdar, or anywhere else for that matter. It is likely but absolutely unproven that the Arkahawl–Marsham succession was deposited between ca. 710–650 Ma, representing a compacted rate of sediment accumulation of 0.02mmyr−1, a figure not unrepresentative of rift basins at low values of stretching, the post-rift stage of failed rifts or the early phase of passive continental margins (Allen and Allen, 2005). If the base Shareef horizon is an erosional unconformity however, there is effectively no constraint on the duration and accumulation rate of the Arkahawl– Marsham Formations.\nUnfortunately, the mechanics of this older Cryogenian phase of basin development is still open to question.

An origin by continental extension is also consistent with the injection of NW–SE orientated dyke swarms. It is unknown, however, whether continental extension resulted from local adaptation to large-scale strike–slip tectonics (Worthing, 2005) or to a broader, diffuse, extension linked to extensional collapse of previously thickened crust, as in the Basin and Range province. Detrital zircons were almost entirely sourced from local, uplifted Neoproterozoic Pan-African basement of overall granodioritic composition (Rieu et al., 2007b), and there is no need to invoke distant, more ancient source terranes during this stage of basin development.\nWhy the start of the filling of the Mirbat palaeovalleys corresponds with a glacial epoch, and why the end of the filling of the palaeovalleys, together with subsequent overstepping of basin margins, corresponds with the end of the glacial epoch, remains to be explained. The coincidence of deposition of glacial sedimentary rocks with the filling of palaeovalleys suggests that glaciation accompanied regional uplift and erosion following terrane accretion, and that preservation of glacial sedimentary rocks awaited the generation of accommodation space during continental extension. In other words, the early Cryogenian glaciation preceded the onset of deposition of the Mirbat Group. The most reasonable explanation for the rapid deepening of sedimentary facies and the overstepping of basin margins is major eustatic rise accompanying deglaciation, but careful modelling of the competing effects of glacioeustasy, glacioisostatic rebound, ongoing tectonic subsidence and sediment supply is clearly required."

The Fiq rift basin stratigraphy overlies the deposits of the earlier basin phase, but it is not knownwhether this is because of selective preservation of older Cryogenian stratigraphy in younger rifts, or whether the younger Cryogenian rift is closely superimposed spatially on an older Cryogenian basin. The Abu Mahara Group basins are currently orientated approximatelyN–S, but the orientation of the Fiq rifts, and evenmore so of the older Ghubrah basins is uncertain, since the N–S structural trend at least partially results from syn-Ara Group structural compartmentalization.\nWe do not know the time of initiation of the basin reactivation phase, since the depositional age of the Saqlah remains undated, but the age of detrital zircons recovered from near the top of the Fiq Formation show that it terminated at younger than 645 Ma. A tentative correlation with the glacial diamictites terminating at 635 Ma in South China (635.2±0.6 Ma from a sample 2.3 m above the top of the Nantuo, Condon et al., 2005) and Namibia (635.5±1.2 Ma from ash interbedded near the top of Ghaub diamictite, Hoffmann et al., 2004) relies on the synchroneity of this phase of deposition of glacial sediments, which cannot be independently verified. Nevertheless, the most plausible view is that the Fiq basin existed between approximately 650 and 640 Ma. It is coeval with some of the post-amalgamation basins of the Arabian Shield. The Fiq basin received zircons from exhumed Pan-African basement, from extrusions associated with basin reactivation, presumably the source for the 645 Ma zircons found in the Fiq, and for the first time, from Palaeoproterozoic sources, probably in the Arabian–Nubian Shield, but possibly as far afield as the Indian Shield or northern Somalia. By this stage, therefore, it must be concluded that Oman was situated adjacent to the easternmost terranes of the Arabian–Nubian Shield (Ar-Rayn in Saudi and Al Mukallah in Yemen). Fiq basin development took place at the time of final suturing of the easternmost and northernmost of the Arabian terranes. This invites consideration of two possibilities; the Fiq basins may be of the syn-orogenic impactogen type (Sengor et al., 1978) or may be part of a system due to extensional collapse of previously thickened continental crust.\nAs in the case of the older Cryogenian glacial epoch, basin tectonics appear to be linked to climate change. It is likely that continental glaciation preceded Fiq basin development, but that preservation of glacial sedimentary rocks was made possible by tectonic generation of accommodation. The end of glaciation is associated\nwith strong overstepping of basin margins, initially by the cap carbonate of the Hadash Formation, suggestive of post-glacial eustatic rise. The linkage between climate change and tectonics is further discussed in Section 6."

    "text": "The reactivated rifts in which younger Cryogenian deposits accumulated did not develop into new oceanic spreading centres in Oman. The Nafun Group represents an extensive mixed carbonate–siliciclastic sheet with no evidence for any intrabasinal magmatism whatsoever. The realm of sedimentation expanded to cover a very wide region from the Alborz Mountains of northern Iran in the north, to the Jibalah Group of the Arabian–Nubian Shield in the west, and most likely to Rajasthan (India) in the east. There was most likely an oceanographic connection to the passive margins of northern India and South China. However, the 1 km thickness of sediments deposited between ca. 640 Ma and 543 Ma (approximately 0.01 mm yr−1 compacted sediment accumulation rate), suggests sluggish tectonic subsidencemore akin to a cratonic basin than to the early stages of a passive margin. Assuming the tectonic accommodation for the Nafun Group was thermal subsidence following Fiq-aged stretching, the thickness of stratigraphy deposited over a 90–100Myr period of time suggests stretch factors of just 1.2–1.8 (Le Guerroué et al., 2006b).\nOther possibilities for the subsidence of the Nafun Group basin might be entertained. Continental rim basins (Veevers, 1977; Favre and Stampfli, 1992) evolve over slightly stretched to unstretched continental lithosphere contemporaneously with passive margin development. Although continental rim basins were initially explained by erosion of a plume-generated uplift associated with active rifting, similar effects might be caused by thermal relaxation of upwelled aesthenosphere relayed laterally from brittle upper crustal stretching associated with passive margin formation, or by convective cooling following continental attenuation. The hallmark of continental rim basins is that their centres are located on order 103 km inboard from the continental edge, their basin-fills are contemporaneous with the drift phase of adjacent passive margins, their subsidence rates are low, their continental basement is typified by minimal amounts of stretching and magmatism is absent.\nA further possibility is that the subsidence of the Nafun Group basin is due to dynamic topography caused by the subduction of a cold oceanic slab into the mantle (Gurnis, 1988, 1992; Burgess and Moresi, 1999).\n176 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nDynamic topography is thought to be effective in the retroarc region in causing broad regional subsidence, but the onset of subduction around the Gondwanan periphery is dated by arc magmatism and tectonism in central Iran (ca. 540–530 Ma) (Ramezani and Tucker, 2003), which strongly postdates the onset of Nafun Group deposition.\nIt is therefore suggested that the slow but very extensive subsidence in the Nafun Group, which affected both the Arabian–Nubian Shield as well as the Gondwanan continental margin, was thermal relaxation following extensional collapse. A broad region of cooling may have been relayed beyond the region of brittle stretching, with the onset of cooling coinciding approximately with the drift phase on adjacent passive margins. Extensive epicontinental environments found in the region of thermal subsidence were presumably connected to the open ocean via corridors through continental margin uplifts.\nThe arrival of ca. 600 Ma zircons in the Nafun Group suggests derivation from igneous centres in the Arabian Shield from a region extending from Ethiopia to southern Israel. The orogenic front of the Arabian– Nubian Shield must have been covered by a blanket of undeformed Nafun Group sediments during this stage."

    "heading": "5.5. Stage 5: Compressional retro-arc basin compartmentalization, ca. 545 Ma",
    "text": "The Ara Group marks the beginning of basin compartmentalization. Although basement-cored highs continued to control facies patterns and sedimentary thicknesses through deposition of the Nafun Group, two features mark the run-up to the Precambrian–Cambrian boundary. First, sedimentation became polarized into shallow water carbonate accumulation on basement highs and organic-rich shale and salt deposition in basin lows. Ara salt is therefore missing from N–S trending, slightly sinuous, structural highs, though the belt of evaporite deposition stretched as a 1000 km-wide latitudinal zone from Iraq to the Punjab. Second, the Ara Group is punctuated by many layers of ash, which probably are coeval with the eruption of the subsurface volcanic edifice known as Abu Butabol (Nicholas and Brasier, 2000), signifying a phase of melting and volcanicity. This is most plausibly related to the onset of subduction of proto-Tethyan oceanic crust beyond the edge of the continental margin, which converted the Oman region into a retro-arc setting. The 547–525 Ma igneous activity in Central Iran strongly supports this possibility (Ramezani and Tucker, 2003). The Oman area was therefore squeezed between a convergent\nsubduction margin in the east/northeast and the welt of the East African Orogen in the west (in present coordinates).\nThe Ara Group depocentre was displaced outwards from the Arabian Nubian Shield relative to the realm of subsidence of the Nafun Group, most likely due to tectonic progradation or extensional collapse of the eastern margin of the orogenic belt. I infer a restriction of the connection to the open ocean during Ara Group times, either by the construction of new topography inboard of the new subduction zone, or by the growth of the array of en echelon highs that partition the superbasin. Lying at 20–30°S, with a connection to an ocean in the north or northwest in 540 Ma coordinates, and a latitudinal orogenic belt to the south, the area was prone to periodic desiccation. The correlation of the Ara Group with the volcanic and salt-bearing series of Central Iran (Desu-Rizu series of the Kerman area of central Iran and Cambrian Volcano-Sedimentary Unit of the Saghand area) highlights the connection between Oman and the Persian Gulf region at this time. Ara (and Nafun) equivalents are missing at an erosional unconformity in Afghanistan (Wolfart, 1969; Wolfart and Kürsten, 1974).\nSediment accumulation rates rapidly increased during the phase of basin compartmentalization, especially in the troughs between an array of N–S trending highs. Dating of ashes within the Ara Group allowed Bowring et al. (in press) to quantify the pace of sediment accumulation from the middle of the A0 unit to the overlying A4 evaporite unit (see Fig. 23), based on ages compiled from4 borehole samples (BB-5, MKZ-11, Minha-1 and Asala-1), comprising three and a half carbonate–evaporite cycles. The time interval of 546.77±0.19 Ma to 542.31±0.14 Ma is 4.4±0.33 Myr, giving compacted sediment accumulation rates of 0.025 to 0.058 mm yr−1, an order of magnitude greater than the rate estimated for the Nafun Group.\nThe origin of the structural highs is difficult to explain. They extend from the Persian Gulf area southeastwards (in present day coordinates) to southern Oman. The Ghudun–Kasfah high and Western Deformation Front of southern Oman may be part of this tectonic system. The orientation of the structures is compatible with shortening in a major sinistral megashear between the orogen in the Arabian–Nubian Shield and the newly created subduction zone. Compression between the collapsing orogenic belt and the convergent subduction margin is another possibility. Dynamic subsidence related to the subduction of a cold oceanic slab (Gurnis, 1992; Burgess andMoresi, 1999) under the Gondwanan periphery may have provided additional background subsidence allowing the local preservation of stratigraphy on both structural highs and intervening depressions.\n177P.A.

The older Cryogenian glaciation therefore took place during a global state of continental dispersal, whatever particular palaeogeographic reconstruction is used. Regionally, it occurred at a time of convergent tectonics, metamorphism and magmatism in the nearby Yemen–Dhofar sector of the East African Orogen. The younger Cryogenian glacial epoch in Oman (Fiq glaciation terminating at younger than 645 Ma) took place at the time of the completion of accretion of terranes in the Arabian–Nubian Shield. But even at this stage, Gondwana was a long way from being the finished article, since in eastern Gondwana, India and Australia–Antarctica did not accrete until ca. 540Ma, and in western Gondwana, the Kalahari and Sao Francisco/ Brasiliano cratons had yet to accrete to Congo, West Africa and Sahara (Collins and Pisarevsky, 2005).\nThe idea that Neoproterozoic glaciation is linked to the positioning of continents in anomalously low latitudes (Kirschvink, 1992) must be put to rest. Numerical climate models that make this assumption suffer from erroneous initial conditions that may affect the severity of the modelled ice-albedo positive feedback (cf.

The widespread elevation of the continental surface in the form of collisional mountain belts and plateaux must clearly be considered a forcing mechanism for local, regional and perhaps even global glaciation. Phanerozoic glaciations appear to have occurred at times of ocean closure and continental collision, causing regional patterns of topographic uplift (Deynoux et al., 1985; Caputo, 1985; Powell and Veevers, 1987; Eyles, 1993; Crowell, 1999).\nPlate tectonics and mantle processes determine the topography of the Earth's surface, modulated by the effects of erodibility and erosivity. In searching for a tectonic trigger for Neoproterozoic icehouse conditions, the spatial and vertical scale of topography, its zonal distribution, and the range of rock-types exposed to weathering in certain climatic regimes, are important. The most important tectonically generated topography is the high topography associated with major contractional mountain belts and associated plateaux such as Tibet. The East African orogen, or Transgondwana Supermountain (Squire et al., 2006) is likely to have surpassed even the largest of today's mountain belts in its size. In declining importance are the large wavelength (N1000 km) continental uplifts associated with plumes and megaplumes, the mega-escarpments associated with the drift phase of continental margins, rift flank uplifts, push-up ranges at restraining bends in strike–slip fault zones, and the uplifted footwalls of individual extensional fault blocks. Whereas some of these smaller types of tectonically generated topography might be important in nucleating local ice fields and glaciers, the resulting topography is unlikely to be important in triggering Cryogenian glaciations.\nThe older Cryogenian glaciation of the Huqf Supergroup postdates accretion-related melting and metamorphism in the terranes of Yemen and Dhofar. Deposition of glacial deposits followed a significant period of uplift and erosional bevelling that may have been widespread across the future area of the Arabian–Nubian Shield. The younger Cryogenian glaciation corresponds in time to the building of tectonic topography in the welded island arcs and plutons of the East African orogen. The Fiq glaciation is therefore late orogenic in the context of the East African orogen. The possible impact of this new tectonic topography is discussed in the following section.\nTectonics also pays a role in providing accommodation, allowing the preservation of thick sedimentary\n178 P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nsuccessions. Consequently, we should expect evidence for glaciation to be concentrated in regions of tectonic subsidence such as foreland basins, rifts and passive continental margins. This points to a tectonic control on preservation, but not necessarily to a tectonic causation of glaciation. It explains the often-quoted link between rifting and glaciation (Martin et al., 1985; Young, 1992; Eyles, 1993; Brookfield, 1994; Young, 1995; Prave, 1999; Zipper rift model of Eyles and Januszczak, 2004), without implying that rift topography, or other processes coupled to rifting, were important in causing the onset or demise of glaciation. If this strong preservational bias towards rift basins and passive continental margins is true, it leaves open the possibility that regional to global climate might have been perturbed by mountain building and global topography in zones of collision while the glacial deposits themselves are preserved in rifts and passive margins."

Enhanced weathering of silicate rocks and carbon burial in marine sediments may draw down CO2 sufficiently to drive climatic cooling (Raymo and Rudddiman, 1992; Berner et al., 1993; Leeder, 2007). Speculatively, a combination of factors may have made this effect particularly strong in the Cryogenian, such as intense weathering and erosion of major convergent orogens situated in warm, humid climates allied to rapid carbon burial in adjacent sedimentary basins (Schrag et al., 2002), perhaps through the mediation of binding of organicmolecules to clayminerals (Kennedy et al., 2006).\nThe weathering of newly erupted lavas in Large Igneous Provinces (such as the 723 Ma Franklin Large Igneous Province of northern Laurentia (Ernst and Buchan, 2004)) related to major plume activity may be important in explaining the older Cryogenian glaciations, since plumes are invoked to have caused prolonged magmatism, topographic uplift and subsequent rift and failed rift development in the China and Australia– Antarctica plates (Zhao et al., 1994; Li et al., 1999; Williams and Gostin, 2000; Goodge et al., 2002). This mechanism of continental scale uplift and CO2 drawdown through weathering of newly erupted lavas appears to be particularly appropriate prior to the break-up of continental super-assemblies, but is an unlikely candidate to explain Cryogenian glaciations that took place at times of continental plate dispersal and reassembly.\nIn conclusion, there are no simple clues to the origin of the glaciations that took place during the earlier and later stages of the Cryogenian recorded in the Huqf Supergroup. It is likely that the Cryogenian Earth, with its lower solar luminosity, and with its carbon cycle lacking the stabilizing effect of calcifying plankton (Ridgwell et al., 2003) was poised in a state capable of periodic descent into frigidity. Such descent may have been triggered by relatively minor perturbations external to the climate system, such as the erection of high topography, and its effect on silicate weathering, the modification of oceanic circulation patterns and the weathering of extensive lava provinces, or may represent an unforced internal instability of the climate-cryosphere system (Peltier et al., 2004)."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "Recent advances in the understanding of the sedimentology, chemostratigraphy and geochronology of the Huqf Supergroup of Oman has highlighted the importance of the Omani Neoproterozoic-earliest Cambrian stratigraphy in assessing regional tectonics and global climate history.\nThe Abu Mahara Group was deposited on exhumed continental crust that was formed principally at 825– 850 Ma, most likely related to subduction. Its subsequent evolution during the Cryogenian can initially be closely linked with the accreted terranes of Arabia, especially those of nearby Yemen. Unroofed 825+ Ma plutons, metamorphic complexes, younger (750–710 Ma) dykes and small unfoliated granitoid stocks and 800 Ma felsic volcanics provided detritus, including zircons, for the Ghubrah–Ayn basins, in which an older Cryogenian glaciation is recorded. Reactivation of basin development associated with basaltic volcanism took place at ca. 650 Ma, correlative with the termination of a long period of terrane accretion in the Arabian–Nubian Shield and peak metamorphism in the East African orogen. The Fiq basin received detritus from progressively unroofing provenance areas, including new sources from synrift volcanics and MesoPalaeoproterozoic terranes. The end of the younger Cryogenian (Fiq) glaciation is marked by basin deepening and overstep of basement-cored highs by the post-glacial transgressive Hadash carbonate.\nBasin subsidence during the Nafun Group was extensive, with major lithostratigraphic packages being correlatable far to the west and north of Oman. The 1 km-thick Nafun Group is thought to have been deposited in a rim basin, perched close to the continental margin, due to thermal contraction following continental\n179P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185\nstretching, and to have been connected to the open ocean through corridors in the north and northeast. Additional sources for 600–640 Ma detrital zircons of the Nafun Group include igneous suites of the Arabian–Nubian Shield, suggesting that Oman had long been sutured to the Arabian–Nubian Shield by this stage. MesoPalaeoproterozoic sources may include basement fragments of the Afif (Khida) or Yemeni (Abas, Al-Mukalla) terranes.\nThe change to the Ara Group is marked by a tectonic compartmentalization that caused rapid facies changes from relatively elevated carbonate platforms to intervening troughs accumulating salt. At the same time, an onset of volcanism is associated with the start of subduction of proto-Tethyan ocean floor around the periphery of eastern Gondwana. The Oman area was squeezed between this subduction margin and the welt of the megasuture in the Arabian Nubian Shield.\nThe older Cryogenian glaciation took place at a time of globally dispersed continents following the breakup of Rodinia. The younger Cryogenian glaciation occurred close to the time of the peak of mountain building in the East African Orogen. There seem to be no simple clues relating the Neoproterozoic glaciations preserved in the Huqf Supergroup to plate positions or tectonic topography. The preservation of glacial successions in rift basins and continental margin basins may be more an effect of enhanced preservation than implying any direct causal link between tectonics and climate change."

  "abstractText": "The Huqf Supergroup of the Sultanate of Oman provides important information on the geological evolution of the Arabian– Persian Gulf region during a protracted period of continental dispersal and reassembly on the periphery of the Gondwanan supercontinent during the Neoproterozoic, and also provides important constraints on the nature of extreme climate swings during this critical period in the evolution of Earth's biosphere. The Huqf Supergroup spans the period ca. 725–540 Ma, and is composed of three groups. The Abu Mahara Group (ca. 725 to b645 Ma) hosts two glacial successions separated by an interval of nonglacial, deep to shallow marine sedimentary rocks. The base of the overlying Nafun Group (ca.b645–547 Ma) is marked by a transgressive post-glacial carbonate, which initiates an overstepping of basement-cored structural highs and the deposition of an extensive blanket of carbonate and siliciclastic stratigraphy. The Ara Group (ca. 547–540 Ma), which is known mostly from the subsurface, comprises carbonates, evaporites and organic-rich shales, with interbedded ashes, deposited in a large number of N–S trending troughs and platforms. The three groups of the Huqf Supergroup correspond to three phases of basin development. The Abu Mahara Group was deposited on an eroded crystalline and metasedimentary basement. An early stage of basin formation preserved b1.5 km of marginal to deeper marine sedimentary rocks, including an older Cryogenian glacial succession infilling erosional palaeovalleys. Renewed tectonic subsidence associated with submarine volcanism allowed the preservation of a N1 km-thick, cyclical, rift basinfill of glacial and non-glacial sedimentary rocks representing a younger Cryogenian icehouse epoch. Progressively older source areas were exhumed during the interval ca. 725 to b645 Ma, with unroofed 800+ Ma granitoid plutons providing the bulk of sediment, supplemented by syn-extension volcanics, and eventually by distant Mesoand Palaeoproterozoic sources. The wide extent of the Nafun Group, basin-wide correlation of major lithostratigraphic units, and its modest thickness (∼1 km) suggest a period of thermal contraction following Abu Mahara rifting. The Oman area was probably a region of slightly stretched continental lithosphere (which passed to the NE into a passive continental margin), occupied by a continental margin rim basin during deposition of the Nafun Group. The Nafun Group bears little resemblance to the coeval small basin-fills choked with calcalkaline volcanic detritus in the Arabian Shield, but the correlation of the Nafun Group with the Jibalah Group indicates that the contiguous continental rim basin extended from Oman across the tectonically deformed eastern fringe of the Arabian–Nubian Shield. Inundation of the Arabian Shield area and incorporation within the Nafun basin was probably facilitated by extensional collapse and tectonic escape. Sources for 600–640 Ma zircons, found in the Nafun Group, can readily be identified in the Arabian– Nubian Shield. Renewed volcanism, compartmentalization of the basin by N–S trending structural highs and troughs, and an increase in sediment accumulation rates, typifies the Ara Group. The Ara Group deposits formed part of an extensive, latitudinal evaporite belt, with a depocentre translated outwards relative to the Nafun basin, suggesting continuing tectonic progradation of the eastern margin of the Arabian–Nubian Shield.

Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139–185 of eastern Gondwana is the most likely cause of Ara volcanism and tectonism, in which case the Oman area can be viewed as occupying a retro-arc setting at this stage, between a subducting margin and the East African orogen. Coeval calc-alkaline plutons and rhyolitic to andesitic volcanics are found in the Central Iranian Terrane. Neoproterozoic glaciations are recorded in the rift and passive margin stratigraphy predating the final amalgamation of continental fragments into greater Gondwana. In Oman, glaciation was contemporaneous with the development of an Andean-type orogen in the Arabian–Nubian Shield while passive margin basins continued to subside in northern Iran, India and South China. The elevated topography associated with the Andean-type orogen together with passive margin mega-escarpments may have promoted nucleation of ice caps that sourced marine-terminating valley glaciers and ice streams. However, the triggering of Cryogenian glaciation must ultimately be related to the biogeochemical cycles operating on a planet with a nascent land biota, lack of calcifying plankton and reduced solar luminosity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
