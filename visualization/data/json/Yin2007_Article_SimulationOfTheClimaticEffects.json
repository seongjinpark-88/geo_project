Solar radiation and volcanism are the primary natural forcings during this period. In the MPM-2, the solar radiation forcing determines the long-term trend of the climate system change, and the volcanic forcing intensifies (weakens) this trend. Ultimately, the combination of solar and volcanic forcings dominates the long-term changes of the climate system. These results are in good agreement with other model data or temperature reconstructions. Natural forcings can well explain the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). At the large regional scale, the SAT response to natural forcings is almost coincident with that of the Northern Hemisphere. Based on MPM-2 model results, it is concluded that the global climate gradually became cold during the pre-industrial era. However, MPM-2 model results substantially correlate with reconstructed solar and volcanic forcings. Namely, to some great extent, these results strongly rely on the forcing series data we choose. Therefore, in order to accurately simulate the secular variation of the historical climate, it is very important to reconstruct well the solar radiation change and volcanic forcing data are well reconstructed for the past 10000 years, at least for the past 2000 years, in addition to the model improvements. The sensitivity study on the abrupt solar radiation change indicates that the increased solar radiation not only strengthens the nonlinear response of SAT, but intensifies the global hydrological cycle. At the same time, the biosphere is also affected obviously.\nMedieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, solar, volcanism, simulation\nSince the Industrial Revolution, global climate has been changing with the unprecedented speed, which has already caused the people’s extensive concern. It is widely believed that anthropogenic activities, such as the greenhouse gases emissions, land cover and land use change, are dominant factors causing global climate change in recent several centuries. However, some studies pinpoint that natural forcings also play an important role in climate change[1,2]. Therefore, it is extremely possible that natural and human forcings together caused global climate variations[1－4].\nFor a few centuries prior to industrial era, it is thought\nthat climate change is primarily forced by natural forcings (solar and volcanic variability) and that anthropogenic forcing is negligible[3－7]. Thus, accurately assessing the role of natural forcings in this period is very valuable for us to understand the causes and mechanisms of the climate variations, further, it is very important to distinguish the variability induced by anthropogenic forcing and natural variability from these climate Received July 12, 2006; accepted November 19, 2006 doi: 10.1007/s11434-007-0207-z †Corresponding author (email: yxd@tea.ac.cn) Supported by the Project of “Aridification over Northern China and Human Adaptation” (Grant No. 2006 CB400500)\n1546 YIN ChongHua et al.

They provide us the important information to understand patterns of historical climate variability on centennial, decadal and annual scales, and lay a solid basis for us to verify the capacity of climate models simulating past climate change[8－13]. Reconstructions of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mean surface temperature show distinct cold and warm periods during the past millennium (certainly including the few centuries prior to industrial era). However, there are some major deviations among these reconstructions. The reconstruction data of Mann et al.[9] show less temperature changes, while those of Moberg et al.[12] yield more pronounced temperature fluctuations.\nVarious types of climate models are used to detect the response of the climate system to some major climate forcings. For example, relatively simple energy balance models have been used to study the global average response by Crowley[5]. The study of Crowley[5] reproduces low-frequency variance in temperature anomalies, and suggests that about 41%－64% of decadal-scale temperature change can be accounted for by solar variability and volcanic eruptions. Studies using general circulation models (GCMs), which allow people to investigate both the global and regional climate response to natural forcings, have also been very extensive. However, due to the computing time constraints, GCMs have generally been restricted to carrying out equilibrium or decadal- to centennial-scale experiments examining historical solar forcing[7,14,15]. The study of Shindell et al.[16] clearly pinpoints that the long-term regional response to volcanism is not obvious, so long-term regional changes appear to have been dominated by solar forcing during the pre-industrial period. In the aspect of simulating climate change on centennial-to -millennium scale, Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) have their own unique advantages for their effective and efficient calculation and almost complete descriptions of the Earth System[3,17,18]. To some extent, studies of these EMICs suggest that natural forcings are major contributors and anthropogenic forcings are negligible during the pre-industrial era[3,17,18].\nBesides overseas studies, domestic scholars have also made great advances not only in the reconstructions of paleoclimatic proxies, but also in simulating the paleoclimate by climate models[4,19－22]，which laid a solid basis for us to understand the causes and mechanism of Chinese past climate change. However, these studies mainly focus on Chinese area. In this paper, to investigate climatic effects of natural forcings, the MPM-2 is employed to simulate long-term climate variability. We believe that it is really important for domestic researchers to know the laws of Chinese historical climate evolution in the context of global changes more completely, to improve the reconstructions of paleoclimatic data, and to enhance the capability of predicting future climate change.\nBased on previous studies, the present study uses updated data on changes in solar irradiance and volcanism. First, we investigate the role of solar activity and volcanism in long-term surface air temperature evolution, respectively. We also discuss their climatic effects on four different spatial scales (global, hemispheric, sub-hemispheric and sub-continental) to investigate whether theses responses are consistent. Second, we perform some simple sensitivity experiments about abrupt changes of solar radiation to investigate the probable responses of the climate system to these abrupt changes. In addition, we also study the characteristics of the LIA and MWP as well as the mechanisms causing these climate changes. The impact of the forcings is assessed by comparing our simulation results with reconstructed historical data and other simulation data."

    "text": "In this study, the McGill Paleoclimate Model-2 (MPM2), an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (EMIC), is employed. The MPM-2 is a global climate model (Figure 1), which comprises the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, land surface, continental ice and vegetation components. In the MPM-2, the meridional resolution is 5 degree, and variables are sectorially or zonally averaged across each continent or ocean basin. Moreover, variables in or over North America and Eurasia are downscaled to a 5°×5° resolution by employing the zonal structures of the Universities Global Atmospheric Modeling Program (UGAMP) general circulation model and the sectorially averaged values of the surface air temperature, precipitation and surface specific humidity\nYIN ChongHua et al.

The meridional heat transport is parameterized by a combination of advection and diffusion processes[27]. The zonal heat transport is parameterized as a diffusion process only[27]. However, the zonal moisture transport is parameterized so that the moisture is always transported from the ocean to the land in all seasons[27]. The surface wind is calculated according to the method of Petoukhov et al.[28] At the same time, a new parameterized solar energy disposition scheme was introduced into the MPM-2[29].\nThe ocean model is a classic zonally averaged dynamic model based on vorticity conservation, which has nine vertical layers and a flat bottom[30,31]. The Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans are resolved, while Arctic Ocean is regarded as a mixed layer ocean. Three zonally averaged basins are connected through the South Sea at 40°S.\nThe MPM-2 employs a simple zero-layer thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice model without snow, in which the ice concentration is predicted using the method of Hibler[32,33]. For the ice advection, a simple meridional advection scheme is used with ice velocities prescribed by Harvey[34]. In the land surface model, the surface temperature is predicted using the energy balance equation, while the hydrological cycle is simulated using the classic bucket model[35]. The ice sheet model in the MPM-2 is the vertically-integrated dynamic part of the 2-D ice sheet model of Marshall and Clarke, in which the ice sheet thickness is predicted by an ice mass conservation equation, and the ice flow velocity is diag-\nnosed from the ice height, and the bedrock depression is predicted from an isostatic adjustment model[24,36].\nThe MPM-2 was also interactively coupled to the dynamical vegetation model of VECODE[37,38]. This model is based on a continuous bioclimatic classification which provides the relative cover of tree, grass and potential dessert for each continent and each latitude. Furthermore, deciduous and evergreen trees, as well as other seasonal phenology are parameterized by using the model’s climatology and the output of the dynamic global vegetation model of VECODE[39]. It should be noted that the computed vegetation changes only affect the land-surface albedo in the MPM-2, and have no influence on other processes.\nThe MPM-2 has successfully simulated such different climate state as the last glacial inceptions, Holocene millennial-scale natural climate changes, two climate state and feedbacks on the thermohaline circulation[40－43]. Recently, the MPM-2 has attributed one of the mechanisms of Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) oscillations to the brine rejection[44]. The MPM-2 took part in the EMIC Intercomparison Project and performed very well, for its simulation of modern climate was in reasonable agreement with the present-day observation data and the results fell within the range of results by high resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs)[45]. The equilibrium sensitivity for a double CO2 in the MPM-2 is 3.1 , ℃ which is in the mid of the IPCC range of 3.5 ± 1.5 and ℃ is slightly larger than the IPCC best estimate of 2.5℃[46]."

Chinese Science Bulletin | June 2007 | vol. 52 | no. 11 | 1545-1558\nsolar forcing changes on the climate system, which indicate that solar radiation change has significantly contributed to climate change. Due to the lack of direct measurements of solar radiation at the climatological time scale, reliable observation of solar activity can be traced back to the 17th century after the invention of the telescope (1610 AD). Although high-precision satellite data have become available, they are too short in time length. Therefore, early studies mainly focused on the sensitivity experiments of the effects of changing the solar constant on the climate[47] and the role of the sun in the climate forcing[48,49].\nHowever, some studies have extended reconstructed solar radiation time series from 1610 to1980 back to the last over 1000 years. For example, based on a quantitative study of the common fluctuations of 10Be and 14C production rates, Bard et al.[50] renewed several time series of the solar irradiance variations over the last 1200 years, which provided us reliable data to investigate contributions of solar irradiance variations to climate change. Comparing with early studies, we use the solar forcing reconstruction series TSI_L provided by Bard et al.[50] in our simulations. This time series is based on factors derived from Lean et al.[51] In addition to TSI_L, we have also taken account of the solar irradiance series used by Crowley[5] (hereafter referred to as TSI_C). These two different TSI time series are displayed in Figure 2(a).\nThere is increasing evidence[3－5,7] that intermissive pulses of volcanism significantly contributed to decadalscale climate variability, especial in the Little Ice Age (LIA). But there is no thorough and dependable record about volcanism until late 1850 AD, so long-term volcanic forcing time series mainly came from ice core proxy data[52]. Therefore, volcanic forcing reconstruction series have very huge uncertainties[53]. In our simulations, we use the volcanic aerosol optical depth time series reconstructed by Crowley[5]. This volcanic series (hereafter referred to as V) has been extended according to some volcano series used by other studies[3,5,17]. Then the optical depth was converted into a net radiative forcing (ΔFnet) according to the equation of Lacis et al.[54]: ΔFnet (W/m2) ~ 30αpτ, (1) where τ is the optical depth (at λ = 0.55 μm), and αp is the planetary albedo (αp = 0.3).\nThe volcano time series is displayed in Figure 2(c). It is seen that volcanic forcing is pulse-like and ΔFnet is able to represent the intensity and frequency of the vol-\ncanic activity. It can also be found that there exist some periods with many volcanisms in the history, for instance from 13th to 14th and from 17th to 18th centuries. The major climatic effect of the volcanic forcing is cooling.\nFinally, according to Berger, the seasonal cycle of the incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere for each latitude band was computed in our numerical simulations[55]."

    "text": "Two types of numerical experiments are performed using the MPM-2. One was transient experiment (TE) used to study the role of natural forcings (solar and volcanism) in the long-term climate system evolution, the other was equilibrium experiment (EQ) under the assumed abrupt changes in solar radiation, which were designed to get reasonable range of solar radiation change resulting in reasonable temperature changes (0.5－1.0℃). At present, the amplitude of almost all reconstructed solar forcing time series tends to be relatively small at large, so do the responses of climate models to these reconstructed data in previous studies[3,5,17].At the same time, the responses of SAT, precipitation, evaporation and biosphere to the abrupt changes in solar radiation in each latitude band are investigated. All experiments are briefly described in Table 1.\nFor equilibrium experiments, almost the same pre-industrial (1800 AD) climate forcings are used, but only with solar forcing set at the values according to the experimental setup. The MPM-2 is spun up for 5300 years to reach the equilibrium state. Thus, equilibrium simulation results are attained. For each transient experiment, to ensue the continuity of the climate system, the initial integration time is extended forward by 200 years. Namely, the MPM-2 is integrated from 800 AD, not 1000 AD. Then, MPM-2 is integrated for 1000 years. Finally, the data from 1000－1800 AD are selected to process. For each transient simulation, the MPM-2 is firstly spun up following the same procedure as used in the equilibrium run, which can ensure that each transient run starts with the same initial conditions.\nThe climatic effects of individual forcing are evaluated by comparing the response of the fully forced simulation (CON or SCON) with the response of the simulation in which the envisaged forcing is switched off, so do the joint effects of solar variability and vol-\nYIN ChongHua et al.

For example, the relative contribution of solar variability would be identified by CON minus TSI.\n3.2 Results\n3.2.1 Transient experiments\nAnnual mean surface temperature response to the solar and volcanic forcing is displayed in Figure 2(b) and (d).\nFrom Figure 2(b), it can be found that solar radiation change decides the long-term trend of surface temperature. During the period when solar radiation is strong, surface temperature is relatively high, and when solar radiation is week, surface temperature is relatively low. Only through a detailed examination of Figure 2(b) can we find that despite surface air temperature response following the solar forcing, it still has a very small and almost imperceptibly time lag. This is because the atmosphere model in the MPM-2 is a simple energy and moisture balance model (EMBM). EMBMs are very sensitive to the radiation change. Nevertheless, the model response to the TSI_L and TSI_C shows a larger difference (Figure 2(b)), and this difference is in positive correlation with the difference between solar forcing reconstructions, which fully demonstrates the large sensitivity of the MPM-2 to solar radiation change. Obviously, surface temperature response to the solar forcing largely depends on the reconstructed solar forcing time series. Thus, the sun-climate correlation significantly depends on the solar forcing series that are selected[5]. As a result, an accurate reconstruction of historical solar radiation change is very valuable to simulate paleoclimate.\nFigure 2(d) displays the annual mean surface temperature response to reconstructed volcanic forcing. Explosive volcanic eruptions, especial continuous volcanic eruptions, generate a large amount of stratospheric aerosols, which lead to increased absorption and reflection of incoming shortwave radiations together and ultimately to continuous cooling. A succession of cooling, such as the simulated cooling events in the mid 13th, 14th and 15th centuries and in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, agrees well with the temperature reconstructions.\nDue to the uncertainties on reconstructed volcanic forcing, the volcanic forcing is homogenously and simply distributed in each latitudinal band. Moreover, volcanic aerosol optical depth is simply converted into net\nforcing using eq. (1). On the other hand, the winter warming associated with large volcanic eruptions is not simulated well in the MPM-2. Thus, all the above factors might overestimate the cooling effect of the volcanism. But the cooling resulting from volcanism has significant impacts on the climate system indeed and intensifies the long-term surface temperature trend dominated by the solar forcing. Particularly, volcanism causes large cooling in the Little Ice Age.\nFigures 3－5 shows the annual mean surface air temperature responses to natural forcings on different spatial scales (globe, hemisphere, sub-hemisphere, and subcontinent). On the whole, their phases are basically similar, because annual surface air temperature changes closely follow the evolution of the natural forcings. Thus, natural forcings could have largely determined the basic pattern of the long-term surface air temperature evolution, including the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age[3,4].\nOn global and hemispheric scales, the annual mean surface temperature responses to natural forcings are quite similar (from Figure 3(a)－(c)). However, the response in the NH is slightly larger than in the SH, for there is larger oceanic area in the SH than in the NH (Figure 3(d)).\nFigure 3(b) clearly shows the major annual mean Northern Hemispheric surface air temperature changes in the pre-industrial period, which comprise a long warmer period from 1000 to 1270 AD often termed the “Medieval Warm Period” with a maximum from 12th to 13th centuries, a transient interval from about 1270 to 1450 AD, and a “Little Ice Age” with relatively low temperatures. However, this temperature variation pattern is interrupted by several small cold-warm fluctuations. For example, there occurs lower temperature in the late 13th century, while the temperature begins to restore in the 18th century (Figure 3(b)). On the whole, the surface temperature in the MWP is higher than in the LIA by 0.3° for TSI_C+V or 0.4° for TSI_L+V. During the periods with weak solar radiations and continuous volcanisms such as the mid 13th and 15th centuries, volcanisms intensify the coolings caused by weakened solar radiations to a greater extent.\nAt the regional scales such as the middle and high latitudes of the North America, Eurasia or the whole Northern Hemisphere scale, the surface temperature response basically follows the natural forcings (Figure 4), which is similar to the response on the global or hemi-\nYIN ChongHua et al.

Temperature anomalies are given relative to CON.\nspheric scale (Figure 3). This seems to imply that the natural forcings obtain similar responses on all scales. Furthermore, our simulations show that the annual mean surface temperature variations in the NH middle and high latitudes are slightly larger than those in the entire NH (Figures are not shown). This is a polar amplification in accordance with refs. [13,18]; however, it is not very clear and strong in our model. In the North America and Eurasia as well as the whole Northern Hemisphere, the temperature variations show some discrepancies in the amplitude and these discrepancies do not show any regularity, which might have something to do with regional processes and needs further studies. Due to its coarse resolution, the MPM-2 is not well adapted to study the surface temperature evolution on smaller scales. For the long-term trend, the NH temperature response to natural forcings is negative (cooling). In this aspect, our model results agree well not only with other model data, but also with the temperature reconstructions[5,8,9,11,17] (Figure 5).\n1552 YIN ChongHua et al. Chinese Science Bulletin | June 2007 | vol. 52 | no. 11 | 1545-1558\n3.2.2 Equilibrium experiments (EQ) The responses of SAT, hydrological cycle and biosphere to the abrupt changes in solar radiation in each latitude band are simply investigated. The responses and feedbacks from other climate system processes and components, especially the sea ice and THC, will be studied more deeply in the near future.\nIn experiment AEC, the solar radiation is increased by 5 W/m2. In response to the abrupt increase, the NH mean surface temperature at equilibrium increases by 0.8℃ and the global mean surface temperature increases by 0.78℃. This suggests that the response of annual mean surface temperature in NH is slightly stronger than that in SH, which is in accordance with the results described above. This value (0.8℃) is somewhat larger than the sensitivity estimated by other studies[14,57], but lies in the reasonable range from 0.5℃ to 1.0℃.\nFigure 6(a) shows the latitudinal distributions of zonal mean surface temperature for the SCON and abrupt changes (including AEC and DEC) cases. Clearly, the temperature responses to solar radiation changes are basically similar in each latitude band. However, a larger temperature change is seen to occur in the middle and high latitudes, while the relatively small temperature change occurs in the low latitudes. This is because increasing in insolation results in the snow-cover significant shrinking in the high latitudes. Consequently, the albedo also decreases markedly, which makes the surface temperature response to solar radiation change more sensitive[47].\nFigure 6(b) and (d) portrays the latitudinal distributions of the zonal mean rates of precipitation and evaporation for the SCON and abrupt changes (including AEC and DEC) cases. For both quantities, the rates for the DEC case are significantly decreased, while the rates for the AEC case are markedly increased. Furthermore, the\nchanges for the AEC case are significantly larger than the corresponding changes for the DEC case. Thus, global hydrologic cycle is largely intensified due to the increased solar radiation. This is because the larger the amounts of the solar insolation reaching the ground, the more the heat energy available for the evaporation[47]. As a result, the amounts of both precipitation and evaporation increase. However, the changes of precipitation and evaporation rate are not homogenous for each latitude band. The change of precipitation rate is minor in the low latitudes, but relatively large in the middle and high latitudes. The rate of evaporation varies much only in the middle and high latitudes of the SH.\nFigure 6 (c) illustrates the performance of the MPM-2 in modeling the zonally averaged total forest area. The simulated forest area change shows a more complicated pattern. For the abrupt deduction of solar radiation, relatively large forest area changes occur in the northern part of boreal forest regions as well as in the subtropical region of the SH. The boreal forests retreat northward due to the decrease of the surface air temperature and precipitation. The forest area in the subtropical region of the SH significantly increases due to the increase of the precipitation in this region (Figure 6 (b)). For the abrupt increase of solar radiation, in the middle and high latitudes of the NH, the changes of forest area illustrate that an irregular pattern is maybe duo to the irregular changes of the precipitation in this region. The southward retreat of the boreal forests enhances the cooling in the high latitudes of NH by the vegetation-albedo feedback."

During the period with marked temperature change such as the late 12th century, the mid 14th and 15th, and the early 17th and 18th centuries, our model results agree well with other model data. Moreover, our simulations yield quite high correlations with other model\nsimulations for the pre-industrial period (Table 2). Particularly, the highest correlation is yielded with respect to the Crowley data[5] (rC = 0.75), which fully suggests that the conclusion of Crowley[5] is also suitable to our model results.\n1554 YIN ChongHua et al.

But the correlation with J98 is smaller, being only about 0.5 (Table 3).\nMPM-2 model results are simply compared with Y2002 (Figure 8). Some similar and different aspects are found at least. Firstly, on the whole, both of them agree with each other in the long-term surface temperature change trend, i.e. the climate gradually becomes cooling in the pre-industrial period. Secondly, both of them clearly reproduce the MWP and the LIA as well as the transient interval. However, there are some noticeable disagreements between them, especially concerning the amplitude and phase of the annual mean temperature\nvariations. The amplitude in Y2002 is almost twice as large as that in our model results on the whole. But in detail, the larger discrepancies are found in the 15th and 17th centuries, indicating that the temperature fluctuations in Y2002 are more dramatic than in our model results, as well as in the mid 12th century, showing that their phases are opposite. In addition, some volcanisms having important impacts on our model results are not well reproduced in China Area. This suggests that these volcanisms do not exert similar global volcanic forcing signals on China Area as we described. Finally, the correlation between them is small, being only about 0.4 (Table 3)."

[22].\nsequently, this problem needs further studies.\nAfter 14th century, the differences between our results and other model data and most reconstructions except M2005 are relatively small, all of which represent minor natural variability. The data of M2005[12] are newly reconstructed data, representing larger variability. The difference between our results and the data of M2005 is the largest among all reconstructions; however, they are consistent in the major characteristics and have the highest correlation, 0.68 (Table 3). Thus, on the decadal-to-centennial scale, relatively large natural temperature variability, represented by M2005, could completely exist in the pre-industrial epoch, so present reconstructed temperature records could completely underestimate the natural variability of the climate system.\nFurthermore, we think that the following factors also result in some differences in our results:\n(1) Large uncertainties exist on reconstructed natural forcing data during the past 1000 years, which obviously influence our simulations[3,5,17,18,51,58,59]. In the MPM-2, the surface temperature response to solar variability is direct and immediate, but the amplitude is relatively small, only 0.2℃. If the solar radiation increases by 5 W/m2, temperature change may be about 0.8 , which is ℃ a relatively reasonable value. Thus, present reconstructed solar forcing reconstruction might tend to be too\nsmall. (2) Large uncertainties also exist on temperature proxy data. Various climatic and non-climatic factors maybe influence the record. For example, different proxy data have different resolutions. Furthermore, reconstructing the global or northern hemispheric longterm temperature change by using excessively sparse regional proxy data also results in some uncertainties[9,20].\n(3) The MPM-2 is not perfect, as any models. The atmosphere model in the MPM-2 is a relatively simple energy and moisture balance model (EMBM), in which the whole atmosphere is regarded as one layer. Though, the active surface wind is parameterized following Petoukhov et al.[28], the MPM-2 is still deficient in simulating atmosphere dynamics. Moreover, the MPM-2 does not comprise an atmospheric chemistry model, so atmospheric aerosol is crudely represented, which could result in some differences. For example, aerosol optical depth is converted into a net forcing using eq. (1). With the MPM-2 improved, simulation results would be bound to make great progress.\n(4) Through the comparison with studies including anthropogenic forcings[3,5,17], it can be found that natural forcings only represent the major characteristics of temperature change during the pre-industrial era. Thus, an-\n1556 YIN ChongHua et al. Chinese Science Bulletin | June 2007 | vol. 52 | no. 11 | 1545-1558\nthropogenic forcings must play an important role in the climate system. Consequently，to simulate the climate change during the past millennium, all natural and anthropogenic forcings such as land cover and land use change should be taken into account. Certainly, it is a focus in our further studies.\nDespite these uncertainties, our results basically represent the major characteristics of surface temperature variations during the pre-industrial period. This shows that the MPM-2 is effective and efficient in simulating the climatic effects of natural forcings on a centennial-to-millennium scale. This also provides a first step, a very important step, towards a systematical assessment and quantification of the relative contributions of various forcings to global warming."

    "text": "Natural forcings (i.e. solar variability and volcanism) are dominant climate forcings during the pre-industrial period. The joint effects of solar variability and volcanic eruptions shape the basic pattern of surface air temperature evolution and explain the major climate change characteristic at global and northern hemispheric scales, where solar variability establishes the long-tern climate change trend, while volcanism might intensify or weaken this trend. Natural forcings can well explain the Medieval Warm Period (about 1000－1270 A.D.) and the Little Ice Age (about 1450－1800 A.D.).\nNatural forcings exert similar forcing signals almost at all spatial scales (global, hemispheric, sub-hemispheric and sub-continental) and annual mean surface temperature response has consistency at these scales, but the response in the high latitudes is amplified. At smaller regional scales, the climate response shows a more complicated pattern, even contrary to global response. It is rather possible that the regional processes play a major role. This suggests that the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age are hemispheric phenomena, or at least are sub-hemispheric phenomena. But it needs to\nfurther study whether there also exist the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age at less regional scales, and the importance of regional processes under the background of natural forcings[18].\nOur simulation results are closely correlated with natural forcings. Namely, the results largely depend on the selected forcing reconstruction data. Consequently, to study the relative contributions of natural forcings to the climate system, it is crucial to reconstruct the solar radiation and volcanism time series more accurately during the last 10000 years, or 2000 years at least.\nThe surface temperature response to abrupt solar radiation changes is non-linear for different latitudes, whereas the basic trend is consistent. The surface temperature change is relatively small in the low latitudes, but larger in the middle and high latitudes. This is because increasing solar radiation makes the snow-cover in the middle and high latitudes shrink significantly and the boreal forests move southward, which decrease the snow-albedo and vegetation-albedo feedbacks. On the other hand, increasing solar radiation intensifies the global hydrological cycle, resulting in the strengthened rates of precipitation and evaporation，which is in agreement with the study of Wetherald et al.[47] This indicates that solar radiation has major impacts on the climate variability and it is the most important climate forcing. However, its contributions to the climate system and variability need further study.\nIn conclusion, natural forcings have shaped the major characteristic of the secular variation of the historical climate. However, to explore the climate evolution during the last millennium, all forcing factors, including natural and anthropogenic forcings, should be taken into account. Moreover, the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic forgings will also be identified and quantified, respectively. Further modeling study should cover all forcings and include an atmospheric chemistry component. The climate change during the past millennium, especially recent several centuries, will then be studied deeper and broader.\n1 Stott P A, Tett S F B, Jones G S, et al.

  "abstractText": "The MPM-2, an Earth system model of intermediate complexity, is employed to study the climate system response to natural forcings during the pre-industrial era (1000-1800 AD), with a special focus on the surface air temperature (SAT) evolution. Solar radiation and volcanism are the primary natural forcings during this period. In the MPM-2, the solar radiation forcing determines the long-term trend of the climate system change, and the volcanic forcing intensifies (weakens) this trend. Ultimately, the combination of solar and volcanic forcings dominates the long-term changes of the climate system. These results are in good agreement with other model data or temperature reconstructions. Natural forcings can well explain the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). At the large regional scale, the SAT response to natural forcings is almost coincident with that of the Northern Hemisphere. Based on MPM-2 model results, it is concluded that the global climate gradually became cold during the pre-industrial era. However, MPM-2 model results substantially correlate with reconstructed solar and volcanic forcings. Namely, to some great extent, these results strongly rely on the forcing series data we choose. Therefore, in order to accurately simulate the secular variation of the historical climate, it is very important to reconstruct well the solar radiation change and volcanic forcing data are well reconstructed for the past 10000 years, at least for the past 2000 years, in addition to the model improvements. The sensitivity study on the abrupt solar radiation change indicates that the increased solar radiation not only strengthens the nonlinear response of SAT, but intensifies the global hydrological cycle. At the same time, the biosphere is also affected obviously.",
