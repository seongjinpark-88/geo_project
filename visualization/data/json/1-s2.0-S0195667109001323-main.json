Cyclic variations within the anoxic event and association with pelagic red beds are indicated by many studies. Global tectonic/volcanic controls on the origin and the chronostratigraphic position of the anoxic event within the global sea-level changes are important for understanding the paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic conditions during the deposition of Cenomanian/Turonian sediments.\nThree measured stratigraphic sections in the Central Pontides and the Central Sakarya region of Turkey on the Sakarya Zone of the Pontides have been studied in detail. Cyclic facies alternations have been analysed and Ficher plot curves have been established for the measured sections. According to the cyclostratigraphic analysis, position of the C/T boundary with black shales/mudstones coincides with the global sea-level rise. This indicates that global sea-level change is one of the controlling parameters of black shale generation at the boundary and the long distance correlation between pelagic/hemipelagic successions of different parts of the Sakarya Zone and with global counterparts displays the effect of a large-scale event rather than local.\nA positive shift in the d13C curve has been obtained just below the C/T boundary similar to many curves obtained around the world. The depletion of Mn indicates oxygen-depleted bottom conditions. Parallel increase of Cd, P, Ba, and Fe indicates increased productivity. Increase in Zn, Cu, Pb and the presence of volcanoclastic sands just below the boundary indicate the fact that volcanism was present during the deposition of anoxic sediments and affected the productivity. TOC values of black shales reach up to 1, 95% at the boundary but drop suddenly after the boundary in parallel with other proxies. The Milankovitch-scale frequent rise and fall of the sea-level superimposed on larger cycles also triggered the nutrient enrichment and the ventilation of the basin resulting in the repetitive alternation of black shales and red marls or cherts.\nTherefore, this study indicates that the OAE2 including cyclic black shale and red marl/chert alternations on the Sakarya Zone was developed by the cooperation of volcanism, productivity and small and large-scale sea level changes.\n2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The global\n).\nAll rights reserved.\nmeaning of these black shales was described and called as ‘‘Livello Bonarelli’’ level in the Tethyan Mesozoic in 1970’s (Bernoulli, 1972). In many localities of Europe, the Bonarelli Level, recognized as occurrence of black shale interval within whitish pelagic limestones, was interpereted as the record of anoxic conditions on the margins of the Tethyan and Proto-Atlantic margins (Jenkyns 1980; Jenkyns and Wilson 1999; Bernoulli and Jenkyns, 2009; Emeis and Weissert, 2009).\nLater, this black shale interval was analyzed in detail by multidisciplinary studies and it is shown that it was not a product of homogeneous process. Internal rhythmic sedimentary pattern and global carbon and oxygen isotope records of the black shales displayed that Cretaceous paleoceanographic and climatic changes were the main controlling factors in collaboration with tectonic events (Claps and Masatti, 1994; Kuhnt et al., 1997; Stoll and Schrag, 2000; Price, 2003; Yilmaz et al., 2004a, b; Yilmaz 2008). It has also been demonstrated that deposition of black shales and associated biotic crisis were also affected by changes in nutrient influxes, weathering and climate conditions and volcanism (Weissert et al.,1998; Coccioni and Galeotti, 2003; Erba, 2004; Coccioni et al., 2006; Keller, 2008).\nAlternation of black shales with red colored marls/limestones in small-scale or large-scale has been focused for paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic studies recently (Hu et al., 2005a, b; Wang et al., 2005; Neuhuber et al., 2007; Yilmaz, 2008). Hu et al. (2005a, b) indicated that occurrences of oceanic red beds are associated with nutrient poor waters in deep water environment, however, in this study, it has been interpreted that pelagic red limestones with abundant planktonic foraminifera and iron bearing minerals occur in nutrient rich conditions in relatively shallow pelagic conditions, not below CCD, and associated with relatively high sea-level /flooding on platforms. Positions of pelagic red beds within or on the black shale successions indicate a change from anoxic to oxic bottom conditions and are the result of switching off and on of the anoxic environment due to change in oceanic circulation, climate and sea-level in shortterm, and tectonics and volcanism in long-term.\nIn northern Turkey, Gorur et al. (1993), Eren and Kadir (1999), Eren and Tasli (2002) and Tuysuz (1999, 2002, and 2003) stated the occurrence of the Upper Cretaceous pelagic red beds within turbidite/volcanic successions. Eren and Kadir (1999) analysed the major oxide elements and concluded that the red colouring of the pelagic red beds is diagenetic in origin in the eastern Pontides.\nFig. 1. Main tectonic units of Anatolia and locations of the study areas (modified from Ok section; 2, Yenipazar section; 3, Boyabat section\nGorur et al. (1993) emphasized the tectonic control on the origin of Upper Cretaceous pelagic red beds in the Pontides. Yilmaz (2008) investigated the relationship between sea-level change, paleoceanography and tectonics on the occurences of Upper and Lower Cretaceous pelagic red beds.\nThe black shale interval composed of alternation of radiolarite and black shales at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary in the Antalya area of southwestern Turkey was studied by Yurtsever et al. (2003), and interpreted as the equivalent to the ‘Bonarelli’ level (OAE 2). Bragin et al. (2001) introduced the presence of Cenomanian radiolarian cherts and mudstones overlying the Precambrian metamorphics from the Devrekhani Basin in the Central Black Sea Region (Sakarya Zone), but did not discuss the detail of the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary. Similarly, Tuysuz and Tekin (2007) mentioned about the alternation of shale/mudstone and radiolarian cherts of late Cenomanian-Turonian in age on the Kargi Massif of the Central Black Sea Region, but did not emphasize the C/T boundary event. Therefore, this study is the first record for the analysis of Cenomanian/Turonian boundary event, ‘Bonarelli’ level (OAE 2), from the Sakarya Zone and indicates the record of the global carbon and oxygen isotope excursions, presence of the cyclic black shales alternating with red beds indicating small- and largescale productivity and sea-level fluctuations around the boundary."

All these three regions\nay and Tuysuz, 1999) and location of the measured stratigraphic sections: 1, Ismailler\nlie on the Sakarya Zone, one of the main tectonic units of Turkey (Okay and Tuysuz; 1999). This continental fragment is delimited by Tethyan sutures such as Intra-Pontide suture zone to the north, and the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture zone to the south (Şengör and Yilmaz, 1981; Okay and Tuysuz, 1999) (Fig. 1). Yenipazar and Ismailler sections were measured from the Mudurnu – Göynük basin (Saner, 1980), whereas the Boyabat section was measured from the Sinop basin (Tuysuz, 1999).\nThe Cretaceous sedimentary succession of the Sinop basin, which is an asymmetric basin facing to the Black Sea in the north, starts with siliciclastic turbiditic sandstone and mudstone alternations and black shales of the Caglayan Formation over the Jurassic Platform Carbonates of the Inalti Formation with an unconformity (Ketin, 1966; Gedik and Korkmaz, 1984; Tuysuz, 1990, 1999). The Boyabat stratigraphic section was measured in the uppermost part of the Caglayan Formation.\nThe Mudurnu-Goynuk basin, also called as the Mudurnu trough, is a kind of rift basin along the continental margin of the Sakarya Zone (Kocyigit et al., 1991) and characterized by a Mesozoic- Cenozoic sedimentary succession over the Palaeozoic to Triassic metamorphic basement. The Upper Jurassic to Cretaceous succession starts with\nFig. 2. Bio-and Lithostratigrap\nalternating shelf carbonates, following pelagic sediments, cherts, volcanics, and volcaniclastics, and terminates with Upper Cretaceous slope and basinal deposits (Altiner 1991; Altiner et al., 1991). Within these Cretaceous successions, Lower Cretaceous pelagic carbonates alternating with black shales/mudstones belong to the Sogukcam Limestone (Altiner et al., 1991; Yilmaz, 2008). The overlying Yenipazar Formation is characterized by a turbiditic/volcano-turbiditic succession and pelagic carbonates of Albian-Santonian age. The Yenipazar and Ismailler sections were measured within the Yenipazar Formation."

In the Boyabat section, lithostratigraphic units start with black shale/mudstone with sandstone alternations at the bottom and continue with alternation of black shale/ mudstone with bioturbated red marls/cherts towards the top. After the C/T boundary, black shales disappear and red cherts and marls\nhy of the Boyabat section\nalternate. As indicated by Yilmaz (2008), the Ismailler section displays an alternation of white to light grey bioturbated limestones/marls with black shales/dark grey silty mudstones from the bottom to mid-part of the section. This succession is overlain by an alternation of brownish/orange radiolarian cherts with darker mudstones/black shales just below the boundary. Alternation of red coloured marls with limestones takes place after the boundary.\nYenipazar section differs from the other sections. It is represented by volcaniclastic/turbiditic succession below the boundary showing alternation with thin-bedded red pelagic mudstones and volcaniclastic sandstones with Bouma sequences. White colored pleagic limestone succession take place on the top of the boundary.\nThe Boyabat and Yenipazar stratigraphic sections have been measured in detail and a biostratigraphic frame has been established by using planktonic foraminifera and radiolaria faunas. The late Cenomanian age has been determined by Rotalipora cushmani and Dactyliosphaera silviae biozones and the Dicarinella algeriana subzone and the early Turonian age has been determined by Whiteinella archeocretacea of planktonic foraminifera and Alievium superbum/Crucella cachensis of radiolarian biozones.\nIn the Boyabat (Fig. 2) and the Ismailler sections, the same biozones of planktonic foraminifera and radiolarian fauna were recorded around the boundary. Biostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy of the Ismailler section were explained in detail by Yilmaz (2008), therefore it will not be repeated in here. However, in the Yenipazar section, due to dominancy of volcanoclastic-turbiditic sandstones below the boundary, planktonic foraminifers were\nsporadic and Rotalipora cushmani biozone was hardly determined. However, just after the boundary, the limestone dominated section contains the Alievium superbum/Crucella cachensis radiolarian biozone which corresponds to the lowermost Turonian age (Fig. 3)."

    "heading": "4. Cyclostratigraphy",
    "text": "Lithofacies association of the Boyabat section within the concept of cyclostratigraphy can be seen as rhythmic alternation (Einsele et al., 1991; Einsele, 2001) and consist of an alternation of black shales and red marls/cherts close to the boundary (Figs. 5e, f) and sandstone and black shale alternation towards the bottom of the succession (Figs. 5b). However, in the Yenipazar section, cyclicity is composed of an alternation of fining-upward turbiditic and volcanoclastic beds. They generally display the Bouma sequences (Fig. 6c) and are composed of polygenic matrix-supported conglomerates at the bottom and the overlying sandstones with parallel laminations and capped by reddish colored bioturbated mudstones with rare radiolaria and planktonic foraminifera at the top. In the _Ismailler section, the dominant cyclicity is observed as the rhythmic alternation of limestones and marls/black shales (Yilmaz, 2008). However, just around the boundary, alternation of black shales and red cherts is quite similar to the Boyabat section. There is a general resemblance between the Boyabat and the Ismailler sections in the concept of cyclostratigraphy, especially around the C/T boundary. However, in the Yenipazar section, cyclic property displays a difference in terms of sediment type and is dominated by a turbiditic supply. Over the boundary, the limestonedominated section continues upward (Figs. 6g, h). However, in the Boyabat section, chert beds dominate up in the section and mudstone/marl and limestone alternation in the Ismailler section. These differences reveal that paleoproductivity and paleotopographic changes could have possibly taken place within different parts of the basin after the C/T boundary. Fischer plot analysis (Sadler et al., 1993) has been applied for the Boyabat, the Ismailler and the Yenipazar sections by using changes in cycle thickness along the sections independently from sedimentary facies associations (Fig. 7). Yilmaz (2008) documented possible correlative conformities of the sequence boundaries coinciding with falling limps of curves and displayed the change in the position and thicknesses of carbonate and shale dominated intervals associated with sea-level change. These occurrences in the curves indicate decreased accommodation space, whereas black shales are generally observed in the rising limbs. Pelagic red beds generally follow black shales and can be observed in relatively high-stand conditions (Yilmaz, 2008).\nSimilar cyclicity superimposed on larger-scale rising and falling limbs and similar correlative conformities of sequence boundaries\nhave also been observed in the Fischer plot curve of the Boyabat and the Yenipazar sections (Fig. 7). Especially just around the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, a sudden rise has been observed in all sections and similar facies also took place within the same biozones except the Yenipazar section. This indicates a transgressive system tract recorded in all sections. Occurrence of an alternation of radiolarian cherts and organic matter rich facies within this transgressive system indicates that their alternation is possibly related with sea-level changes. This data also reveals that the global sea-level change is one of the controlling parameters of black shale generation at the boundary. This long distance correlation between pelagic/hemipelagic successions of different parts of the Sakarya Zone demostrates the effect of a large-scale event rather than a local one. In the Yenipazar section, the increase in the thickness of volcaniclastic-turbiditic beds coinciding with the rising limb before the boundary can be interpreted as an increase in influx to this part of the basin due to the sudden rise of sea-level and/or volcanic activity in relation with tectonic movements.\nLarge-scale sea-level curve obtained from Fischer plots and correlative conformities of the sequence boundaries of the all sections display a good correlation with global sea-level change curves and sequence chronostratigraphic charts (Figs. 7 and 8). Even very similar pattern of cyclicity and nearly the same largerscale third-order sea-level curve was obtained around the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary in the Tarfaya Atlantic Coastal Basin (Morocco) by Kuhnt et al. (1997). In addition to this, Niebuhr, and Prokoph (1997) also published very similar third-order sea-level change curves indicating a sudden sea-level rise around the Cenomanain/Turonian boundary in the northern German Basin and documented the Milankovitch cycles within the black shale interval including red carbonates. In south Atlantic Ocean, Jacquin and de Graciansky (1988) described cyclic fluctuations in anoxia in the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary sucession and interpreted these fluctuations with the combination of increased rate of sea floor spreading, high sea-level and low water-circulation. From ProtoNorth Atlantic off coast of North America, Kuypers et al., (2004) introduced the Milankovitch type redox cyclicity within the OAE2.\nross correlation of C and O isotope values.\nKeller et al. (2004) demonstrated small and large-scale sea level rise and falls within the OAE2 and indicated the control of sea-level change within OAE2 as a fluctuation in salinity and organism abundances from Pueblo, Colorado. Mitchell et al. (2008) stated that cyclic variations within the OAE2 ‘‘Bonarelli Level’’ in ScagliaBianca Formation in the Umbria–Marche region of Italy was completely composed of Milankovitch signals and must be orbitally controlled. They also concluded that cyclicity within the OAE2 must be globally synchronous.\nThere is a conformable pattern between the European and Russian Eustatic sea-level change curves and relative sea-level changes of the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary on the Sakarya Zone. In all curves, just at the boundary, a sudden rise of sea-level appears considerably (Fig. 9)."

    "text": "d13C and d18O stable isotope analysis have been applied to the Ismailler section. A positive shift in the d13C curve has been obtained just below the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary similar to many sections around the world (Jarvis et al., 2006) (Fig. 10, Table 1).\nd18O displays a sudden negative shift just around the C/T boundary. Cross plot of d13C and d18O values display similar pattern with modern marine cements (Fig. 11). This implies that the diagenesis did not fractionate the isotope values too much and display more or less preserved values. Sudden change of d18O curve just around the C/T boundary may indicate the effect of climate and rise of temperature in the ocean (Skelton, 2003).\nMajor elements such as CaO and SiO2 are inversely related. Amount of CaO decreases, whereas the amount of SiO2 rises around the boundary. Additionally Si/Al element ratio displays sudden drop and rise respectively just around the boundary (Fig. 12, Table 2a). This may indicate that the supply of SiO2 can be related with productivity. Because, sudden increase in abundance of cherts occurs very near to the SiO2 peak.\nThe element values are normalized with respect to Al and compared to the North American Shale Composite (NASC) (Gromet et al., 1984; Van der Weijden, 2002). The depletion of Mn, increase in Mo and total S just before the boundary (Fig. 13) indicate oxygendepleted bottom conditions and relative enrichment of Mo and S\nmay also indicate that anoxic-sulfidic conditions were prevailing during the event (Algeo and Lyons, 2006). At the boundary, parallel increase of Cd, P, Ba, Si, and Fe values (Fig. 14) indicate the increased productivity conditions (Piper and Perkins, 2004; Forster et al., 2008; Zhongwu et al., 2008; Hetzel et al., 2009). Increase in Zn, Cu, Pb, V values (Fig. 15) and the presence of volcanoclastic sands just below the boundary display the fact that hydrothermal activity was present during the deposition of anoxic sediments (Teagle et al., 2003; Demina et al., 2009; Parsapoor et al., 2009) and affected the productivity (Snow et al., 2005; Bralower, 2008). Enrichment of Ni, V, Mo, Zn redox sensitive elements also display reducing anoxic bottom water conditions (Kuypers et al., 2004; Forster et al., 2008; Hetzel et al., 2009). Sudden increase in total S just around the C/T boundary also supports this interpretation. In addition, fluctuation of Ti/Al ratio (Fig. 16) does not match with any other curves except with Fischer plot curve, especially just around the C/T boundary. This correlation indicates that sediment influx was probably affected by sea level changes.\nTotal organic carbon distribution across the C/T boundary in the Boyabat section (Fig. 17, Table 2b) display that values reach to the highest value towards the boundary and after the boundary they decrease. This property is also in parallel with d13C and d18O curves. For analysis, only black shale/mudstone/marl samples have been chosen through the boundary within the stratigraphic section. The position of the samples within the section is indicated with the same sample numbers in fig. 2. TOC values ranges between 0, 21 and 1, 95 % within 12 samples, 1.95% value is obtained just below the boundary. Increase in organic matter content and productivity proxies are present within an interval just below the boundary."

Some individual pyrite framboids in 5–10 mm diameter size, and clustered pyrite framboids forming an area within the same sample have also been observed (Fig.18). Pyrite framboids within the chambers of planktonic foraminifera displaying individual and clustered shapes can be seen as attached to the wall of the chambers.

    "text": "Geochemical, biostratigraphical, cyclostratigraphical and sedimentological data from the C/T boundary on the Sakarya Zone display very similar properties and parallel evolution with global events. C and O stable isotope excursions just around the C/T boundary display very similar pattern within the same biostratigraphic zones reported within many European studies (Coccioni and Galeotti, 2003; Coccioni et al., 2006; Erba, 2004; Emeis and Weissert, 2009, and many others). Even the position of radiolarian cherts within the established biostratigraphic framework and the lithostratigraphic pattern displaying the alternation with black shales are quite similar with the type section of Bonarelli level (Bernoulli and Jenkyns, 2009; Emeis and Weissert, 2009).\nThe Milankovitch-scale frequent rise and fall of sea-level superimposed on larger cycles also triggered the nutrient enrichment and the ventilation of the basin resulting in the repetitive alternation of black shales and red marls or cherts. In addition to this, Kuypers et al., (2004) pointed out the control of productivity changes in redox cyclicity within the OAE2 from the Proto-North Atlantic off coast of North America. Even from Pueblo, Colorado, Keller et al. (2004) stated cyclic alternations within the OAE2 and demonstrated the relationship between high frequency sea-level fluctuations and salinity changes by oxygen isotope and planktonic foraminifera analysis, and they also claimed that high frequency sea-level rise and fall were associated with the fluctuation in fresh and marine water fluxes reflected in oxygen isotope values and abundances in planktonic foraminifera along the succession. This also supports the idea of sea-level control within the OAE2.\nHay (2008) stated that global episodes of anoxia during the Cretaceous could reflect general turnover of the ocean with widespread upwelling as stable sources of deep water developed in the\nice-free Cretaceous world. These changes must have operated in small and large-scales. The changes in turnovers and upwelling systems reflected as black shale and pelagic red bed alternations in the ocean might have also been related to thermally/climaticallyinduced sea-level changes and paleoproductivity fluctuations on the larger scale tectonic and volcanic events. Snow et al. (2005) and Bralower (2008) discussed the effect of hydrothermal events created by submarine lava flows during the formation of the Caribbean plateau on the occurrence of OAE2 and display the Cr, Co, Cu, Sc, Ag and W metal elements enrichment in the pelagic sediments just before the C/T boundary. They also indicated the possible effect on paleoproductivity via pumping metal micronitruent into ocean by submarine Carrabean eruptions. Erba (2004) announced the effect of submarine volcanic events on paleoproductivity and formation of Oceanic Anoxic Events in Cretaceous in similar way.\nCenomanian/Turonian records from Taurides (Yurtsever et al., 2003), and from Sakarya Zone (Rojay and Altniner, 1998; Rojay et al., 2001; Bragin et al., 2001; Yilmaz, 2008) and records of this study are plotted on a Mid-Cretaceous paleogeographic map (Gorur and Tuysuz, 2001) (Fig. 20). It is seen that they are lying on the slopes/basins of the North and South Neotethyan Oceans. Rojay and Altniner (1998) reported the presence of upper Aptian – upper Cenomanian deep-sea turbidites and pelagic carbonate successions just over drowned Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous shallow water carbonate platform succession in the Sakarya Zone. Similarly, record of Cenomanian cherts (Bragin et al., 2001) just on the unconformity surface over the Precambrian metamorphics supports the idea of large-scale sea-level rise and tectonic movements in the late Cenomanian. Goncuoglu et al. (2006) and Rojay et al. (2001) did mention about the presence of the late Cenomanian blocks of radiolarian chert successions in association with submarine volcanics/pillow basalts within ophiolitic melange in Central Anatolia. According to this, it\ncan be implied that the oceanic crust of the Neotethyan Ocean was present in the Cenomanian and large-scale submarine volcanic and tectonic activities took place in the northern Neotethyan Ocean during the Cenomanian. In addition to this, Tuysuz and Tekin (2007) indicated the presence of northward subduction of the Neotethyan Ocean during the Valanginian to Campanian in the Noerthern Turkey. Al-Riyami and Robertson (2002) indicated the presence of association of Cenomanian radiolarian cherts, mudstones and reddish pelagic limestones, ferromanganese rich pelagic silicious limestones and submarine volcanics within the Baer–Bassit Melange of northern Syria indicating deepwater sedimentation and volcanism adjacent to the Arabian continental margin and emphasised on the effect of complex interplay between post-rift thermal subsidence, plume-inducted thermal uplift, oceanographic siliceous productivity events, eustatic sea-level change and climatic change on the sedimentation on the South-Tethyan Ocean in northern Syria. However they also announce the large-scale dominant effect as tectonic/magmatic events."

    "heading": "8. Conclusion",
    "text": "Close to the C/T boundary, the appearance of pelagic red beds alternating with black shales is very spectacular. Cyclic alternation of red beds/cherts and black shales is similar in between the Ismailler and Boyabat sections and differently, red-pink mudstones alternate with volcanoclastic sandstones in the Yenipazar section. These lithologic features, sedimentological properties, trace and major element anomalies and isotope excursions observed at the C/T boundary indicate a kind of interplay between paleoproductivity, climate induced (Milankovitch bands) small-scale sea-level changes superimposed on larger-scale, volcanism and tectonic movements. The large-scale sea-level change curve obtained from the measured sections fits to the global sea-level curves and displays consistency with paleoclimate proxies. This collaboration caused swithcing on and off of the ocean ventilation and affected the amount of nutrient distribution, sediment influx, changes in the thickness of the ocean layers, and their connectivity. Record of the sudden rise of sea-level and temperature coincided to the the C/T boundary on the Sakarya Zone as in many examples from the world (Skelton, 2003)."

  "abstractText": "The Cenomanian/Turonian oceanic anoxic event as recorded in many parts of the world is characterized by presence of black shales and global carbon isotope peaks. Cyclic variations within the anoxic event and association with pelagic red beds are indicated by many studies. Global tectonic/volcanic controls on the origin and the chronostratigraphic position of the anoxic event within the global sea-level changes are important for understanding the paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic conditions during the deposition of Cenomanian/Turonian sediments. Three measured stratigraphic sections in the Central Pontides and the Central Sakarya region of Turkey on the Sakarya Zone of the Pontides have been studied in detail. Cyclic facies alternations have been analysed and Ficher plot curves have been established for the measured sections. According to the cyclostratigraphic analysis, position of the C/T boundary with black shales/mudstones coincides with the global sea-level rise. This indicates that global sea-level change is one of the controlling parameters of black shale generation at the boundary and the long distance correlation between pelagic/hemipelagic successions of different parts of the Sakarya Zone and with global counterparts displays the effect of a large-scale event rather than local. A positive shift in the d13C curve has been obtained just below the C/T boundary similar to many curves obtained around the world. The depletion of Mn indicates oxygen-depleted bottom conditions. Parallel increase of Cd, P, Ba, and Fe indicates increased productivity. Increase in Zn, Cu, Pb and the presence of volcanoclastic sands just below the boundary indicate the fact that volcanism was present during the deposition of anoxic sediments and affected the productivity. TOC values of black shales reach up to 1, 95% at the boundary but drop suddenly after the boundary in parallel with other proxies. The Milankovitch-scale frequent rise and fall of the sea-level superimposed on larger cycles also triggered the nutrient enrichment and the ventilation of the basin resulting in the repetitive alternation of black shales and red marls or cherts. Therefore, this study indicates that the OAE2 including cyclic black shale and red marl/chert alternations on the Sakarya Zone was developed by the cooperation of volcanism, productivity and small and large-scale sea level changes. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
