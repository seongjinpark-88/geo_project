    "text": "In Part I of this study (Diamantides, 1998) the presence of long-term patterning in solar activity was investigated and its macrodynamic features portrayed by means of a model describing the morphology of the process. In Part II which now follows, examples are presented demonstrating the pertinence of this formulation to terrestrial phenomena of considerable interest.\nAlthough in a last analysis all such phenomena are powered either by energy stored in the earth's interior\nduring its formation, or by energy issuing from the sun contemporarily, the physics of their relationship to the basic entity z11 t of the present model, should it exist, is for the most part unknown. Therefore, the term connection will be used in examining possible relationships, the dictionary de®nition of the term `connection' being: ``Relation between things one of which is bound up with, or involved in, another'' (The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary). Hence, in the present context, Ôconnection' neither implies a cause-e ect relationship, nor excludes it; for all we know, both the solar and the terrestrial may be in¯uenced by processes emanating from outside the solar/planetary system. In all cases examined subsequently, the long-term behavior of the phenomenon under scrutiny will be sought and, therefore, when necessary, data series given in terms of annual ®gures will be replaced by their 11-year average as de®ned by Eq. (7), Part I. Identi®cation of the connection will then be searched by means of the transfer-function algorithm and/or the Kolmogorov algorithm, both of them employed in the realms of control-systems and communication-signals; with it, the presence of both harmonics and/or subharmonics of the 11-year sunspot cycle will be monitored in view of the basic tenet's corollary.\nIn what follows, a number of lithospheric and atmospheric phenomena are looked upon from this connection point of view. By analogy with the behavior of mechanical and/or electrical systems, each of the input agent's components: trend T t , surges Si t and time derivative Dz11 t can be a ecting the phenomenon under consideration di erently. Therefore, to assess each component's relative contribution, the component's normalized counterpart will be entered into the presumed connection, the normalization algorithm being:\nf t f t ÿ favg =fstd : 1 The terrestrial phenomena in Sects. 2±6 that follow are to be viewed in this light, their historical record, as well as that of z11 t , being given in the Appendices."

    "text": "The atmospheric circulation as well as the sea surface temperature, pressure, and subsurface currents in the western equatorial Paci®c have exhibited remarkably consistent space and time patterns ever since their observation began in the middle of the last century. Several other atmospheric and oceanic features ± both near to/and far from the site ± vary in association with these patterns, including the very important El NinÄo phenomenon, and the climate dynamics of Oceania, Australia, New Zealand, and the western parts of the Americas (Phillander, 1992). The literature spurred by the phenomenon has been varied (Anderson and McTeay 1985; Cane et al., 1986; Legrand and Simon, 1989; Quinn et al., 1987; Simon and Legrand, 1989; Kerr, 1991; Simkin, 1994; Mendora et al., 1991), often invoking the solar factor in various ways, like solar ultraviolet radiation, solar wind, general atmospheric circulation, ocean-atmosphere coupling, geomagnetic activity, solar winds, etc.\nThe phenomena and the physical mechanisms involved have been referred to as the Southern Oscillation. The importance of its in¯uence upon global climate may be judged by the fact that 18 countries have invested in a decade of research named Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Study (TOGA) beginning with a search for temperature models of the tropical Paci®c waters (Monastersky, 1993).\nIn this section of the study the 1850±1975 history of air barometric pressure over that area amassed by Wright (1977, 1995) is analyzed in the present context. The data has been arranged by Wright in a form which he named the Southern Oscillation Index, and which, arranged by season, is given in Appendix 1a,b. For our purposes the annual ®gures of the index for spring, i.e., March-April-May (MAM); and fall, September-October-November (SON) will be combined to produce the function:\nO t MAM+SON =2 ; 2\nand its long-term counterpart O11 t , both of which can be seen in Appendix 2 and Fig. 1. The reason for selecting Eq. (2) to represent the index is to track the average course of the Southern Oscillation phenomenon and avoid either one of the two extremes of winter (DJF) and summer (JJA) months. Beyond 1974 the index is extended to 1992 based on the di erence p t between the standardized sea-level pressure anomalies at Tahiti and Darwin (National Weather Service, 1992). The two records, having a common time-span in 1973± 1994, make possible the expression of O11 t as a linear function of p t over this span, with the result being included in Appendix a and b. Then, in a trial step, O11 t was set up as a linear function of the trend T t and surge S t components of z11 t , and the ensuing residual was probed for the presence of incommensurate frequencies: once again the second subharmonic of z t was found in the residual's autocorrelogram leading to the ®nal model:\nO11 t a T t b S t m sin x2t n cos x2t c ; x 2p=11 : 3\nThe resulting regression parameters are listed below:\nparameter offset years i w i a 0:768 0:161 ÿ20 0:008 b 0:450 0:084 ÿ16 ÿ0:026 m 0:187 0:098 ÿ12 ÿ0:385 n 0:438 0:090 ÿ8 ÿ0:035 c ÿ0:364 ÿ4 0:443 R2 0:665 to 1870;\nnormalizing constants\nO11 T t S t avg 0:124 48:26 1:337\nstd 0:244 4:195 17:32\n4\nTo the residual of this step, whose autocorrelation function is seen in Fig. 2, the Kolmogorov operation was applied resulting in the transfer function w i also\nshown in Eq. (4). The unit-time-step of 4 years was chosen because according to National Weather Service (1992) ``the temporal behavior of the Southern Oscillation shows a quasi-periodicity of 3 to 5 years''. The ®nal residual proves de®nitely to be a random function, its autocorrelogram being the delta-function. Figure 3 of the ®nal result shows how the solar `connection', Eq. (3), and the ocean's surface thermodynamics presumably represented by the Kolmogorov sum, combine to power the phenomenon, with Fig. 4 showing the two components separately: their individual contributions to O11 t as measured by their standard deviation (std) are 0.83 for the former and 0.45 for the latter. The model's adequacy may be judged by the fact that its standard deviation is 0.987 compared to 1 for the actual O11 t .\nThe outcome of this modeling therefore allays the hesitations expressed by, among others En®eld and Cid (1991), on the question of a solar connection presence. Finally, it should be pointed out that the presence of the sunspot number's period (11 years) has been noted in the analysis of climate behavior in an Atlantic Ocean counterpart of the Paci®c Southern Oscillation; Ping et al. (1997) have proposed a model for the decadal variation of the sea surface temperature of the Atlantic north-south dipole. According to it, the variation is attributed to ``an unstable thermodynamic ocean-atmosphere interaction between wind-induced heat ¯uxes and sea surface temperature''. Under certain conditions, however, the model's so-called Dipole Index is an 11-year sinusoid (their Fig. 1b), and not the 10-year one they theorize, suggesting a solar connection."

    "heading": "3.1 The atmospheric contaminants",
    "text": "The ®rst climatic subject to be probed in the present context is the question of long-term changes in atmospheric gasses known to a ect the radiative budget of the atmosphere; under the current state of the art, the most important of these atmospheric contaminants are\ncarbon dioxide (CO2) and the anthropogenic aerosols (Wigley and Raper, 1992), the growths of which have paralleled the growth of industrialization. For the purposes of this study, sulphur dioxide (SO2) will be used as the surrogate of the in¯uence of aerosols upon climate. The choice of these two agents re¯ects the fact that, while CO2 constitutes a warming factor by being transparent to incoming visible radiation and opaque to outgoing infrared radiation, SO2 can behave as a cooling factor most of the time, but not always, as explained later on. The `contaminants' record, in parts per million by volume (ppmv), is given in Appendices 2 and 3.\n3.1.1 The CO2 factor. According to the researchers of the Physics Institute of the University of Bern (Neftel et al., 1985), a detailed knowledge of the increase in CO2 concentration since preindustrial times is a necessary prerequisite for understanding such aspects of the role of carbon dioxide as the sensitivity of climate to its concentration in the atmosphere and the contribution of biomass burning to the CO2 increase. It is their view that the most reliable assessment of the ancient atmospheric CO2 concentration is derived from measurements on the air occluded in ice cores. To this end, the researchers used a core from Siple Station in West Antarctica to determine the enclosed gas concentrations with a very good time resolution and over a time-span covering the last three centuries. The 200-m core was drilled in the summer of 1983±1984 by a team from the Bern Physics Institute and the Polar Ice Coring O ce in Nebraska. The researchers' CO2 concentration data from extracted air come from Table 1 and Fig. 1 of Naftel et al. (1985). It is reassuring to note that this record matches the one from a similar analysis of a core drilled in central Greenland by Wahlen et al. (1991). Here, the Siple Station data are the presumed output function CO2 t . The Naftel records were correlated with the trend component T(t) of the long-term solar activity z11 t of the present model over the period 1734± 1940. The reason for this choice is the fact that the CO2Fig. 3. Southern Oscillation model\nrecord strongly suggests a low-pass ®lter characteristic for the presumed `connection'. Accordingly, the simple functional relationship:\nCO2 t a T t k 5 was subjected to linear regression over the 1745±1940 time-span, resulting in:\na 98:626 ; k 0:2834 0:0121 ; R2 0:987 :\n6\nAs Fig. 5 shows, the agreement between the actual CO2 data and the data from the model is remarkable up to about the year 1940, and so is the disagreement from that time on. The outcome is given in Table 1. According to it, the atmospheric CO2 rate begins to outstrip that of T t at about 1940, and this in spite of the fact that the T t model used was the one with parameter values of Eq. (10) from Part I, making for a faster T t rise than the constrain tenet allows. Quite obviously, the rapidity of this growth cannot all be attributed to the sun. The fact that the year 1940 marks the end of the worldwide depression of the 1930s and the onset of the most intensive and extensive industrial activity to date is very likely the reason. Equally important, however, is the fact that this manmade factor appears to have become aggravated by a naturemade positive feedback: recent studies (Prentice et al., 1990; Oechel et al., 1993; Smith and Shugart, 1993) have found that conditions have changed in the Arctic tundra, which during historic as well as recent geological times has been a net sink of CO2 with large amounts of carbon being stored in the soils of northern ecosystems. But, with many regions of the Arctic becoming warmer than they were in the past, microbial action upon plant debris is enhanced, causing the soil to change from a sink to a source of CO2. How much this a ects the CO2 budget is presently a matter of conjecture. In addition,\nregional e ects can be much more variable ± and uncertain ± than global average projections. To this the nonlinear character of the system should be added, and the risks that nonlinearity often portends. (Ayres and Walter, 1991).\nAll these factors notwithstanding, should the relationship expressed by Eq. (5) hold into the distant future, a peaking of the atmospheric CO2 content would occur at about the year 2050 at the level of 331.7 ppmv, if only solar in¯uence were operative. Yet the level has already been reached at the beginning of the 1990s.\n3.1.2 The SO2 factor. The radiative forcing by atmospheric aerosols in general and by SO2 in particular is quite involved. Radiative in¯uences of aerosols on climate can be distinguished as direct, referring to the scattering and absorption of radiation by the aerosol particles themselves, and indirect, referring to the in¯uence of aerosols on cloud formation (a complex process in itself), cloud lifetimes (Charlson et al., 1992; Kellog, 1992; Lelieveld and Heintzenberg, 1992) and cloud altitude (tropospheric or lower-atmospheric). For all these reasons SO2 climate forcing varies greatly with location and to the point where net warming instead of cooling may at times be the result. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion and metal smelting, have increased greatly over the industrial period (Charlson et al., 1992). For this reason more than 90% of industrial SO2 is emitted in the northern hemisphere, with the result that aerosol forcing is more of a factor there than in the southern hemisphere. By the same token, the forcing will be more pronounced in the industrial and large urban areas, and downwind from them than in open country. To this should be added the fact that radiation-related aerosol phenomena depend nonlinearly on aerosol concentration.\nThe time history of SO2 t , based on Moller (1984), is given in Appendix 3 ± a history that is better appreciated through the function ln SO2 t shown in Fig. 6 (solid line). As seen there, SO2 t has been growing steadily from 1800 to the present time at a rate only slightly a ected by the Great Depression. Taking the optimistic stand that this growth rate cannot continue ad in®nitum, let us use the notation:\ny t ln SO2 t ; 7"

    "text": "Recent homogenized near-surface temperature data over the land and oceans of both hemispheres have been combined by P.D. Jones and his team (Jones et al., 1986) at East Anglia University to produce the ®rst comprehensive estimates of the northern hemisphere's mean temperature TH(t). His carefully scrutinized data\nmake possible the application of the present model to this extensive climatic measure. Table 3 gives summarily the TH(t) record drawn from Appendix 4.\nAs seen in Fig. 7, hemispheric temperature advanced only little during the second half of the nineteenth century, increased markedly from 1910 to 1940, remained relatively steady in 1950±1975, and assumed a\nrapid track from then on.

    "heading": "4 The seismic connection",
    "text": "The possibility of extraterrestrial (planetary) connection for terrestrial seismism has been considered by research workers in the past (Gribbin and Plagemann, 1974; Lomnitz, 1994) by invoking the combined gravity attraction of the sun's planetary system on the lithosphere as the quake trigger mechanism. It is of course a straightforward matter to compute the intensity of this force by applying Newton's equation of gravity and, through it, obtain the ¯uctuations of the force over the 1700±2100 span. The outcome is a regularly ¯uctuating function of time with peaks about 10 years apart, a regularity not found in the seismic record and, therefore, not supporting the planetary connection view.\nThe possibility of a relationship between earthquakes and solar activity per se has been discussed previously by various authors (Sytinski, 1963; Simpson, 1967; Singh, 1976). Simpson, for example, used the sunspot numbers, and the solar radio¯ux in combination with geomagnetic activity as indicators, and concluded that a signi®cant role is played by solar activity in the triggering of earthquakes. Singh opines that whatever mechanism of energy-coupling seems to be working, the magnitude of such energy seems to be very small and, therefore, any contribution of the solar activity to seismic events should be more pronounced and more easily discernible in the case of very small energy seismic events, called microearthquakes. He then proceeds to conduct a small experimental research which leads him to conclude ``that the solar activity is by no means an exclusive factor in the timing of microearthquakes''. In what follows, the case of severe earthquakes is investigated. For this, the question of a solar `connection' will be probed using actual quake data for which the case of the California area (CA) is particularly interesting; it accounts for more than eighty percent of all seismic activity in the contiguous United States.\nExact countrywide seismological information amassed in a systematic and consistent way has been available in the United States only from the beginning of the current century; this is because of the fact that in the\nearly days much of the country was sparsely settled and seismographic stations relatively few or nonexistent.\nWe may begin by setting up, for a particular territory and year t, an annual index of seismicity Q t de®ned as the sum of the year's n quakes whose magnitudes are qi > 5, or intensities qi > VI):\nQ t Xn 1 qi;\nqi > 5 or VI:\n16\nFrom this, the long-term seismicity index is derived as\nQ11 t 1 11 Xt tÿ10 Q t : 17\nThe quake magnitude limit of 5 units set for Eq. (16) re¯ects the fact that small (unbounded) earthquakes triggered within the seismogenic zone of the earth's crust exhibit frequency/magnitude distributions di erent from those of large (bounded) earthquakes occurring past the down-dip width of that zone (Pachaco et al., 1992). It is the second kind of disturbance that the lower magnitude limit of 5 singles out. While the platetectonics phenomena causing the occurrence of an earthquake in a given locale are today fairly well understood, very little is known about any patterning in their timing and frequency of occurrence. In the context of the present search, we may check for one in a solar `connection':\nQ11 t f z11 t : 18 For the California area the U.S. Government Reports cited in the references contain all the factual information presently known about the subject, excluding the mathematics of its physical mechanism. They include tabular listing of earthquake date, location, magnitude, and intensity. To quote from that source:\nmagnitude is a logarithmic measure of the energy released as seismic waves at the focus of an earthquake. Although such a scale has neither ``top'' nor ``bottom'' values, the highest earthquake magnitude known to have been calculated is about 9.5 units on a Richter scale and the lowest about )3.0. On the other hand, the term intensity represents a measure assigned subjectively based on a quake's e ects upon: (1) people (i.e., the number of persons noticing, a ected, frightened, panicked, etc), (2) e ects on manmade structures (chimneys, walls, etc), and (3) e ects on the Earth's surface (landslides, faultings, etc). Intensity therefore is more of a subjective tool resorted to when lack of instrumentation prevents the objective magnitude computation. The quantitative relationship between the two measures has been computed based on quake cases where both were available.\nBecause in the data sources used magnitudes are very often given in di ering scales ML;Ms;MLa;MLs , or are unavailable while intensities are, the latter will be used in our analysis and introduced in the equations not as Roman numerals but as their decimal equivalents. For\nthe western United States, where the CA area lies, the suggested magnitude/intensity relationship (U.S. Government, item 1, p. 4) is given in the tabulation below:\nintensity magnitude intensity magnitude V <5:0 IX 6:5 VI 5:0 X 7:0 VII 5:5 XI 7:5 VIII 6:0 XII 8:0 :\nAppendix 5 contains the Q t data (in intensity units), while both Q t and Q11 t over the 1880±1989 period are seen in Fig. 9. Using this record Q11(t) was set as the simplest form of Eq. (18), namely:\nQ11 t a z11 t c ; 19 application of linear regression and probing its residual suggested the presence of the second subharmonic of the sunspot number z t . Hence, the processes were repeated using:\nQ11 t a z11 t m1 sin 2p 22 t\nm2 cos 2p 22 t\nc :\n20 The residual of this regression in turn revealed a de®nite patterning p(t) with a 50-year repetition rate, which after a moderated ®ltering:\np t 0:25p t ÿ 1 0; 50p t 0:25p t 1 ; 21 is listed in Table 4 and pictured in Fig. 10; this term added to the right-hand member of Eq. (20) as bp(t), contributed to the model regression as seen by:\na 0:659 0:015 ; b 1:074 0:071 ; m1 1:643 0:435 ; m2 3:706 0:431 ; c ÿ7:859; R2 0:960; t0 1890 :\n22\nFigure. 10 shows p t superimposed upon the original p t from which it was derived. It also shows Q11 t and its model counterpart Q11 t supporting the assumption of solar connection, albeit lacking the identi®cation of p t . The present state of the art in understanding the mechanics of the stick-and-slip process taking place at the boundary between the North American and Eastern Paci®c tectonic plates on which California lies is part of the problem (Zielinski et al., 1994). In the mean time, the autocorrelogram of the residual of the preceding regression, seen in Fig. 11 reveals the presence of the 8-year periodicity found in Dz11 t , Eq. (52) Part I. This provides the means of projecting p t , which, along with the projection of z11 t also found in Part I, make possible a good estimate of Q11 t during the 1995±2005 span seen in Fig. 12. It points to a moderate upswing in the mid-1990s, to be followed by a period of subsiding seismic activity.\nBesides the seismicity index, a separate modeling of the series of the annual strongest quake qmax t would have been of value; but, unfortunately, no deterministic measure can be found in the data. Instead, the distribution P qmax of the 1880±1990 period may be seen in Fig. 13 and in Table 5, with the most probable maximum value being 5.5 Richter units. The expected upper and lower probability limits for the frequency distribution of quake magnitudes 5 or greater were derived by ®tting a separate decaying exponential through the\npeaks and valleys of the P qmax data (R2 0.99 for the peaks and 0.94 for the valleys).\nOf interest in terms of teleconnection is the similarity of time paths between the p t factor of the California earthquakes Q11 t and the Kolmogorov term of the northern hemisphere temperature TH11 t ÿ 20 , 20 years earlier, both of them normalized. It is shown in Fig. 13, after TH11 t 's Kolmogorov part was subjected to the same moderate smoothing:\ny t 0:25 y t ÿ 1 0:5 y t 0:25 y t 1 24 that had been applied to p t ."

    "heading": "5 The volcanic connection",
    "text": "Volcanic activity throughout the globe is the result of crustal thermal and mechanical changes powered by the energy stored in the planet's core. However, important as volcanism is, its record is fragmentary, uncertain, and scattered, in spite of the fact that volcanos provide some of the most awesome and spectacular examples of natural change on earth. References (Simkin et al., 1981) and (McClelland et al., 1989) are the main source of data presently available. Besides eruption time and duration from which the number N t of active volcanos during a given year t is determined, these two sources also give the so-called Explosivity Index through which the magnitude of each eruption is quanti®ed. This measure\ncombines total volume of products, descriptive terms of deposits, eruptive cloud height, and other measures, to yield a simple 0-to-8 index of increasing explosivity. However, the reported size, or bigness, of\nhistoric eruptions depends very much on the experience and vantage point of the observer. It is easy, therefore, to understand why one observer's `major' eruption might be another's `moderate', or even `small' event (Simkin et al., 1981, p. 20)\nFor the purposes of the present research therefore, not the ambiguous explosivity index but the number of yearly explosions N t will be used, corrected on the basis of the so-called Reporting Index (Simkin et al., 1981, p. 23) which we may designate by R t . The index is de®ned as the number of volcanos active during a given decade as a percentage of the number of volcanos known at the start of the decade. As shown in Fig. 14, line A (replicated from Simkin et al., 1981) the time history of volcanism over the last 600 years exhibits three plateaux, of which the last one (1838±present) is virtually a constant r t 33 and is preceded by a practically linear transitory phase, line B, with the year 1622 being the line's time-axis intercept. Thus, the timefunction for R t will be:\nR t ÿ 0:141 t ÿ 1622 ; 1622 t 1838, 33 ; t > 1838.\n25\nHence, the surrogate of volcanic activity on the basis of which the possibility of a solar `connection' will be explored is the quantity:\nV t N t R t ; t 1800 ; 26\nwhich we choose to name the Index of Volcanism. Appendix 6 lists the V t series. Following Simkin's lead, a long-term average of V t will be examined as the representative of the case: as such we choose the 11-year running average V11 and its rate of change DV11:\nV11 t 1 11 X11 i V i ;\nDV11 t V11 t ÿ V11 t ÿ 1 : 27\nFigure 15 shows the course of the index since 1800. Since at the present time no clues exist in the\nliterature as to possible long-term time patterns for\nV11 t , our search began by ®rst making the secular trend TV t of V11 t function of the long-term Tz t of z11 t (see Part I):\nTV t a Tz t k; a 0:000089 k 3:3092 0:0693 R2 0:945\n28\n1800 t 1985 : Since in Part I it was found that Tz t peaks in the year 2100 at the level Tzmax 60:8, it follows that TVmax a Tzmax k 65:0 : 29 On the other hand, to ®nd TVmin, the quadratic approximation was used over the 1800±1885 span of V11 t yielding an R2 0.915 and TVmin 19:1 : 30 With the upper and lower limits of TV t now known, use of Eq. (2), Part I, can be tried in search of a V11 versus z11 t connection. From that equation one derives:\nC t ln 1=TVmin ÿ 1=TVmax 1=V11 t ÿ 1=TVmax ; 31\nwhere\nC t c t dt ; and therefore\nc t C t ÿ C t ÿ 1 : 32 Subjecting V11 t ÿ TV11 t to the autocorrelation operation yields the function shown in Fig. 16, which reveals two things:\n1. a strong delta-function representing a random component,\n2. a component with a periodicity of 22 years, suggesting again the periodicity of the polarity of the magnetic ®eld in the sunspot number z t .\nBy multiplying the z t values of every other z t cycle by )1 and naming the new series zz t , the polarity factor was incorporated in the sunspot series. Comparison of c t to DV11 t , as seen in Fig. 17, shows a marked agreement between the two, but two di erences:\n1. an 11-year ®xed time-delay of DV11 behind zz t over the interval 1825±1883, which is roughly that of the upper part of surge Sxx, 2. a 5.5-year ®xed time-delay of DV11 behind zz t from the year 1936 on, which is the beginning of the upper part of surge Sxxx.\nBy upper part we mean the positive segment of the normalized surge function Sxx or Sxxx.\nFigure 18 shows the extent of the agreement after these time-lags were incorporated in zz(t), changing it to zz t . For lack of a better term, we are going to refer to zz t from now on as the `groomed ' zz t . The high degree of coherence between the solar and the volcanic is best demonstrated by the two curves in Fig. 19, of which A is the autocorrelogram of zz t and B the crosscorrelogram of zz t with DV 11 t . Both correlations were computed over the 1800±1985 time-span. Under these circumstances the possibility of a solar-terrestrial\n`connection' in this case cannot be ruled out. The two nonlinearities were brought to bear upon C t in the following manner:\nC t a Dzz t j jm *sign jDzz t j b Dzz t c ; 33 for which iterative linear regression produced:\na 0:218 0:017 ; b ÿ0:040 0:039 ; c 0:144; m 2; R2 0:898 :\n34\nThe outcome is pictured in Fig. 20, foretelling the relative volcanic activity quiescence of the early-to-mid 1990s and a new upswing as the year 2000 approaches.\nTwo points of interest emerge from this analysis: ®rst, the time-delay between the terrestrial and the solar occurring at the peaking of the long-term solar activity; and second, the fact that of the eight most violent eruptions of the last two hundred years (Angel and Korshover, 1985; Zielinski et al., 1994):\nTambora 1815 Coseguina 1835 Krakatoa 1883 Santa Maria 1902 Katmai 1912 Agung 1963 El Chichon 1982 Pinatubo 1991\nfour occurred at the very bottom of the V11 undulations, and three at a peak."

    "heading": "6 A tree-ring connection",
    "text": "Tree-ring research has a long and extensive tradition in physical science, and a wealth of ®ndings revealing details of past climates over far-¯ung parts of the world. The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research of the University of Arizona at Tucson clearly stands out in this realm of scienti®c research. Of the voluminous record of studies compiled there, and elsewhere, we choose to present one that strongly suggests a long-term connection between things terrestrial and solar, and this over the last three centuries. According to Lamb (1973, p 449), a general turn toward colder climates from 1200± 1400 AD onward seems to have produced a worldwide cold stage lasting well into the 17th century. This stage was widely known in Europe of the late Middle Ages as the climatic worsening (Klima-Verschlechterung). Tree growth, and therefore tree-ring record, seems to bear witness to this cooling and to the recovery that followed it, beginning with the early 1700s.\nThere are many studies documenting the fact that, in addition to climate, tree-ring growth is very much dependent on local conditions of soil composition, human activity interference, and the prevailing atmospheric composition (see for instance, McLaughlin and Tjoelker, 1992, 1993; McLaughlin et al., 1994; McLaughlin and Downing, 1995; also, Francey and Farquhar 1982; Andersen et al., 1991). Consequently, data normalization is necessary when comparing cases. In what follows, the data of two sets of oak-tree ring\nmeasurements are grouped into one body of data in order to widen the time-span covered, namely: (1) in a study by Hollstein (1965) tree-ring widths of oak west of the Rhine near Trier, 1350±1700, were measured; (2) in a study by Libby and Pandolti (1974) the anomaly of the oxygen isotope ratio 18O/16O was measured in the treering dated wood of oak trees in two areas of Germany, Marburg (®ve trees) and Spessart (two trees), and a 30-year running average was computed over the 1750± 1960 time-interval. Each set of data was normalized to its own average and standard deviation, and the composite tree-ring set TR t , seen in Table 6 and Fig. 21, was structured from (1) the Rhine data over 1350±1700, (2) the (Rhine+Marburg)/2 data over 1700± 1750, and (3) the Marburg data over 1750±1960. Included for comparison in this ®gure is the normalized z11 t curve. It is interesting to note that z11 t is shown lagging behind TR t , a fact con®rmed by Fig. 22, which pictures the correlation functions TR TR and TR z11, and pinpoints the length of the lag to between 30 and 40 years. The explanation for this lag is found in Eddy (1976), based on the past abundance of terrestrial 14C: carbon and its radioactive isotopes are abundant constituents of the earth's atmosphere as CO2; given that when the latter is assimilated into trees the carbon isotope 14C undergoes spontaneous disintegration at well-known rates, it is possible to determine the date of life of the carbon-bearing tree wood. Thus, the 14C curve is a fair representation of the overall envelope of the sunspot curve and of real changes in solar behavior in the distant past before the time of telescopic examination of the sun. According to Eddy (1976, p. 1896):\nthe 14C indications will tend to lag behind the real solar changes by periods of 10 to 50 years, because of the ®nite time of exchange between the atmosphere and the trees."

    "text": "Of particular interest is the fact that the lowest part of TR t coincides with the Maunder Minimum (1645± 1715), during which sunspot activity had ceased to exist. Following these observations, it becomes tempting to reverse the roles of TR t and z11 t and apply the Kolmogorov algorithm to the case in order to provide a glimpse into z11 t 's past. The algorithm produces the transfer function:\ni w i i w i (years) years ÿ90 ÿ0:015 ÿ40 0:141 ÿ80 0:207 ÿ30 0:282 ÿ70 ÿ0:170 ÿ20 0:070 ÿ60 ÿ0:227 ÿ10 0:192 ÿ50 0:116 0 ÿ0:327 ;\n35\nwith the ®nal outcome given in Fig. 23 diagramming the long-term course of z11(t) before the invention of the telescope.

    "heading": "7 Conclusions",
    "text": "A diversi®ed group of terrestrial phenomena has been examined in the context of a possible match between their historical record and the record of a surrogate of long-term solar activity. For lack of scienti®c knowledge on any causality connecting the two, only the morphology of the possible liaison was extracted. Based on both the rationale and the actual results of this analysis, it can be stated that:\n1. In a number of important geophysical phenomena involving the earth's atmosphere and geosphere a solar-terrestrial connection does exist. 2. The proposed surrogate z11 of long-term solar activity does make for a quantitative intermediary of solarterrestrial connections. 3. The mathematical modeling of z11 itself does provide a tool of projecting geophysical processes.\n4. The Kolmogorov algorithm of time-signal analysis can diagram the time course of geophysical processes, though their physical mechanism is presently unknown, and can e ect their projection.\n5. In all the connection cases examined, incommensurate frequencies do appear, pointing to process nonlinearity.\n6. Most always one of these frequencies is that of the magnetic polarity of the sunspot cycle, i.e., 22 years.\n7. Finally, such anthropogenic factors as CO2 and SO2 do exert important forcing upon climate.\nFor all these occurrences, although `connection' does not necessarily imply causality, it does indicate synchronization (Friis-Christensen and Lassen, 1991), the degree of which can be judged by the degree of similarity between the autocorrelation function z11 z11 of the solar member z11, and the cross-correlation function X11 z11 between solar z11 and terrestrial X11. By the same token, lack of such coherence renders a connection between X11 and z11 doubtful.\nFinally, the tree-ring case raises the possibility of a causal factor external to the known solar system and leading the postulated solar surrogate z11 t itself.\nWe would like to end this essay by invoking the observations of D.E. Walker of the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology, who begins a recent paper of his as follows:\nIn 1988, evidence showed a connection between the ®ve extreme lows of the Southern Oscillation Index from 1964 through 1987 and episodic seismic activity along the East Paci®c Rise from 20°S to 40°S, an area that contains one of the earth's most rapidly spreading ridge systems. Observed coincidences are often the basis for discovery, and reviewing the available data leads us to note several. Two distinct phenomena ± El Ninos and earthquake swarms ± seem to occur almost simultaneously in spite of their irregular recurrence rates and durations. (Walker, 1995).\nAs a footnote, it should be pointed out that the purpose of the numerous Appendices included in this essay is the hope that other investigators specializing in particular topics would use them either to extend or refute the thesis advocated in this study.\nAppendix 1a Southern Oscillation Index (seasonal)\nyear win DJF\nsum JJA\nspr MAM aut SON\nyear win DJF\nsum JJA\nspr MAM aut

  "abstractText": "The research task described herein aims at the structuring of an analytical tool that traces the time course of geophysical phenomena, regional or global, and compares it to the course of long-term solar conditions, long-term meaning decades or a few centuries. The model is based on the premise that since in a last analysis the preponderance of atmospheric, hydrospheric, and, possibly, some aspects of geospheric phenomena are, or have been, powered by energy issuing from the sun ± either now or in the past ± the long-term behavior of such phenomena is ultimately ``connected'' to long-term changes occurring in the sun itself. Accordingly, the proposed research ®rstly derives and models a stable surrogate pattern for the long-term solar activity, secondly introduces a transfer-function algorithm for modeling the connection between the surrogate and terrestrial phenomena viewed as partners in the connection, and thirdly probes the connection outcome for episodic or unanticipated eects that may arise due to the fact that in the present context, the connection, should it exist, is very likely nonlinear. Part I of the study presents the theory of the concept, while Part II demonstrates the concept's pertinence to a number of terrestrial phenomena.",
