    "text": "The evolution of organisms during the Phanerozoic was irregular with their biodiversity experiencing growths and declines (Fig. 1). Climatic oscillations (warming and cooling periods), eustatic sea-level fluctuations (regressions and transgressions), development of oxygen-deficient or oxygen-free (anoxic) conditions in seas and oceans, impact events (collision of the earth with large astronomical bodies), powerful volcanic eruptions, and tectonic movements are usually thought to be among the main abiotic factors responsible for significant reorganizations and mass extinctions of the oceanic biota. These events and the related changes in the habitat conditions of the organisms are either interrelated or independent from each other. The factors that negatively influence the biota evolution and cause mass extinctions of organisms or substantial reorganization of ecosystems attract the particular attention of researchers.\nThe Mesozoic Era was marked by large tectonic, paleogeographic, and climatic changes. By its beginning, the continents were united into the Pangea supercontinent surrounded by the Panthalassa Superocean, which extended from one pole to the other over 300 °\nof longitude. According to the reconstructions available, the circulation system consisted of two main gyres in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, respectively, and equatorial currents that encircled 85% of the earth’s circumference. The temperature gradients between the poles and the equator were probably insignificant, which determined the sluggish meridional circulation. The climatic zonation was represented by tropical and bipolar temperate belts.\nThe Pangea breakup with the separation of Laurasia and Gondwana resulted in the formation of the intervenient Tethys Ocean and the transformation of the equatorial current into a circum-planetary one. The Jurassic sediments that are now preserved only in small areas of the oceanic bottom indicate sedimentation similar to the present-day one in lower latitudes with calcareous and siliceous oozes (chalk, limestones, and cherts). At the initial stage of its evolution, the Atlantic Ocean was represented by several shallow-water basins poorly connected with each other and with the World Ocean.\nA modeling of the ëé\n2 concentration in the atmosphere [20] shows that, during the Mesozoic, it became an order of magnitude lower. This resulted in an average annual temperature decrease by 5.4°ë\nduring the period from the Middle–Late Triassic to the Early– Middle Jurassic.\nThe general successive biodiversity growth throughout the Phanerozoic was intermittently interrupted by its reduction due to the partial extinctions of selected taxa. Five particularly catastrophic extinctions are usually considered as events of mass extinctions. Mass extinctions are determined as significant events when at least 10% of the families or at least 40% of the species disappear during short periods [13]. When subsidiary small extinction episodes are taken into consideration, their integral quantity approximates 30 [1, 4].\nThe Mesozoic Era (251 to 65 My B.P.) commenced after the great mass extinction at the Permian–Triassic boundary and terminated with an equally great mass extinction at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (Fig. 1). (Hereinafter, the geochronology is given according to the scale recommended by the International Geological Congress in 2004 [25]). An additional Mesozoic mass\n—An analysis of the biota evolution during the Mesozoic in response to abiotic factors shows that the most important among them are the climate, sea-level position, dynamics and structure of the water column, its chemistry, volcanism, tectonics (horizontal and vertical movements of lithospheric blocks), and collision of the earth with astronomical bodies (impact events). Stable conditions and a variety of ecological niches promoted the growth in the biodiversity. Their changes that resulted in mass extinctions of organisms stimulated evolution. The analysis of the materials available leads to one of the most important inferences that all the terrestrial processes, the biospheric included, develop in close and continuous relation with the extraterrestrial processes that occur beyond the solar system in the space to which our planet belongs.\nDOI: 10.1134/S0001437008040097\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nEVOLUTION OF THE MESOZOIC OCEANIC BIOTA 539\nextinction occurred at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. All these events resulted in substantial renewals of biological communities.\nThe influence of abiotic factors on the development of the biota during the mass extinction of organisms and the subsequent recovery of the biodiversity is particularly distinct. The mass extinction in the terminal Permian was the most catastrophic in the earth’s history. Cardinal changes in the communities marked this event as the boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. According to different estimates, 75–96% of all the species became extinct at that time. The combination of abiotic factors that resulted in this global catastrophe and their interrelations are briefly discussed in [2]. Long-living forms of a wide geographic distribution best adapted to different habitat environments most easily survived the Late Permian crisis. Their evolution and diversification gave rise to the rich Mesozoic organic world.\nK/T—Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary; Cen/Tur—Cenomanian–Turonian boundary; Apt/Alb—Aptian–Albian boundary; Th— Tithonian; Cel/Oxf—Callovian–Oxfordian boundary; Plb/Toa—Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary; Rht—Rhaetian; P/Tr—Permian–Triassic boundary.\n540\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nBARASH"

    "text": "The Triassic Period (251 to 199.6 My B.P.) was marked by recovery and development of the oceanic biota. The diversity of the marine communities in the initial Triassic (Scythian Age, 251 to 245 My B.P.) was, however, insignificant: four bivalve genera, not numerous microscopic gastropods, and cosmopolitan echinoderms. Fossil remains of diverse benthic gastropods, bivalves, brachiopods, bryozoans, sponges, and calcareous algae taxa are missing from the sediments and appear again higher in the sections (Lasarus taxa). This indicates that only some of their representatives survived the period of unfavorable conditions. No reef buildups developed and no biogenic siliceous sediments (future cherts) accumulated during the period of 7–8 My. At the same time, nekton recovered quite rapidly.\nIn the subsequent Anisian Age (245 to 237 My B.P.) of the Middle Triassic, the restored favorable near-bottom conditions promoted the development of most of the Lasarus taxa: marine reptilians, foraminifers, and scleractinian corals. The algal–bryozoan reefs appeared again. Only in the Ladinian Age (237 to 228 My B.P.) and later did radiation of bivalves, brachiopods, and bryozoans start again from subsidiary philetic lineages."

    "heading": "Mass Extinction in the Terminal Triassic",
    "text": "The terminal Triassic was marked by one of the five great Phanerozoic mass extinctions, which affected both marine and terrestrial communities. In total, 48% of the invertebrate genera became extinct: mainly cephalopods, bivalves, gastropods, and brachiopods [65]. At least six ammonite families disappeared at the Triassic– Jurassic boundary, while only one family survived the\ncrisis [26] (Fig. 2). Almost half of the bivalve taxa died off, primarily endemic and deep-water and, to a lesser extent, cosmopolitan forms. At the end of the Triassic, many reef-building organisms such as sclearctinian corals and sponges became extinct: 50 genera died off, while 11 genera survived. In the Rhaetian Age, 41% of all meso- and macrobentic genera disappeared [42]. Many conodont, brachiopod, and gastropod taxa that dominated among the Paleozoic communities and survived the catastrophic terminal Permian crisis became extinct as well.\nMeanwhile, the mass extinction in the Late Triassic was not a one-time event. Presumably, instant extinctions of ammonoids, brachiopods, and conodonts were more prolonged when detailed stratigraphic data are taken into consideration. Four separate events with a successive increase in the extinction rate are distinguished: in the Middle and Late Triassic, terminal Norian Age (216.5 to 203.6 My B.P.), and terminal Rhaetian Age (approximately 200 My B.P.) [49]. Thus, the extinction lasted approximately 16 My. Marine reptilians suffered this event earlier in the terminal Ladinian Age (237 to 228 My B.P.). Radiolarians experienced a substantial evolutionary reorganization at the end of the Triassic.\nFour main factors are used to explain the mass extinctions of organisms in the terminal Triassic: climate, volcanism, impact event (asteroid fall), and sealevel fluctuations with associated anoxia [27]. It is thought that, during both the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the climate was warm. In the Late Triassic, greenhouse conditions spread over the entire earth. This was the only period of the Phanerozoic that left no evidence of any glacial activity. Nevertheless, some data point to temperature oscillations at the transition\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nEVOLUTION OF THE MESOZOIC OCEANIC BIOTA 541\nbetween these epochs [43]. According to one of the hypotheses, the initial global warming phase corresponding to the Late Triassic extinction event resulted in dissociation of gas hydrates in shelf seas and/or highlatitude permafrost areas; release of methane into the atmosphere; and, correspondingly, a temperature increase and greenhouse effect [14]. In the Hungarian sections, the decline in the benthic and planktonic biota at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary is accompanied by a shift of the carbon–oxygen isotopic ratio, which is interpreted as warming by 10°\nC and corresponding perturbation of the carbon cycle, probably, due to the methane release from gas hydrates [56].\nThe hypothesis according to which extinctions are related to impact events is grounded by some data as well. Several craters dated approximately at 214 My B.P. (Late Triassic, Norian Age) are established worldwide [22 and others]. These craters are the Rochechouart in France, the Manicougan and Saint Martin in Canada, the Obolon’ in Ukraine, the Red Wing in the United States, and one more near Bristol in England. In the opinion of the above authors, these impact structures were formed synchronously during a multiple impact event induced by a collision of the earth with a fragmented comet or asteroid. This event immediately preceded the period of a stepwise extinction, which commenced, as is believed [49], in the mid-Norian of the Late Triassic.\nSimms [66] reported about a 2- to 4-m-thick member of the uppermost Triassic (Raethian) deformed sediments (seismites) widespread in England. The author believes that they are indicative of the impact of a fire ball several kilometers across, which was responsible for the formation of a crater several tens of kilometers in diameter and generated seismic waves. Based on marine seismic data, its epicenter is assumed to be located on the shelf west of Ireland. The formation of seismites, geochemical anomalies, elevated iridium concentrations, and shock quartz correlate with the biota extinction event in the terminal Triassic.\nSharp sea-level fluctuations during the terminal Triassic are well substantiated by the geological data from Europe and North America. Different areas of the Northern Hemisphere demonstrate a sea-level rise in the terminal Triassic, which gave way to its global fall at the Triassic–Jurassic boundary [46]. In the early Jurassic, the large regression was rapidly replaced by a transgression. For example, the sections of the western Tethys on the Iberian Platform record a regressive– transgressive cycle approximately 12 My long that commenced in the late Triassic and terminated in the Early Jurassic [24]. It is assumed that the brief oscillations that occurred against the background of long-term sea-level fluctuations resulted in variations in the primary production and destruction of niches populated by shallow-water organisms such as conodonts and ammonites.\nThe basal Jurassic layers in Europe and North and South America are enriched in organic matter, being barren of remains of benthic organisms or containing their impoverished assemblages indicating stagnant environments. It is possible to explain the mass death of marine biota by a well-substantiated anoxia in oceanic environments, but the crisis of the terrestrial fauna and flora points to more universal factors.\nMass extinctions of organisms in the terminal Triassic are correlative with the main rifting phase of volcanism on the Pangea supercontinent, which preceded the opening of the pra-Atlantic Ocean in the Middle Jurassic [53]. These processes were accompanied by the sealevel rise and eruption of at least 3 × 10 6 km 3\nof basalts in the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) from New Scotland to Bolivia and from the southern United States to Morocco during a period <1 My long. During the Rhaetian, the proportions of the Sr and Os isotopes in seawater drastically changed, which is explained by the rapid weathering of the CAMP basalts [19]. Eruptions were presumably accompanied by degassing of basalts and release of significant quantities of ëé\n2\nand SO\n2 , which could influence the composition of the atmosphere and ocean. In this case, tectonics was the primary factor responsible for the biotic crisis.\nThe substantial variations in the carbon isotope ratios in carbonates and organic matter confirm significant changes in the global carbon cycle at the transition between the periods under consideration [69]. The notable negative carbon isotope shift determined in marine carbonates, organic matter, and terrestrial wood is explained by the release of significant ë H\n4 volumes from gas hydrates contained in marine sediments into the atmosphere due to the degassing of volcanogenic carbon dioxide. By the beginning of the Jurassic, oxidation of methane should have additionally increased the pCO\n2\nin the atmosphere up to >2500 ppmv [11].\nModeling shows the possibility of a harmful influence of rapidly released ëé\n2 into the atmosphere in the terminal Triassic on the marine and terrestrial biotas [32]. The wind-induced circulation and meridional water exchange in the ocean should have decreased fourfold and strengthened the stratification in the latter. The temperature rise should decrease the solubility of oxygen; reduce its content in the water column; and, thus, stimulate development of anoxia in the ocean. Marine biota was deprived of oxygen. The variations in the orbital Milankovitch parameters should have strengthened the stress conditions for the biota."

The initial Jurassic evolution of marine biota at the species level is well studied based on the\n542\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nBARASH\nsections from northwestern Europe. It was established that the mass extinction in the terminal Triassic was followed by a rapid recovery of several marine invertebrate groups during the Hettangian Age (199.6 to 196.5 My B.P.) and a more decelerated diversification that lasted up to the end of the Pliensbachian Age (189.6 to 183 My B.P.). In the early Toarcian Age, the biodiversity became sharply reduced again."

    "heading": "Biotic Crisis at the Pliensbachian–Toarcian Boundary",
    "text": "This crisis occurred (approximately 183 My B.P.) and resulted in the disappearance of most bivalve species (84%) and changes in the brachiopod fauna (the last spiriferids disappeared). Ostracodes suffered the strongest extinction for the entire Paleozoic. Many belemnite and ammonite species died off as well (Fig. 3). The extinction affected both benthos and nektobenthos [27]. In the early Toarcian, 72% of radiolarians disappeared from the sections of western North America. The mass reduction of biodiversity in the terminal Pliensbachian– initial Toarcian affected the entire marine biota on a global scale [57].\nIn the Jurassic sections of the northwestern Caucasuses, the species diversity of planktonic foraminifers at the Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary decreased by 55% [61]. These authors believe that the regional regression in the terminal Pliensbachian was responsible for the disappearance of all the taxa, while the early Toarcian transgression brought immigrants from neighboring basins.\nThe geochemical and oxygen isotope analyses of belemnite rostra from the Lower Jurassic sediments of northern Spain revealed paeoceanological changes during the Pliensbachian–Toarcian [60]. The period of a relatively uniform and warm climate in the early Pliensbachian was followed by a sharp water temperature fall in the late Pliensbachian–early Toarcian. The early Toarcian anoxic event in this region located at the junction of the Boreal and Tethyan bioprovinces is reflected in the variations of the δ 18 é\nand Mg/Ca values. The crisis nature is evident from the wide distribution of laminated slate shales enriched in organic matter in corresponding European sections. In the Apennines, these black shales are characterized by negative δ 13 ë\nshifts in organic matter ( 5–6 ‰) and carbonates ( 2–3\n‰) [62]. The Fe/S ratio values, pyritization, and enrichment of the sediments with heavy metals confirm the existence of oxygen-deficient or anoxic conditions and the development of free H\n2 S in the water column. Similar paleontological and lithological signatures are registered at the Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary in the sections from Chile and Argentina [7], as well as in the deep-sea sediments off Japan. Thus, the mass extinction in question related to the sea-level rise and anoxia development involved both epicontinental areas and deep basins on the global scale.\nBy the beginning of the Middle Jurassic, the marine biota gradually recovered due to the colonization of free ecological niches by immigrants and diversification of the groups that survived the crisis. The tropical climate, high ëé\n2 concentrations in the atmosphere, and shallow-water settings were favorable for the accumulation of biogenic carbonate in epicontinental seas of West Europe during the Jurassic. It was intermittently interrupted by deposition of shales."

    "heading": "Biotic Crisis at the Callovian–Oxfordian Boundary",
    "text": "This crisis (approximately 161 My B.P.) (= the Middle–Upper Jurassic boundary) is reflected in one of the most drastic reductions in the carbonate bioproductivity. The hypotheses of eustatic sea-level fluctuations, volcanism, impact events, and other phenomena were proposed for its explanation. Contrary to the traditional concepts of a uniformly warm climate in the Jurassic Period, recent studies revealed biogeographic and geochemical evidence for substantial climatic fluctuations. They are evident from the paleobiogeography of ammonites and coral reefs, as well as from the distribution of corresponding lithofacies in northern and central Europe, the Mediterranean, eastern Africa, and Central Asia [16]. The carbonate accumulation crisis is reflected in the lack of reefal formations and the wide distribution of stratigraphic gaps. It corresponded to cooling, which lasted 1 My. By the middle Oxfordian, cooling gave way to warming to provide greenhouse environments, which is evident from the biostratigraphic (mainly, the distribution of coral reefs) and geochemical data. Carbonate deposition resumed in the European Platform and accumulation of radiolarites was maximal in the Mediterranean Tethys. This reflects the development of latitudinal belts, which are also observable in the late Oxfordian–early Kimmeridgian.\nThe oxygen isotope studies of shark teeth reveal a significant cooling at the Callovian–Oxfordian boundary in the Northern Hemisphere. This cooling provoked southward migration of marine invertebrates, ammonites included [21]. In the terminal Middle Jurassic, boreal ammonites migrated southward by 15–30 °\n. The amplitude of the temperature fall in the temperate latitudes is estimated to be 1–3 °\nC. This cooling immediately followed the wide distribution of C\norg -rich marine sediments at the middle–late Callovian boundary (northwestern Europe, Central Atlantic, and Arabian Peninsula). The authors explain the climatic deterioration by the reduced CO\n2 concentration in the atmosphere due to the mass burial of organic carbon in the sediments.\nThe development of oceanic anoxia, the cessation of carbonate accumulation at the beginning of the middle Callovian, the subsequent aridity increase in the early Oxfordian, and the restoration of conditions favorable for biogenic carbonate accumulation are also confirmed by the studies of molecular biomarkers [30].\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nEVOLUTION OF THE MESOZOIC OCEANIC BIOTA 543\nThe early–middle Oxfordian transition was marked by important changes in the climate and oceanic circulation. In the European sections of the Tethyan sediments (Switzerland, France), this is evidenced by isotopic and sedimentological records [48]. Low-carbonate and C\norg -rich sediments in these sections are replaced by high-carbonate facies. The climatic and oceanological conditions were favorable for the development of calcareous nannoplankton, which became one of the main rock-forming components."

    "heading": "The Biotic Crisis in the Tithonian Age of the Terminal Jurassic",
    "text": "It occurred from 150.8 to 145.5 My B.P. and was particularly harmful for most diverse groups of organisms, bivalves included. According to some estimates [12], 5.1–6.1% of the families of marine organisms disappeared at that time. The biota reorganization at the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary was particularly distinct at the species level and mainly affected shallow-water communities. In the Crimea and Caucasus, 102 bivalve species disappeared, while only six species crossed the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary. In eastern England, 50 out of 63 species became extinct [27]. This extinction event is correlative with the transgression, which involved epicontinental seas of Europe. No notable reorganization is observed in South America and Japan. In the terminal Jurassic–initial Cretaceous (Tithonian– Berriasian), the latitudinal biogeographic differentiation close to the present-day one became outlined [21]. The most significant difference is observed between the subpolar and subtropical assemblages.\nThe paleooceanological changes that occurred at the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary strongly influenced the development of calcareous nannoplankton: both a substantial increase in the carbonate accumulation and rapid diversification of calcareous nannofossils are registered in the Central Atlantic [15]. Almost all the longnecked plesiosaurs ( Muraenosaurus, Cryptocleidida\n) became extinct at that time [10].\nThus, the Jurassic–Cretaceous transition in the paleontological record is marked by a notable biotic reorganization and biodiversity reduction mainly on a regional scale and shows no mass extinction of organisms. The main factor responsible for this event was primarily tectonic: the opening of the North Atlantic determined by the motion of lithospheric plates. The established water exchange between the Tethyan and Boreal basins undoubtedly influenced the hydrodynamical processes, climate, development of the biota, and formation of its biogeographic assemblages. The epicontinental seas of Europe were affected by a regression.\nVolcanic activity approximately 144 My B.P. was characteristic of the present-day Sudan region.\nAt least one significant impact event occurred at that time. Near Morokweng in the Kalahari Desert, the\ngravimetric and magnitometric studies revealed a buried crater at least 70 km wide left by an asteroid 5–10 km across. Its age (145 ±\n0.8 Ma) corresponds to the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary [51]."

    "heading": "CRETACEOUS PERIOD",
    "text": "In the Cretaceous, paleooceanologic environments were uniform with warm waters and low gradients. The sluggish circulation and strong haline stratification sometimes resulted in an oxygen deficiency in the nearbottom waters and burial of large volumes of organic matter in the sediments. The paleotemperatures in the Middle Cretaceous were higher as compared with their present-day values. Chumakov [6] believes that climatic changes in a warm biosphere were less harmful for the biota than in a cold one. Nevertheless, the coincidence of some climatic and biotic events implies cause-and-effect relations between them.\nThe Cretaceous ocean was characterized by an intense development of planktonic organisms with both calcareous and siliceous skeletons: planktonic foraminifers, coccolithophorids, diatoms, and radiolarians. Diatoms and silicoflagellates, whose siliceous skeletons became the most important component of biogenic sediments, appeared in the Late Cretaceous. Intense development of diatoms continues up to the present. The diversity of planktonic foraminifers, which was as low as 10 species in the Jurassic, grew through the Late Cretaceous to reach 60 species in the Campanian Age [5].\nThe rapid diversification and abundance of several groups of oceanic microplankton during the Cretaceous is usually explained by several factors. The Cretaceous corresponded to the development of several new oceanic basins such as the North and South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. This resulted in the isolation of the previously closely associated communities and their evolutionary radiation against the favorable background of warm stable climatic conditions. The strengthened stratification of the water column provided additional ecological niches. The high sea-level stand characteristic of the entire Cretaceous Period was responsible for the widening of the pelagic realm and spread of epicontinental seas, which resulted, in turn, in the increase in the potential ecological space for intense evolutionary development of microplankton.\nThe Middle Cretaceous was one of the periods in the earth’s history that were characterized by the highest sea-level stand, the maximal concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and warm climatic conditions with low latitudinal temperature gradients. The late Cenomanian was marked by a significant oceanological event, which provoked a global shift of the carbon isotope ratio in carbonates and organic matter. Significant changes in the oceanic circulation system and variations in the bioproductivity at that time resulted in\n544\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nBARASH\nthe global burial of organic matter in the sediments and affected the evolution of marine biota.\nThe Cretaceous sediments are widespread in the oceans, where they are drilled by numerous deep-sea holes. Their sections enclose several sedimentary sequences enriched in organic matter, which reflect different-age anoxic episodes. Among them, three such events are particularly distinct: the Aptian–Albian ( ~112\nMy B.P.), the terminal Cenomanian–initial Turonian ( ~93.5 My B.P.), and the Coniacian–Santonian.\nThe Cretaceous was marked by the development of the Rudista group, which were particularly abundant in the Aptian Age. At the same time, several genera died off in some tropical areas: calcareous algae and benthic foraminifers in carbonate facies of southern Europe in the late Aptian and some foraminiferal species in planktonic pelagic communities at the Aptian–Albian transition (approximately 112 My B.P.). These and others similar changes in biotic communities are not considered as mass extinction events. Despite the wide distribution of Aptian–Albian black shales in many epicontiental seas, the formation of anoxic conditions was a diachronic process and some shelf areas served as refuges to preserve ecosystems."

    "heading": "The Biotic Crisis in the Terminal Cenomanian",
    "text": "This crisis (approximately 93.5 My B.P.) is the most distinct and best studied among similar Cretaceous events. It is reflected in the extinction of 7% of the families and 26% of the genera among marine communities [29]. The Cenomanian–Turonian transition was marked by cardinal reorganization in the inoceramid populations: Inoceramus spp. were replaced by Mytiloides\nspp. The well-studied representative Cenomanian–Turonian boundary sections in West Europe and North America (Colorado, Kansas, Arizona, and others) record a stepwise extinction, which lasted the last 500 ky of the Cenomanian. The crisis initiated with the extinction of many endemic ammonite and planktonic foraminiferal taxa. Only several species of benthic filtering foraminiferal taxa survived this event. The sediments enriched in organic matter contain remains of detritophagous gastropods and representatives of several long-living bivalve genera characteristic of eutrophic environments. The diversity of ammonites decreased and the taxa that crossed the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary became poorly abundant [29]. The crisis largely affected deep-water communities of nektobenthic ammonites. At the end of the Cenomanian Age, two Rudista families died off. In the Pacific, atolls turned into guyots due to the extinction of reef-forming Rudista [63].\nThe Late Cenomanian crisis affected many deepwater organisms: for example, 29% of the benthic bathyal foraminiferal species disappeared from the sections off Japan [35]. In the North Atlantic abyssal sections, Cenomanian black shales barren of organic\nremains are replaced by lower Turonian sediments with agglutinated long-living foraminiferal taxa adapted to oxygen-deficient environments [44]. At the end of the Cenomanian, the biotic crisis also involved higher links of the trophic chain (representatives of sharks, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs). Most of the particular Cenomanian–Turonian extinction events are recorded in the warm-water realm between 60°\nof the northern and southern paleolatitudes.\nThe Cenomanian–Turonian is considered as one of the periods marked by the highest sea-level stand. In many tropical and subtropical regions, coeval marls and limestones are enriched in organic matter or contain laminated sediments indicating anoxic conditions. This period is also marked by shifts of the carbon and oxygen isotope ratios. The prolonged negative δ 18 é\ndeviation reaches a plateau near the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary to gradually increase during the remaining part of the late Cretaceous up to elevated values.\nTwo peaks in the iridium concentration up to 0.11 ppb are observed against its background values of 0.017 ppb [55]. The first of them coincides with the commencement of the extinction of several benthic groups, and the second corresponds to the significant decline in the subtropical ammonite communities. The iridium peaks are accompanied by elevated concentrations of many minor elements (V, Cr, Ni, Pt, Au). These features are observed in the sections around the Atlantic. The ratio between these elements is close to that in the basalts from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Based on these data, many authors assume that the phase of rapid ridge growth at the end of the Cenomanian resulted in elevated concentrations of these metals and a rapid eustatic sea-level rise at that time.\nIt is widely accepted that the development of anoxic conditions was responsible for the extinctions of organisms in the terminal Cenomanian. The zone of the nearbottom anoxia was of global distribution and its rise was pernicious for all the organisms populating shallower depths. The recent study of the oxygen isotope ratios in tests of benthic foraminifers from the deep-sea hole drilled at the Demerara Rise in the tropical Atlantic allowed the temperature of the bottom waters to be estimated for the Cenomanian–Turonian [23]. It was as high as 20–25°ë and reached 29°ë\nduring the anoxia episode at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary, when black shales with a very high concentration of organic matter (up to 29%) accumulated.\nIn the early Turonian, the sea level reached the highest position for the last 250 My and the dominant accumulation of shales enriched in organic matter gave way to the deposition of more carbonate sediments. The appearance of the wide water exchange between the North and South Atlantic resulted in a significant reorganization of the global oceanic circulation and, correspondingly, marine biota. The oxygen isotope study of foraminiferal tests from middle bathyal sediments of the subtropical North Atlantic and tropical Pacific\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nEVOLUTION OF THE MESOZOIC OCEANIC BIOTA 545\nreveals extremely high temperatures averaging approximately 16°C to, probably, 19°\nC. Very high surface temperatures (30–32 ° C) are determined using δ 18 é\nfor the Late Turonian on the Falkland Plateau at 58 °\nin the southern paleolatitude [31]."

    "heading": "Mass Extinction at the End of the Cretaceous Period",
    "text": "It occurred approximately 65 My B.P. At the Mesozoic–Cenozoic boundary, the earth experienced a crisis that affected all its external shells: the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. In most coeval sections, the boundary between these eras is marked by a gap. In deep-sea sections, it is characterized by sharply reduced sedimentation rates. In addition, in the areas of the outer shelf and continental slope, dominant carbonate sediments were replaced by black clays. In the central and inner shelf areas, the Mesozoic–Cenozoic boundary coincides with an unconformity. In all the sections, the carbonate content decreases. For pelagic and shelf areas, this is explained by the reduced productivity of calcareous nannoplankton and increased influx of terrigenous material due to the sea-level fall, respectively.\nThe biota extinction in the terminal Cretaceous is one of the most significant events of this kind in the\nPhanerozoic. This crisis resulted in the extinction of approximately half of the genera that existed at that time.\nFor understanding the causes responsible for the mass disappearance of organisms, it is important to estimate the rate, succession, and chronology of extinctions and the impact of harmful conditions on different ecological groups. A study of these parameters is possible only in continuous sections with high stratigraphic resolution. Such sections across the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K–T) boundary are rare. The International Stratigraphic Commission accepted the El Kef succession in the Tunisia section to represent the global boundary stratotype section (Fig. 4).\nAccording to some studies [36 and others], extinction of planktonic foraminifers in this section starts slightly above the boundary and approximately 30% of the species cross the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. In addition to planktonic foraminifers, benthic foraminifers, calcareous nannoplankton, dinoflagellates, ostracodes, pollen, and spores were also studied in this section [39, 40]. Significant changes at this boundary are observed only in foraminifers and nannofossils. The latter authors believe that, similar to as in other shelf areas, changes in shallow-water benthic foraminiferal assemblages from this section were determined by the regression in the terminal Maestrichtian and the subse-\n546\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nBARASH\nquent sea-level rise at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, which was accompanied by local rises of the oxygen minimum layer. Tropical and subtropical species with large morphologically complex tests, which populated in the late Maestrichtian well-stratified waters of the open ocean at the thermocline depths or deeper, became entirely extinct at that time. The survivors included only highly tolerant shallow-water species that dwelt in the upper photic water layer of the open ocean or were elements of coastal stress ecosystems. These species became dominant in pelagic and shelf communities.\nSuch a highly selective mass extinction reflects significant changes in the temperature, salinity, and contents of oxygen and nutrients in the Tethys at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary. Some researchers [39, 40] believe that this event resulted from a combination of several factors: long-term environmental changes on the earth and the impact of a meteorite or comet in the Yukatan Peninsula area (Chicxulub crater).\nA special study of the El Kef section by the group of researchers demonstrated that some taxa (2–21%) disappeared below the boundary, while half of the species became extinct precisely at this boundary [71]. At high paleolatitudes (Denmark), all but three planktonic foraminifera species disappeared at the K–T boundary [54]. In the Hokkaido sections, the extinction rate of the benthic foraminifers that populated intermediate depths below 150 m was 10%, while that of the species dwelling in the photic zone amounted to 80%, which confirms the catastrophic character of the extinction in the near-surface waters [34]. A comprehensive study of the K–T boundary sediments accumulated at depths of 600–1000 m [18] in southern Spain revealed that this boundary is characterized by a drastic reduction of the biodiversity at the generic level with a simultaneous increase in the abundances of infaunal taxa. This observation points to the increased influx of organic matter to the bottom, which resulted in the reduction of dissolved oxygen concentrations in waters. The rapid formation and wide distribution of anoxic conditions was recorded for intermediate waters of the southern Tethys and other areas. Eutrophic species were affected to a substantially greater extent as compared with oligotrophic forms.\nA more extensive study of Tethyan foraminiferal assemblages in connection with the environmental changes at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary was carried out in the sections from Spain, Tunisia, and France [8]. The boundary is marked by a 2-mm-thick layer with anomalous concentrations of iridium and microtectites. Over 90% of the Late Maestrichtian planktonic foraminiferal taxa became extinct by the end of this age with 70% of them disappearing precisely at the boundary. Benthic foraminifers experienced dramatic reorganization of their communities. Diverse assemblages with infaunal and epifaunal species were replaced by their taxonomically impoverished counterparts with dominant epifaunal components. These data imply the formation of oligotrophic conditions immediately after the termination of the Maestrichtian Age due to the sharp reduction of the primary production.\nCalcareous nannoplankton experienced a strong stress at the K–T transition: approximately 100 species disappeared at this level in the El Kef section and only 15–20 species crossed the boundary [58]. The surviving species are represented by rare specimens. No changes in the nannoplankton composition are noted below the boundary.\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nEVOLUTION OF THE MESOZOIC OCEANIC BIOTA 547\nThe immediate factor responsible for the mass extinction of urchins during the catastrophic events at the K–T transition was the decrease in the phytoplankton productivity, which resulted in the reduced influx of nutrients [33]. This inference is supported by the study of marine bivalves, which were dominated by filtering and burrowing taxa prior to and after the events at the K–T transition, respectively [28].\nBivalve inoceramid and Rudista taxa, ammonites, and belemnites are large and abundant invertebrate representatives characteristic of the Cretaceous Period. All these groups became extinct by the end of the Cretaceous, which serves as a criterion for discriminating between the Cretaceous and Cenozoic sediments. The diversity of inoceramids, ammonites, and belemnites declined over millions of years down to the complete extinction at the end of the Maestrichtian. The disappearance of inoceramids in the initial late Maestrichtian is considered as representing a global event explained by the influx of oxygen-rich Antarctic bottom waters at that time, which eliminated the oxygen-deficient conditions associated with soft bottom sediments [50]. The Denmark sections record the sudden disappearance of most brachiopods at the very end of the Maestrichtian, which occurred synchronously with the mass extinction of plankton without any preliminary decrease in their species diversity and abundance [68]. Ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs were gradually degrading through the Cretaceous. Marine reptilians characteristic of the Mesozoic Era died off by the end of the Cretaceous Period.\nThe mass extinction of planktonic organisms at the end of the Cretaceous demonstrates that catastrophic environmental changes affected the near-surface waters of the ocean. Selected groups of them that survived these changes such as diatoms and dinoflagellates are characterized by bottom or resting (spores) phases and, thus, are able to wait until unfavorable conditions are over. The disappearance of many planktonic organisms destroyed the entire trophic chain, including large marine carnivores such as fish and reptilians. The filtering organisms such as bryozoans, crinoids, corals, some brachiopods, and bivalves, which were deprived of their food source due to the plankton extinction, disappeared as well. Floating and infaunal bivalve species were affected to a greater extent as compared with their passive attached forms. At the same time, burrowing and carnivorous species appeared to be more resistant to the unfavorable conditions."

    "text": "The discovery of the iridium anomaly at the K–T boundary in the Gubbio section (Italy) was the first convincing evidence for the fall of a large fire ball on the earth (impact event) [9]. Subsequently, iridium anomalies with ages of 65 My B.P. were discovered in many deep-sea drilling cores and offshore sections. The anomaly is enclosed in a layer 10 cm (sometimes 2 cm)\nthick, which indicates the one-time deposition of the sediment with a high concentration of this element. According to the calculations performed by these authors, the asteroid should have been approximately 10 km across and have moved at an approximate velocity of 25 km/s. This catastrophic impact event should have affected the biota and triggered several radical environmental changes. The study of the osmium isotope ratio in the K–T boundary clays confirmed its extraterrestrial origin.\nThe δ18é values in tests of benthic foraminifers from bathyal sediments of low and high latitudes measured for the initial and terminal Maestrichtian (70.5 and 66 My B.P., respectively) correspond to approximate temperatures of 7°C. The δ18é values for high-latitude planktonic foraminifers demonstrate a positive shift marking the cooling episode at 70.5 My B.P. related to a rapid glacioeustatic sea-level fall [31]. A negative shift equal to 1.5‰ corresponding to a temperature rise by 6°C is established for the last 3 My of the Maestrichtian Age (~68.5 to 65.5 My B.P.) in planktonic foraminifers from the western North Atlantic. Thus, in the Maestrichtian, the cooling was replaced by a warming.\nMany studies of the sediments and their calcareous microfossils demonstrate negative δ13ë values at the K–T boundary determined by the reduced bioproductivity related to the mass extinction of planktonic organisms. The environmental changes commenced 200 ky prior to the K–T transition, although the disappearance of plankton and the δ13ë deviation were rapid in the geological sense [38].\nThe K–T boundary is also marked by a 87Sr/86Sr maximum as well. The latter is explained by the intensified weathering on continents and increased Sr influx with the riverine runoff due to the sea-level fall and widened continental areas. According to the other hypothesis [27], this is related to an impact event and acid rains that intensified the weathering."

    "text": "The possible factors responsible for this (and other) mass extinction(s) remain debatable. The collision of the earth with a large asteroid or comet, the birth of a supernova star near the solar system, an increase in the concentrations of toxic elements, volcanic eruptions and poisoning of environments by metals, sharp sealevel fluctuations, a decrease in the ocean’s productivity, reduced phytoplankton reproduction and its influence on the oxygen concentration, changes in the magnetic field of the earth, ëé2 crises and a CCD rise, sharp freshening of the surface waters in the World Ocean due to the outburst of freshwater from the Arctic, and climatic changes are mentioned among them. Each of these hypotheses is grounded by particular facts, although none of them explains all the associated phenomena. Some hypotheses were disproved by subse-\n548\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nBARASH\nquent observations. For example, climatic changes were probably not as catastrophic as is usually thought. In addition, some of the above-mentioned causes of the global crisis might be consequences of others.\nMany researchers relate the mass extinction of organisms at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary to sharp environmental changes determined by falls of large astronomical bodies (asteroids or comets). It is thought that these impact events triggered volcanism and climatic changes. It was discovered that the shelf of the Yukatan Peninsula in Mexico hosts a large Chicxulub impact crater from 180 to 280 km across with an age of 65 My B.P. [52].\nAccording to the hypothesis proposed in [9], the impact of a large asteroid should affect marine and terrestrial organisms due to the reduced illumination, temperature changes, acid rains, and fires. The global distribution of dust consisting of crustal material particles ejected from the crater and material of the astronomical body reduced photosynthesis and disturbed the entire trophic chain. This effect should be strengthened by associated fires. The ejection of vapor into the atmosphere during the asteroid fall into the ocean should cause the greenhouse effect. The fall of an asteroid onto rocks with high concentrations of CaCO3 and CaSO4, as in the case of the Chicxulub event in the Yukatan area, should intensify acid rains and increase the temperature by several degrees. The assumed global distribution of fires at the K–T boundary is confirmed by extremely high contents of carbon black in the boundary clays of Denmark, Spain, and New Zealand sections.\nThe evidence for impact events in the form of microtectites similar in geochemistry and age (within a 200 ky range) to their counterparts from the Chicxulub crater was also registered in Haiti and Mexico. In northeastern Mexico, the K–T boundary section encloses tsunamirelated sediments up to 6.1 m thick with glassy spherules and tektites. These sediments are interpreted as associated with the Chicxulub impact event, which took place 800 km to the southeast [65]. Judging from the iridium anomalies in Mexico, Guatemala, and Haiti, an additional impact event could have happened slightly after the K–T transition (64.9 My B.P.). In addition to the Chicxulub crater, similar Late Maestrichtian structures are recorded in the North Sea (Silverpit) and Ukraine (Boltysh). Iridium anomalies are also reported from Oman.\nThe synchronism between the eruption of thick Deccan trappes in India and events at the K–T boundary gave birth to an alternative hypothesis, which explains the mass extinction of organisms by this phenomenon. In addition, the basalts of the Emperor– Hawaiian Ridge erupted at the same time. According to the scenario in [45], the eruption of the trappes was accompanied by the ejection of large volumes of ashes and aerosols into the atmosphere. In low latitudes, temperatures sharply decreased. The high content of aerosols in the atmosphere provoked intense rains in previ-\nously arid areas. The freshening of the surface waters in high latitudes hampered vertical circulation and migration of oxygen-rich near-bottom waters into lower latitudes. In the oceans, the upper boundary of oxygen-free waters ascended up to shallow areas due to the development of anoxia. After eruptions, global warming determined by the high CO2 and water vapor contents in the atmosphere was no more balanced by cooling factors (volcanic dust and sulfate aerosols). Such a combination resulted in a strong warming, particularly in high latitudes, and in a partial death of organisms that survived the main biotic crisis.\nThe Maestrichtian climate was unstable: the longterm trend was interrupted by a brief cooling episode at the end of this age, which was followed by cooling immediately prior to the K–T transition [70]. The latter was probably caused by the impact event.\nThe large regression at the end of the Cretaceous could be responsible for the mass extinction. According to [38], the last sea-level fall in the Cretaceous occurred immediately prior to the transition to the Paleogene and was followed by its rise. The authors estimate the instability period as lasting approximately 100 and 300 ky prior to and after the transition, respectively. In epicontinental seas, the K–T boundary is marked by a stratigraphic gap, which makes catastrophic consequences for shelf communities quite understandable. The mixing of oceanic waters under the warm Late Cretaceous climate is determined by haline convection. Reduction of shelf areas, where deep waters were formed, during regressions resulted in a decreased vertical water exchange and a degradation of phytoplankton and, correspondingly, of the entire trophic chain.\nThus, climatic changes, sea-level fluctuations, intense eruptions of basalts (India), and impact events (Chicxulub in the Yukatan Peninsula) are thought to be the main abiotic factors responsible for the mass extinction of organisms at the end of the Cretaceous period. These factors caused a series of environmental changes of lower orders, which immediately resulted in mass disappearances of organisms and cardinal reorganizations of their communities. The temporal relationships of the associated events, however, remained unclear. The gradual environmental deterioration that lasted the last several millions of years of the Cretaceous Period and resulted in the degradation of marine (and terrestrial) communities was crowned by the fall of a large asteroid that contributed its baleful mite to the mass extinction process. Such a coincidence of irrelevant events seems hardly probable.\nZherikhin justly emphasizes that the long-lasting preparation of the ecological crisis masks the scenario of mass extinction and is poorly consistent with the assumed geologically instant exogenic impact factor responsible for the global taxonomic diversity decrease. “Nevertheless, no other concepts that can explain the global synchronism in the extinction processes during the geological crises exist. No mecha-\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nEVOLUTION OF THE MESOZOIC OCEANIC BIOTA 549\nnism of close relations between the marine and terrestrial biotas has been found so far” [3, p. 362]. The seemingly irreconcilable contradiction between the adherents of gradual biota degradation vs. its catastrophic death has stimulated scientific research.\nBoreholes drilled in the Chicxulub crater penetrated at a depth of several hundred meters a layer of impact breccia with fragments of crystalline crustal rocks, glassy spherules, and particular structural features; the layer rests upon shallow-water limestones [37]. In the opinion of these authors, the late Maestrichtian Chicxulub impact event is synchronous with the eruption of Deccan basalts, greenhouse warming (65.4 to 65.2 My B.P.), and the gradual biodiversity decline during the 700 ky interval prior to the K–T transition that preceded the main mass extinction.\nIt is conceivable that the mass extinction at the K–T boundary is related to another catastrophic impact event that left the giant Shiva crater in the Indian Ocean west of Bombay [17]. It is believed that it was formed approximately 65 My B.P. Probably, it represents a part of a spacious crater 600 × 400 km in size and 12 km deep. The bolide that was presumably responsible for the formation of this crater is estimated to be approximately 40 km across. The formation time of the crater is determined based on the age of the basal Deccan lavas and overlying Paleogene sediments in this structure as well as on the magnetic anomalies of the Carlsberg Ridge. Concentric geophysical anomalies, seismic and structural observations, and drilling data point to the probable origin of the Shiva structure from an impact event. The Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary sections in India enclose iridium anomalies, shock quartz grains, Ni-enriched glass and spinel, and tsunamirelated sediments. The last dinosaur remains are found immediately under the layer with the iridium anomaly. The synchronism between the Deccan trappes and the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary, their geographic proximity to the crater, and the thick layer of shock quartz beneath the basal lava flows confidently indicate that the volcanism could have been triggered by the Shiva impact event.\nSome other impact craters formed at that time are also known. The age of the Boltysh crater 24 km across discovered in the Ukraine is estimated to be 65.17 ± 0.64 My B.P. An analysis of seismic records obtained during oil prospecting surveys in the North Sea near the English shore in 2001 revealed an impact crater (Silverpit) 20 km across with an age of 60–65 My B.P. [67]. It is conceivable that the Cretaceous–Tertiary transition was marked by multiple collisions of the earth with several astronomical bodies.\nIn some sections, the iridium anomaly is located slightly above the layer corresponding to the mass extinction event or in its uppermost part. This can be explained by the iridium influx to sedimentation basins during many thousands of years from continents, where it was dispersed immediately after the impact event.\nThe proposed succession and combination of many natural processes reconcile some contradictions that have existed for many years. It unites the alternative hypotheses of impact events and volcanism that result in catastrophic environmental changes. The fall of the Chicxulub asteroid was not a crowning event in the train of processes that resulted in the mass extinction. Nevertheless, at least several impact events occurred at the Maestrichtian–Paleogene transition. According to the data available, the fall of a giant asteroid that left the Shiva crater was the most significant of them. It verbatim destabilized the entire earth resulting in baleful environmental changes and grandiose biota reorganization: the Mesozoic Era gave way to the Cenozoic one. The successive degradation of the Mesozoic biota by the end of the Cretaceous Period was determined by several terrestrial and extraterrestrial factors that were either independent, interrelated with each other, or determined by more general causes."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "An analysis of the oceanic biota development in connection with the changes of abiotic factors reveals that long relatively stable periods characterized by a high sea-level stand, high-energy hydrodynamics, and diverse ecological niches promote the growth in the biodiversity and abundance of organisms. The biota degradation results from rapid environmental changes, particularly with multiple alternation of opposite trends (transgression–regression, warming–cooling, and others). In addition, events and processes unambiguously harmful for the development of organisms such as global anoxia in oceans, intense eruptions of trappe basalts and volcanism, and collisions of the earth with large astronomical bodies negatively influence the biota.\nThe abiotic environmental changes that resulted in the extinction of organisms stimulated their evolution. The changes in marine biota occurred against the background of gradual environmental changes, while catastrophic changes were responsible for the extinction of taxa, the mass death of organisms included.\nThe Mesozoic Era commenced after the mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period, which represented the most catastrophic crisis in the earth’s biosphere, when over 50% of the marine genera became extinct, and terminated with the other catastrophe at the end of the Cretaceous Period, when over 30% of the genera died off [59]. Both Mesozoic crises, which are attributed to the five “great mass extinctions” of the Phanerozoic, are associated with all eight of the abovementioned causes and abiotic factors that negatively influence biodiversity. Other less catastrophic biotic crises or reorganizations correspond to the periods when up to 4–5 such factors were in action (table).\nThe table demonstrates that anoxia was the end universal cause responsible for the death of marine organisms during practically all the mass extinctions and less\n550\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 48 No. 4 2008\nBARASH\nsignificant reorganizations. It acted in combination with other abiotic factors or was determined by the latter. These factors themselves could only affect some of the organisms, displace their distribution areas, reduce or eliminate ecological niches, and provoke a global crisis. The rapid alternation of opposite tendencies (warming–cooling, transgression–regression, and others) resulted in a significant degradation of the biodiversity. The mass extinction of the biota could be determined, however, only by the formation of conditions unsuitable for life: anoxia, poisoning of the waters with toxic chemical compounds, sharp photosynthesis and primary production decreases, and hard cosmic radiation.\nThe abiotic factors that directly influence the evolution of marine biota (the temperature; the seawater salinity; the concentration of nutrients, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other dissolved and suspended components; the structure of the water column; the hydrodynamics; the bottom topography; the illumination; and others) are determined by factors of a higher order. Tectonic movements (horizontal and vertical) and volcanism are the most important among the terrestrial factors. The general evolution of the planet determined by\nendogenic terrestrial causes may be superimposed by extraterrestrial factors such as, for example, changes in the orbital parameters and in the precession of the earth’s axis.\nThe study of the biota reveals the significant role of impact events in its development. At present, approximately 150 different-size and different-age impact craters are registered on the earth’s surface. It is clear that impact events were an integral part of the earth’s life through its entire history. The synchronism or temporal closeness between impact events and changes in other important factors that resulted in reorganizations of ecosystems or mass extinctions of organisms imply their relationship with or dependence on more general extraterrestrial sources: cosmic radiation, electromagnetic and gravity fields, birth of supernova stars, crossing of spiral arms of the galaxy by the solar system, and others.\nThe above consideration of the marine biota development during the Mesozoic under the influence of different-order abiotic factors confirms interrelationships previously outlined for the Paleozoic [2] and their presumable dependence on a common source beyond the solar system (Fig. 5).

  "abstractText": "An analysis of the biota evolution during the Mesozoic in response to abiotic factors shows that the most important among them are the climate, sea-level position, dynamics and structure of the water column, its chemistry, volcanism, tectonics (horizontal and vertical movements of lithospheric blocks), and collision of the earth with astronomical bodies (impact events). Stable conditions and a variety of ecological niches promoted the growth in the biodiversity. Their changes that resulted in mass extinctions of organisms stimulated evolution. The analysis of the materials available leads to one of the most important inferences that all the terrestrial processes, the biospheric included, develop in close and continuous relation with the extraterrestrial processes that occur beyond the solar system in the space to which our planet belongs.
