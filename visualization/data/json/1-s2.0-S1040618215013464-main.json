All rights\na b s t r a c t\nChronologically-secure volcanic event histories are important for improving our understanding of volcano-climate responses, and securing ice core chronologies. We present an exploratory case-study that attempts to reconcile the chemical fingerprints of major volcanism in Greenland ice-cores for the years 670e730 CE. This period experienced considerable volcanic perturbation with multiple volcanic signals registered in all 8 Greenland ice-core datasets studied, including some comparable in magnitude to the great 1815 Tambora eruption, but reconciling signals with divergent dating between datasets presents a number of challenges. To further our understanding of the volcanic history of this period, frost-rings, tree-ring growth width and density minima from Europe, Siberia and China are considered together with Western European, Near Eastern and Chinese documentary evidence. These reveal a striking sequence of co-occurring inter-regional climatic extremes and social crises. We further examine a recently proposed 7-year adjustment to the GICC05 chronology used by many Greenland ice cores, and find that this results in a more coherent volcanic history for these years, and an improved agreement with tree-ring and written records. Three major volcanic events can now be identified, dated to 681, 684 e686 and 706e707, with several moderate events further contributing to a sustained climate perturbation reflected in prolonged temperature reductions in high-resolution reconstructions.\n© 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "Explosive volcanic eruptions are long recognized as drivers of climate variability that primarily act by injecting sulfur dioxide into the high atmosphere where it oxidizes to form sulfuric acid droplets (aerosols) that scatter incoming solar shortwave radiation to space and cool the Earth's surface (Robock, 2000; Langmann, 2014). In addition to this direct radiative effect, dynamical processes can result in winter warming over northern hemisphere continental landmasses for several winters following large tropical (low latitude) eruptions (Stenchikov et al., 2002; Fischer et al., 2007; ColeDai, 2010). While the most pronounced climatic impacts of individual eruptions are usually cited as lasting up to three years (e.g.,\nitute, Department of History,\nreserved.\nRobock, 2000; Cole-Dai, 2010), series of closely-spaced eruptions can induce decadal-scale responses, while ocean and ice feedbacks may promote responses that evolve over multi-decadal and potentially centennial time-scales (e.g., Stenchikov, 2009; Zhong et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012; Zanchettin et al., 2012). With many of the largest eruptions (and sequences of closely spaced eruptions) occurring before the twentieth century (Schneider et al., 2009), examining the response to historic events is key for understanding our climate history, estimating climate sensitivities, and for climate detection and attribution studies (Zielinski, 2000; IPCC AR5, 2013).\nSulfate aerosols produced after explosive volcanism are often deposited on ice sheets through wet or dry precipitation. Measurements of the sulfate content (and other acidity) in ice-cores can thus provide a continuous history of explosive volcanism that extends back beyond the twentieth century, inwhich the number and styles of major explosive eruptions have been relatively limited (Free and Robock, 1999). However, the complexities of atmospheric\ntransport can result in acid deposition that is temporally and spatially variable (Gao et al., 2007), while the representativeness of the volcanic signals in any individual core can be diminished by drifting and wind-scouring of fallen snow and other postdepositional processes (Fisher et al., 1985; Zielinski et al., 1997). Moreover, sulfate in ice-cores has several sources, including marine biogenic emissions (Traufetter et al., 2004). Volcanic signals must therefore be distinguished from this varying background of nonvolcanic sulfate (Section 2). The resolution at which ice-cores are sampled also introduces uncertainty regarding volcanic acid deposition dates (Kurbatov et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2012). The GISP2 core, most widely available on the Meese-Sowers chronology (Meese et al., 1997), has, for example, an approximately bi-annual resolution with a reported 2.5-year minimum in our period (Mayewski et al., 1997).\nDisagreement between volcanic histories can also arise from the differing chronologies (time-scales or deptheage scales) for each core, and their stated uncertainties or error estimates. These are intended to account, for example, for possible mis-identification of annual layers. Uncertainty generally accumulates with depth (Zielinski,1995; Ferris et al., 2011), butmay be reset to zero by using chronological age-markers as zero-error points (or tie-points), such as large unambiguous sulfate and/or tephra signals preferably linked to eruptions of securely and independently-known historical date. Undiagnosed chronological errors that are greater than stated error estimates may also develop between age-markers, or indeed arise because of incorrectly dated or misidentified age-markers. These errors may be sustained when misdated or misidentified age-markers are also used as validation points (distinct from zeroerror points) to assess and confirm the accuracy of chronologies; such age-markers again include sulfate signals linked to historical eruptions of presumed-known date. Of relevance here is Baillie (2008, 2010) and Baillie and McAneney's (2015) hypothesis of an undiagnosed c.7 year systematic error in the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) (Rasmussen et al., 2006; Vinther et al., 2006) in the sixth and seventh centuries.\nEmployingmultiple ice cores can help reduce many of the above uncertainties and provide more reliable volcanic histories (Gao et al., 2008; Sigl et al., 2013). However, notable differences still exist between multi-ice-core volcanic reconstructions prior to c.1500 (e.g., Gao et al., 2008), suggesting the challenges inherent in reconciling data from multiple ice-cores. This can be illustrated by examining a period of dramatic cooling in the latter decades of the seventh century. In Salzer and Kipfmueller's (2005) 2262-year treering reconstruction of annual mean-maximum temperatures for\nthe southern Colorado Plateau, the coldest sustained interval spans 683e700 CE (Fig. 1), which the authors suggest may be the result of volcanic activity. The PAGES 2k reconstruction (PAGE2 2K Consortium, 2013) also shows a decade-long summer temperature decline for Europe starting c.683 in Europe (Fig. 1), implying the spatially extensive character of this climatic perturbation. Volcanic signals of substantial magnitude are observed in most Greenland ice cores at this time, but with considerable disagreement regarding the number, size and dating of events. Sulfate deposition dated to 674 (using the year of first notable deposition associated with this event, as reported by Sigl et al. (2013)) in the NEEM S1 icecore dataset (Table S1) approaches about half that of the immense 1257 CE Samalas eruption (Lavigne et al., 2013), widely considered the largest eruption of the past two millennia.\nThe ‘early medieval period’ (c.400e1200 CE) is broadly understudied in historical climatology, paleoclimatology and related disciplines. This is partly because of a perception that the historical documentary records of the period are scarce, imprecisely dated and/or exaggerated (National Research Council, 2006). Difficulties experienced in reliably pushing annual-resolution climatic reconstructions from natural proxies back into the first millennium CE (e.g., due to lesser sample depth or replication in tree-ring chronologies) also contribute to the period's neglect. In this study, we thus expressly select the period 670e730 CE as a case study, in which our primary research question is whether available documentary sources and tree-ring data are sufficiently reliable and abundant to help resolve important questions such as divergence between ice-core volcanic records and, secondarily, whether a useful volcanic reference horizon can be established for this early period as a result of this case study. As a corollary, the intent is to demonstrate both the challenges and potential of combining diverse natural and anthropogenic sources in studying our climate history. Section 2 examines available ice-core evidence for major explosive volcanism during this 61-yr period, followed by examination of tree-ring and documentary records in Sections 3 and 4. An assessment of the merits of several volcanic histories for this period is presented in Section 5, with discussion and conclusions in Section 6."

Potential volcanic ‘peaks’ where sulfate or ECM signals in a given year exceed three times the 31-year running median absolute deviation (MAD) are extracted following the method described in Gao et al. (2008). A high threshold of 3 MAD is chosen for consistency with Sigl et al. (2013), and serves to remove spurious (e.g., nonvolcanic) signals and smaller events with potentially negligible climate impact."

    "heading": "2.1. Number and timing of potential volcanic eruptions",
    "text": "The challenge of reconciling ice-core volcanic signals is compounded when many closely-spaced events register in the ice, when secure age-markers are remote, and in deeper ice with greater cumulative uncertainties, as for 670e730. Fig. 2 presents the eight time-series datasets of potential volcanic signals extracted from the six major Greenland ice cores for our period. Volcanic signals (some of substantial magnitude) are recorded in each dataset, but with disagreement regarding their number, size and dating. For this 61-year period it is thus possible to reconstruct\nmultiple more or less divergent volcanic histories, each history (hereafter ‘scenario’) arising from specific assumptions and treatment of uncertainties that inform and limit choices regarding which deposition signals may represent common or unique signals of distinct volcanic events. The construction of several scenarios is outlined below, with further detailed consideration of methodological challenges and assumptions underlying their construction presented in Supplementary Information, Text S1.\nScenario 1: To obtain a simple limiting (upper bound) scenario for the number of distinct explosive volcanic events that register via acid deposition in the Greenland datasets for 670e730, we aggregate all co-occurring and contiguous signals (e.g., to allow for acid deposition from events that cross annual layers) between or within datasets, treating these as common signals of distinct volcanic events. The total of 21 signals observed in the datasets are combined in this way to identify 12 explosive volcanic events, most being unique to certain dataset, but some being common to several (Tables 1 and 2). However, because Scenario 1 does not directly account for ice-core chronological uncertainties, it almost certainly overestimates the number of volcanic events registered in this period. It is noteworthy, for example, that Fig. 2 reveals a close clustering of signals between datasets that likely represent deposition from common volcanic events, even though these signals are not dated to the same or even directly consecutive years.\nScenario 2: To obtain a more realistic upper bound estimate we begin by applying a ±2 year uncertainty margin to the date of each acid deposition signal. This is broadly consistent with stated uncertainties for Greenland ice-cores in the Common Era (e.g., Vinther et al., 2006). Where any given signal's date does not overlap with any other signal within their respective ±2 year uncertainty margins, we consider it unique to the dataset in question. Hence, in this scenario the signal at 713 in the GRIPmain dataset is deemed the sole deposition signal from a distinct eruption, having no overlap with the next nearest signal (at 705 in the Dye3deep dataset), whereas the signal at 690 in NEEM S1 (ranging from 688 to 692 within its uncertainty margin) by contrast overlaps with that at 692 in GISP2 (ranging from 690 to 694), and is thus considered deposition from a common volcanic event. This reduces the number of prospective volcanic events registered in the Greenland ice-cores to eight (Table 1).\nScenario 3: Several mechanisms may produce volcanic signals of apparently significant magnitude, but which may not represent major explosive eruptions with the potential for marked climatic impact. These include spatially variable snowfall and localized wind-drifting and piling that amplifies acid volumes in a given\nannual layer (Fisher et al., 1985; Zielinski et al., 1997; Robock, 2000; Cole-Dai, 2010), or direct tropospheric transport of acid from small climatically-ineffective eruptions in Greenland's vicinity (e.g., from Iceland). As these mechanisms are unlikely to systematically affect all Greenland cores in any single year, greater confidence may be placed in the reality and climatic significance of signals that appear common to several datasets (Gao et al., 2008). In Scenario 3, we thus refine our list of eight signals from Scenario 2 by retaining only those six signals deemed to cooccur between datasets (i.e., that are corroborated by signals in other datasets that overlap within their respective ±2 year uncertainty margins). These six co-occurring signals are dated 674, 677e679, 690e692, 697e699, 702e705 and 723e726 (Table 1), with ranges indicating the earliest and latest deposition dates per dataset."

    "heading": "2.2. Adjusting the GICC05 and Crête chronologies",
    "text": "Improved estimates of eruption magnitudes (and climatic effectiveness) can be obtained by combining measurements of\nsulfate deposition from multiple locations (Gao et al., 2006; Sigl et al., 2014). This procedure depends upon accurately identifying common depositions signals, itself contingent upon accurate estimates of ice-core dating uncertainties, wherein actual dating errors vary within published margins. Baillie (2008, 2010) and Baillie and McAneney (2015) have, however, proposed that sixth and seventhcentury volcanic event dates from ice-cores using the GICC05 chronology (Dye-3, GRIP, NGRIP, NEEM) require an adjustment that is greater than published GICC05 dating uncertainties, and observe improved correspondence to tree-ring growth minima, frost-rings (as listed by Salzer and Hughes (2007)) and historical records upon moving volcanic dates byþ7 years. For example, a set of large volcanic signals in Dye-3, GRIP, NGRIP and NEEM (dated c.529) move into alignment with the famous ‘dry frog’ observed c.536e537 in the Mediterranean region (Stothers, 1984; Kostick and Ludlow, 2015). The adjustment also helps explain the prolonged two-stage nature of the famous climatic anomaly from c.536e550, placing a second eruption at c.540e541 (the same eruption identified by Larsen et al. (2008) in the Dye-3, GRIP and NGRIP at 533e534 ± 2 but invoked by these author to explain only the initial 536 event).\nShould Baillie and McAneney's hypothesis prove correct, each scenario in Section 2.1 will require revision. That an adjustment may be merited up to and beyond our study period is suggested by the date of 933 assigned to the large fissure eruption of Icelandic volcano Eldgj a in the GICC05 chronology (Vinther et al., 2006). Historical support for an Eldgj a eruption at 933, or at any date in the early 930s is, however, problematic (Kostick and Ludlow, 2015). A key historical reference discussed by Stothers (1998) who supported an eruption date of 934 comes from Widukind of Corvey's tenth-century history. Widukind's account (Supplementary Information, Text S2) of weakened and reddened sunlight, alongside a mount of obscure provenance that ‘according to rumour, vomited many flames’ is certainly compatible with a volcanic dustveil and eruption. Yet Widukind's chronology is ambiguous. He describes these events in his entry for 941, but presents them as part of a miscellany of undated natural phenomena (excepting certain comets dated to 941) as portents of the death of German King Henry the Fowler, a date he does not cite explicitly, but is known to have occurred on 2 July 936. Widukind does not formally record any events in 934 and any medieval conflation of extraordinary natural phenomenawith the births, coronations or deaths of prominent rulers requires critical treatment. Widukind is far from the only medieval author to stress heavenly concern for a ruler in this way (e.g., see Given-Wilson, 2004). If relevant phenomena did not match in timing or geography, a temptation could clearly exist to obfuscate or massage such details.\nBy contrast, a widely-cited Irish observation that has been interpreted as a probable volcanic plume or dust-veil is dated to 939 in the Annals of Tigernach (McCarthy and Breen, 1997; Oman et al., 2005; McCormick et al., 2007; Ludlow et al., 2013). This observation's credibility is supported by the known chronological accuracy of Irish monastic astronomical recording at this time (McCarthy and Breen, 1997; McCarthy, 2008; Adelman and Ludlow, 2014), and the lack of any overt motive to manipulate the event's date. Severeweather and human crises in Europe (McCormick et al., 2007) and Asia (Fei and Zhou, 2006) starting in the early 940s further support a later date for Eldgj a's eruption. A misdating of Eldgj a's eruption from c.939 to c.933 is clearly compatible with the c.7 year correction suggested by Baillie (2008, 2010) for the sixth and seventh centuries. The discussion of Eldgj a's date by Sun et al. (2014) also presents evidence favouring a later date, and it is important to note that Stothers' (1998: 717) argument for a 934 date was influenced by ice-core dates of ‘934 ± 2’ from Crête and\nDye-3 that he preferred to the ‘rougher date’ from the GISP2 ‘at 938 ± 4’ (see also, Zielinski et al., 1995).\nGiven a prospective c.7 year error in the sixth and seventh centuries, and a c.6 year error in the tenth, we thus adjust all volcanic signals between 670 and 730 in GICC05 ice-core datasets (i.e., Dye-3, GRIP, NGRIP (Vinther et al., 2006)) by þ7 years. We also adjust the NEEM S1 by þ7 years, as it employs the GICC05 chronology (Sigl et al., 2013). We make no adjustment to the GISP2 chronology, as its dating is based on the Meese-Sowers chronology (Meese et al., 1997) that is independent of the GICC05 and its dating of Eldgj a is more consistent with the historical evidence. We apply an exploratory adjustment of þ5 years to Crête volcanic signals for two reasons: (1) The signal in Crête associated with Eldgj a is dated c.934 (Hammer et al., 1980), suggesting a 5 year error. (2) Although Crête extends back to 550 and we thus cannot inspect its timing of signals associated with the c.536e550 climatic anomaly, it dates a large event to c.622, which, if associated with the large eruption at c.627 (Fei et al., 2007), is also consistent with a 5 year adjustment. For a probable dust-veil observed in Ireland and the Mediterranean between 626 and 627, see McCarthy and Breen (1997) and Kostick and Ludlow (2015).\nScenarios 4 and 5: Fig. 2 (top panel) shows the adjusted signals, as per the dates listed in Table 1. We re-calculate Scenario 2 using these adjusted dates, and present this as Scenario 4, having 9 events in total (Table 1). The first event comprises two signals that now move into our period of interest, both dated 673, found in the Crête.ECM and Crête.SO4 datasets. The final event, comprising three signals found in the NEEM S1, NGRIP.SO4 and GRIPmain datasets, respectively, moves forward and ranges 730e733. We next recalculate Scenario 3, omitting signals observed in a single dataset only and present this as Scenario 5 (Table 1). This reduces the number of events to 6. Here, we also omit the first event from Scenario 4, because while it is found in two datasets, both derive from the same Crête ice-core."

    "heading": "2.3. Relative size of volcanic signals",
    "text": "For a perspective on the size of eruptions in our period, we calculate the ratio of the largest individual sulfate signals in each ice-core dataset, 670e730, relative to the respective signals of three major Common Era eruptions, namely the 1257 Samalas, 1815 Tambora, and 1883 Krakatau eruptions, as observed in the same datasets (Table 2). In calculating these ratios, we employ only those datasets providing sulfate values. ECM data are less reliable for this purpose, because they reflect not only sulfuric acid concentrations, but also others such as hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid concentrations that may be impacted (neutralized) by deposition of alkaline dust (Cole-Dai, 2010), while measurements of conductivity on solid ice also vary according to the temperature at the time of measurement (Cole-Dai, 2010). The NEEM S1 dataset preserves the largest single sulfate signal in our period (dated 674, or 681 when adjusted as per Section 2.2) relative to our reference eruptions, with deposition at 55% of the amount deposited from Samalas, 117% of Tambora and 246% of Krakatau eruption, suggesting a very substantial event with the potential to significantly impact climate. Eruptions of this prospective magnitude are rare and provide vital test-cases to study the climatic and societal impact of volcanism, but the inherent spatial variability in deposition necessitates the use of data from multiple ice-cores, where possible. For example, the same sulfate signal in NGRIP (i.e., in the NGRIP.SO4 dataset; also at 674, or 681 when adjusted) registers with deposition at 32% the size of Samalas, 77% of Tambora and 203% of Krakatoa.\nWe therefore also estimate the relative magnitude of volcanic events with common signals between datasets under Scenarios 3 and 5 (from Table 1) with respect to the great 1257 Samalas\neruption. For Scenario 3 we find the average deposition volumes for the 674, 677e679, and 702e705 signals are 44%, 24%, and 19% of the 1257 Samalas event, respectively, while the relative size of the 690e692, 697e699 and 723e726 signals are 10%, 6% and 7%. For Scenario 5, we find the average deposition volumes for the 681, 684e686, and 706e707 signals are 44%, 24%, and 17% of the 1257 Samalas event, respectively, while the relative size of the 692e693, 697 and 730e733 signals are 14%, 5% and 7%. In being based on comparatively few ice-cores, these estimates comewith substantial uncertainties, but they nonetheless improve on estimates using single datasets only. They also confirm the 670e730 period as one likely to have experienced pronounced volcanic climatic perturbation, including eruptions of apparently considerable magnitude that are not currently noted in widely used ice-core-based volcanic forcing reconstructions (e.g., Gao et al., 2008)."
  }, {
    "heading": "3. Tree-ring evidence of volcanic climate perturbation",
    "text": "Recent decades have seen the development of long tree-ring chronologies from overlapping series of annual tree-ring growth and latewood density measurements sampled from large numbers of living and dead (e.g., sub-fossil) trees, as well as, worked-wood from historic structures and archaeological sites. Since tree-ring growth is strongly controlled by climate, variations in growth have been used to reconstruct climatic conditions beyond the relatively short instrumental period. This approach works best when a single limiting factor, such as temperature, dominates growth, often in marginal (e.g., high-latitude, high-altitude) environments where trees grow near their biological limits (Briffa et al., 2004). Tree-ring data and related climatic reconstructions can identify and characterize the impacts of historic eruptions. Results are, however, sensitive to the accuracy with which eruptions are dated in ice cores, and some studies have thus confined their attention to eruptions of precisely known (e.g., historically documented) date (e.g., Fischer et al., 2007). Such work has shown that the most severe ring-width and density minima (and inferred summer temperature anomalies) of recent centuries are often associated with major eruptions (e.g., Briffa et al., 1998; D'Arrigo and Jacoby, 1999).\nA need for caution has been noted when linking tree-growth minima to ice-core volcanic signal dates, particularly in individual cases (Pyle, 1989), because of their lesser precision (where ice-core volcanic dates vary within uncertainty margins that tend to grow wider the earlier the date) and their potentially lower accuracy (where the dates vary beyond the stated uncertainty margins). The need for exact (precise and accurate) eruption dates has in some cases restricted ice-core-based analyses of the spatial and temporal evolution of volcanic climate impacts to the second millennium CE when chronologies are often more secure (e.g., Esper et al., 2013; Sigl et al., 2013). Nonetheless, when multiple ice-core volcanic signals are examined, a frequent though variable association with tree-ring width and density minima can be observed over long periods (e.g., Scuderi, 1990; Gervais and MacDonald, 2001; Hantemirov et al., 2004; Salzer and Hughes, 2007; Helama et al., 2013). Tree-rings thus hold potential to validate or refine ice-core volcanic dates, as previously attempted for archaeologically and historically significant eruptions (e.g., Baillie, 1989, 2008, 2010; Larsen et al., 2008; Pearson et al., 2009; Plummer et al., 2012).\nIn undertaking this, it is important to recognize that tree-ring response will vary widely, even to the extent that large eruptions with a definite presence in the ice may not find clear expression in the trees. This will partly reflect the genuine spatial and temporal complexity of volcanic climate impacts (D'Arrigo et al., 2013). Net summer-season response is generally a cooling on hemispheric scales, but this cooling can vary markedly on continental and sub-\ncontinental scales (e.g., Písek and Br azdil, 2006), while the most pronounced response may occur in different (e.g., first vs. second) post-eruption summers by region (Esper et al., 2013). The magnitude of climate impact is also sensitive to the month of eruption (Kravitz and Robock, 2011), and can be mediated (masked or amplified) by pre-existing climate trends and the pre-eruption states of major modes of climatic variability such as the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Adams et al., 2003; Emile-Geay et al., 2008; McGregor and Timmermann, 2011; Bourassa et al., 2012; Timmreck, 2012). Eruption location also influences impacts; low-latitude (tropical) eruptions may induce winter-season warming for Northern Hemisphere continental landmasses by a dynamical strengthening of the winter westerlies (Robock, 2000; Cole-Dai, 2010). This may give way to cooling for some regions over the course of several post-eruption winter-seasons (Fischer et al., 2007; Ludlow et al., 2013). Notable impacts on precipitation (in some cases promoting drought) are also increasingly recognized, in which volcanically-induced cooling may act to suppress mean global or hemispheric precipitation by reducing evaporation, in addition to dynamical suppression through a reduction of the land-sea thermodynamic contrast, leading, for example, to a weakening of the Asian monsoon (Peng et al., 2010; Man et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2014; Zhuo et al., 2014).\nVariation in tree-ring response will also arise from the complexities of climateetree-growth relationships. The probability that trees will clearly register a given eruption is, to begin, contingent upon it perturbing one or more the meteorological parameters that most strongly influence growth in a given species and region, particularly, though not exclusively, during the growing season. The level of response (or sensitivity) is also influenced by whether the trees are pre-stressed by growing in an environment with thermal, hydrological and/or other growth limitations (e.g., light availability (Stine and Huybers, 2014)). Trees may also present delayed (lagged) or multi-year responses to unfavourable weather, including when this occurs beyond the Spring-Summer growing season (García-Su arez et al., 2009; Babst et al., 2013). They may also be pre-conditioned towards muted or amplified responses due to pre-existing climatic trends or recently experienced extremes (Babst et al., 2013), including those that are volcanically induced (Sigl et al., 2013).\nThe early date of our 670e730 study period reduces the number of available and appropriate tree-ring chronologies in which to identify candidate volcanic tree-growth minima. However, the increasing availability of multi-millennium chronologies has provided a number of important well-replicated series, fromwhich we choose two that are primarily precipitation sensitive and two that are temperature sensitive, from four regions in Eurasia. These are: (1) a 3512-year Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii) precipitationsensitive ring-width chronology from the arid high-altitudes of the northeast Tibetan plateau, as presented by Yang et al. (2014), (2) a 4064-year Siberian larch (Larix sibrica) temperature-sensitive ringwidth chronology from the high-latitude Yamal Peninsula, Western Siberia, as presented by Hantimerov and Shiyatov (2002), (3) a 2407-year Pedunculate and Sessile oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea) precipitation-sensitive ring-width chronology from temperate Central Europe (France and Germany), as presented by Büntgen et al. (2011), important because it is proximate to the location of many of our European documentary sources, and, (4) a 2140-year Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) maximum latewood density temperature-sensitive chronology from cold Northern Scandinavian high latitudes, as presented by Esper et al. (2012). This latter chronology is of added importance as ring widths, in contrast to latewood densities, can exhibit biological memory effects, whereby ring widths exhibit a multi-year decline (generally <10 years) after major volcanic climate disturbances, temporarily reducing the fidelity by which they track climate (D'Arrigo and Jacoby, 1999, 2013;\nGervais and MacDonald, 2001; Esper et al., 2013; Kasatkina et al., 2013).\nWe adopt a straightforward and objective approach to identify notable growth minima by selecting all years with growth at least 1.25 standard deviations below each series mean, with this threshold striking a good balance between over- and underidentifying minima for our period. All four published chronologies are already detrended using established techniques (e.g., regional curve standardization (Esper et al., 2012)) to remove nonclimatic (e.g., early growth) trends. Where possible, medium to low-frequency (e.g., decadal or greater) variability of climatic origin has often been deliberately preserved in these chronologies. This is readily observed even within our short 61-year case-study period, and introduces issues of comparability when selecting notable growth minima using our simple approach. Selected minima may,\nfor example, be biased toward those that occur in years when average growth is already below the whole-period (670e730) mean, whereas minima that are quite severe relative to their surrounding years may be omitted if occurring during times of locally greater growth.\nTo address this, we first remove any period-wide linear trend per series by a standard least squares fit. To remove remaining trends (at decadal and greater frequencies) we fit each series with an 8-point cubic spline and take the residuals as our standardized detrended series. Spline standardization is widely employed in dendrochronology (Cook and Peters, 1981) and we implement it here following Hammer et al. (2001). We note that each detrended series correlates strongly with its original published counterpart (r > 0.80 in all cases for Pearson's r and >0.75 for Spearman's Rank coefficient, all at p < 0.001). The inter-annual growth patterns of\namal, Siberia (temperature sensitive), panel B; Central Europe (precipitation sensitive), ive), panel D), for 670e730 CE. Years are on horizontal (x) axes. Vertical (y) axes are in rture from an 8-point spline after first removing any whole-period linear trend (main 30 CE whole-period mean are highlighted in aquamarine and grey, respectively.\neach original series, from which we aim to identify sudden and pronounced growth decreases that may be indicative of the number, timing and impact of explosive volcanic events, are thus well preserved in the detrended series (Fig. 3).\nAlthough volcanic climatic perturbations may be spatially complex, major eruptions are still readily capable of inducing synchronous or near-synchronous hemispheric and global scale impacts (Robock, 2000; Cole-Dai, 2010). We expect, however, that some minima may reflect non-volcanic regionally-specific extremes. To improve the likelihood of identifying volcanicallyinduced minima, we select only those minima that co-occur in at least two regions. Minima are deemed to co-occur if observed in the same or directly consecutive years, because different regions may experience the greatest magnitude of impact in different posteruption years, and because tree-ring response times may vary by species and region. Ten sets of inter-regional co-occurring minima are identified in this way (Table 3). Section 5 examines the corre-\nspondence between these sets of co-occurring minima and our scenarios of common ice-core volcanic signals (from Section 2)."

    "heading": "4. Documented climatic extremes and societal stresses",
    "text": "A remarkable feature of Eurasia's written heritage are the often abundant historical accounts that share a common format in presenting events in an explicit linear chronological arrangement, despite the cultural differences across this immense area. Major events deemed worthy of record commonly include abnormal or extreme weather and ensuing ecological and social stresses. These annals, chronicles and other annually-ordered ‘histories’ have often been regarded as primitive or rudimentary forms of historiography (particularly European annals), because theymay lack consistent or overt causal narratives linking reported events. This, however, belies the complex underlying motives and world-views of their authors, which must be understood when interpreting the material, lest misinterpretations arise (see, e.g., Widukind of Corvey, Section 2.2). Annals and chronicles have also been seen as inferior by historical climatologists (or climate historians) seeking sources that provide more consistent and objective recording, as with weather diaries that can allow continuous quantitative climatic reconstructions. Intermittency and subjectivity are certainly concerns when using annals and chronicles (e.g., Ludlow, 2012), yet no documentary genre can escape the need for critical assessment in historical climatology (Br azdil et al., 2005), and as the discipline remedies its neglect of periods prior to the past 500 years, annals and chronicles will provide a foundation for analyses.\nFor our period, we primarily focus upon extreme weather and societal stresses reported in European, Near Eastern and Chinese annals and chronicles. For the first two regions, a thorough survey\nidentifies relevant reports in 29 and 16 sources, respectively. For Europe, this capitalises upon an historiographical revival with the keeping of Christian monastic annals, the earliest of which are attested in Ireland from sixth and possibly fifth centuries (McCarthy, 2008), in addition to court chronicles such as the AngloSaxon Chronicle and Royal Frankish Annals, after the lull in writings upon the decline of the Roman Empire. For the Near East, we draw upon several contemporary or near-contemporary Syriac and Greek sources associated with the Byzantine Empire, such as the contemporary, anonymous Syriac Chronicle of Disasters and the early-ninth-century Short History by Nikephoros Patriarch of Constantinople. Arabic sources are also important. Although the major flowering of Arabic historical writing occurred in the ninth century CE, historians (such as al-Ṭabar ı) from that period drew upon nowlost sources that report many relevant events for 670e730. For China, we draw from A compendium of Chinese meteorological records of the last 3000 years (Zhang, 2004), an authoritative and comprehensive compilation of meteorological and related phenomena from China's rich written history. For 670e730, the primary sources are the (Old and New) Annals of the Tang Dynasty, with additional information from the famous and broadly reliable Chinese universal history, Zizhitongjian, a chronological summary of major events, 403 BCE to 959 CE, published in 1084 CE (Wilkinson, 2012).\nAll relevant material identified in our survey is presented (with translated excerpts or summaries) in the Supplementary Information, Tables S2 to S4, with a full primary source bibliography in Text S3. Events of dubious veracity are excluded upon critical assessment. Islamic Hijri, Chinese Lunisolar and other calendrical dates (see introduction by Blackburn and HolfordStrevens (1999)) are converted to Julian dates where possible, and general dating accuracy is assessed by reference to events of independently known date (e.g., deaths of major ecclesiastics and nobles, lunar and solar eclipses). Special efforts aremade to identify duplicated reports that, when undiagnosed, will inflate the number of apparent events. Frequent duplication occurs due to the shared ancestry and common source material of many surviving texts, and may be challenging to identify when scribes (accidentally or deliberately) emend details from their sources and/or copy events under incorrect years. Paying close attention to known textual histories, and the phrasing and orthography of reports is, however, generally effective in identifying duplicates (see Greetham (1992) for principles of textual scholarship).\nTo identify the prospective climatic impacts of eruptions in our sources, we exclude extremes of transient or localized importance (e.g., small-scale or isolated flash flooding), and focus upon apparently persistent or large-scale drought and extremes of cold as may be induced by major eruptions (Fig. 4). One example is the ‘great frost … so that the lakes and rivers of Ireland froze …’ (Chronicon Scotorum) in 700, an event that coincided with ‘famine and pestilence … so that man ate man’ (Annals of Ulster). The fact that documentary sources can record weather extremes for all seasons is an advantage, an example being the drought lasting from the winter of 706 to summer of 707 with consequent famine, as reported in the (Old and New) Annals of the Tang Dynasty, China. This contrasts with the general growing-season sensitivity of treerings, and compensates for the limitations of documentary sources such as their subjectivity and intermittency.\nMajor societal stresses, including poor harvests, scarcity and famine, epidemic and epizootic disease, and mass human and animal mortality, often occurred in the medieval period in association with extreme weather (for evidence and perspectives, see McCormick et al., 2007; Campbell, 2010; Dybdahl, 2012; Lieberman and Buckley, 2012; Hoffman, 2014). For the earlymedieval period in particular, major eruptions have been credited with inducing\ndocumented weather extremes, linked in turn to poor harvests, scarcity and famine (e.g., for Europe, see McCormick et al. (2007) and Ludlow et al. (2013), for China, see Fei and Zhou (2006) and Fei et al. (2007)). This matches a pattern observed after major eruptions in later centuries, including the 1257 Samalas event (Stothers, 2000; Atwell, 2001), 1783 Laki fissure eruption (Witham and Oppenheimer, 2005) and 1815 Tambora eruption (Oppenheimer, 2003). Large-scale mortality, epidemic and epizootic disease also often coincidewith extremeweather, bothmodern and medieval (e.g., Farris, 1985; Stothers, 1999; McMichael, 2001; Hays, 2005; Haines et al., 2006; Molloy et al., 2008). In addition to many direct health impacts, extreme weather can promote disease and mortality indirectly via famine-related malnutrition, weakened immune system, and starvation ( O Gr ada, 2009; Reilly, 2009; Keneally, 2011). Disease transmission may also increase with the displacement and migration of human populations in search of food, as well as, other mammalian and insect disease vectors moving in response to weather-related ecological disturbance (Farris, 1985; Black et al., 2013; Newfield, 2013).\nWe must stress, however, that extreme weather does not hold a simple deterministic sway over society. Rather, its impact is mediated by the complex socioeconomic and cultural characteristics and vulnerabilities of the society in question (Fara, 2001; Juneja and Mauelshagen, 2007). These include varying agricultural sensitivities, population pressures, governance structures and the efficacy of coping mechanisms. Such mechanisms include state-\norganized food relief (e.g., the distribution of relief supplies in China in response to conditions of cold and scarcity in 704 (Supplementary Information, Table S4)) that may delay the onset or worsening of societal stresses (e.g., with harvest failure prevented from developing into famine (Li, 2007)). Pre-existing instabilities may also dispose certain regions and periods to more marked responses to extreme weather, and vice versa. Indeed, conflict alone (if interrupting agriculture, diminishing resources by scorchedearth tactics or the billeting and provisioning of troops) may induce scarcity and famine (Aberth, 2010; York, 2012). The influence of extreme weather on epidemic and epizootic disease is also complex, varying with the pathogen(s) under consideration, and may be difficult to establish for any individual outbreak, particularly historical outbreaks wherein the underlying pathogen(s) may be uncertain (Newfield, 2009; Altizer et al., 2013; Morley and Lewis, 2014).\nExtreme weather cannot therefore be expected to induce major societal stresses in all cases, and not all reported stresses are expected to arise from extremeweather. Nonetheless, upon removing reports of scarcity and famine that appear to purely result from conflict, we utilize major stresses as an additional exploratory indicator of volcanic weather perturbation, given (1) the frequent, if not total, correspondence between extremes andmedieval stresses, and (2) the intermittency of reporting in this period, wherein reports of famine, disease and mortality may constitute the only, albeit indirect, documentary reflections of extreme weather. Just\none example is the ‘… great mortality of birds, so that on sea and land a very foul stench was noticeable…’ as reported for 671 in the Chronicle of Æthelweard (England). Although the text does not elaborate regarding causation, Swanton (2000) infers this to have resulted from severe cold, consistent with reports of cold resulting in mass avian mortality as elsewhere explicitly described in European chronicles, particularly as accounts become fuller in the high and late Middle Ages (Swanton, 2000; Ludlow et al., 2013).\nFig. 4 presents the results from our survey for the 670e730 period, revealing frequent weather extremes and major societal stresses, and also highlighting the potential of documentary sources for the historical climatology of the later first millennium CE. Thirteen (21.3%) years experienced extremes of cold in one or more regions, comprising reports of heavy or prolonged snowfall, and frost and ice, 27 (44.3%) experienced conditions of drought, comprising reports of drought and, in China, anomalously low upland winter snowfall (for the meteorological significance of which, see Chu et al. (2008)). Three years reported weather conditions (683, Near East, 708 and 709, Europe) that were clearly severe, but not specific as to the phenomena involved. Of societal stresses, 36 (59%) of years reported mass human mortality in at least one region, resulting variously from scarcity and famine, directly fromweather, or disease, while 10 (16.4%) reported poor or damaged harvests, and 20 (32.8%) scarcity and famine. Eleven (18%) experienced mass animal mortality resulting from weather and disease, with mass animal mortality in 671 (Europe; see the preceding paragraph) and 681 and 727 (China) being ambiguous as to cause. Figs. S2eS3 present the total number of years for which each category of event is reported per region.\nExtremes often group closely in time within and between regions, with extremes of cold and dryness juxtaposed (e.g., in China, widespread summer drought in 700 with heavy spring snow in 700 and 701, and in Ireland a ‘great frost … so that the lakes and rivers …’ froze in 700). Societal stresses also often group, as per the Irish cattle mortality (in which disease is implicated), famine and pestilence, ‘so that man ateman’ in 700, with pestilence in the Near East between 699 and 700 and again in 701, and famine in multiple regions of China in 701 (Supplementary Information, Tables S2eS4). While some such groupings may arise randomly, they are consistent with climatic anomalies expected after major eruptions, impacting temperatures and precipitation in regions far distant, with anomalies persisting and evolving over several posteruption seasons and years. The large number of years with events in this period does, however, frustrate any simple formal identification of inter-regional groupings, in terms of assigning distinct start dates and durations. Nonetheless, Fig. 4 clearly suggests clusters of years that are more notable than others, with the years 681e684, 686e688, 698e701 and 704e707 particularly, if somewhat impressionistically, noteworthy for the confluence of different extremes (drought, cold) and social stresses (famine, mortality) ongoing within or between regions."

    "heading": "5. Evaluating and contrasting volcanic scenarios",
    "text": "Acid deposition in polar ice cores provides one of the most important means of reconstructing the history of major volcanic eruptions before the twentieth century. Since any given core may variably under-represent or fail to register deposition from major events, while also over-representing small (local, regional) eruptions or registering spurious signals, the use of multiple records is important for determining the actual number of eruptions with clear (acid) representation in the ice, and for better constraining their magnitudes. There are, however, challenges in reconciling these records, often relating to chronological differences that introduce uncertainty in identifying common and unique signals.\nPeriodswhereinmultiple signals occur over a small number of years are particularly challenging to interpret, even when differences in the dating of signals are small, as generally seen in ice-cores using the GICC05 time-scale for the past two millennia. In our 670e730 case study, substantial volcanic signals are observed in the majority of the eight Greenland datasets under consideration, but there is often disagreement in their dating. Baillie (2008, 2010) and Baillie and McAneney (2015) have, moreover, argued that GICC05-based datasets require a systematic chronological adjustment of þ7 years in our period. This adjustment is considerably larger than published GICC05 chronological uncertainties, and further complicates efforts to reconcile volcanic signals between datasets.\nIn this situation it is possible to reconstruct multiple divergent volcanic histories for the 670e730period,five ofwhichwepresent as scenarios in Table 1, considering that Scenarios 3 and 5 are most credible. We construct Scenario 3 by identifying common signals as those overlapping in date between datasets within ±2 year uncertaintymargins, andomitting signals that are not supportedbyat least two datasets. Scenario 5 is constructed following the same policy, but first adjusting the dates of GICC05-based datasets by þ7 years, and Crête datasets by þ5 years (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). This approach identifies a set of six signals, dated to 674, 677e679, 690e692, 697e699, 702e705 and 723e726 under Scenario 3, and five signals, dated 681, 684e686, 692e693, 697 and 706e707 under Scenario 5 that fall fully within our 670e730 study period (i.e., omitting the 730e733 signal as falling beyond our chronological remit). This period is thus one of considerable volcanic activity regardless of scenario, particularly for eruptions with notable sulphate output and the potential to perturb climate on large spatial scales.\nTo help assess the merits of Scenarios 3 and 5, we draw upon a selection of the (comparatively few) tree-ring chronologies that cover our early period and exhibit a dominant sensitivity to a single climatic variable, namely temperature (QinghaieTibet, N. Scandinavia) and precipitation (Yamal, Central Europe). From these we identify instances in which notably reduced tree-ring growth (minima) co-occur between regions in the same or directly consecutive years, as may be expected during large-scale volcanic climatic disturbances (Section 3, Fig. 3). In comparing these to our volcanic signals in Scenarios 3 and 5, we find that each signal is nominally supported by at least one set of inter-regional cooccurring minima within a conservative 1/þ3 year window. For Scenario 3, the average number (per year) of such minima cooccurring with volcanic signals is 0.19 (i.e., 8 minima co-occur within the 42 years covered by volcanic signals and their windows), whereas the average number of minima in years not associated with volcanic signals is less, at 0.13. For Scenario 5, the average number of minima co-occurring with volcanic signals is 0.31 (i.e. 9 minimawithin the 29 years covered by these signals and their windows), while the average number of minima in years not associated with volcanic signals is several multiples less at 0.09.\nThe same pattern is thus observed for both scenarios, with a greater average incidence of inter-regional tree-ring minima occurring within a small number of years from volcanic signals, than in years more remote in date (and hence less likely affected) by explosive volcanism. Yet it is also clear in a comparative context that Scenario 5, incorporating the above-discussed correction to the GICC05 chronology, provides a better match, and a range of simple metrics can be calculated to assess this issue further (Table 4). Thus, the average maximum difference between volcanic signal dates and the closest co-occurring tree-ring minima is 3.00 years under Scenario 3, but only 1.40 years under Scenario 5, while the averageminimum difference is 0.83 years under Scenario 3, but only 0.20 years under Scenario 5 (we calculate maximum and minimum values because volcanic signals and inter-regional minima can span several consecutive years). The average number\nofminima dates that directly overlapwith volcanic signal dates (i.e., if no uncertainty window is applied) is, moreover, 0.67 for Scenario 3, but 1.00 for Scenarios 5.\nTable 4 also presents the number of extremes and stresses documented from all regions that correspond to our volcanic signals using windows spanning ±1 up to 1/þ3 years, and averaged by the size (in years) of each signal and window (e.g., extremes falling within the 1/þ3 year window of the Scenario 5 volcanic signal at 692e693 are summed and divided by 6). Both scenarios again receive nominal support, but in comparative perspective this is greater, in sum, for Scenario 5. Thus, for Scenario 3, a total average of 0.80 extremes per year are observedwithin our smallest window of ±1 years from volcanic signal dates, while the equivalent value for Scenario 5 is just marginally less, at 0.79. However, for the 1/ þ2 window, this situation reverses, with averages of 0.83 and 0.88, respectively, while for the 1/þ3 window, the averages are 0.81 and 0.90 extremes per year. Turning to our record of societal stresses, the average incidence of these events within our ±1 year windows is 1.53 per year for Scenario 3, but 1.89 for Scenario 5. For our 1/þ2 window, the averages per scenario are 1.58 and 2.13, respectively, and for our 1/þ3 window, they are 1.57 and 2.03.\nThe balance of evidence from this simple analysis thus persistently favours the accuracy of the volcanic signal dates in Scenario 5, and suggests the veracity of Baillie and McAneney's proposed adjustment to the GICC05 chronology. These authors have also highlighted the utility of widespread “frost ring” events in pinpointing dates of major eruptions. Table 4 thus also presents the average number of frost rings under our threewindows (taken from Salzer and Hughes (2007) who identify seven such events, 670e730). In the ±1 year window for Scenario 3, we observe an average of 0.07 frost rings per year, while for Scenario 5 the average is several multiples greater at 0.26. For the 1/þ2 window, the averages are 0.06 and 0.21 respectively, while for the 1/þ3 window, the averages are 0.10 versus 0.21. This further supports our conclusion as based upon co-occurring tree-ring minima, and documented extremes and stresses, and is evidence of the need for a correction to the established andwidely-used GICC05 chronology."

    "heading": "6. Discussion and conclusions",
    "text": "A key concern in utilizing ice-cores to identify past eruptions is uncertainty in available chronologies (IPCC AR5, 2013). Because this uncertainty is in part particular to each core and in part common to those using the same time-scale, it is challenging to reconcile their volcanic signals, particularly for earlier periods in deeper ice with\ngreater cumulative uncertainties, and for which secure reference horizons are remote. The GICC05 chronology is widely employed by Greenland cores, i.e., by Dye3, GRIP, NGRIP, NEEM S1 (Vinther et al., 2006; Sigl et al., 2013), and is also used as a chronological reference for Antarctic cores (Plummer et al., 2012). However, adjusting the dates of acid signals in the GICC05 cores by approximatelyþ7 years in the sixth and seventh centuries has been argued to improve their correspondence with frost rings and ring-width minima (Baillie, 2008, 2010; Baillie and McAneney, 2015). We observe the same for our 670e730 case-study period, using a different selection of tree-ring chronologies, in addition to observing an improved correspondence between volcanic signals and documented extreme weather and societal stresses.\nA further result of adjusting the chronology of GICC05-based (and Crête) datasets is that the volcanic histories that can be produced exhibit a greater internal consistency. For example, the volcanic signals considered to represent common deposition events in Scenario 5 predominantly exhibit smaller dating divergence than the signals for each event in the Scenario 3. Thus, the average range of volcanic signals (in years) in Scenario 3 is 3.0, but is only 1.8 in Scenario 5 (or 2.2 if including the 730e733 signal). Both signals in the independent chronology of the GISP2 (at 692 and 697) are also closely corroborated in timing by signals in the NEEM S1 (at 693 and 697) under its adjusted chronology (Fig. 2), with additional close agreement regarding the comparatively small magnitude of these signals (Tables 1 and 2).\nThe largest signal in Scenario 5 dates to 681, having deposition of 44% the size of Samalas. Though uncertainty exists in any estimate based on a small number of ice-cores, an event approaching this magnitude can be expected to induce significant climatic perturbation on a large spatial scale. It is noteworthy that the only instance in which mass human mortality is documented in precisely the same year in all three regions surveyed (i.e., Europe, the Near East, China) occurs just two years later, in 683. That this cooccurs across a vast area suggests an underlying climatic forcing consistent with an eruption on this scale. The impact of this eruption was likely compounded by a further major event c.684e686 (at 24% the size of Samalas). Together with additional smaller events in c.692e693 and 697, this likely explains Salzer and Kipfmueller's (2005) characterization of the years 683e700 as the coldest period in their 2262-year temperature reconstruction for the southern Colorado Plateau. With ongoing multi-year human crises (famine, disease) and a prolonged temperature downturn in Europe and North America (Fig. 1), the 680s and 690s hold considerable comparative value to the famous climatic anomaly of\nc.536e550, an event of much-debated origin, namely volcanic and/ or cometary (e.g., Baillie and McAneney, 2015; Kostick and Ludlow, 2015), and coincident with the great Justinian plague.\nA question of considerable importance for understanding the likely climatic impacts of the eruptions in our period concerns their location, with tropical eruptions expected to induce different impacts (e.g., dynamical winter warming for Northern Hemisphere continental landmasses), to high-latitude eruptions (Robock, 2000). Prior to the twentieth century, the history of major eruptions becomes progressively less complete and precise in dating, particularly for eruptions in the many volcanically-active regions beyond Eurasia with less substantial or shorter written histories. Nonetheless, the comprehensive catalogue of historic volcanic eruptions by Siebert et al. (2010; see also the link in Table 5) identifies eight eruptions with locations in the tropics, middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, that are of a magnitude consistent with several of the larger acid signals (e.g., 681, 684e686 and 706e707, in Scenario 5) in our period (i.e., at VEI 4, Table 5). However, the often substantial uncertainties on these eruption dates preclude any clear assignment (e.g., the largest eruption, at VEI 6, of Pago, New Britain, in the tropics, is radiocarbon dated to 710 ± 75 years), while eruptions presently dated in Siebert et al.\nTaking only those eruptions of VEI 4, of confirmed eruption status, and with a location in the tropics or mid/high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Source: Siebert et al. (2010), updated online as v.4.3.4 of the Global Volcanism Program e Volcanoes of the World database. See www.volcano.si.edu.\n(2010) beyond our 670e730 period may in reality have occurred within it. Table 5 should thus not be considered a complete list of candidate eruptions occurring between 670 and 730.\nIdentification and analysis of tephra in the Greenland ice would clearly be of value here. Other avenues of future research that would provide an indication of eruption locations (low-latitude (tropical) or mid/high-latitude) include identifying and comparing tree-ring minima from Southern and Northern Hemisphere chronologies, on the logic that tropical eruptions are more likely able to perturb climate in both hemispheres simultaneously. Similarly, establishing whether an eruption has a bipolar ice-core presence (e.g., with acid deposition in Greenland and Antarctica) can aid in distinguishing tropical from mid/high-latitude events (e.g., Gao et al., 2008; Sigl et al., 2013). The lower resolution of many Antarctic cores (e.g., often associated with lower accumulation rates that make annual layer counting more challenging), varying transport times for sulphate to Greenland versus Antarctica, as well as, Baillie and McAneney's (2015) argument that the highresolution Law Dome and WAIS Divide Antarctic ice-cores also require a systematic chronological correction in the first millennium CE, must also be borne in mind. However, potential clearly exists to extend our analysis to incorporate the Antarctic datasets, particularly as they continue to grow in number and resolution (e.g., Sigl et al., 2014), providing a firmer basis for integrating documentary, tree-ring and ice-core data.\nIn this paper we employed multiple Greenland ice-cores with tree-ring data from central Europe, Scandinavia, Siberia and the\nQinghaieTibetan Plateau, as well as historical records compiled from Europe, China and the Near East, to examine the timing and magnitude of explosive volcanism for the period, 670e730. Our results support the proposal of adjusting the GICC05 chronology by 7 years. We also suggest that such a distinctive closely-spaced sequence of large and small volcanic signals between 680 and 700 (as dated according to Scenario 5 and supported by tree-ring and documentary evidence), holds potential to act as a new chronological reference horizons for dating ice-cores in this comparatively early period, ideally augmented by tephra analyses and a robust correspondence to signals in Antarctic ice-cores."

  "abstractText": "Chronologically-secure volcanic event histories are important for improving our understanding of volcano-climate responses, and securing ice core chronologies. We present an exploratory case-study that attempts to reconcile the chemical fingerprints of major volcanism in Greenland ice-cores for the years 670e730 CE. This period experienced considerable volcanic perturbation with multiple volcanic signals registered in all 8 Greenland ice-core datasets studied, including some comparable in magnitude to the great 1815 Tambora eruption, but reconciling signals with divergent dating between datasets presents a number of challenges. To further our understanding of the volcanic history of this period, frost-rings, tree-ring growth width and density minima from Europe, Siberia and China are considered together with Western European, Near Eastern and Chinese documentary evidence. These reveal a striking sequence of co-occurring inter-regional climatic extremes and social crises. We further examine a recently proposed 7-year adjustment to the GICC05 chronology used by many Greenland ice cores, and find that this results in a more coherent volcanic history for these years, and an improved agreement with tree-ring and written records. Three major volcanic events can now be identified, dated to 681, 684 e686 and 706e707, with several moderate events further contributing to a sustained climate perturbation reflected in prolonged temperature reductions in high-resolution reconstructions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.
