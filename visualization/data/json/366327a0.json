  "abstractText": "can be easily dismissed because it requires a substantially smaller unit cell. It should be pointed out that the volume of the unit cell in our proposed model is just large enough to contain the octapeptide dimer and anything smaller can not physically hold the entire mass of the octapeptide. Therefore, the observed electron diffraction pattern must be due to the principle axis. Finally the crystalline model was checked for bad contacts using the program XPLOR 17 (molecular dynamics calculations on the three-dimensional crystal lattice). No bad contacts were found and the overall energy of the model was low. Most importantly, when the three-dimensional model was used to calculate structure factors, the patterns produced compared very favourably with the electron diffraction patterns thus strongly supporting the proposed model. Involvement of intermolecular hydrogen bonding networks in tube assembly is also supported by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis l8 (Fig. 4). In alkaline solutions, the monomeric peptide subunit displays an amide-I band at 1,632 cm I consistent with the cyclic structure of the backbone. Moreover, the bands at 1,568 and 1,670 cm I are typical solventexposed carbonyl stretching frequencies for glutamate and glutamine side-chain functionalities, respectively. On self-assembly, however, organic nanotubes display characteristic features of a hydrogen-bonded f3-sheet structure. Not only is the appearance of amide-l bands at 1,628 cm -I , and 1,688 cm I, and the amideII band at 1,540 cm I consistent with the expected backbone structure, but the observed NH stretching frequency at 3,277 cm ' I also strongly supports formation of a tight network of backbonebackbone hydrogen bonding. Given the tight backbonebackbone inter-subunit interactions, as determined by the above analysis of the electron diffraction patterns, it is possible to use Krimm's correlation to estimate the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding distance from the observed frequency of the NH stretching vibration l8 . The observed frequency of N-H stretching mode approximately correlates to an average intersubunit NO distance of 2.85 A, or an inter-subunit distance of 4.71 A. This value is consistent with the value of 4. 73 A obtained from electron diffraction patterns. It is should be pointed out that the IR spectrum of the nanotubes also closely resemble the ones reported for gramicidin A-a naturally occurring linear peptide composed of hydrophobic amino acids with alternating Dand L-configuration which is known to form dime ric f3-helical transmembrane ion channel structures I9,ZO. Gramicidin A (l W , that is, an antiparallel f3-helix with a 6.4 residue rise per turn) has amide-I bands at 1,630,1,685 cm-\\ an amide-II band at 1,539 cm I, and an N-H stretching frequency at 3,285 cmI (ref. 21) . The general strategy described here should allow the design and synthesis of a wide range of tubular structures with specified internal diameters and surface characteristics, and having wide range of applicationsâ€¢ . For example, such tubular materials could be designed to mimic biological channels and pore structures, used to study physical and chemical properties of confined molecules, control growth and properties of inorganic and metallic clusters, or design novel optical and electronic devices.
