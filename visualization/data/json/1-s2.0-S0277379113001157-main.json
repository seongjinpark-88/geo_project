A composite standardized climate record from the two lakes provides a single time series that efficiently integrates multi-proxy data that reflect the evolution of summer temperatures through the Holocene. The first-order trends in biogenic silica (BSi), d13C, and C:N rise relatively abruptly following deglaciation, reaching maximum values shortly after 8 ka following a complex minimum between 8.7 and 8.0 ka. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the lakes is marked by all proxies, with a sharp transition out of the 8 ka cold event into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka, and continuing warm with some fluctuations until 5.5 ka. Decreasing summer insolation after the HTM is reflected by incremental cooling, initially w5.5 ka, with subsequent cold perturbations recorded by all proxies 4.3 to 4.0 ka and 3.1 to 2.8 ka. The strongest disturbance occurred after 2 ka with initial summer cooling occurring between 1.4 and 1.0 ka, followed by a more severe drop in summer temperatures after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 0.2 ka. Following each late Holocene cold departure, BSi re-equilibrated at a lower value independent of the sediment accumulation rate. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in the highlands of Iceland. The similarity in timing, direction and magnitude of our multi-proxy records from glacial and non-glacial lakes, and from the adjacent marine shelf, suggests that our composite record reflects large-scale shifts in ocean/atmosphere circulation throughout the northern North Atlantic.\n2013 Elsevier Ltd.

    "text": "On millennial timescales, the climate of the Holocene in the Northern Hemisphere was strongly influenced by the steadily decreasing summer insolation, whereas on decadal to centennial timescales Holocene climate was variable, fluctuating between warmer and colder, and more humid and more arid states (e.g. Wanner et al., 2011). Complex changes in atmospheric and ocean surface currents are documented for the northernmost North Atlantic through the Holocene (e.g. Bond et al., 2001; Mayewski et al., 2004; Alley and Ágústsdóttir, 2005; Wanner et al., 2008, 2011). For example, several studies of North Atlantic terrestrial\nAll rights reserved.\nand marine archives describe a delayed response to early Holocene peak summer insolation suggesting that meltwater from the lingering Laurentide Ice Sheet influenced thermohaline circulation (e.g. Kaufman et al., 2004; Kaplan and Wolfe, 2006; Geirsdóttir et al., 2009a). Cold summer anomalies since 8 ka that are superimposed on the decreasing Northern Hemisphere summer insolation are related to some combination of reduced solar irradiance, explosive volcanism, and changes in the internal modes of variability in the ocean-atmosphere system during the Holocene (Crowley, 2000; Denton and Broecker, 2008; Wanner et al., 2011). However, no consensus has been reached on the timing, duration, or dominant controlling mechanism for these short term and sometimes abrupt changes.\nA prime target for Holocene paleoclimate studies is to test whether changes on decade-to-century scales are regionally coherent. This effort requires continuous records at high resolution\nthat are well dated. Recent high-resolution Holocene paleoclimate studies from Iceland and the North Atlantic (Massé et al., 2008; Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2010; Sicre et al., 2011) are limited by uncertainties associated with the various methods of age determination. Large offsets between radiocarbon ages from terrestrial sites, tephra ages and marine sites have been detected due to variable reservoir ages for marine carbon and reworked terrestrial carbon input into lacustrine systems (Wolfe et al., 2004). Diagnostic Icelandic tephra provide discrete timelines that can aid in the correlation of paleoclimate records from marine and terrestrial archives, but there are few widely distributed and well dated tephra layers common to most archives around the North Atlantic. Age models for marine and lake sediment cores can be improved using paleomagnetic secular variations (PSV) combined with tephra chronology.\nThis paper has two goals. Firstly, we present a new 10 ka highresolution paleoclimate record from a non-glacial, low-elevation lake, Haukadalsvatn (HAK), in West Iceland, where the last 10 ka is contained in 18m of sediment (Fig.1). The 10 ka record builds on an initial study of the last 2 ka (Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b), using the same proxies to extend the proxy record back to 10 ka at neardecadal resolution. PSV synchronization with a well-dated marine core from the shelf north of Iceland (Stoner et al., 2007; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2013), coupled with tephrochronology provide temporal resolution at century or better resolution, allowing a well dated multi-proxy reconstruction of relative changes in summer temperatures over the past 10 ka. Secondly, in Section 4.5, we summarize the PSV and varve-dated record from the glacial lake Hvítarvatn (HVT), located in the central highlands of Iceland, with similar sedimentation rates and at similar resolution (Larsen et al., 2011, 2012). Multiple physical, biological, and chemical proxies derived from the sediment in each core are composited to derive continuous, annual to multi-decadal multi-proxy records of Holocene environmental change and ice-cap activity in Iceland (summarized in Section 5). Despite very different dominant catchment\nFig. 1. (a) Map of Iceland in the North Atlantic showing generalized ocean circulation.

General cooling through the Late Holocene is punctuated by abrupt changes in background state about 4.2, and 3.0 ka, with the strongest cooling beginning w1.5 ka, culminating in the Little Ice Age, the coldest multicentennial cool interval since 8 ka. Given Iceland’s sensitive geographic location in the northern North Atlantic, we suggest that the combined records from these two lakes serves as a template for Holocene climate evolution and abrupt climate change around the northern North Atlantic and Nordic Seas regions."

    "text": "Haukadalsvatn (3.3 km2, elevation 32 m asl, max depth 42 m) is a coastal lake located in the narrow, steep-sided valley of Haukadalur in western Iceland with an ice-free catchment of 172 km2 lying mostly above 500m asl (Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b). The site can be influenced by both the North Atlantic Drift, which delivers warm, saline Atlantic water to the coast of Iceland in the Irminger Current, and the cold, low-salinity water of the East Greenland Current, which flows from the north along the shelf and slope of East Greenland (Fig. 1). Any changes in these opposing ocean surface currents are imprinted on the terrestrial environments in Iceland and sedimentation in HAK. The site is also sensitive to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the dominant extra tropical atmospheric forcing in the Atlantic sector (e.g. Hurrell, 1995). At present, HAK is neutral (pH 7.7) and well mixed, probably due to a high level of wind stress (Langdon et al., 2008; Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b). The surrounding bedrock is mainly easily erodible Tertiary basalt, and the region lies outside the active volcanic zones of Iceland (Jóhannesson, 1997). The valley of Haukadalur was submerged during deglaciation (marine limit 70m asl) and the earliest lake sediment fill is of marine origin. The basin became isolated\nation map of study sites in Iceland. The location of sediment cores from.

Soils around HAK are mostly Andosols (eolian sand and tephra), with lesser amounts of Histosols (Arnalds and Gretarsson, 2001). These soil types lack cohesion, which makes them vulnerable to erosion by wind or water (Arnalds, 2004). The lake basin has not been affected by glacier meltwater during the Holocene, but a large delta has developed at the inflow indicating high minerogenic sediment input from the surrounding catchment."

Total recovery of the cores exceeded 98% with 30 m long sediment cores, of which the uppermost 18 m covers the last 10 ka, after the HAK basin became isolated from the sea (Geirsdóttir et al., 2009a). The cores were analyzed for multiple physical and organic matter proxies, including density and magnetic susceptibility (MS), biogenic silica (BSi), total organic carbon (TOC), and organic carbon stable isotopes (d13C) (details on analytical methods are in Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b)."

Declination and inclination were correlated in the depth domain to the PSV record from MD99-2269, a marine sediment core from the shelf north of Iceland (Figs. 1 and 2, Stoner et al., 2007) using 54 tie points over the past 10 ka and eight tephra layers common to both cores (Fig. 2; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2013). To further constrain the chronology, age constraints from 210Pb and 137Cs in a surface core\nwere spliced with the PSV-derived age control for the GLAD core (Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b). The agemodel was constructed by fitting control points with a smoothed spline using the CLAM code (Blaauw, 2010). The uncertainty of the age model is low (decades) due to the high accumulation rates in the lake and the large number of secure age control points. All ages in the text are reported as calendar years prior to 2000 AD."

Samples for TOC were taken at 1e2 cm intervals throughout the core resulting in a 1e3 year resolution over the last 1000 years and decadal resolution for the older parts. TOC was determined at the University of Iceland on a CM5200 Autosampler/ Furnace (combusted to 950 C) and measured on a CM54014 CO2 Coulometer version 3.0 with a detection limit of 0.05 wt %. As there is no CaCO3 in the basaltic bedrock of Iceland, %C can be taken as representing exclusively organic carbon (e.g. Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b). The flux of TOC (TOCflux) is determined as the mass of organic carbon accumulated in continuous 20-year intervals through the core (TOC mg g 1*density g cm 3*SAR cm a 1), where SAR is the average sediment accumulation rate.\nAdditional OM proxies (%C, %N, d13C, d15N, C:N) were sampled at 0.5e1.5 cm intervals from a surface core (Glew, 1991) and at 1-to10 cm intervals from the main GLAD cores, resulting in sub-decadal\n2269 (red).

This provides roughly one sample every 3 years on average for the past 50 years, one sample every 5 years for the balance of the past 2 ka, decadal resolution between 2 and 6 ka and multi-decadal resolution between 6 and 8 ka. BSi measurements were carried out at the University of Illinois, where freeze-dried bulk sediment samples were analyzed following the methods described by Mortlock and Froelich (1989), except for the use of 10% Na2CO3 solution (0.9 M Na2CO3). A HACH Dr/2000 spectrophotometer was used to measure BSi concentration, which was then converted to weight percent SiO2 of dry sediments. Mineral matter content was estimated as the residual after accounting for organic matter (%C/0.4) and % BSi."

The CLAM-constructed age model is based on 72 control points. This high frequency of tie points in HAK allows the reconstruction of SAR changes in the lake record that were not apparent using just the tephrochronological controls with linear interpolation between marker tephra points (Fig. 2) (Ólafsdóttir et al., 2013). The SAR in HAK drops dramatically after 10 ka with a short but sudden increase in SAR between 9.8 and 9.6 ka after which it remains low until a distinct peak between 8.2 and 7.9 ka. Minimum SAR <0.05 cm a 1 occur between 7.9 and 5.5 ka, after which SAR shows a stepwise and punctuated increase at 4.2 ka, 3 ka, 2.5 and 1.5 ka, reaching a maximum of 1.5 cm a 1 between 0.7 and 0.4 ka (Fig. 2)."

    "heading": "4.2. Resampling of proxy time series for HAK",
    "text": "To compare our proxies at decadal resolution we use the Analyseries software (Paillard et al., 1996) to resample each proxy time series at 20-year increments (Fig. 3). Raw data were normalized (mean/standard deviation) to produce standard deviation plots at 20-year increments.\n4.3. Organic proxies in HAK: BSi, d13C, C:N\nThe amount of BSi in lake sediment reflects the productivity of diatom silicification as well as the flux of other material into the lake that dilutes the BSi signal. We evaluate the dependency of BSi concentration on SAR in Fig. 4. Only 16% of the variance in BSi is explained by changes in SAR. Hence, we consider BSi values in HAK to be dominantly a measure of diatom primary productivity, which in Iceland is correlated to spring/summer temperatures following break up of ice cover on the lake, with higher temperatures resulting in greater diatom productivity (Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b).\nStable carbon isotopes (d13C) in lacustrine sedimentary organic matter can be influenced by a range of factors. HAK is an ultraoligotrophic lake with little authigenic carbon production (TOC averages over the last 10 ka <1%; n ¼ 500). Consequently, there is little influence of primary productivity on the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the lake. The surrounding bedrock (basalt) contains almost no carbon, so it exerts little\ninfluence as well. Rather, we argue that the dominant control on OM d13C is the source of the carbon. There are three primary sources of OM to HAK, each with distinctly different d13C. These are terrestrial vascular plants (d13C: w26&), aquatic algae (d13C: w30&) and aquatic moss (d13C: w20&) (e.g. Meyers and LallierVergès, 1999). Because HAK is bowl-shaped, without an extensive littoral zone where moss is likely to grow, we argue that aquatic macrophytes carbon influence on the total OM d13C is negligible. Consequently, we interpret more negative d13C to be indicative of dominantly autochthonous algal carbon sources, whereas less negative d13C reflects increasing contributions from allochtonous terrestrial plant sources in the catchment.\nC:N reflects the proportion of terrestrial versus aquatic organic matter in the sediment. The proportion of carbon and nitrogen in organic residues is relatively low in aquatic carbon, and relatively high in terrestrial plants (Meyers and Teranes, 2001).\nAt 10 ka BSi is low, but abruptly increases w9 ka, d13C becomes steadily more negative, whereas C:N is generally low, with brief shifts to much higher values (Fig. 5). All three proxies show a brief “cold” perturbation w8.2 ka. Between 8 and 5.5 ka BSi averages its highest values, d13C is more negative than during any other interval, and C:N remains relatively low, although not as low as in the preceding interval. BSi declines from 5.5 ka to 1.5 ka, whereas d13C remains relatively constant, although at a more positive value than in the preceding interval. C:N is similar, but less variable than between 8 and 5.5 ka (Fig. 5). All three proxies are more variable after 1.5 ka than at any other time. BSi is lower than during any other interval, d13C has two strong multicentennial shifts to higher values, and C:N generally increases, but with significant variability."

    "heading": "4.4. Physical proxies in HAK: density, MS, SAR and TOC",
    "text": "Lake sediment physical characteristics (density, MS and SAR) primarily reflect the contribution of terrestrially eroded material into the lake, with higher values indicating higher catchment erosion rates and increased minerogenic flux to the lake. Although TOC is not normally considered a physical proxy, we argue that after 5.5 ka primary productivity within the lake is overprinted by the flux of terrestrial carbon eroded from the catchment; hence, during the Late Holocene, TOC behaves like the other physical proxies. Sediment density and MS are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the source clastic grains. During the early Holocene, clastic grains in the catchment were derived for the most part from fresh glacially eroded sediment remnant from the last glaciation. Between w8.0 ka and 6.0 ka, hillslopes were stabilized by vegetation that contributed weathering processes and soil development. After 5.5 ka, our proxies indicate that reduced terrestrial vegetation led to increased vulnerability of hillslope sediment to eolian and fluvial erosion processes. However, these soil grains were hydrated, leached of some of their primary elements, and therefore less dense than fresh glacially produced grains. Hillslope soils also contain significantly more organic carbon than does fresh glacial sediment. These factors result in reduced MS and density for the post-5.5 ka sediment despite higher SAR. Consequently, there is a shift in sign of the correlation between both MS and density with SAR and TOC from positive to negative after w5.5 ka (Fig. 6). This pattern is common to other non-glacial Icelandic lake sediment fill (e.g. Axford et al., 2007; Geirsdóttir et al., 2009a)."

    "heading": "4.5. Multiproxy composite record for HAK",
    "text": "To incorporate the large number of highly resolved climate proxies (Table S1), we developed a single multiproxy composite that describes the evolution of summer climate in the HAK catchment. We evaluate correlations between proxies with bi-plots\nusing d13C as the basis for comparison for OM proxies, and SAR for physical proxies (Fig. 7a and b). To create a composite plot we normalize each re-sampled proxy and compute standard deviation units (Table S2). Standard deviation values for those proxies with significant co-variation were summed, with the sign dependent on\nthe correlation between each proxy and the record of SAR (physical proxies) or d13C (organic proxies).\nThe bi-plots during the last w6 ka for some proxies show a change in the sign of the correlation. Several proxies show positive co-variations with d13C in the earlier part of the Holocene changing\nto negative co-variation after 6 ka (Fig. 7a). By exploring the covariations of all proxies at different break points throughout the last 6 ka we found the time when most proxies shifted the sign of their correlationwasw5.5 ka (Fig. 7a and b). The best examples are the BSi and TOC bi-plots (Fig. 8). Although BSi and TOC are commonly used proxies for bioactivity in lake cores, with higher values indicating higher primary productivity under higher lake temperatures (Meyers and Teranes, 2001; Conley and Schelske,\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 5600070008000900010000\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\nFig. 5. Normalized standard deviations for 20-year resampling of OM p\n2002), in the HAK sediment these two proxies are weakly anticorrelated over the last 10 ka (r ¼ 0.14), with notable anti-phase excursions of the two proxies at ca 8.2, 5.5, 4.2 ka and during the last ca 1.5 ka (Figs. 5 and 6). These anti-phase excursions increase after 5.5 ka when the correlation shifts from a strong positive correlation between 10 and 5.5 ka (r ¼ 0.56) to a negative correlation between 5.5 and 0 ka (r ¼ 0.38) (Fig. 8). The TOC record of HAK over the past 1.5 ka is unusually variable compared to the full Holocene record (Fig. 6c) but a noticeable feature is the significant positive correlation between TOC and SAR during the last ca 5.5 ka (Fig. 7b), supporting our contention the TOC is dominated by changes in the delivery of terrestrial C after 5.5 ka. We interpret this shift in co-variation of the HAK proxies as a clear signal for an environmental system change in the HAK catchment; the TOC is determined by within lake primary productivity 10 to 5.5 ka (mean TOC ¼ 0.7%) but dominantly by inwash of terrestrial C after 5.5 ka (mean TOC ¼ 1.1%). Consequently TOC is vulnerable to overprinting by carbon from terrestrial sources and high TOC values commonly reflect episodic landscape instability and delivery of soil carbon after 5.5 ka.\nThe composite graphs tend to reduce proxy-specific signals, while amplifying those signals that are recorded by most or all proxies. For those proxies with a change in sign of correlation after 5.5 ka we changed signs when summing younger values. BSi is our clearest indication of warmth but can also be influenced by sedimentation rate. To avoid overprinting by sedimentation rate changes we compare our proxies to d13C, which has the advantage that it is a ratio not influenced by sedimentation rate, and it is strongly correlated to BSi in both lakes. This allows us to describe all\n01000200030004000000\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\nroxies recovered from HAK sediment, (a) BSi, (b) d13C and (c) C:N.\nour organic matter proxies as either warm or cold based on their sign of the correlation to d13C. Furthermore, the d13C is significantly correlated to density and MS, which allows us to give warm and cold rank to the physical proxies.\nThe HAK composite reflects stepwise changes in lake productivity, consistent with maximum warmth between 8 and 5.5 ka with incremental cooling at 5.5, 3.0, 1.5, and 0.7 ka. Following each of the steps, BSi re-equilibrates at a lower value (Figs. 5 and 9). Calculated TOCflux mimics the SAR curve in HAKwith greater values at 8.2 ka, 5.5 ka, 4.2, 3.0 and during the last 1.5 ka also coinciding with higher C:N ratios suggesting higher landscape instability and soil erosion in the catchment influencing the source of organic matter in the lake.\nPeaks in the composite of SAR, density, MS and TOC reflect cold summers and landscape destabilization. This interpretation is reinforced by the combined BSi, d13C and C:N plot that describes a decline in lake productivity."

    "text": "Accurate age control of sediment cores for the glacierdominated Hvítárvatn system (HVT) was obtained by splicing a varve chronology of the past 3 ka with a PSV-derived chronology for older sediment (Larsen et al., 2012). Both time intervals are constrained by a robust tephrochronology (Jóhannsdóttir, 2007; Jagan, 2010).\nLarsen et al. (2011, 2012) showed how physical characteristics of HVT sediment (density, MS, SAR and grain-size distribution) are primarily influenced by erosional products from the adjacent ice cap, Langjökull, and thus reflect ice-cap size. The HVT proxies were resampled in a similar manner as for HAK using the Analyseries software (Paillard et al., 1996) (Fig. 3). Bi-plots allowed a compositing of the HVT proxy records similar to the HAK system, although no clear breaks in bi-plots over time were apparent, presumably because unlike at HAK, TOC is always dominated by in-wash of\nterrestrial OM (either glacial or soil erosion). Despite the glacier influence at HVT the two records show similar patterns of environmental change (Fig. 9)."

    "heading": "5. Trends and departures during the Holocene in a glacial lake vs a non-glacial lake",
    "text": "By resampling, normalizing and compositing the climate proxies from the two lakes a comparison of the two records is facilitated (Fig. 9). Colder environments are characterized by high catchment erosion and eolian activity in HAK (high SAR, TOC and TOCflux, and low MS and density) and glacier erosion/advances in HVT accompanied by high rates of soil erosion (high SAR, MS and density). Warmer times are reflected in high BSi, low SAR, low C:N, stable TOC and depleted d13C in both lakes (Figs. 5, 6 and 9). Comparing the physical properties of the non-glaciated Haukadalsvatn sediment with Hvítárvatn sediment supports this interpretation but also accentuates the differences in the two lakes’ catchments and depositional processes during the Holocene.\n5.1. The Early Holocene and Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) (10e5.5 ka)\nThe earliest part of the lake records between 10 and 9 ka reflects a period of catchment stabilization by immigrating vegetation as the region equilibrates after millennia beneath an eroding ice sheet (Fig. 9). Short periods of destabilized hillsides and cooler summers occurred at w9.2, 8.7, 8.5 and culminating at 8.2 ka. The shifts toward cooler conditions are most distinct in the abrupt lowering of BSi in both lakes (Fig. 3). Each of the perturbations has a similar duration (w150 years), and is interpreted to represent pulses of major environmental disturbances. Although the same proxies from the two lake records show synchronous changes between 8.7 and 7.9 ka they do not react identically. While the cooling in the glacial lake HVT is reflected in low benthic diatom concentrations, increasing sediment density and MS, which all point toward rapid increases in water turbidity and minerogenic deposition, HAK shows a decrease in both MS and density. These proxy shifts reflect a substantial climate event(s) that initiated landscape destabilization and/or glacier activity in the watershed of HVT, while in HAK an elevated TOC and C:N associated with lower MS and density point toward increased eolian activity, soil erosion, and the consequent influx of organic matter and weathered mineral grains into HAK. Cooling beginning around 8.7 ka in both lakes and culminating between 8.3 and 7.9 reflects a longer, more complex, and stepwise cooling, than the short-lived climate excursion at 8.2 ka recorded in the Greenland ice cores or North Atlantic marine records (Alley et al., 1997; Alley and Ágústsdóttir, 2005; Thomas et al., 2007). We suggest that there may have been repeated increases in the flux of Laurentide Ice Sheet meltwater and/or episodes of explosive volcanism that beganw8.7 ka, with a maximum climate impact w8.2 ka.\nAll composite proxies show a sharp transition out of the 8 ka event and into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka and continuing warmwith some fluctuations until 5.5 ka (Fig. 9). This interval (7.9e 5.5 ka) defines the HTM in Iceland. This is an interval of low SAR, MS and density in both records and where TOC and C:N show little changes, indicating stable conditions in the watersheds and less erosion than previously. In HVT, benthic diatoms dominate, reflecting a non-turbid water column. Altogether, these records point to higher primary productivity and little or no glacial erosion, suggesting Langjökull was absent (Larsen et al., 2012). This is probably the only time during the Holocene where both lake catchments are affected by similar sedimentary processes. The BSi decrease in the HAK record between 7 and 6 ka is also detected in\nHVT where elevated C:N but lower of d13C occurs between 6.4 and 6.2 ka reflecting a 250-year cooling event that resulted in reduced lake productivity and landscape instability (Larsen et al., 2012). However, a lack of change in sedimentation rates in both lakes suggests that the duration or magnitude of inferred cooling was insufficient to initiate substantial growth of Langjökull (HVT) or to strip the landscape of vegetation (HAK). The reason for this temperature lowering seen in both lake records is unclear. However, multiple Icelandic volcanic effusive eruptions are known from this interval and could have released massive amounts of sulfur into the troposphere resulting in a local climate impact and affecting productivity in the lake systems. Between 6.2 and 5.5 ka both lake systems record the highest BSi values, and the low C:N indicates that organic matter is dominantly from aquatic sources."

    "heading": "5.2. Onset of the Neoglaciation (5.5 ka)",
    "text": "The composite records from both lakes indicate that the HTM ended w5.5 ka, with a shift toward increasingly cooler summers throughout the Late Holocene (Fig. 9). Superimposed on the firstorder summer cooling trend are abrupt shifts suggesting stepped changes in state that arenotdirectly linked to the steadilydecreasing insolation receipts. After 5.5 ka proxy responses begin to decouple (MS anddensity becomeelevated inHVTbut reduced inHAK) and in the HAK record there is a reversal in sign for the co-variations of several proxies (Section 4.3). This shift marks the onset of Neoglaciation, including the establishment of Langjökull, that remained as an increasingly dominating erosive agent in the HVT catchment, and the appearance of episodic catchment-scale soil erosion events in the HAK catchment as summers became progressively colder.\n5.3. Intensified Neoglaciation (4.2 ka to present)\nAfter 5.5 ka, departures from the orbitally forced summer cooling trend are apparent in both physical and OM proxies. As BSi decreases, peaks in TOC start to appear, indicating episodic erosion in the catchments of the lakes. The OM proxies show step-function changes about 4.2 ka, 3 ka, 1.5 ka, 0.7 ka and 0.2 ka, re-equilibrating at a lower mean value after each step (Fig. 5). The HVT proxy data imply periods of significant ice cap expansion at these steps (Larsen et al., 2011, 2012). Cooling steps in the HAK record are reflected in raised TOCflux, SAR and C:N suggesting abrupt catchment destabilization (Figs. 5 and 6). A major break at 1.5 ka in both records occurs during the Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP) suggesting that the North Atlantic system entered a cold state, which was interrupted by warmer Medieval times between 1.0 ka and 0.7 ka. This warm Medieval interval is superimposed on a millennial cold episode from 1.5 to 0.1 ka (Fig. 9). Although severe soil erosion in Iceland is frequently associated with human settlement w1.1 ka (dated to 871 2 AD; Grönvold et al., 1995), our reconstructions indicate that soil erosion began several centuries before settlement, during the DACP, whereas for several centuries after settlement (between 1.0 and 0.7), during the warmer Medieval times, there was little or no soil erosion. Only during the transition into and during the Little Ice Age (LIA) did soil erosion become a major feature of the record. The LIA is the most severe multi-centennial cold episode of the past 8 ka. The onset is marked by a dramatic increase in varve thickness in HVT together with elevated TOCflux and C:N values in both lakes beginning in the 13th Century. A more severe drop in summer temperatures follows this initial summer cooling after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 0.1 ka (Figs. 5, 6 and 9).\nThe different responses in the physical parameters of the two lakes reflect the difference between the lake settings after the HTM. Renewed glacier erosion in the HVT catchment brought an increasing flux of fresh clastic material as well as some soil erosion\n(Larsen et al., 2012). In contrast, the non-glaciated HAK catchment was more susceptible to changes in catchment vegetation that altered the efficiency of fluvial and eolian erosion. Decreased vegetation allowedmore organic-rich soil of lowMS anddensity to reach the lake. Comparing the average values of TOC in HAK before 1.5 ka (0.8%) and after (1.4%) together with more negative d13C and higher C:N supports this interpretation. Differences in response of proxies within the two catchments becomes particularly evident during the last ca 150 years, when the HAK record starts recovering from the cold LIA at ca 0.1 kawhile HVT is still “feeling” the LIA glaciation due to the delayed response of Langjökull, which reached its maximum extent in the mid-to-late 19th century (Larsen et al., 2011)."

    "heading": "5.4. Iceland as a proxy for the climate development of the North Atlantic",
    "text": "Iceland’s central location in the northern North Atlantic and terrestrial climate defined by the integrated influence of atmospheric circulation and ocean surface currents means that replicated well dated high resolution climate records could serve as a template for the greater North Atlantic region. Despite substantial\ndifferences in catchment specific processes that dominate the HVT and HAK records, the multi-proxy reconstructions are remarkably similar including abrupt and large-scale climate changes at 8.7e7.9, 7.0e6.0, 5.5, 4.2, 3.0, 1.5, and 0.7 ka (Fig. 9). Each event is characterized by colder summers associated with increased glacier activity in the Hvítárvatn catchment and increased soil erosion in the Haukadalsvatn catchment. The main differences detected in proxy responses between the lakes reflect the differences in the governing processes of the two catchments and their time constants, with a near-instantaneous reaction to cold and windier intervals in the HAK record compared to a delayed and less variable response in HVT reflecting the centennial response time of the ice cap.\nAlthough both lakes include evidence of a strong cold excursion centered on 8.2 ka, coincident with the large isotopic excursion in Greenland ice cores, this event in the lake records is part of a longer interval of suppressed summer temperatures between 8.7 and w7.9 ka. This scenario is supported by climate data from the North Atlantic, which show a similarly extended cooling interval (e.g. Rohling and Palike, 2005; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2010). Collectively, these records suggest similar or additional forcings may have preconditioned the North Atlantic prior to the 8.2 ka catastrophic release of\ndependency. Composite plot is derived by combining those proxies with significant con of the co-variation about 5.5 ka in the bi-plots indicates a system change at that time.\nice-dammed lakes from the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet. Such preconditioning would make the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) more sensitive to the disturbance from the fresh water flood (Tindall and Valdes, 2011).\nThe peak in summer temperatures from our combined lake records indicate that the HTM occurred after 8 ka, lagging peak insolation forcing by 3 ka (Berger and Loutre, 1991) and the Greenland ice core records by more than 2 ka (Fig. 9). This was presumably due to the lingering effect of the Laurentide Ice Sheet resulting in intensification of the East Greenland Current and weakening of the AMOC (Kaufman et al., 2004; Kaplan and Wolfe,\n2006; Geirsdóttir et al., 2009a). Marine records from the shelf of Iceland also record the HTM beginning w8 ka (Eiríksson et al., 2000; Castañeda et al., 2004; Kristjánsdóttir, 2005; Justwan et al., 2008; Knudsen et al., 2008; Ran et al., 2008; Quillmann et al., 2010). Quantitative estimates of the magnitude of peak Holocene warmth from marine, lacustrine, and glacier reconstructions indicate summer temperatures w3.5 C higher than the 1961e1990 average for Iceland (Flowers et al., 2007; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2010). A cooling around 6.4 ka in our lake records is consistent with a cooling seen in foraminiferal and diatom-based sea surface reconstructions from the north shelf of Iceland (Andersen et al., 2004;\nGiraudeau et al., 2004; Ran et al., 2008) suggesting a stronger influence of the East Iceland Current at that time, although the mechanism explaining these changes remains obscure.\nIt has long been recognized that the Late Holocene witnessed intermittent expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice masses (Porter and Denton, 1967; Wanner et al., 2008). The onset of Neoglaciation at 5.5 ka in our records is similar to ages reported from both sides of the North Atlantic, suggesting a common cause (Mayewski et al., 2004; Wanner et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2010). Previous studies in Iceland based on glacial geological and marine core records have suggested glacier growth as early as 6 to 5 ka with evidence for intermittent cooling and glacier expansion taking place at various times from mid- to late Holocene (e.g. Gudmundsson, 1997; Geirsdóttir et al., 2009a). However, these studies are commonly discontinuous with infrequent 14C dates or limiting ages derived from independently dated tephra above or belowa till. The relatively large age uncertainties in those records preclude a direct comparison with our high SAR lake sediment cores synchronized with the welldated marine core MD99-2269. If late Holocene glacial advances around theNorthAtlantic have a common cause,we expect precisely dated records of glacier advance to form discrete temporal clusters, although differences in glacier response times precludes an exact match for all records. Chironomid studies of the lacustrine sediments of the lake Lögurinn, eastern Iceland, suggest cooling or a longer periodof ice cover by 5.4 ka althoughonset ofNeoglaciation is not set until 4.4 kawhen a return to glacio-lacustrine conditions in the lake took place. Lake Lögurinn records the maximum Holocene Eyjabakkajökull extent during the Little Ice Age (Striberger et al., 2012).\nOur paleoclimate reconstructions from the two lakes exhibit distinctly non-linear responses to simple insolation forcing, indicating strong local to regional feedbacks that modulate the primary insolation forcing (Figs. 9 and 10). This is particularly clear in the Neoglacial growth of Langjökull as seen in the HVT sediment record (Flowers et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2012). The final, most extreme cooling since 8 ka began at 0.7 ka and marks the LIA onset in both lake records. LIA climate resulted in intensive landscape destabilization and the maximum Holocene stand of Langjökull (Geirsdóttir et al., 2009b; Larsen et al., 2012). The Equilibrium Line Altitude lowering during peak LIA conditions implies a w1 C temperature decrease relative to present, suggesting a total Holocene temperature change of 4.5 C, from peak HTM to peak LIA summer conditions (Flowers et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2012).\nThe mechanisms that might explain such a variable cryospheric response to linear forcing have been debated for decades. Recent summaries (Wanner et al., 2008, 2011) suggest a complex suite of explanations were involved, including meltwater, solar irradiance, explosive volcanism, AMOC variability and internal unforced dynamics. Our data already demonstrates that the onset of the LIA, the most extreme multi-centennial departure in our records, was abrupt (Miller et al., 2012) with the onset linked to an unusual 50- year-long episode with four large sulfur-rich explosive eruptions. Although explosive volcanism is a potential trigger for abrupt climate change, sustaining volcanic perturbations to the climate system requires strong positive feedbacks involving ocean and atmospheric circulation and changes in sea ice. The extent of sea ice in the waters around Iceland is linked to the strength of the AMOC. This was discernable during the “Great Salinity Anomaly” in the 1970’s (Dickson et al., 1988) when a vast discharge of Arctic sea ice impeded the thermohaline convective overturning in the North Atlantic, resulting in a significant cooling in the North Atlantic area and Iceland (www.vedur.is; Mysak and Power,1992; Mauritzen and Hakkinen, 1997). Moros et al. (2006) reconstruct ice-rafted debris (IRD) based on quartz weight percent in the MD99-2269 marine core from the shelf north of Iceland (Fig. 1). The most conspicuous feature is the change in quartz from a relatively low baseline level\nrecorded during the mid-Holocene to increasing input after 5.5 ka with a similar trend recorded in sediment cores from the East Greenland Shelf (Andrews et al., 1997; Jennings et al., 2002). Moros et al. (2006) suggest that the increasing input of drift ice and fresh water in the East Greenland Current areas caused a shift in and a strengthening of the Polar Front after ca 5.5 ka and especially after 4 ka when the North Atlantic Drift and East Greenland Current IRD proxy records differ significantly. The period after approximately 3.7 ka was climatically unstable, similar to what is detected in our lake cores and in two marine cores (Ólafsdóttir, 2010; Ólafsdóttir et al., 2010). Increasing climate variability in the Late Holocene is also evident in the d18O record in the Renland, East Greenland (Vinther et al., 2008) (Fig. 10).\nThe similarity between our high resolution records from HAK and HVTand themarine records from around Iceland and the North Atlantic suggests that the proxy records from HAK and HVT are reflecting changes in ocean currents and sea ice export and consequently provide the clear indications of past climate variability for the NW North Atlantic region, but at higher resolution and with more precise chronologies than previously reported."

    "heading": "6. Conclusion",
    "text": "The climate reconstructions derived from the glacial lake Hvítárvatn and the non-glacial lake Haukadalsvatn reveal distinct, non-linear changes that constitute some of the most coherent terrestrial evidence from Iceland for widespread, quasi-periodic abrupt Holocene climate shifts. The unusually high sediment accumulation rates characteristic of Icelandic lakes and shelves, coupled with secure geochronologies (210Pb, 137Cs, 14C, PSV synchronization, tephrochronology, and varves in glacier-dominated lakes) allows the development of precisely dated high-resolution records of climate through the Holocene, which is essential to evaluate the causes behind abrupt climate change.\nDespite differences in geographic settings of the HAK and HVT lake basins both records indicate an approximately 2500-year-long interval of HTM conditions beginning w7.9 ka, followed by a threshold change at w5.5 ka and the onset of Neoglaciation. The orbitally forced first-order cooling trend reflected in the lake records after 5.5 ka is interrupted by abrupt step-function shifts, recording changes in the state of the catchments, including increases in periglacial activity and decreases in vegetation cover at 4.2 ka, 3.0 ka and 1.5 ka, and culminating in the Little Ice Age (LIA) between 0.7 and 0.1 ka. The combined lake records demonstrate that landscape instability and soil erosion preceded human colonization of Iceland by several centuries, and that for several centuries after settlement soil erosion was reduced. Although changes in land use and deforestation associated with the settlement, probably made the region more susceptible to disturbance from natural climate variability, the initiation of landscape instability at the beginning of the LIA appears to be unrelated to human activity. Because Iceland’s climate is dominated by North Atlantic circulation, our synchronized records may provide a template for other land areas around the northern North Atlantic and GreenlandIceland and the Norwegian (GIN) seas."

  "abstractText": "Two high-sediment-accumulation-rate Icelandic lakes, the glacial lake Hvítárvatn and the non-glacial lake Haukadalsvatn, contain numerous tephra layers of known age, which together with highresolution paleomagnetic secular variations allow synchronization with a well-dated marine core from the shelf north of Iceland. A composite standardized climate record from the two lakes provides a single time series that efficiently integrates multi-proxy data that reflect the evolution of summer temperatures through the Holocene. The first-order trends in biogenic silica (BSi), d13C, and C:N rise relatively abruptly following deglaciation, reaching maximum values shortly after 8 ka following a complex minimum between 8.7 and 8.0 ka. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the lakes is marked by all proxies, with a sharp transition out of the 8 ka cold event into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka, and continuing warm with some fluctuations until 5.5 ka. Decreasing summer insolation after the HTM is reflected by incremental cooling, initially w5.5 ka, with subsequent cold perturbations recorded by all proxies 4.3 to 4.0 ka and 3.1 to 2.8 ka. The strongest disturbance occurred after 2 ka with initial summer cooling occurring between 1.4 and 1.0 ka, followed by a more severe drop in summer temperatures after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 0.2 ka. Following each late Holocene cold departure, BSi re-equilibrated at a lower value independent of the sediment accumulation rate. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in the highlands of Iceland. The similarity in timing, direction and magnitude of our multi-proxy records from glacial and non-glacial lakes, and from the adjacent marine shelf, suggests that our composite record reflects large-scale shifts in ocean/atmosphere circulation throughout the northern North",
