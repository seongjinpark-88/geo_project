    "text": "The world's sediment strata hold an enormous paleoenvironmental archive. Reading and interpreting this archive has for practical reasons focused on abundant microfossils and other fine sediment particles sampled by coring. However, sediments also contain paleoenvironmental information in the form of relatively large, sparse objects, such as vertebrate bones or wood, missed or destroyed by coring; their story may require extensive, eroding outcrops and years of collecting for meaningful interpretations. This paper deals with objects of this sort—widely dispersed lithic erratics, pebble to cobble size, occurring in three shallow Middle Miocene marine strata (hereafter referred to as beds), part of the ca. 18–8 Ma, fossil-rich Miocene deposits outcropping along the Calvert Cliffs on the western shore of the Maryland Chesapeake Bay. The three beds were laid down in a shallow, open embayment, called the Calvert Sea (Fig. 1), of the western Atlantic Ocean.\nThe erratics are here attributed to deposition from driftwood, not ice, during the Middle Miocene Climate Optimum. The age of the host strata and the nature and origin of the MMCO, when global temperatures may have been 3 °C higher than today (e.g., Tripati et al., 2009) is reevaluated. Our term “driftwood dropstones” denotes entrapment\nniversity of California at Santa\nrights reserved.\nin the roots of trees, which were occasionally uprooted along river banks in floods, perhaps associated with transgressions, and carried out to sea. Erratic pebbles in marine sediments are often attributed to ice-rafting, and may become unchallenged cold-climate proxies. However, there are other ways to transport lithic erratics into the sea. Bennett et al. (1996) review ‘dropstones’ and caution against uncritical identification of dropstones as IRD (Ice-Rafted Detritus).\nAbout 225 lithic erratics (pebbles and cobbles) were collected over more than a decade from Shattuck's (1904) “zones” #12, 13 and 14 (hereafter referred to as “beds”, following Ward and Andrews, 2008). We also use some of the nomenclature introduced by Kidwell (1984, 1997): She designated units (packets) of two to three beds, as well as the disconformities at the base of these units, by a two-letter abbreviation for the formation or member (e.g., CT for Choptank Formation), followed by a digit indicating stratigraphic position. Thus, CT0 denotes the basal unit of the Choptank Formation, and also the disconformity at the base of the unit.\nThe Calvert Cliffs form a 50 km-long series of seacliffs, ca. 10–30 m high, along the western shore of the Maryland Chesapeake Bay (Figs. 1, 2). The three beds (Fig. 3), described in many papers (e.g., Kidwell, 1997; Ward and Andrews, 2008), belong to the upper Plum Point Member of the Calvert Formation. This member and the overlying Choptank Formation are traceable over a ca. 9000 km2 area of the Maryland and Virginia coastal plain (Kidwell, 1984). The sampled beds are Langhian to perhaps early Serravalian in age, but more accurate direct dating (e.g., Browning et al., 2006) remains uncertain.\nUsing lithology and paleoenvironments, we propose relating the beds indirectly to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations driven by volume changes in the Antarctic ice sheet. Although detailed age assignments differ among investigators (Kidwell, 1997; Section 5 in present paper), the three sampled beds were deposited during an anomalous and enigmatic interval of climate history: the ca. 16–14 Ma Middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO; e.g. Tripati et al., 2009) and the ‘Monterey’ carbon isotope excursion, a period of anomalously high 13C (16.4–13.6 Ma; Holbourn et al., 2007)."

    "heading": "2. Lithology of beds 12–14",
    "text": "Beginning in the 19th century, many geologists have studied the Calvert Cliffs Miocene marine strata; the following summary is partly based on a recent review (Ward and Andrews, 2008):\nBed 12 (Parkers Creek Bone Bed) is a distinctive light chocolate brown, slightly muddy to clean sand unit ca. 30 cm thick (thickening updip), rich in disarticulated vertebrate remains, with a sparse, poorly preserved molluscan assemblage. Carbonized wood fragments and pebbles are present in low concentrations. The underlying Bed 11 is a blue-gray sandy clay, barren of macrofossils. The base of bed 12 is burrowed, but the burrows are short.\nBed 13 (Glossus–Chione interval of Kidwell, 1984) is a shell-poor, blocky, silty clay, ca. 1–2 m thick in the sampling area. Relatively well preserved vertebrate remains have been found. Ward and Andrews (2008) combine beds 12 and 13 into a single unit, with bed 13 the deeper-water part of a transgressive sequence. However, this is inconsistent with the diversity of planktonic foraminera (Gibson, 1983) and sedimentological analyses (Kidwell, 1989; 1997) that beds 11 and 12 were deposited in the deepest (40–50 m), furthest offshore, fully marine environment. A sediment-starved deepshelf environment, in which the coastal current winnowed out clay and silt, would also explain the sandy character of Bed 12.\nBed 14 (Kenwood Beach Shell Bed of Kidwell, 1984) is a semiconsolidated, shelly fine sand–silt–clay mixture, its molluscan fauna moderately diverse. Up to four discrete shelly interbeds are locally present, separated by less fossiliferous layers of muddy fine sand, with burrowed discontinuities separating the units. The interbeds are not present further updip (Kidwell, 1984). The top of bed 13 is burrowed, suggesting a hiatus in deposition. Bed 14 is about 1–2 m thick in the sampling area, up to 4.5 m elsewhere. Widely scattered carbonized wood fragments, vertebrate remains, and pebbles/cobbles occur. Kidwell (1984, 1997) placed a disconformity at the bed 13–14 contact, but no basal lag deposits (e.g., pebbles or bone) or root fillings in bed 13 were observed in the pebble collection area. According to Kidwell (1997) bed 14 was deposited in a relatively shallow marine, but not littoral environment during a transgressive phase, with the overlying shell-poor bed 15, with relatively more clay, deposited in deeper water. However the general absence of barnacles on pecten shells, and the plentiful shark teeth and bones of large marine vertebrates are more consistent with deeper shelf water for bed 14 as well.\nThe mollusk shells in bed 14 and particularly in bed 12 are crumbly, apparently altered, especially in contrast with shells from the overlying Choptank Formation."

    "heading": "3. Dropstone characteristics",
    "text": "Bennett et al. (1996, p. 332) define a dropstone as a “clast of anomalous size and/or lithology, indicative of vertical or oblique introduction into the host sediment”. The clasts discussed here are dropstones largely due to size (>1 cm, much larger than the surrounding matrix). The sea bed lacked bottom currents or wave action strong enough to move such clasts, as shown by the limited shell fragmentation, with many bivalves in life position (e.g., Kidwell, 1984) and widely scattered articulated cetacean skulls.\nOf the ca. 225 dropstones collected to date from beds 12 to 14, 191 (Fig. 4A) were collected between 1982 and 1992 by Wallace A. Ashby along ca. 3 km of the Calvert Cliffs between the community of Governors Run and the mouth of Parkers Creek. While these beds crop out along a longer stretch of cliffs, they are only accessible from the beach in the study area. Within this area, bed 12 is only exposed above sea level along the northern 1 km portion, bed 13 is accessible along the northern 2 km, and bed 14 along the southern 2 km. Even within these outcrop sections, outcrops are missing at many ravine mouths, and at any time portions of the beds are obscured by vegetation or slide debris. The 191 clasts were described by J. Glaser, a field geologist (Glaser, 1971) with the Maryland Geological Survey. Glaser, most familiar with the geology of Maryland could best evaluate rock provenance. The exact clast locationwithin each bedwas unfortunately not recorded, but clasts appeared scattered throughout each bed, not concentrated as basal lags. The Ashby–Glaser clasts (Fig. 4A), ca. 5 to\n100 mm in diameter, were characterized by source bed, degree of roundness, lithology, and, based on lithology, the likely original provenance . We add “original” because, except for angular/subangular specimens, dropstones may have been carried into the ocean in two or more stages, with temporary deposition along river banks.\nOf the 191 samples (and rounded to the nearest 1%), 24% were collected from bed 12, 4% from bed 13, and 70% from bed 14. Inspection did not suggest systematic differences in clasts from one bed to another, so we lumped the samples together. About 12% are angular, 30% subangular, 39% subrounded, and 19% rounded. Their lithology comprises quartz or vein quartz, 38%; microcrystalline quartz, 12%; quartzite and metaquartzite, a few of which micaceous or feldspathic, 14%; precipitates, mainly phosphorite, 15%; siltstone, metasiltstone, sandstone and chert, 21%; and gneiss and schist, 3%.\nIn associating clast lithologywith provenance, as judged frommodern surface geology, we allow for the thickness of material eroded from the land surface in the ca. 15 Ma since the dropstones were removed from the outcrop area. Most clasts suggest a Piedmont origin (see below), and the Piedmont has sufferedmore downward erosion than the Appalachians and Allegheny Plateau. Based on long-term erosion rates of ca. 20 m/Ma (e.g., Stanford et al., 2002) the erratics were probably quarried from a surface nomore than ca. 300 mhigher in the crust than at present. Given the dimensions of typical lithologic units, the 15 Ma surficial geology was probably not substantially different from the present.\nThe likely original provenance of 97% of the Ashby–Glaser collection could only be assigned to provinces: Coastal Plain, including in situ precipitation (phosphorites, etc.), 22% of samples; Piedmont, 57%; western Piedmont or Appalachians, 11%; western Piedmont, Blue Ridge or Appalachians, 3%; and Appalachians, 4%. The remaining 3% (mostly quartz diorite gneiss), also of Piedmont origin, were the only clasts reasonably attributed to a known source, the Port Deposit Gneiss, near the mouth of the modern Susquehanna, about 120 km NNE of the collection site. Although a single feldspathic clast (anorthosite?) may be of New York state origin, no samples require a northern (e.g. Hudson River watershed) origin. No certain Allegheny Plateau samples are present.\nSome clasts collected after 1992 were described in detail by D. Vanko (personal communication, 2006). This smaller sample (Fig. 4A) appears similar to the Ashby–Glaser collection. However, Vanko's descriptions of several specimens are more detailed. Their potential for localizing provenance gives three metamorphic clasts (here labeled MC-1, MC-2, and MC-3) special significance, so we repeat these descriptions here:\nMC-1 is a subangular/subrounded, weathered cobble ca. 5×3×2 cm, probably granodiorite, with porphyritic texture, cm-scale crystals of quartz and feldspar in a finer, biotite-bearing matrix, and some phenocrysts with a granophyric texture.\nMC-2 is a subangular/subrounded, highly weathered cobble ca. 12×6×3 cm (one of the largest dropstones), a garnet–biotite gneiss, with >50% granular crystals (quartz, feldspar and garnet) and b50% biotite.\nMC-3 is a subangular/subrounded, highly weathered cobble ca. 5×4×2 cm, from bed 14. The clast is a medium-grained, epidote (?)–chlorite–biotite–quartz schist, with original biotite in relict cores altered to chlorite rims. MC-3 may be hydrothermally altered intermediate volcanic rock."

    "heading": "4. The case for driftwood transport",
    "text": "Because ice-rafting is commonly invoked to account for lithic debris in marine sediments (see Bennett et al., 1996 for examples), we first eliminate ice as a plausible transport mechanism. Ice can raft rocks as marine grounded or shore-ice, freshwater ice carried into the sea by rivers, and icebergs. Although the headwater regions of\nthe Susquehanna River were glaciated during maximum Laurentide ice sheet advances, no large northern hemisphere Cenozoic ice sheets were present until ca. 2.75 Ma (Ruddiman, 2008). The highest topography in the present mid-Atlantic watersheds did not support separate glaciers even during the Quaternary. None of the dropstones showed the striations observed in some glacial cobbles.\nIce rafting by marine shore-fast or grounded sea ice is also eliminated—the Mid-Atlantic climates were considerably warmer, during the deposition of beds 12–14, compared to historic times, and no shore-fast or sea ice has been observed historically along the Atlantic coast . However, freshwater river ice forms on the Susquehanna and Chesapeake during cold winters. Such ice may occasionally reach 10 cm and more in thickness (first author's personal observations), and could carry pebbles from river banks into the Chesapeake Bayor directly into the Atlantic. However, there is no observational record of pebbles trapped in river ice grounded on Chesapeake beaches. Moreover, freshwater river ice would not long survive even in the modern, saline coastal Atlantic, where winter water temperatures remain well above freezing. Of course, we cannot prove that none of the Miocene dropstones were transported by river ice in exceptionally cold winters.\nSome animals, including marine tetrapods, more specifically otariid pinnipeds (Taylor, 1993) and crocodilians, ingest pebbles or even cobbles, either by accident or intentionally, to aid digestion or, more likely, to control buoyancy and aid underwater swimming (Taylor, 1993). Are some or all of the dropstones described above gizzard stones (gastroliths)? We think not: some gastroliths are typically not only round but also worn even smoother than water-worn pebbles, and none of our dropstones are unusually smooth. Many are angular or subangular, and some are friable and weathered. Most vertebrate bones recovered from the Calvert Cliffs are cetaceans, which rarely ingest stones; no vertebrate remains quarried from these strata were associated with erratics (S. Godfrey, personal communication, 2010). Gastroliths are typically found in small clusters, whereas all our dropstones were isolated. Of course, one cannot prove that none of the dropstones—particularly rounded pebbles— ever passed through the gut of an animal.\nProjectile dropstones, such as volcanic bombs and pumice, meteorites, and coral fragments (Bennett et al., 1996) can be eliminated because none were found. Pebble to cobble sized coprolites have been collected from these strata (particularly bed 14), but none are present in our collection. Although turbidity flows can carry coarse material, no graded sediment units, suggestive of such flows, have been identified in the Calvert Cliffs. Vegetation can raft rocks in a variety of ways: as kelp holdfasts, in marshy vegetation rafts, and trapped in the roots of trees. Giant kelp is not known from the Miocene coastal Atlantic; moreover, kelp holdfasts are frequently bored and encrusted with shallow-water organisms (Emery, 1965). None of our erratics were bored or encrusted. Vegetation rafts cannot be ruled out, but fine sediments, not solitary cobbles, are more likely to have been transported by such rafts, broken loose from coastal marshes.\nElimination of other transport mechanisms leaves rafting in the roots of riverbank trees uprooted in floods, or coastal trees eroded during transgressions, and carried out to sea. Tree-root rafting was already recognized by Charles Darwin (Bennett et al., 1996), and was inferred to account for lithic erratics in coal deposits (e.g., Spencer, 1887) and Maastrichtian to Danian limestones (Noe-Nygaard, 1975). Trees floating in modern seas and rivers or washed up on beaches are often observed to be carrying lithic debris in their roots (e.g., Fig. 4D).\nWhile driftwood dropstones in aquatic sediments need not be associated with fossil wood (Bennett et al., 1996), carbonized wood is common in some of the Miocene strata - particularly bed 14 (Fig. 4C; Kidwell, 1984). Typical fragments are 1–5 cm by 2–25 cm in cross section, and commonly bored by teredinid bivalves (shipworms). No detailed data were collected, but fragments in bed 14 are locally spaced only 1–5 m apart. Wood frequency appears to mimic pebble frequency, with the greatest number in bed 14, least in bed 13. Those in bed 14 appear from limited observations to be concentrated in the interbeds between shelly layers, suggesting provenance, deposition and rapid burial during periods of flooding on land and high sedimentation rates offshore. An entire pebble-containing root ball of a tree would be ‘smoking gun’ evidence for driftwood dropstones, but none has been observed. Floating trees probably disintegrated gradually, with both trapped dropstones and slivers of decayed, water-logged wood intermittently spalling off and sinking to the bottom.\nFloral remains from Calvert Cliffs Miocene beds include palynomorphs, carbonized seeds, pine cones, leaf impressions and wood, showing the nearby land to have supported a scrub oak and pine forest (Visaggi and Godfrey, 2010). Carbonized wood fragments found in beds 12 and 14 (e.g., Fig. 4C) are prima facie evidence for forests growing along or near the shores of rivers. Berry (1916) present macrofossil evidence from the lower Calvert Formation exposures near their landward limit: Coastal forests, dominated by baldcypress (Taxodium spp.) included broadleafed Quercus, Ulmus, and Platanus.\nThe concentration of both dropstones and carbonized wood in beds 12 and 14 (bone and shell-rich sands), but not in 13 (mud), has two ‘end member’ interpretations: If the average flux of dropstone-bearing trees into the Miocene seas was constant over time, and if the distance to shore did not vary, then the concentration difference implies much faster sedimentation during bed 13 time than before and after. In that case, both beds 12 and 14 are condensed deposits and record the most time. “Condensation” is a relative term, generally in relation to coeval thicker, more complete downdip strata. Because independent evidence (e.g., Kidwell, 1989) suggests only bed 12 was deposited in a sediment-starved environment in deeper water farther from shore, bed 14 may be condensed for a different reason— more wave action and bottom water motion closer to shore, but still outside the littoral regime. In that scenario, bed 13 was deposited offshore, between the sediment-starved regime of bed 12 and the current/wave influenced regime of bed 14. To first order this hypothesis also accounts for the higher concentrations of mollusks (e.g., Kidwell, 1997; Ward and Andrews, 2008), fossil shark teeth (Visaggi and Godfrey, 2010) and other vertebrate remains in bed 12 (especially) and 14, vs in bed 13. Alternatively, relatively high abundances of shark teeth, fossil wood and dropstones in beds 12 and 14 largely reflect changing climates, river flood frequencies, and ocean currents and/or different ocean productivities during those times. The very high concentration of shark teeth in bed 12 may be more due to the fact that sharks were more plentiful in deeper water (Visaggi and Godfrey, 2010) than to sediment starvation (condensation), or it might reflect a combination of the two conditions. In any case, if bed 12 (and perhaps also 14) represents deeper water, outer shelf environments, the presence of fossil wood and dropstones in those beds means that driftwood must have floated that far out into the ocean. Driftwood-rafted erratics land on remote modern islands (e.g., Emery, 1965). Because none of the dropstones were barnacleencrusted, the driftwood probably did not remain at sea long, consistent with provenance not farther than the Susquehanna watershed.\nThe provenance of driftwood dropstones was largely Piedmont and Coastal Plain, with a handful from the Appalachians, and few or no clasts from further north or west. Several of the metamorphics apparently came from the Port Deposit Gneiss, still exposed along the lower modern Susquehanna. The southward transport from there to the collection site is consistent with a modern-like south-flowing coastal current. We suspect that most of the dropstones originated in the lower (Piedmont) part of the Miocene Susquehannawatershed, with rounded ones perhaps later reworked from pebbly river-bank deposits on the inner Coastal Plain."

    "heading": "5. Age, paleoenvironments, and glacioeustatic correlations",
    "text": "The origin and paleoenvironmental significance of the dropstones cannot be understood without reference to the ages and regional paleoenvironments at time of deposition. Above, we cited warmmiddle Miocene climates as evidence against ice-rafting. We therefore begin by evaluating the ages of sediments in the Calvert Cliffs, and more specifically the age of sampled beds 12–14.\nOrbitally forced (“Milankovitch”) climate controls are commonly suspected wherever quasi-cyclic sediment successions are observed, provided the “quasi-cycles” are of the order 10s to 100 s of ka. The middle Miocene sediment succession observed in the Calvert Cliffs has long been recognized as quasi-cyclic, with generally sandier, mollusk-rich strata alternating with more clay-rich, shell-poor ones. Kidwell (1984) described the sequences as “conspicuously cyclic”, and suspected glacioeustatic forcing. Vogt and Eshelman (1987) speculated that this cyclicity might reflect Milankovitch-type sea level fluctuations caused by Antarctic ice volume changes. However, the 413 ka eccentricity “cycle” could not have paced the Calvert Cliffs record unless several cycles are ‘missing’ at unconformities (Vogt and Eshelman, 1987).\nSubsequent borehole transects on the New Jersey margin (e.g., Browning et al., 2006) show the Miocene sediments exposed in the Calvert Cliffs strata to be thin, landward fringes (e.g., Kidwell, 1997) of correlative regional successions. Browning et al. (2006) also suggested volumetric fluctuations in the Antarctic ice sheet, causing eustatic sea level changes, as the principal driver for the observed lithologic changes. We consider the ca. 1.2 Ma modulation of the 41 ka obliquity cycle (Fig. 5; Paelike, 2004; Paelike et al., 2006; see also St. John, 2008) as the most plausible dominant astronomic pacer recorded in these sequences. This is supported by 18O/16O records from some deep sea cores, e.g. ODP Site 1146, which for the period 16.9–13.5 Ma shows significant power in the 41 ka (obliquity) band and its 1.2 Ma modulation (Holbourn et al., 2007). Browning et al.'s (2006; their Fig. 10) Cape May section shows eleven sequences from 10 to 24 Ma, an average of 1.27 Ma per sequence. Obliquity is a likely driver for middle Miocene Antarctic ice sheet response (Warny et al., 2009); because little sunlight falls on polar ice sheets in winter, the summer insolation angle probably controlled East Antarctic ice sheet expansion and contraction. As suggested by Langebroek et al. (2009), the relatively small East Antarctic ice sheet—prior to its dramatic expansion ca. 13.9–13.8 Ma—was particularly vulnerable to large, orbitally paced volume fluctuations."

    "heading": "5.1. Antarctic ice Sheet expansion 13.9 Ma recorded in the Calvert Cliffs?",
    "text": "The East-Antarctic ice sheet Expjansion (EAISE in Figs. 3 and 5), and the ca. 15.7–15.5 Ma peak warmth of the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO in Figs. 3 and 5; e.g., Warny et al., 2009; Fig. 11 of Browning et al., 2009) represent the twomost prominent global climate events of the epoch, and both fall within the time interval recorded in the Calvert Cliffs. By their exceptional character, both eventsmay be unusual climate excursions, with some combination of orbital and nonastronomical forcing, together with feedback effects. The MMCO was probably associated with higher eustatic sea level, and the EAISE with\na dramatic drop in sea level. Both global climate events should have been recorded in the middle part of the Calvert Cliffs Miocene strata. We propose they were—within age-dating uncertainties—as features unique in the ca. 18–8 Ma interval represented in the outcrops.\nThe 13.9 Ma EAISE was modeled e.g. by Langebroek et al. (2009) as a threshold effect of gradually declining CO2 concentrations and orbitally paced insolation changes. Shevenell et al. (2008) attributed 80% of the dramatic increase in 18O anomaly (Fig. 5) to ice growth, and suggested the ice growth was in part due to increased pacing by eccentricity. In any case, the cryosphere expansion must have effected a relatively abrupt ca. 43 m eustatic sea level drop (e.g., Langebroek et al., 2009). Such sea level falls should have rejuvenated streams and caused new valleys to be cut into gently sloping near-shore sediments. The only channel of significant scale (Kidwell, 1997) exposed in the ca. 18–8 Ma, 50 km long Calvert Cliffs is about 3 km wide in north–south exposure and was incised ca. 5–8 m into upper Calvert Formation strata, and where exposed forms the boundary between the Calvert and Choptank formations. This Governors Run Channel was then filled largely by fine sand. Although older than the age assigned by Browning et al. (2006; their Fig. 11) for the base of the Choptank Formation (the CT-0 disconformity of Kidwell, 1984), our suggested 13.9 Ma age lies within the error bars of Browning et al.'s Fig. 11. If we are correct, the time gap at the PP-3 disconformity was short, consistent with the absence of a basal lag. This interpretation would also increase the age of the base of bed 14 from ca. 13.1 (Browning et al., 2006) to ca. 14.5 Ma. We infer that beds 12–14 all predate the ca. 13.9 Ma expansion of the East Antarctic ice sheet and thus record warm climates, free of winter river ice."

(2006) with extension into Miocene.\nboth water temperatures and glacier ice volumes, the main contributor in Pre-Pliocene times being the Antarctic ice sheet. One such warming began gradually and intermittently after ca. 29 Ma, but terminated rather abruptly ca. 14 Ma. The generally warmest portion, ca. 16–14 Ma MMCO (e.g. Tripati et al., 2009) roughly corresponds to the ‘Monterey carbon excursion’ (16.9–13.5 Ma; Holbourn et al., 2007), an enigmatic period of anomalously abundant 13C carbon, relative to 12C.\nAs suggested by stacked oxygen isotope anomalies from ocean floor coring, the 16–14 Ma climate and ice volume was itself oscillatory, plausibly by the 1.2 and 2.4 Ma modulation of the obliquity cycle (Fig. 5; Paelike, 2004; Paelike et al., 2006; Holbourn et al., 2007). The isotope anomaly curve of Browning et al. (2009, their Fig. 11), created by splicing isotope data from different boreholes, places the peak warmth of the MMCO ca. 15.7–14.7 Ma, between marine isotope stages Mi2 and Mi3a. We refer to this interval as pMMCO.\nThe MMCO (ca. 16–14 Ma) was generally the warmest part of the Miocene, with global temperatures averaging about 3–6 °C warmer than present, and was the only time in the last 20 Ma when CO2 concentrations exceeded the 2009 CE level of 387 ppm (Tripati et al., 2009). Peak MMCO CO2 concentrations are estimated (You et al., 2009) to have reached 460–580 ppm, causing global average temperatures ca. 3 °C higher than today. However, estimating CO2 concentrations from proxy data has large uncertainties (e.g., Ruddiman, 2010), and other investigators had earlier inferred much lower CO2 levels (220–250 ppm) for the Middle Miocene (e.g., Pagani et al., 1999).\nWhile the cause for the MMCO remains uncertain, CO2 emissions from volcanic activity, previously proposed to have been globally high during the mid-Miocene (e.g., Vogt, 1979), may have contributed. If volcanogenic greenhouse warming occurred, it would most likely have been associated with the exceptionally volatile-rich (Lange, 2002) subaerial Columbia River Flood Basalts (CRFB; Hooper et al., 2007). CRFB eruptions climaxed with the Grande Ronde basalt flows, emplaced during the interval 15.99–15.57 Ma (Barry et al., 2010). This interval corresponds (Figs. 3, 5) within dating uncertainties to the pMMCO—making a causal connection at least plausible. Volcanogenic, mantle-derived CO2 would have a carbon isotopic composition of about −50/00 (e.g., Cui et al., 2011), which would cause a positive carbon isotope excursion in the ocean–atmosphere system unless canceled out by warming-related release of lighter carbon, e.g. from methane hydrate dissociation. The enigmatic middle Miocene “Monterey” positive carbon-isotope excursion (ca. 16.0– 13.5 Ma; e.g., Holbourn et al., 2007) might be partly the result of anomalously high volcanogenic CO2 release. Moreover, based on the effects of the comparatively modest Icelandic Laki (1783 CE; 14 km3 basalt) flood basalts on Europe (Grattan, 2005), it seems likely that eastern North American forests were intermittently impacted (e.g., acid rain, causing tree mortality) by the CRFB ca. 3000 to 3500 km upwind.\nHowever, estimates of volcanic contributions of CO2, beginning with Leavitt (1982; see also Self et al., 2006, and Saunders, 2006), have suggested that direct volcanic degassing effects-even from flood basalts—on global atmospheric CO2 are modest. For example, Caldeira and Rampino (1990) estimated the greenhouse warming caused by CO2 release from the ca. 65 Ma Deccan Traps to have been less than 1 °C. The North Atlantic (Brito-Arctic) flood basalt episode was the next youngest major magmatic episode in the geological record, and at ca. 55 Ma is closely correlated with the 55.9 Ma PETM (Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum), when global temperatures warmed by ca. 5 to 9 °C over a few thousand years (ca. 19 ka according to Cui et al., 2011), a total warming roughly twice that of the MMCO. However, the 55.9 Ma basalts mainly intruded subseafloor sediments, suggesting methane hydrate dissociation and organic carbon release from coal seams as a greenhouse contributor (Storey et al., 2007; Cui et al., 2011). Modeling (Zeebe et al., 2009) has shown that carbon dioxide forcing alone could only account for\nca. 1–3.5 °C of the PETM global surface warming. Although volcanogenic mantle-derived CO2 that may have contributed to the PETM (Cui et al., 2011) the Brito-Arctic flood basalt episode is not a good analog to the MMCO, insofar as the CRFB were entirely subaerial.\nDrilling in the Ross Sea (Antarctica) recovered palynological evidence (Warny et al., 2009) for an abrupt MMCO Antarctic warming, with summer land temperatures ca. 10 °C and large ice-free areas supporting tundra and shrub forest cover. The peak warmth occurred ca. 15.7 to 15.5 Ma. We propose that beds 11 and 12 were deposited during the MMCO, with bed 12 corresponding to peak warmth (pMMCO, 15.7–15.7 Ma). This identification is consistent with marine faunal evidence that beds 11 and 12 were deposited in the deepest water recorded by Miocene strata in the Calvert Cliffs (Fig. 5, Kidwell, 1988); Whitmore (1971) had inferred a subtropical climate from the terrestrial vertebrates (e.g. crocodilians) in beds 12 and 13. Bed 12 (Parkers Creek Bone Bed) is unique in the Calvert Cliffs exposures and was deposited in a sediment-starved environment farthest from shore (Kidwell, 1989). This accounts in part for the high concentration of shark teeth (e.g.,Visaggi and Godfrey, 2010) and other vertebrate remains. The similar Sharktooth Hill bone bed, deposited over a time of no more than 700 ka (15.9 Ma to 15.2 Ma) is exposed in the San Joaquin Basin (California) and has also been attributed to the MMCO (Pyenson et al., 2009). Besides sediment starvation and thus bone concentration, the Parkers Creek bone bed may record increased ocean productivity, as suggested for the Sharktooth Hill bone bed by Pyenson et al. (2009).\nThe altered nature of shells in beds 12 and 14, as contrasted with those in the overlying Choptank Formation shells, remains unexplained—is this entirely a product of later diagenesis, or could it also reflect the probably lower pH of the MMCO ocean?"

    "heading": "5.3. Age assignments: conflicts with some Sr isotope dates",
    "text": "Our assignment of bed 12 to the pMMCO and incision of the Kenwood Beach channel to the EAISE (Fig. 3) results in some bed ages conflicting with 87Sr/86Sr dates of mollusk shells from these strata by Browning et al. (2006; their Fig. 11). However, given their error bars and sample sizes, demonstrating hiatuses of 0.5–1 m.y. is problematic. Our pMMCO assignment of bed 12 would be consistent with their scheme in the absence of a significant disconformity between beds 11 and 12, but lies ca. 1 my younger than their three Sr dates. We consider their large PP-2 hiatus implausible because the paleoseafloor was deep for both beds 11 and 12 (Kidwell, 1988, 1997). Moreover, a significant hiatus is not internally consistent with the three PP-2 Sr ages, which bracket the contact between the beds, unless the shell samples from bed 11 are demonstratably burrow fill from bed 12.\nShell alteration (diagenesis) and/or paleosalinity-dependent effects may have affected the shells analyzed by Browning et al. (2006). This is further suggested by borehole samples from the Chesapeake Impact Crater, where a number of Sr dates from the Eyreville (Fig. 9 of Browning et al., 2009) and Exmore (e.g., Fig. 5 of Kulpesz et al., 2009) boreholes are ca. 0.5to 3 Ma younger than the best-fitting age vs depth distributions proposed by those authors. In many cases, the Sr dates on borehole material are systematically younger than those from dinocysts, based on de Verteuil and Norris (1996).\nCochran et al. (2010) showed that Sr ratios of Campanian mollusks from the Western Interior Seaway decrease significantly where shell preservation is poor. Mollusk shells from the same unit showed that increasing paleosalinity increases the Sr ratios, which, if applicable to the Miocene shells analyzed by Browning et al. (2006), would cause ages of open-marine fauna to appear younger than fauna inhabiting near-shore, more brackish waters. Given that fossil assemblages from beds 11 and 12 were deposited in the deepest water and hence likely highest salinity (e.g., Kidwell, 1997), this may help\naccount for the three relatively young ages reported above and below the PP-2 disconformity by Browning et al. (2006).\nThe dashed lines A (preferred) and B in Fig. 3 are our approximate age assignments for beds 12 to 17, and do not require a long hiatus at the CT-0, PP-3 or PP-2 disconformities. Line B assumes that only our MMCO assignment for bed 12 is valid, and that the channel event postdates the 13.9–13.8 Ma Antarctic ice sheet expansion. We do not claim there are no disconformities, but rather that sedimentation may have been interrupted only locally, and that hiatus lengths may have been short, i.e. up to a few tens of ka. The exact time it takes to produce one of the burrowed firmgrounds described by Kidwell (1984) is not well established. Our age assignments are inconsistent with beds 12 and 14 being significantly condensed.\nThe age assignments of Browning et al. (2006) and our own (Fig. 3) imply long term average sedimentation rates of ca. 10 m/ Ma, or 1 cm per 1000 yr. Such rates are comparable to deep water hemipelagic sedimentation, but, unlike the deep seafloor, short term (1 to 1000 year range) rates likely fluctuated over orders of magnitude on geologically short periods of time (Kidwell, 1984). The fragile carbonized wood fragments 1–10 cm thick in shell-poor bed 14 interbeds (e.g., Fig. 4C) would, at the ‘average’ sedimentation rate of 1 cm/ 1000 yr, have implausibly lain on the seafloor undisturbed for millennia prior to complete burial! Clearly these nearly neutrally buoyant wood fragments actually settled onto the Miocene seafloor during short intervals, perhaps less than a year, of rapid sedimentation, and were buried essentially intact. Because the shell-poor bed 14 interbeds are absent updip (Kidwell, 1984), these interbeds probably represent deposition, in relatively deeper, quieter water, of fine sediment eroded by bottom currents updip, or/and deposited directly from river outflow sediment plumes, also carrying driftwood, during periods of intense, protracted precipitation in the watershed."

    "heading": "6. Discussion: dropstones may not always be good proxies for cold climates",
    "text": "Following other authors, we propose that quasi-cyclic glacioeustatic sea level variations explain to first-order the Miocene sediment record in the Calvert Cliffs and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic sediment record (e.g., Browning et al., 2006). The 1.2 Ma obliquity modulation period (e.g., Paelike, 2004) was the plausible pacer throughout those 10 Ma, both before and after the Antarctic ice sheet expansion ca. 13.9 Ma. The dropstones from beds 12, 13 and 14 represent a ca. 1.5 Ma long part of this record. Fluctuations in sediment supply, wave and bottom current erosion, and bioturbation probably prevented shorter Milankovitch periodicities from being recorded, with possible local exceptions such as the four shell bed/interbed sequences in downdip parts of bed 14 (Kidwell, 1984).\nAlthough detailed dating remains elusive, we propose the Calvert Cliffs strata have recorded A) the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) in the form of beds 11 and 12, with bed 12 deposited in ca. 200 ka from 15.7 to 15.5 Ma, and B) the Antarctic ice sheet expansion ca. 13.8–13.9 Ma in the form of the 5–7 m deep channel carved into the bed 15–16 seabed (Kidwell, 1997) due to the ca. 43 m sea-level fall (e.g., Langebroek et al., 2009). Interpolation then suggests bed 13 was deposited during the period 15.5–14.5 Ma (with the upper part possibly missing in our area), and bed 14 during the period 14.5 to 14.4 Ma. These age assignments are within the range of previous estimates but are ca. 1.5 Ma older than the 86Sr/87Sr ages proposed by Browning et al. (2006) for the same beds. We suggest the disagreement reflects diagenic mollusk shell alteration and paleosalinity-related effects (e.g., Cochran et al., 2010), consistent with many comparably too-young Sr ages reported from Chesapeake Impact Crater borehole sediments by Browning et al. (2009) and Kulpesz et al. (2009). Our age assignments are inconsistent with beds 12 and 14 being significantly condensed overall.\nThe fine fraction of IRD is likely much greater than the pebble to cobble size fraction, compared to driftwood transport (fine sediment readily washes out of tree roots, and little is observed; e.g., Fig. 4D). Thus, estimating total IRD content in cores from gravel sized material (Grobe, 1987) must assume it was ice-rafted."
  }, {
    "heading": "6.1. Driftwood dropstones in the Eocene Arctic Ocean?",
    "text": "The origin of some erratics might be questioned even in the Arctic Ocean as it existed in the Eocene. While ice-rafting seems the obvious transport mechanism in polar regions, the pre-Pleistocene Arctic was long considered ice-free, until 2005 ACEX coring on Lomonosov Ridge recovered apparent IRD as old as middle Eocene (e.g., Stickley et al., 2009); Tripati et al. (2008) offered evidence for ice rafting beginning in the Greenland Sea 44 Ma. While the case for Middle Eocene Arctic ice-rafting was strengthened by Stickley et al. (2009), who identified the types of diatoms associated with sea-ice, their result does not mean that all lithic material in the ACEX core was carried there by ice.\nNumerous trees are floated even into the modern Arctic Ocean from the great Siberian rivers, although northern Siberia today is a treeless tundra (e.g., Emery, 1965) Northward-flowing rivers remain frozen longer downstream, forming ice dams and consequent spring floods. The Arctic Ocean was even more land-locked in the Eocene than it is today. The low surface water salinity implied by study of Middle Eocene ACEX cores implies a high discharge from surrounding north-flowing rivers (e.g., Fig. 1 of Stickley et al., 2009), with weak export of this water from the Arctic. While the precise age of Middle Eocene forests growing along Arctic shores (Jahren, 2007) remains uncertain, Arctic coasts were probably forested even during the colder parts of “Milankovitch” cycles (e.g., Sangiorgi et al., 2008). As during modern times, ice dams must have formed during spring thaws, causing floods and carrying large amounts of driftwood into the ocean. Thus, while the evidence for Middle Eocene ice rafting is compelling, Arctic driftwood transport probably contributed."
  }, {
    "heading": "7. Summary",
    "text": "More than 200 lithic erratics were recovered in situ from beds 12, 13 and 14 of the Middle Miocene Plum Point Member of the Calvert Formation, where these beds are exposed along the Chesapeake Bay. We argue these beds were deposited ca. 15.7 to 14.2 Ma, during part of the ca. 16 to14MaMiddle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO) and the Monterey carbonate isotope excursion. Above these three beds is the disconformity between the overlying sandier Choptank and the more clay-rich Calvert formation. We attribute this disconformity, which includes the buried Governors Run Channel (Kidwell, 1997) carved into the upper Plum Point Marl Member, to Antarctic ice sheet expansion and glacioeustatic sea level fall 13.8–13.9 Ma (e.g., Shevenell et al., 2008; Langebroek et al., 2009).\nWe argue that bed 12 (Parker Creek Bone Bed) records peak warmth (pMMCO), corresponding to the lowest oxygen isotope anomaly in the Atlantic stack (Fig. 8 of Browning et al., 2009, our Fig. 5). Bed 12 is therefore probably an Atlantic analog to the California Sharktooth Hill bone bed, attributed to the MMCO by Pyenson et al. (2009), and corresponds in time to an extremely warm interval in Antarctica (Warny et al., 2009). We propose that the voluminous and volatile-rich (Lange, 2002) Grande Ronde flood basalts released enough CO2 to help account for the pMMCO.\nCarbonized wood and lack of alternative transport mechanisms indicates that most of the erratics are ‘driftwood dropstones’—floated into the ocean by trees uprooted along forested Piedmont river banks, particularly during floods on the MMCO Susquehanna River. Clast lithology points to a Piedmont and Coastal Plain origin for most dropstones, with several probably derived from the Port Deposit Gneiss, still exposed along the lower Susquehanna ca. 150 km northnortheast of the dropstone collection area (Fig. 1). Driftwood\ndropstone provenance may offer independent tracers for land animal remains from the same strata. Using the Eocene Arctic as an example, we echo Bennett et al. (1996) in urging caution before attributing all dropstones to ice rafting, especially when other proxies indicate climate warmth."
