  "abstractText": "Potassic volcanism has been widespread and semi-continuous on the Tibetan plateau since ~13 Ma, post-dating the orogenic thickening of the India—Asia collision. Volcanism may have commenced slightly earlier (~16—20 Ma) in the southern portion of the plateau arid then ceased around 10 Ma. The dominant lavas are pyroxeneand plagioclase-phyric shoshonites with subordinate occurrences of dacites and rhyolites. Their mineralogy reflects crystallization from high-temperature (^1100°C) magmas which had elevated oxygen and water fugaciti.es. Geochemically, they are characterized by relatively low TiO2, AI2O3 and Fe^Os, and high .A&^Q coupled with variable abundances of compatible trace elements and very high contents of incompatible trace elements. Normalized incompatible element patterns have marked negative Nb, la and Ti anomalies whereas K^O appears to be buffered at ~4% over a wide range of SiO^. Isotope data show a relatively broad and enriched range of^Sr/^Sr (0-7076-0-7106) at more restricted (—5 2 to -8 1). Pb isotopes are characterized by a range of 204 ^Pb/^Pb (38-67-39 SO) /204 pb/20 pb (,5.51_15.72) 207pb/pb (",
