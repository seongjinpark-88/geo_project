    "text": "Paleobiogeographic patterns of the Cretaceous^Tertiary (K^T) mass extinction in planktonic foraminifera in Tunisia, spanning environments from open marine upper bathyal, to shelf and shallow marginal settings, indicate a surprisingly selective and environmentally mediated mass extinction. This selectivity is apparent in all of the environmental proxies used to evaluate the mass extinction, including species richness, ecological generalists, ecological specialists, surface and subsurface dwellers, whether based on the number of species or the relative percent abundances of species. The following conclusions can be reached for shallow to deep environments: about three quarters of the species disappeared at or near the K^T boundary and only ecological generalists able to tolerate wide variations in temperature, nutrients, salinity and oxygen survived. Among the ecological generalists (heterohelicids, guembelitrids, hedbergellids and globigerinellids), only surface dwellers survived. Ecological generalists which largely consisted of two morphogroups of opportunistic biserial and triserial species also suffered selectively. Biserials thrived during the latest Maastrichtian in well stratified open marine settings and dramatically declined in relative abundances in the early Danian. Triserials thrived only in shallow marginal marine environments, or similarly stressed ecosystems, during the latest Maastrichtian, but dominated both open marine and restricted marginal settings in the early Danian. This highly selective mass extinction pattern reflects dramatic changes in temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrients across the K^T boundary in the low latitude Tethys ocean which appear to be the result of both long-term environmental changes (e.g., climate, sea level, volcanism) and short-term effects (bolide impact). ß 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Keller).\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\ntributed to a large extraterrestrial impact near Chicxulub on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, though the end of the Cretaceous was also a time of extremely stressful environmental conditions for any living organism due to the culmination of long-term climatic changes, such as the V6^7‡C cooling during the Maastrichtian followed by rapid warming of V3^4‡C between 400 and 200 kyr before the K^T boundary and subsequent cooling of V2^3‡C during the last 100^200 kyr of the Maastrichtian (e.g., Barrera, 1994; Li and Keller, 1998a,c). Few studies, however, have addressed the biotic e¡ects that accompanied these long-term environmental changes and the e¡ect this may have had in pre-disposing high stress assemblages to eventual extinction (e.g., Abramovich et al., 1998, 2002; Li and Keller, 1998b,c; Kucera and Malmgren, 1998; Olsson et al., 2001).\nMost K^T boundary studies on planktonic foraminifera have concentrated on documenting the pattern of species extinctions immediately below and above the lithological change and geochemical anomalies that mark the boundary event. A few studies have attempted to evaluate some aspects of this mass extinction event on a regional or global scale, including hiatus distribution (MacLeod and Keller, 199l), species survivorship (MacLeod and Keller, 1994), pre-K^T species extinctions in the Negev (Abramovich et al., 1998) and extinctions in northern Spain (Apellanize et al., 1997) and the northern Tethys (Pardo et al., 1999). The absence of more comphrehensive integrated summary results is largely because most K^T sections are scattered far apart and direct comparisons are di⁄cult due to still unknown regional e¡ects.\nRecent studies of several new K^T boundary sections in Tunisia now provide the opportunity to evaluate the mass extinction pattern in the low latitude Tethys region. The Tunisian sections, which include the El Kef stratotype, are known to have the most continuous sediment accumulation records across the K^T boundary and generally well preserved planktonic foraminiferal assemblages. The Elles locality, about 75 km southeast of El Kef, has an even more expanded K^T transition than the stratotype section and\ndi¡ers from the latter in the presence of an event deposit consisting of a 20 cm thick, cross-bedded foraminiferal packstone just below the K^T boundary. Here we detail the K^T transition of Elles II, the most expanded of the Elles outcrops (see Elles I in Karoui-Yaakoub et al., 2002). We consider the faunal turnover in this section, as well as that of El Kef, as representative of the mass extinction in the open marine low latitude Tethys environment.\nWe then present a regional paleoecological evaluation of the mass extinction in Tunisia based on ¢ve sections which span from the shallow Sahara Platform in the south to the open marine environment of the north (Fig. 1). The database consists of the planktonic foraminiferal species census and relative species abundances of these sections and the analysis contrasts faunal assemblages before and after the K^T boundary based on two time slices, the latest Maastrichtian (upper CF1) and early Danian (P0 to lower P1a). Speci¢c parameters are evaluated and mapped, including species richness, ecological generalists, ecological\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nspecialists, opportunists, and surface vs. subsurface dwellers. This allows us to evaluate the biotic e¡ects in assemblages ranging from shallow marginal to open marine settings in the low latitude Tethys region."

    "text": "The paleogeographic and tectonic setting of Tunisian sections during the late Maastrichtian to early Paleocene is shown in Fig. 1 (modi¢ed from Burollet, 1967). The Seldja section was deposited in the shallow water Gafsa Basin which was connected to the Sahara Platform to the south, but separated from the Tethyan realm to the north by the Kasserine Island. Interchange with the open sea was therefore restricted by the Kasserine Island and probably also by small uplifted areas to the east and west that acted as barriers to circulation (Burollet, 1956; Burollet and Oudin, 1980; Sassi, 1974). Sediment deposition occurred largely in restricted seas that £uctuated between inner neritic and coastal environments. Tectonic activity and erosion of the Kasserine Island contributed to a constant though variable terrigenous in£ux of sediments (Adatte et al., 2002). Planktonic foraminiferal faunas provide a rare glimpse of marine life in shallow\nnear-shore environments during the K^T transition (Keller et al., 1998).\nThe El Kef, Elles and Ain Settara sections are located to the north of the Kasserine Island. Sediment deposition occurred at upper bathyal to outer neritic depths at El Kef and middle to outer neritic depths at Elles and Ain Settara, as indicated by benthic foraminifera (Galeotti and Coccioni, 2002, Fig. 2). All three sections indicate similar depositional environments in open marine conditions, but with variable terrigenous in£ux from the Kasserine Island (see Adatte et al., 2002). At Elles and Ain Settara, terrigenous in£ux is generally higher than at El Kef with episodes of bioclastic or terrigenous transport just below and above the K^T boundary. Elles and El Kef have comparable sediment records, whereas Ain Settara has a condensed boundary clay and possibly a short hiatus (zone P0 is only a few centimeters thick; Luciani, 2002).\nAbout 150 km to the north of El Kef is the El Melah section which represents the northernmost of the Tunisian K^T boundary outcrops. Sediment deposition occurred at a deeper upper bathyal depth than at El Kef and terrigenous in£ux was low (Adatte et al., 2002). As a result, sediment accumulation is signi¢cantly lower than at El Kef and Elles (Karoui-Yaakoub et al., 2002).\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nWith the exception of Seldja where beds are tilted, sediment layers at the other four Tunisian K^T boundary localities are essentially horizontal and without structural complexities. There is easy access to the sections and foraminiferal preservation is very good to excellent. Together these ¢ve sections provide an ideal transect representing paleodepositional environments from the shallow inner neritic, to middle and outer neritic, and upper slope environments (Fig. 2) that may be characteristic of the low latitude Tethyan realm in general."

    "heading": "1.2. Previous work and database",
    "text": "A number of high resolution quantitative planktonic foraminiferal studies have recently been completed for the Tunisian K^T sections, including El Kef (Keller et al., 1995; Molina et al., 1998), Ain Settara (Molina et al., 1998; Luciani, 2002), Elles and El Melah (Karoui-Yaakoub et al., 2002 and this study) and Seldja (Keller et al., 1998, Fig. 1). Though these studies were done independently by di¡erent workers, in all but one (Molina et al., 1998) the same or similar species concepts and methods were used and the database of these workers is thus internally consistent and forms the basis for the Tunisian paleobiogeography of the K^T mass extinction.\nThere are few taxonomic di¡erences between Keller and Luciani (see Luciani, 1997, 2002), and the di¡erences between Keller and KarouiYaakoub in the species census data are due to lumper and splitter e¡ects (see discussion in Karoui-Yaakoub et al., 2002). Therefore for the Elles section, only the results of Keller’s analysis (this study) are used, though both Elles outcrop localities show nearly identical species census and faunal assemblage changes. The quantitative data for this report are based on Keller’s and Luciani’s studies for all Tunisian sections."

    "heading": "1.3. Methods",
    "text": "Samples from all ¢ve Tunisian sections were collected by the same team using the same methods. The sections were cleaned from surface contamination by digging a trench to fresh bedrock. Samples were then taken at 5^10-cm intervals in\ngeneral, and at closer 1^2-cm intervals across the boundary clay layer. For each section, the same sample set was used for faunal, geochemical and mineralogical studies to insure direct comparison of results (Adatte et al., 2002; Stu«ben et al., 2002).\nLaboratory and analytical methods for planktonic foraminiferal studies have been described in Keller et al. (1995). Population counts were based on sample splits of about 300 specimens from each of two size fractions (38^63 Wm and s 63 Wm). Duplicate analyses of two size fractions were done because there is a signi¢cant di¡erence between the ¢rst appearances of the earliest Danian species in the two size fractions, with earlier ¢rst occurrences in the small 6 63-Wm size fraction. This a¡ects the biostratigraphic results of biozones P0 and P1a. In addition, the relative abundances of small species is signi¢cantly larger in the smaller size fraction because they tend to fall through the larger sieve size (s 63 Wm). Conversely, the larger size fraction (s 63 Wm) was analyzed because larger species tend to be underrepresented in the smaller size fraction. Quantitative results of the two size fractions are shown for the Elles II outcrop (Tables 1 and 2). For the biogeographic maps, relative abundances of the s 63-Wm size fraction was used. Species identi¢cations are based on Robaszynski et al. (1983/ 84), Caron (1985), Nederbragt (1991), Keller et al. (1995) and Olsson et al. (1999)."

    "text": "The biostratigraphy and faunal turnover of Elles II are discussed and illustrated here as characteristic of the species richness and relative species abundances of the K^T transition in Tunisia, and in the low latitude Tethys in general. The lithostratigraphy of this expanded sequence is characteristic of Tunisian sections, but may also be relevant in other regions, assuming that the K^T transition evident in Tunisia records global, rather than local trends.\nElles II is located about 75 km southeast of El Kef near the hamlet of Elles in a valley cut by the\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nKarma river. Following the river upsection to where the valley forks, Elles I is located in the right side valley fork (see Karoui-Yaakoub et al., 2002) and Elles II in the left side valley fork. Elles II di¡ers from Elles I primarily in the more expanded K^T transition and the presence of a 20^25 cm thick bioclastic bed with ripple marks below the K^T boundary clay and red layer."

    "heading": "2.2. Lithology and lithostratigraphy",
    "text": "The uppermost Maastrichtian at Elles II consists of monotonous gray marls and silty shales.\nAn important sedimentological change occurs in the 25^30 cm thick interval directly underlying the K^T boundary red layer (Fig. 3). In this interval gray marls ¢rst grade into gray calcareous siltstones and then into gray calcarenites, both of which form layers of 5 cm and 8 cm thick respectively. Overlying this interval is a 5^7 cm thick yellow calcarenite consisting primarily of planktonic foraminiferal tests (foraminiferal packstone). The foraminiferal packstone is yellowish, cross-bedded and burrowed. Burrows are about 5 mm in diameter, unbranched and reach a length of a few centimeters. Most of the burrows are horizontal or oblique, but a few are almost vertical with the upper end at the top of the packstone layer. All of the burrows are in¢lled with the yellow marly sediment and none with the green clay that overlies the foraminiferal packstone. This indicates that colonization and in¢lling of burrows occurred before deposition of the green clay layer. Because the upper surface of the packstone is also an undulating erosional surface, an unconformity is present between the top of the packstone and the green clay. However, this hiatus appears to be very short as suggested by the presence of the most expanded zone CF1 known to date (10 m at Elles as compared with 6 m at El Kef; Pardo et al., 1996; Abramovich et al., 2002).\nThe overlying plastic green clay varies between 0.2 to 1 cm thick and ¢lls the depressions in the packstone. Above the green clay is the 2^4 mm thick rusty red layer that generally marks the K^T boundary event and contains maximum concentrations of Ir- and Ni-rich spinels (Rocchia et al., 1995; Robin et al., 1995). No burrows are observed across the red and green layers. Overlying the red layer is another 1^2 cm thick plastic green clay layer with a second very thin red layer (Fig. 3). No burrows are observed in this couplet either.\nUpsection, the green clay grades into ¢ssile clays with small Fe concretions. The lowermost 10 cm of the clay are black, rich in organic matter and contain rare casts of nuculanid bivalves. The black clays grade into dark gray shaley clays overlain by gray shales which are less ¢ssile. Bioturbation was noted at 50 cm above the K^T boundary (Fig. 3).\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nT ab\nle 1A\nR el\nat iv\ne pe\nrc en\nt ab\nun da\nnc es\nof pl\nan kt\non ic\nfo ra\nm in\nif er\na (s\n63 W\nm

    "text": "Recently, a new classi¢cation of Paleocene\nplanktonic foraminifera based on wall texture was published (Olsson et al., 1999). This study generally follows this new classi¢cation scheme for the early Danian species though with some exceptions that are explained below. Parasubbotina pseudobulloides (Plummer, 1926): This well-known species is characterized by 5 chambers in the last whorl (rarely 6) and rapidly increasing chamber size. Well-developed large (s 150 Wm) morphotypes ¢rst appear after the extinction of Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina. But forms with 4.5^5 chambers appear earlier in the upper half of the P. eugubina range (zone P1a) and later coexist with the well-developed pseudobulloides morphotypes. The ¢rst appearance of this morphotype marks the subdivision of zone P1a (Fig. 4). Olsson et al. (1999) assign these specimens to a separate group P. a¡. pseudobulloides. However, since these forms appear to be part of a continuous variation within the pseudobulloides population and separation is di⁄cult at best, we retain this early morphotype within P. pseudobulloides. Subbotina triloculinoides (Plummer, 1926): This is another well-known species with 3.5 globose chambers in the last whorl and the last chamber characteristically enveloping the upper half of the test. This morphotype ¢rst appears in the middle of zone P1a nearly coincident with Parasubbotina pseudobulloides and marks the subdivision of zone P1a (Fig. 4), though, as with the latter species, large morphotypes (s 150 Wm) of S. triloculinoides do not appear until after the extinction of Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina. Olsson et al. (1999) recognize only the larger morphotypes which they date as ¢rst appearing at 64.5 Ma. Guembelitria cretacea Cushman, 1933; Olsson et al. (1999) group all triserial morphotypes within the species G. cretacea, including the high-spired danica, the irregularly stacked chambers of irregularis and the short-spired trifolia. Although we agree that all three morphotypes share the same ¢nely perforate wall texture, globular chambers and overall triserial chamber arrangement, theyTa bl e 2B (c on ti nu ed ) B io zo ne s P 0 P 1a Sa m pl es : cm ab ov e K ^T 0^ 0. 5 0. 5^ 1. 0 1^ 2 3^ 4 4^ 5 8^ 10 12 ^1 5 18 ^2 0 25 ^3 0 35 ^4 0 45 ^5 0 55 ^6 0 65 ^7 0 75 ^8 0 85 ^9 0 95\n^1 00\n10 5^\n11 0\nE .\ned it\na 1\n2 5\n5 3\n10 12\n9 10 11 E . fr in ga 1 X 2 2 2 5 3 3 6 S . tr iv ia lis X P ar vu la ru go gl ob er in a eu gu bi na 2 2 4 10 4 4 4 4 4 P . ex te ns a 1 1 1 1 X 5 X 4 8 10 6 5 4 6 11 8 G lo ba no m al in a co m pr es sa X 1 1 X X T ot al co un te d 38 3 41 0 35 8 41 4 27 0 38 3 12 6 24 0 29 1 41 2 39 2 41 5 36 8 33 2 44 8 32 6 36\n5\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nare also very distinct and easily identi¢ed morphotypes which di¡er in their relative abundance distributions geographically and through time. They may represent either di¡erent species or ecological variants. We continue to separate these morphotypes in order to evaluate their stratigraphic and ecological a⁄nities. Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina (Luterbacher and Premoli Silva, 1964): This small species was originally de¢ned as a 5^6 (rarely 8) chambered form with in£ated subglobular chambers and high open aperture. Blow (1979) described a small species with 5^8 compressed chambers and slit-like narrow aperture, with a similar stratigraphic range, as longiapertura. Olsson et al. (1999) consider this form a variant of P. eugubina. We retain the separation of these two distinct morphotypes because their geographic distribution may eventually provide paleoecological information. Parvularugoglobigerina extensa (Blow, 1979); Olsson et al. (1999) consider the species formerly classi¢ed as Globoconusa conusa (Khalilov) a junior synonym of P. extensa and we follow this convention."

(1995) subdivide zone P1a (range of Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina) based on the ¢rst appearances of Parasubbotina pseudobulloides (P. a¡. pseudobulloides of Olsson et al., 1999) and/or Subbotina triloculinoides."

At Elles II, as well as other Tunisian sections, P. hantkeninoides is consistently present (except for two samples), whereas only two occurrences of Abathomphalus mayaroensis (the alternative late Maastrichtian marker species) were noted (at the K^T boundary and at 1 m below, Fig. 5). At Elles I and Elles II the range of P. hantkeninoides spans\nthe last 7 m and 10 m of the Maastrichtian respectively (Abramovich and Keller, 2002) as compared with 6 m at El Kef (Li and Keller, 1998a). Agewise the range of this excellent latest Maastrichtian marker species spans the last 300 kyr of the Maastrichtian, or most of chron 29R below the K^T boundary, as estimated from the paleomagnetic record at Agost (see Pardo et al., 1996; Groot et al., 1989). This species is easily identi¢ed by its long apical spines and is common in Tunisian sections where its stratigraphic range (generally s 6 m) provides a good estimate of the completeness of the latest Maastrichtian interval. The P. hantkeninoides Zone replaces the A. mayaroensis Zone for the top part of the Maastrichtian."

    "text": "This boundary is de¢ned by the coincidence of several characteristic lithological and geochemical criteria in all sections in Tunisia (e.g., Fig. 3) and worldwide including: a lithological change from marls or shales to dark gray or black organicrich clay; a 2^4 mm thin rusty red layer at the base of the clay; the presence of spherules, spinels and anomalous concentrations of Ir and other plantinum group elements in the rusty red layer.\nPaleontological criteria include the extinction of all ornate large tropical and subtropical species, including all globotruncanids, racemiguembelinids and rugoglobigerinids (with the possible exception of Rugoglobigerina macrocephala) below the red layer and organic-rich clay layer. This extinction horizon is followed by the ¢rst appearance of Danian species at or near the base of the organic-rich black clay (e.g., Parvularugoglobigerina extensa, Eoglobigerina fringa, Eoglobigerina edita, Eoglobigerina eobulloides, Woodringina hornerstownensis)."

In many earlier studies zone P0 was considered to span the organic-rich clay layer (e.g., Smit, 1982; Keller, 1988;\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nOlsson and Liu, 1993; Molina et al., 1998). This is also supported by the ¢rst occurrence of the marker species in the s 63-Wm size fraction near the top of the clay layer (at 65 cm above the red layer) at Elles I and Elles II (Table 2A, Fig. 5). However, new studies based on the smaller 36^63- Wm size fraction at Elles I and Elles II indicate small P. eugubina ¢rst appear 25^30 cm above the red layer, whereas small P. longiapertura ¢rst appear at 45^50 cm (Fig. 6, Table 2B, see also Karoui-Yaakoub et al., 2002). This suggests that P0 may be restricted to the lower half of this black clay layer. Zone P0 is noteworthy for its common presence of reworked Cretaceous tropical species and large abundance of triserial species."

Due to the increased terrigenous in£ux from the nearby Kasserine Island at Elles I and II, as well as at Ain Settara, the P1a zone is about 5^6 m thick and hence more expanded than the 4.5 m observed at El Kef (Keller, 1988). At the more distant and deeper water locality of El Melah, zone P1a is condensed and only 1.4 m thick. Zone P1a can be subdivided into P1a(1) and P1a(2) based on the ¢rst appearance (FA) of Parasubbotina pseudobulloides (Fig. 4)."

A comparable number of species was identi¢ed at El Kef (57 species, Keller et al., 1995; Keller, 1996), Ain Settara (Luciani, 2002) and El Melah (this study). Most species range through the last meter interval below the K^T boundary. Though only a few species were not observed in the top 10 cm below the K^T boundary (e.g., Gublerina cuvilieri, Rosita wal¢shensis, Globotruncanita angulata, Rugoglobigerina reicheli), many species reappear in the top 25 cm (Fig. 5) within the foraminiferal packstone layer marked by cross-bedding. This suggests that there is signi¢cant transportation and reworking of older assemblages within the packstone and for this reason we excluded the packstone from our paleobiogeographic database.\nThough most species disappear at or below the K^T boundary, 16 species (Heterohelix carinata to Rugoglobigerina rugosa, Fig. 5) are also present in the lower zone P0 (Fig. 5); these are considered reworked because many of the specimens show di¡erential preservation or are broken. In sections globally, these species generally disappear near the K^T boundary (MacLeod and Keller, 1994). A total of 16 Cretaceous species range well into the early Danian and are considered as survivors as discussed below.\nThus, we consider all but 16 species, or 75%, as extinct at or near the K^T boundary (Gublerina cuvilieri to Rugoglobigerina rugosa in Fig. 5); though the combined relative abundance of this group averages less than 20% of the total assemblage (Fig. 7A,B). The same species extinction and relative abundance pattern was observed at El Kef (Keller et al., 1995, ¢g. 11, p. 243) and at Ain Settara (Luciani, 2002). Nearly all of the extinct species have large morphologies, highly ornamented tests, and their geographic distributions are restricted to low and middle latitudes. We consider these taxa as ecological specialists well adapted to tropical and subtropical environments, but intolerant of environmental changes, including £uctuations in temperature, nutrients, oxygen and salinity as discussed below."

    "heading": "2.3.3.2. Survivors",
    "text": "The fact that the mass extinction eliminated only ecological specialists having relatively narrow ecological habitats points to a selective mass extinction pattern. The group of 16 species (or 25%) which range into the lower Danian zones P0 and P1a are generally common to abundant (s 80%) in the upper Maastrichtian (Fig. 5, Heterohelix planata to Guembelitria trifolia ; see also\nFig. 6 for ranges of small species in the 38^63-Wm size fraction, Figs. 7A,B and 8). A similar number of Cretaceous species range well into the lower Danian at El Kef, El Melah and Ain Settara (16 species). These species are considered Cretaceous survivors because they have been observed to be consistently present in early Danian sediments of sections worldwide, do not show di¡erential preservation as compared with Danian species, and many have Danian stable isotope signals (Barrera and Keller, 1990, 1994; Keller et al., 1993; MacLeod and Keller, 1994).\nAmong these 16 species, Pseudoguembelina costulata, and Pseudoguembelina kempensis were not previously considered survivors, but are tentatively included here because of their consistent occurrence in Danian sediments ; though further studies are necessary to determine their extinction datum. All the survivor taxa are biserial (mostly heterohelicids), triserial (guembelitrids), trochospiral (hedbergellids) and planispiral (globigerinellids). Morphologically, these taxa are generally small with little or no surface ornamentation. They are geographically widespread and for the most part common to abundant. We consider them ecological generalists, able to tolerate £uctuations in temperature, nutrients, oxygen and salinity.\nIt is noteworthy that in the examination of the s 63-Wm size fraction, the new Danian species as well as most of the Cretaceous survivors are absent in an interval spaning part of P0 and the lowermost part of P1a (Fig. 7B) as also observed earlier at El Kef (Keller, 1988; Keller et al., 1995), ODP Site 738 (Keller, 1993) and Haiti (Keller et al., 2001). Nevertheless, in the smaller size fraction (38^63 Wm) these species are common to abundant (Fig. 8, Tables 1 and 2). This re£ects the dwar¢ng of species in environmentally\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nstressed habitats (see MacLeod et al., 2000). However, it also illustrates that biostratigraphic and faunal turnover conclusions based solely on the s 63-Wm size fraction are in error."

    "heading": "2.3.3.3. Opportunists",
    "text": "The populations of most Cretaceous survivors dramatically decline in the lower Danian zones P0 and P1a and never recover. Some Cretaceous species, however, thrive after the mass extinction of tropical and subtropical species and the decline of the ecological generalist survivors. These are the triserial Guembelitria species in low to middle latitudes and the biserial Zeauvigerina waiparaensis in high latitudes (Keller, 1993; Pardo and Keller, 1999). These biserial and triserial taxa dominated (s 95%) the faunal assemblages during the early Danian in the absence of ecological competition as a result of the mass extinction and decline of survivor species, and prior to the establishment of the newly evolving Danian assemblages.\nGuembelitria species are generally present in very low abundances (6 1%) in Cretaceous faunal assemblages of normal open marine conditions and more abundant (s 10^25%) in shallow neritic near-shore environments characteristic of variable temperature, oxygen, salinity and nutrient conditions (see Keller et al., 1998). However, whenever open marine environmental conditions reach a crisis level and reduce normal population diversity they produce opportunistic blooms (e.g., K^T boundary, Cenomanian^Turonian boundary, and\nthree blooms in the late Maastrichtian, Abramovich et al., 1998; Keller et al., 2001). In open marine conditions, such an opportunistic Guembelitria bloom began in zone P0 and continued through P1a, though tapering o¡ in the later part of P1a (Keller et al., 1994; Luciani, 1997; Molina et al., 1998; Olsson and Liu 1993; Apellaniz et al., 1997). However, in near-shore shallow neritic environments, such as Seldja on the Sahara Platform or Brazos River in Texas, the Guembelitria blooms began in the latest Maastrichtian suggesting that adverse environmental conditions began well prior to the K^T boundary event (Keller, 1989; Keller et al., 1998).\nIn northern and southern high latitude sections, such as in Kazakstan and ODP Site 738, the Guembelitria bloom in the lower Danian is much reduced (V20^30%) and the biserial species Zeauvigerina waiparaensis takes its place as the dominant opportunistic species (Keller, 1993; Pardo and Keller, 1999). Zeauvigerina waiparaensis Jenkins was originally considered a Danian species, but was found to be common (V20%) in the upper Maastrichtian of Site 738 (Keller, 1993), as well as in northern high latitude sections (Pardo and Keller, 1999). Opportunistic blooms of this species began below the K^T boundary and increased to 80% in P0 and P1a.

Over two thirds of the species disappeared at or near the K^T boundary and nearly one third of the species survived into the early Danian.

These ecological specialists are generally characterized by highly ornamented, large multiserial or keeled morphologies. Their combined relative abundance is less than 20% of the total planktonic foraminiferal assemblages (Fig. 8). In contrast, the K^T survivor group consists of ecological generalists, characterized by small biserial, triserial, trochospiral or planispiral morphologies with little surface ornamentation.

However, this proxy makes no distinction between a species that is rare (often only one specimen), and one that is abundant. It is therefore only a ¢rst approximation of a mass extinction. For example, the presence or absence of a species in any given sample is also dependent on its numerical abundance; rare species may not be observed and their absence interpreted as extinctions (e.g., Signor^ Lipps e¡ect). Alternatively, the presence of rare and isolated specimens may be due to reworking. These problems have resulted in the controversial interpretations of sudden vs progressive mass extinction patterns.\nIn order to avoid this controversy, we estimate species richness for the two time slices as the maximum number of species present in any sample irrespective of where the last occurrence was noted. This means that any species which is noted only at the base of the time slice, or is an isolated occurrence, is counted as present throughout the time slice (up to the K^T boundary without consideration of the reworking potential). This will tend to exaggerate the mass extinction e¡ect and bias it towards a more catastrophic interpretation. The alternative option of excluding these species would result in the opposite bias.

During the late Maastrichtian, the small biserial heterohelicids (Heterohelix globulosa, Heterohelix navarroensis, Heterohelix dentata) generally dominated (70^80%) planktonic foraminiferal assemblages and hedbergellids were common. In the early Danian, many of these species were consistently present, though reduced to a few percent and generally dwarfed (V30^50% smaller than Cretaceous populations; Keller, 1988; MacLeod et al., 2000). The exception are the triserial Guembelitria species which were rare in open marine environments during the Maastrichtian, but common to abundant in shallow restricted environments, and dominated both open marine and shallow restricted environments in the early Danian. The consistent presence of these Cretaceous species in early Danian sediments in Tunisian sections, as well as globally (MacLeod and Keller, 1994), indicates that these species were survivors (see discussion above) as well as ecological generalists able to tolerate signi¢cant £uctuations in temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrients.\nSpecies richness of ecological generalists in the latest Maastrichtian CF1 zone averaged 20 species in open marine and 14 species in restricted shallow marine environments (Fig. 9C,D).

None of these species dominate foraminiferal population during the Maastrichtian and their relative abundances were generally less than 5% (Li and Keller, 1998a,b). The diversity of ecological specialists was highest in tropical and subtropical environments, but these species may have migrated outside these regions during times of climate warming. As a result, they may be found as temporary incursions into higher latitudes during warm climates.\nDuring the latest Maastrichtian zone CF1, species richness was dominated by ecological specialists (V60%). An average of 37 ecological specialist species were present in open marine environments and 21 in the shallow Gafsa Basin (Fig. 9E,F), but only four of these were consistently present (Fig. 9E, Plummerita hantkeninoides, Rugoglobigerina reicheli, Rugoglobigerina rugosa, Planoglobulina carseyae, Keller et al., 1998).

In contrast, ecological specialists (including surface and subsurface dwellers) averaged less than 5% in open marine, and 6 2% in the Gafsa Basin (Fig. 11A,C). This indicates that already prior to the K^T boundary event, ecological specialists were a rare and endangered group with very high diversity and very low numerical abundance. These overspecialized species were thus prone to extinction.\nDuring the early Danian zone P1a(1) Cretaceous ecological generalists decreased to 40^50% in open marine environments (Fig. 11B), and the remaining assemblage consisted of the evolving early Danian species. In the shallow restricted Gafsa Basin, the Cretaceous ecological generalists remained dominant (s 90%). Ecological specialists did not survive (Fig. 11D). This indicates that although the K^T mass extinction was restricted to ecological specialists, most Cretaceous generalists also died out, though much later in the early Danian. Species populations of generalists declined dramatically in open marine environments, but not in the restricted shallow Gafsa Basin. Though this generalization is somewhat misleading as is evident when the ecological generalist group is further evaluated below."

Using these two groups as proxies reveals that the biserial opportunists dominated both in open marine (70^75%) and shallow restricted basins (60^80%) in Tunisia, but relative abundances are more variable in the latter (Fig. 12A). All biserials su¡ered strong declines in the early Danian (from 70^75% to 6 5%, Fig. 12A,B) and all were extinct by the end of P1a or in P1c (MacLeod and Keller, 1994). This suggests that a well-strati¢ed ocean prevailed in CF1 with a well-developed oxygen minimum zone, but in the early Danian this ecological niche was reduced probably as a result of a cooler wellmixed watermass.\nThe triserial opportunists are also revealing. During the latest Maastrichtian CF1 they were rare (6 2%) in open marine environments, but rather abundant in the shallow restricted Gafsa Basin (20^40%, Fig. 12C). But in the early Danian P1a(1) (and particularly zone P0) they dominated, though still maintained a preference for shallow near-shore environments (90%) as compared to open marine (50^80%, Fig. 12D). The amplitude di¡erence in the £uctuations is probably due to greater competition with evolving Danian species in more open marine environments. The preferred environmental conditions of triserial guembelitrid species are not yet well understood, though there appears to be a high tolerance for salinity, nutrient and temperature £uctuations. In the Gafsa Basin guembelitrid dominance is associated with a warm humid climate, high rainfall, low salinity and high organic matter in£ux (Keller et al., 1998)."

As noted above, surface dwellers before and after the K^T boundary were dominated by di¡erent opportunistic taxa: the low oxygen tolerant heterohelicids thrived in open marine environments and the guembelitrids\nthrived in shallow marginal marine environments. Although this proxy suggests there was little change in the relative abundance of surface dwellers across the K^T boundary, in fact, guembelitrids replaced heterohelicids (see Fig. 12). In contrast, subsurface dwellers were a minor component of open marine (5^10%) environments during the latest Maastrichtian and there were no survivors in the early Danian (Fig. 13C,D).\nSurface and subsurface dwellers thus re£ect relatively consistent high stress environments in open marine as well as shallow restricted basin environments before and after the K^T boundary.

    "text": "Foraminiferal experts generally agree that a major mass extinction occurred across the K^T boundary in low to middle latitudes. But they disagree about the nature of the mass extinction pattern. Some workers contend that all but one to three species became extinct as a result of the bolide impact and that the presence of other Cretaceous species in Danian sediments is due to reworking (e.g., Olsson and Liu, 1993; Peryt et al., 1993; Olsson, 1997). Other workers contend that many more species survived, though they also agree that reworking is signi¢cant in Danian sediments (e.g., MacLeod, 1996a,b; Luciani, 1997).\nThe survivorship of Cretaceous species has been discussed in many publications (MacLeod and Keller, 1994; MacLeod, 1996c; Keller, 1996), and also addressed in the El Kef blind test (e.g., MacLeod, 1996a,b; Canudo, 1997; Masters, 1997; Orue-Etxebarria, 1997; Keller, 1997; Olsson, 1997; Smit and Nederbragt, 1997). At issue here is not whether many Cretaceous species are present in Danian sediments ; nearly all workers have reported their presence, but whether they are survivors or reworked. Keller (1988) ¢rst noted\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nthat at El Kef the large ornamented tropical species disappeared at or near the K^T boundary, whereas the small weakly ornamented ecological generalists ranged well into the lower Danian zone P1a and appeared to be K^T survivors (see also Keller et al., 1995). Since that time, this pattern has been substantiated in many low latitude sections worldwide and the question is no longer whether, but how many, of the ecological generalists survived. Current estimates range from as low as three to ¢ve (Smit and Nederbragt, 1997; Olsson, 1997) to as many as 16 species (e.g., MacLeod and Keller, 1994; Luciani, 1997, 2002; Apellaniz et al., 1997; Molina et al., 1998; Pardo et al., 2002; Karoui-Yaakoub et al., 2002).\nCretaceous species survivorship is also substantiated based on carbon and oxygen isotope measurements of species. In low latitudes, where the carbon isotope shift is between 2^3x across the K^T boundary, many Cretaceous species that lived in the Danian have a signi¢cantly greater negative isotopic shift than those that lived in the Maastrichtian (e.g., Barrera and Keller, 1990, 1994; Keller et al., 1993). At higher latitudes, where the carbon isotopic change is small, this test is less reliable. In these sections, the continued and consistent presence of certain Cretaceous species in Danian sediments, but absence of others, is a good indicator of survivorship.\nHowever, the stable isotope test for species survivorship has its pitfalls and must be applied with great care. For example, recently Kaiho and Lamolda (1999) claimed that, based on stable isotope measurements of individual species at Caravaca, Spain, there is no evidence of Cretaceous species survivorship. Details of their data, however, reveal that the specimens analyzed were taken within the ¢rst 5 cm of the Danian zone P0 at three intervals : at the K^T boundary, at 2 cm and 5 cm above the boundary. This interval (zone P0) contains an abundance of reworked Cretaceous species as discussed by Canudo et al. (199l). Moreover, numerous studies have shown that the basal Danian zone P0 almost always contains many reworked Cretaceous specimens, which generally cannot be distinguished from in situ specimens, and hence should be avoided when testing for Cretaceous survivors. Kaiho and Lamolda\n(1999) thus unwittingly analyzed reworked Cretaceous specimens and correctly obtained a Cretaceous signal which they correctly interpreted as reworked. But they incorrectly concluded that their analysis of these reworked specimens provided evidence against survivorship of Cretaceous species and for a catastrophic mass extinction of nearly all species at the K^T boundary.\nDuring the last decade, the argument for significant survivorship among Cretaceous ecological generalists into the Danian (Keller, 1988, 1989; Keller et al., 1995) has gained much support, largely due to the accumulation of a global empirical database that documents the consistent presence of Cretaceous ecological generalists in the Danian (MacLeod and Keller, 1994; Keller, 1993; MacLeod, 1996a,b; Luciani, 1997, 2002; Apellaniz et al., 1997; Molina et al., 1998). In addition, Tertiary stable isotope signals obtained from individual Cretaceous species in Danian sediments have provided convincing evidence of survivorship for many species (Barrera and Keller, 1990; Keller et al., 1993). Although there is still no agreement as to the total number of species that survived, about 15 species may now be counted as K^T survivors (Globotruncanella subcarinatus, Globigerinelloides aspera, Heterohelix globulosa, Heterohelix complanata ( = Heterohelix lamellosa), Heterohelix navarroensis, Heterohelix dentata, Heterohelix planata, Hedbergella monmouthensis, Hedbergella holmdelensis, Pseudoguembelina costulata, Pseudoguembelina kempensis (?), Guembelitria cretacea, Guembelitria trifolia, Guembelitria danica, Guembelitria irregularis)."

    "text": "Still highly controversial is the pre-K^T species extinction pattern and, in fact, some workers question whether there is any foreshadowing of the boundary extinction event (Smit, 1982, 1990; Olsson and Liu, 1993; Molina et al., 1998; Apellaniz et al., 1997; Luciani, 1977). It is generally argued that the species which are shown to disappear below the K^T boundary at Elles I and II and also at El Kef I and II, are simply extremely rare, but in fact survived up to the boundary event. A time-consuming multiple hour search\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nfor each of these species in a sample just below the K^T boundary by two El Kef blind test investigators is reported to have revealed at least one specimen of each species (Olsson, 1997; Orue-Etxebarria, 1997). It is suggested that these rare occurrences of isolated specimens at the K^T boundary prove that these species also survived up to the K^T boundary event. However, no consideration has been given to the fact that isolated specimens may equally well be present due to reworking as is evident at Elles I and Elles II in the foraminiferal packstone. Even though the reworking argument is generally rejected for isolated specimens below or at the K^T boundary, this same argument is commonly used to interpret the presence of Cretaceous species in Danian sediments as reworked.\nIn our paleobiogeographic distribution study we avoided arguments regarding pre-K^T extinctions by taking the worst-case scenario, namely that all species present in the CF1 time slice interval were extinct by K^T boundary time. The argument regarding pre-K^T extinctions is unlikely to be solved based on the narrow interval of 50^100 cm below and above the boundary that most workers choose to analyze and we used in this study. Few workers have examined the environmental and faunal changes during the late Maastrichtian. Though, stable isotope studies demonstrate profound climatic changes during the last 500 kyr of the Maastrichtian with maximum cooling near the chron 30N/29R boundary about 500 kyr before the K^T boundary followed by rapid 3^4‡C warming between 200 and 400 kyr before the K^T boundary and cooling during the last 200 kyr of the Maastrichtian (Stott and Kennett, 1990; Barrera, 1994; Li and Keller, 1998a,b). Recent studies by Li and Keller (1998a,c) at El Kef and DSDP Site 528, by Abramovich et al. (1998) in Israeli sections and at Elles II have demonstrated major biotic turnovers that mark the progressive biotic e¡ects associated with these rapid climatic changes."

    "text": "Paleoecologic patterns of the K^T mass extinc-\ntion in planktonic foraminifera in Tunisia, spanning environments from open marine upper bathyal, to shelf and shallow marginal settings, indicate a surprisingly selective and environmentally mediated mass extinction. This selectivity is apparent in all of the environmental proxies used to evaluate the mass extinction, including species richness, ecological generalists, ecological specialists, surface and subsurface dwellers, whether based on the number of species or the relative percent abundances of species. The following conclusions can be reached for shallow to deep environments:\nb About three quarters of the species disappeared at or near the K^T boundary.\nb Only ecological generalists, able to tolerate wide variations in temperature, nutrients, salinity and oxygen, survived.\nb Among the ecological generalists, only surface dwellers survived.\nb Ecological opportunists survived (biserial and triserial morphotypes).\nb Only selected ecological opportunists survived.\nb Opportunistic biserial species thrived during the latest Maastrichtian in well strati¢ed open marine settings, but dramatically declined in relative abundances in the early Danian.\nb Opportunistic triserial species thrived only in shallow marginal marine environments during the latest Maastrichtian, but dominated both open marine and restricted marginal settings in the early Danian.\nThis highly selective mass extinction pattern re£ects dramatic changes in temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrients across the K^T boundary in the low latitude Tethys ocean. Are these environmental changes solely the result of a major meteor or comet impact on Yucatan at the K^T boundary? Or are they the cumulative result of rapid climatic changes, major volcanism and impact(s) across the K^T transition? Though an answer to these questions is beyond the scope of this study, the single impact scenario can not explain why the ecosystem did not recover for several hundred thousand years after the K^T boundary, or why high stress conditions began long before the K^T boundary. New studies of the Haiti and\nPALAEO 2758 1-5-02\nMexican K^T sections suggest a multi-event scenario of impacts, volcanism and climatic changes beginning in the late Maastrichtian and continuing well into the early Danian (Stinnesbeck et al., 1999, 2001; Stu«ben et al., 2002; Keller et al., in preparation)."

This selectivity is apparent in all of the environmental proxies used to evaluate the mass extinction, including species richness, ecological generalists, ecological specialists, surface and subsurface dwellers, whether based on the number of species or the relative percent abundances of species. The following conclusions can be reached for shallow to deep environments: about three quarters of the species disappeared at or near the K^T boundary and only ecological generalists able to tolerate wide variations in temperature, nutrients, salinity and oxygen survived. Among the ecological generalists (heterohelicids, guembelitrids, hedbergellids and globigerinellids), only surface dwellers survived. Ecological generalists which largely consisted of two morphogroups of opportunistic biserial and triserial species also suffered selectively. Biserials thrived during the latest Maastrichtian in well stratified open marine settings and dramatically declined in relative abundances in the early Danian. Triserials thrived only in shallow marginal marine environments, or similarly stressed ecosystems, during the latest Maastrichtian, but dominated both open marine and restricted marginal settings in the early Danian. This highly selective mass extinction pattern reflects dramatic changes in temperature, salinity, oxygen and nutrients across the K^T boundary in the low latitude Tethys ocean which appear to be the result of both long-term environmental changes (e.g., climate, sea level, volcanism) and short-term effects (bolide impact). ß 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
