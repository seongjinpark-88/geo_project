  "abstractText": "Maximum entropy and YuleWalker methods of spectrum analysis applied to Lambâ€™s dust veil indices (dvi) for the Northern Hemisphere (1500-1968) show two strong peaks, with periods of 18.6k0.5 and 10.8+0.3 years. They are identified as the 18.6-year luni-solar M, and 10-1 1-year solar cycle S, signals, which have recently been reported in a wide variety of climate and economic time series. The signals were transformed into the time domain by band-pass filters, their wavetrains summed, and the sum superimposed on trend-like components of the dvi; it is found that they account for 48 per cent of variance in the index."
