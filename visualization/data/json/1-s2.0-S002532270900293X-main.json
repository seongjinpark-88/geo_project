In that context, Lake Tutira in Hawke's Bay was cored in 2003 to recover a complete sedimentary record since the lake's formation ca 7.2 ka. The 27.14 m-long core contains alternating lithotypes that are sedimentary responses to lacustrine organic accumulation, normal to severe rainfalls, earthquakes and volcanism. A diatom allochthonous ranking scheme, pollen counts, and C and N percentages were used to identify intralake and watershed-derived storm deposits and modes of lithotype deposition. The lithotypes and depositional modes are: tephras (volcanic airfall); organic-rich mud (algal-rich lake sedimentation); massive to weakly graded, brown silty clay beds (homogenites and redeposited lake sediments); grey, graded sandy mud beds (intense storm-delivered sediment); and, thin yellow clay layers (run-off from small storms). Using 12 tephras and 3 radiocarbon ages to provide a chronology, the long-term sedimentation rate is ca 3.3 mm/year, which increases to N10 mm/year following European colonisation. Storm beds occur in response to rainfall events, with no obvious correlation to El Niño-Southern Oscillation polarity or strength. Moreover, no single climate index appears to correlate strongly with the historic rainfall event record. Having characterised and identified storm-beds over the lake's history, a hindcast relationship implies that around 53 pre-historic storms occurred with a magnitude similar to the severe Cyclone Bola event of 1988, plus 7 potentially larger storm events. Despite the prominence of storm beds, a summation of the total percent thickness as an indication of the relative modesof emplacement for each lithotype shows that proportionally, thebalanceof intra-lakeversus stormsources preserved in the lake bed is 69% and 26%, respectively. Aswell as storms, lake sedimentation is strongly influenced by earthquakes that destabilize the terrigenous, sediment-laden lake margins to generate homogenites, represented by the brown silty clay beds. These deposits tend to be thicker after a hiatus in seismic activity and after sustained periods of lake-margin loading, as inferred from the occurrence of thick graded storm beds. Comparison with marine records on the adjacent continental margin suggests that more terrestrial events are captured in the lake record, due to: (i) close hillslope–lake connectivity, with little intervening storage of sediment compared with the Waipaoa sedimentary system; and, (ii) the preservation of event stratigraphy at Tutira compared to its reduced preservation in the dynamic marine environment. Only major storms such as Cyclone Bola leave an imprint traceable to the ocean, whereas identifiable sedimentary responses to individual earthquakes are localized, although through landscape preconditioning and sediment production they contribute to the overall high terrigenous input to the ocean. In contrast, low-frequency, high magnitude perturbations (volcanic eruptions, European deforestation) are preserved through the Source-to-Sink sedimentary system, consistent with earlier hypotheses.\n64 4 386 2153.\nl rights reserved.\n© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "Given the concern surrounding projected global climate change and the potential for more extreme and unpredictable weather,\ndetailed and well dated environmental records form valuable tools to help gauge future responses. The small, landslide-dammed Lake Tutira, located in northern Hawke's Bay (Fig. 1), was cored to obtain a high-resolution record of environmental change extending back to around ∼7.2 ka (all ages in calendar years) when the lake was formed (Page and Trustrum, 1997). Because of the lake's proximity to the Waipaoa watershed (Source-to-Sink study site), the lacustrine record provides insight into watershed responses to climatic and tectonic processes that have likely affected the Waipaoa source through time. It also acts as a point of reference to comparewith the adjacentmarine record at the Poverty Bay continental margin.\nBy virtue of its geography combined with a vigorous, temperate, maritime climate, storms have regularly produced distinctive deposits\nFig. 1. Locality and bathymetry of Lake Tutira and hinterland in Hawke's Bay, eastern North interval is 10 m. The Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) extends northeast through the central Nor\nin Lake Tutira, during both the period of enhanced post-colonisation erosion, and pre-historic time under undisturbed forest cover. Previous studies of Lake Tutira cores spanning the last 2.25 ky, identified rainfall events preserved as graded sandy mud beds (e.g. Page et al., 1994; Eden and Page, 1998). Such data helped identify the frequency and intensity of rainfall and provided an insight into the waxing and waning of regional weather patterns. Similarly, sedimentary sequences preserved on the adjacent East Coast margin of New Zealand also retain signals generated by perturbations to terrestrial conditions that have occurred over a range of timescales (e.g. Stewart and Neall, 1984; Wilmshurst et al., 1999; McGlone, 2001; Carter et al., 2002). The link between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), rainfall, and watershed erosion has been inferred from previous core\nIsland of New Zealand. Land contours interval is 25 m, and the lake bathymetry contour\nth Island.\nrecords at Lake Tutira, and the lake contains a detailed record of storm intensity and magnitude for the mid–late Holocene (Eden and Page, 1998; Page et al., 2010-this volume). Moreover, a recent landmark study by Gomez et al. (2004) correlating terrestrial and marine records, documented a shift in landscape erosion proxies that was broadly coincident with the mid-Holocene intensification of ENSO activity in northern New Zealand. Acquisition of a terrestrial record for much of the Holocene was a key motivation to re-core Lake Tutira. Here, the key ingredients of rugged and easily erodible slopes, high rainfall, proximity to sediment sources, and the lake's high trapping efficiency have led to an expanded, high-resolution sediment record. Consistent with the over-arching framework of the Waipaoa Source-to-Sink study (e.g. Kuehl et al., 2003, 2006), Lake Tutira offers the opportunity to unravel upper watershed sedimentation at the source. In 2003 a new 27.14 m-long core was recovered from Lake Tutira as a collaborative initiative between Landcare Research, NIWA and Indiana State University.\nThe aims of this new drilling initiative included: (1) characterisation of the complete sedimentary record since the lake's formation 7.2 ka; (2) identification of when and how the lake responded to mid to late Holocene environmental change; (3) re-evaluation of the rainfall event frequency and intensity relationships based on the new core data, which extends beyond the postulated onset of strong ENSO influence ca 4 ka; and (4) construction of a terrestrial “source” record of environmental change that can be compared with records constructed for the marine “sink” at the adjacent Poverty Bay and Hawke's Bay margins (e.g. Carter et al., 2002; Gomez et al., 2004, 2007). A new type of “event bed” is argued and temporal relationships suggest a complex link with climatic and non-climatic forcing. Collectively these components will establish the relative significance of drivers for sedimentation and provide a terrestrial template to apply across the Source-to-Sink study site. This paper establishes the sedimentary framework of the lake for the companion study of Page et al. (2010-this volume), which provides a palaeoenvironmental perspective, together with an examination of the wider climatic implications by Gomez et al. (submitted for publication)."

    "text": "Lake Tutira formed by collapse of a hillside around ∼7.2 ka, damming the southern valley outlet (Adams, 1981; Trustrum and Page, 1992). The lake's 32 km2 watershed is situated ∼155 m above sea level (Irwin, 1978) in the landslide-prone, hill country of Hawke's Bay (Fig. 1). This region lies within the forearc of the active convergent Hikurangi Margin (Lewis and Pettinga, 1993). Locally, the geology is dominated by uplifted Tertiary marine sandstones and mudstones, with interlayered calcareous rocks (including limestone) and conglomerates (Lowe, 1987). The southern surrounds of the lake are particularly landslide-prone, featuring a physiography of steep, dissected hills and narrow-infilled valleys (Page et al., 1994). The majority of terrestrial sediment entering Lake Tutira is derived from these proximal hillslope sources of similar lithology. The bathymetry of the lake shows a drowned valley morphology of interfingering spurs with steep slopes that descend into a narrow meandering lake floor (Fig. 1). This small (1.8 km2) and shallow lakewith amean depth of 21 m and max depth of 42 m (Irwin, 1978), has long been recognised as a sediment and nutrient trap and repository of storminduced erosion (e.g. Guthrie-Smith, 1999 — first printed in 1921; Teirney, 1980; Adams, 1981; Lowe 1987; Page et al., 1994; Eden and Page, 1998; Gomez et al., 2002). Guthrie-Smith, who settled at Lake Tutira in 1882, first observed large influxes of mud during heavy rainfall events and speculated on the lake's eventual demise from infilling (Guthrie-Smith, 1999). He also began recording daily rainfall measurements and other environmental data, creating a valuable historical archive for a period of dramatic landscape change when forest and bracken fern were converted to pasture. Evidence from\npollen analysis and charcoal content of the lake sediment indicates that a succession of fires over a few centuries of Polynesian settlement since ca 0.49 ka destroyed most of the conifer-broadleaved forest that once dominated the watershed (Wilmshurst, 1997; Wilmshurst et al., 1997). By the time European settlers arrived at Tutira in 1873 AD nearly all the lake watershed was covered in bracken (Guthrie-Smith, 1999). Successive bathymetric surveys in 1925 and 1963 showed that around 1.9×106 m3 of sediment had been deposited on the lake bed over 38 years (Grant, 1966), equivalent to a flux of 5.4×104 m3/year or 63,000 tonnes/year, assuming a dry bulk density of 1.16 g/cm3 (Page et al., 2004)."

    "text": "In April 2003, the 27.14 m-long core, LT24, was collected in 37.4 m of water. The field program involved retrieval of frozen box cores to capture an undisturbed stratigraphy in the uppermost ∼50 cm of the lake bed (cf. Page et al., 1994). Deeper sediments were retrieved using a barge-mounted rig operated by Webster Drilling Ltd. Their initial cores (LT22 and LT23) were obtained by push, and periodic powered, coring of the substrate, which resulted in incomplete recovery and sediment deformation. The introduction of a piston core for LT24 overcame these issues considerably and yielded 95.3% recovery with minimal core deformation. Distinct sedimentary units were characterised using a range a physical and biophysical properties."

    "heading": "3.1. Sedimentological analysis",
    "text": "Upon retrieval, split and cleaned core sections were photographed using a high-resolution digital camera under natural light. Cores were also visually logged for lithology and sedimentary structures, and profiles of volume magnetic susceptibility and spectral reflectance were obtained at 1 cm intervals down core using a Bartington MS2F probe and a hand-held Minolta Spectrophotometer CM-508d (8 mm measurement diameter), respectively. These physical properties assisted in the identification of fine-grained tephra layers. Selected sections were X-radiographed to further define sedimentary structures. Tephras were analysed by A.S. Palmer (Massey University) for glass-shard major element chemistry (using an electron microprobe housed at Victoria University of Wellington) and heavy mineral assemblages to identify the eruption sources and their ages by correlation with well-established and dated counterparts elsewhere (e.g. Froggatt and Lowe, 1990; Lowe et al., 2008). Storm deposits that occurred during the 20th century were identified in LT24 by correlating against the storm record template as described by Page et al. (1994).\nThe proximity of Lake Tutira around 100 km downwind from the Taupo Volcanic Zone (Fig. 1 inset) has resulted in the presence of numerous discrete airfall tephras in the lake record. Tephras also mantled the regional landscape (e.g. Froggatt and Lowe, 1990) and were readily eroded on steep hillslopes. Airfall was distinguished from redeposited tephra by the former's purity and normal grading; washed tephras typically contained non-volcanic sediment and formed both graded and massive beds, and laminae. Lake tephra deposits have been used previously, along with other age markers (e.g. pollen, diatoms, and 137Cs activity), to define sedimentation for historical and late Holocene times (e.g. Page and Trustrum, 1997; Eden and Page, 1998). Sedimentation rates are calculated by linear interpolation between discrete tephra layers derived from volcanic activity in the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). The 11.8 and 49.5-cm thick tephras for the Taupo (1.717 ka) and Waimihia (3.392 ka) eruptions respectively, comprise a lower graded airfall unit with a sharp basal contact immediately overlain by an upper redeposited unit. In the absence of intervening mud beds, both primary and secondary components are assumed to be instantaneous deposits. Accordingly,\n14 A .R.O\nrpin et al./ M arine G eology 270 (2010) 11 –29\nthe redeposited top of the tephra is assigned the same age as its air fall base.\nThree radiocarbon dates from wood samples preserved at the base of the lake section in core LT24 range from 7.05–7.29 ka, giving a mean age of ∼7.2 ka for the commencement of lake sedimentation, which presumably closely followed damming by a landslide.\nGrain size analyses on selected beds were performed using a Galai laser-particle sizer (NIWA, Hamilton) and a Sedigraph 5100 (NIWA, Wellington). Samples were dispersed in fresh water with the aid of mild sonification and 0.5 g/L calgon, in accordance with standard laboratory practice."

    "heading": "3.2. Diatom sampling and analysis",
    "text": "Forty-nine representative samples from the range of sedimentary units were processed at the GNS Science Rafter Laboratory to broadly characterise the diatom and pollen record, partly guided by an earlier report by Harper (1990). Initial effort focused on 17 samples from the upper 138 cm of the core to allow correlation with historical rainfall records, namely the 1924, 1938, 1960, 1985, and 1988 storm deposits (cf. Page et al., 1994; Eden and Page, 1998).\nSamples of ∼1 g (dry weight) were processed to concentrate diatom valves. Samples were treated with hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid to remove organic matter and carbonates. Sand and clay fractions were removed by washing, settling and decanting. Microscope slides were prepared by drying small aliquots of the suspensate onto coverslips and mounting them in Naphrax. Diatom species were identified with reference to standard floras (e.g. Hartley, 1996; Hustedt, 1985; Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1991, 1999a,b, 2000a,b). In all except one sample at least 300 valves were counted.\nDiatom concentrations were estimated using the following equation:\nTotal valves = valves counted × area coverslip area counted × sample volume aliquot volume\nConcentrations are expressed as valves per gram of sediment after dividing the above by the dry weight of the initial sample used. Diatomswere grouped into the following categories according to their favoured habitats to aid interpretation of sedimentary sources, derived from Round et al. (1990) and van Dam et al. (1994): (a) planktic diatoms living in water column; (b) tychoplanktic diatoms living in the water column but limited to shallow turbulent water; (c) benthic diatoms attached to surfaces such as sediment, rocks, plants; and, (d) aerophilic diatoms living on moist or dry surfaces often associated with soils. Species richness is used to provide an indication of the taxonomic diversity of a diatom assemblage and is simply the number of taxa identified divided by the total diatoms counted."

    "text": "Pollen and spore analyses were carried out on the same 49 layers sampled for diatoms, with the aim to provide further information about the source and mode of lake sediment deposition. Samples of ∼1–3 g (dry weight) were treated with 50% hydrofluoric acid for two days, then treated with 5% nitric acid for 5–10 min, oxidised and filtered through a 6 μm filter and strained through a 260 μm strainer. All samples had one exotic Lycopodium tablet added to permit the determination of absolute abundance. All samples were counted to 300 spores and pollen. Earlier work by Wilmshurst et al. (1997) and Wilmshurst (1997) summarise the regional pollen record."

    "text": "Twelve samples representing the major sediment types were also analysed to characterise organic source contribution. All samples\nwere kept frozen at−20 °C until they were sampled, freeze-dried and ground to a fine homogeneous powder. Subsamples of the core were treated with 5 ml 1 M HCl acid overnight to remove inorganic carbon. Acidified samples were neutralised with deionised water and centrifuged 3 times (3600 rpm for 15 min) before being freezedried and rehomogenised.\nCarbon and nitrogen contents and isotopic composition from the demineralised core samples were analysed in duplicate at the GNS Science Stable Isotope Laboratory, using a Europa Geo 20/20 (PDZ Europa Ltd. U.K.) isotope ratio mass spectrometer, interfaced to an ANCA-SL elemental analyzer (PDZ Europa Ltd. U.K.) in continuous flow mode (EA-IRMS). The carbon dioxide gas was resolved from nitrogen gas using gas chromatographic separation on a column at 65 °C and analysed simultaneously for isotopic abundance as well as total organic carbon and nitrogen. International and working reference standards (NIST N1, IAEA-CH6, Montana Soil, wheat flour, and beet sugar) and blanks were included during each run for calibration. Isotopic ratios (15 N/14 N and 13C/12C) are expressed as isotopic deviations δ defined as\nδð‰Þ = ½ðRs−RRefÞ= RRef × 1000\nwhere Rs is the isotopic ratio measured for the sample and RRef that of the international standards. The δ13C value is relative to the international Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) standard, and the δ15N value is relative to atmospheric air. Results are expressed in δ (‰) versus the specific reference. The analytical precision of the measurements is ±0.2‰, and reproducibility of the results is within ±0.2‰ for carbon and ±0.3‰ for nitrogen (1σn). The samples were also analysed for visual abundance of macroscopic aquatic and terrestrial organic matter to see if this indicates an in-lake or watershed origin for the sediment."

    "text": "The makeup of the sedimentary record is alternating grey–brown terrigenous units interlayered with brown–black, organic-rich lake deposits. Known historical storms were sampled for palaeoecological and sedimentological analysis to compliment visual descriptions, and help establish a lithostratigraphic template to interpret the prehistoric part of the core (Table 1). The core record can be further characterised by five basic lithotypes: (1) tephras; (2) organic-rich muds; (3) massive to weakly graded, brown silty clays; (4) wellgraded, sandy muds; and (5) thin clay layers (Table 2; Fig. 2). There is some overlap in physical, chemical and biological characteristics, some of which can be accommodated as sub-types (Table 2).\nMacroscopic tephras (Type 1) from the Taupo Volcanic Zone occur throughout the core, with 12 geochemically identified from discrete eruptions. Tephras have variable thickness, are typically light-grey to cream coloured, often graded with very-coarse sand-sized lapilli at sharp basal contacts, and magnetic susceptibilities higher than other lithologies (Fig. 2). Darkly-coloured, laminated, organic-rich, silty clay beds (Type 2) are typically thin, have a weak magnetic susceptibility signature, and occur approximately every 5 years throughout the complete core. Thick, brown, silty clay beds are massive to weaknormally graded units (Types 3A and 3B, respectively), or well, normally graded units (Type 4) (Fig. 2). The degree of grading, the presence of disseminated organic fragments, mud content, and a sharp top contact distinguish these lithotypes. A range of normal grading is evident from the grain size analyses, suggesting a spectrum of hydrodynamic conditions. The average occurrence of Type 3 and Type 4 beds in the complete core is approximately every 31 and 40 years, respectively. Clay units (Types 5A and 5B) are typically laminae and thin beds of light-yellow brown colour. Type 5A halo clays have gradational lower and sharp upper contacts, and overlie\nTa bl e 2 Su m m ar y of\nse di m en\nta ry\nch ar ac te ri st ic s, di at om\n,p ol le n,\nca rb on\n,n it ro ge\nn, an\nd ph\nys ic al\npr op\ner ti es\nfo r th e 27\n.1 4- m\nlo ng\nLT 24\nco re\nre co\nrd .S\ned im\nen ta ry\nun it s ar e di vi de\nd in to\nbr oa\nd lit ho\nty pe\ns, w hi ch\nar e us\ned as\na te m pl at e fo r in te rp re ti ng\nm od\nes of\nde po\nsi ti on\n.D ia to m ,p\nol le n an\nd tr ile\nte sp\nor e da\nta ar e su\nm m ar is ed\nfr om\nTa bl e 1.\nTy pe\nBe d na\nm e\nTe xt ur e\nN um\nbe r\nof be\nds D ia to m\nal lo ch\nth on\nei ty\nra nk\nin g (s ee\nTa bl e 1)\nPo lle n co nc en\ntr at io n\nTr ile\nte sp\nor e\nco un\nt Th\nic kn\nes s A ve\nra ge\n,r an ge (c m )\nM ag\nne ti c su\nsc ep t.

The assumption implicit with this style of analysis is that distinct units result from different processes. For the most part, these lithotypes can be considered sedimentary responses to different forcing mechanisms, such as severe rainfall, earthquake or volcanic eruption."

    "text": "The tephra chronology coupled with three radiocarbon dates yield a sedimentation curve that extends those presented in earlier studies (Eden et al., 1993; Page and Trustrum, 1997). The curve (Fig. 4) shows a broadly consistent sedimentation rate of ca 3.3 mm/year over the pre-European 7.1 ky period. Bulk density data summarised in Page et al. (1994) suggest that there is negligible compaction down core, hence the measured sediment thicknesses closely approximate the corrected mass accumulation rate. A slight steepening in the sedimentation curve occurs immediately prior to the Taupo eruption (1.717 ka), and around the Hinemaiaia series of small eruptions in the mid-Holocene (Fig. 4), which are discussed in detail below. The postEuropean settlement period shows an order of magnitude increase in sedimentation rate to N10 mm/year since ca 1880 AD."

    "heading": "4.3. Historical rainfall record",
    "text": "Daily rainfall measurements made between 1900 and 2000 AD from Lake Tutira (Fig. 5) show that the region is moderately wet, with an average annual rainfall of 1375 mm, but experiences significant inter-annual variation as indicated by the standard deviation of 346 mm. Accordingly, the average number of wet days is 103/year (allowing for some years with incomplete data). Of particular relevance to the lake stratigraphy is the frequency of major rainfall events. There were 55 years during the 20th century that experienced at least one rainfall event N100 mm/day. Similarly, 9 years experienced rainfalls of N200 mm/day. Whilst monthly and annual statistics provide some averaging by the inclusion of background conditions, the rainfall event component biases the longer term statistical record. With the exception of 1973 and 1977, months with the storms accounted for 28–39% of the annual rainfall.\nThe relationship between the top 10% of rainfall events and regional climate indicators is not clear. A comparison of the seasonal Southern Oscillation Index (SOI: the seasonal fluctuations in the normalized surface air pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia) and seasonal total rainfall reveals a significant scatter (Fig. 6), but the two largest floods of 1938 and 1988 (in terms of rain intensity and duration) occurred when the seasonal SOI was weakly positive (La Niña). Severe rainfall events occurred during El Niño and La Niña phases with no obvious correlation to either the polarity or relative strength of the ENSO (Fig. 6). In contrast, the majority of rainfall events are coincident with reduced westerly flows as shown by the negative average seasonal east–west pressure gradient (Fig. 6), indicative of southward to southeastward tracking ex-tropical cyclones and deep depressions that deliver strong onshore wind and heavy rain as they cross northeastern New Zealand.\nENSO (the combined atmospheric-ocean response caused by warming of surface waters of the tropical Eastern Pacific Ocean) patterns are closely linked to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO: the pattern of Pacific climate variability that shifts phases on at least interdecadal time scale) with periods of strong positive IPO polarity associated with enhanced and more frequent El Niño events (Salinger et al., 2001). During El Niño conditions New Zealand experiences\n18 A .R.O rpin et al./ M arine G eology 270 (2010) 11 –29\nenhanced westerly to southwesterly winds, more rain in western regions and slightly less rain in the east (Salinger and Mullan, 1999). However, positive IPO at mid-latitudes may be accompanied by elevated sea-surface temperatures and atmospheric effects that enhance the generation of tropical and ex-tropical depressions (Salinger andMullan, 1999; Sinclair, 2002). Despite these generalities, the relationship of the annual number of wet days and the IPO at Lake Tutira shows no strong correlation (Fig. 5). Historically the three most severe storms in terms of rain intensity (N300 mm/day in 1924, 1938, and 1988) occurred when the IPO was positive and relatively large. Sympathetic with a negative IPO phase between 1950 and 1970, there are fewer storm beds over that same period (Fig. 5). Similarly, there is\na weak correlation for some dry years during negative phases of IPO polarity, with the number of wet days well below the average of 103.\nIn summary, direct correlation between historical climate indicators and the sedimentary record is not straightforward, even in what appears to be a relatively closed lake system (e.g. Figs. 4 and 5). This contrasts with the strong ENSO signals preserved in lake records from South America (Rodbell et al., 1999; Moy et al., 2002; Conroy et al., 2008) where climate is less modulated by the multiple drivers that it is suggested affect New Zealand rainfall (Ummenhofer and England, 2007; Ummenhofer et al., 2009). These and other proxy data emphasise that natural systems are comprised of many interconnected components and, in the case of Lake Tutira at least, no\nsingle climate measure offers an avenue to fully unravel the sedimentary record. A more comprehensive examination of the storm frequency–magnitude record from LT24 and its relationship to other climate proxies is presented in Page et al. (2010-this volume), and climatic drivers and global teleconnections are explored in Gomez et al. (submitted for publication)."

    "heading": "4.4. Diatom assemblages",
    "text": "Diatoms are present and well preserved in all samples, and concentrations range from moderate (millions of valves per gram of sediment) to extremely high (billions of valves per gram) (Table 1). Dominant planktic diatom taxa are those typical of a freshwater, oligotrophic lake (nutrient poor) such as Cyclotella stelligera, Aulacoseira ambigua, A. granulata and Cyclostephanos dubius. High proportions of tychoplanktonic species (forms able to settle to the bed, survive, and await physical resuspension) such as Staurosirella pinnata, are also present throughout much of the lake record. Although these species dominate many samples, there are other features of the assemblages that enable differentiation between samples, including diatom concentration, proportions of different habitat types and species richness. Samples that contain extremely high concentrations of diatoms generally have assemblages made up of over 80% planktic species, low percentages of other habitat types, and low (b0.07) species richness. This combination of features is consistent with high productivity, low diversity, and autochthonous, central lake flora. In contrast, other samples with relatively lower concentrations of diatoms (although still moderate to high in absolute\nterms) tend to contain significant proportions of tychoplanktic, benthic and aerophilic species (N20% combined) with high (N0.07) species richness. These characteristics indicate dilution/inhibition of the central lake flora by non-lake sediment influx and introduction of diatoms from littoral lake and moist soil sources, thereby raising the proportions of tychoplanktic, benthic, and aerophilic species. The high species richness is a result of littoral and soil species being added to the central lake diatom flora.\nFrom these observations an allochthoneity ranking is developed whereby the autochthonous central lake assemblage is designated ‘0’ and the assemblage with most allochthonous features is designated ‘4’. All samples are ranked between 0 and 4 (Table 1) according to the number of the following allochthonous features they contain: (1) diatom concentration bb1 billion diatoms per gram of sediment; (2) low ratio of planktic:benthic/tychoplanktic habitat types (b80% planktic species, N10% benthic and/or tychoplanktic species); (3) high soil diatoms (N1% aerophilic species); and (4) high species richness (N0.07). By ranking samples according to their allochthonous features, the lithologic units can be assessed semi-quantitatively to represent ‘normal’ lake sedimentation or an extreme event. A reasonable initial assumption is that the higher the ranking, the more likely the sample is to represent an extreme event such as a severe flood (Fig. 7).\nDiatom analyses of samples from known storm events in the historical section of the core (the upper 167 cm with 35 storm beds represents the period after European arrival) were used to test the allochthoneity ranking. Samples from the base, middle and top of the unit representing Cyclone Bola in 1988 all have an allochthonous ranking of 4— they contain all four features representative of material being transported from lake margins and outside the lake into the centre of the lake. Deposits identified in LT24 as from the 1985, 1938 and 1924 storms (see Page et al., 1994) all have allochthonous rankings of 4, the former two in the uppermost sample only. The 1960 storm is represented as a thin clay unit and only has a ranking of 1. All remaining samples are from units not related to historically recorded storms and they rank as 0 or 1. The low allochthoneity rankings of the 1960 storm and the basal sections of the 1938 and 1985 storm units perhaps indicate that allochthonous components may be stratigraphically restricted due to variability of storm sediment delivery processes. Therefore, vertical sampling through a storm bed is required to obtain a more complete picture. Furthermore, examination of the historical record suggests that storm units need to be N1 cm thick before registering a high allochthonous ranking.\nThese observations suggest a link between diatom allochthoneity ranking and an inferredmode of deposition (Tables 1 and 2). Although there are likely to be differences between the historical and prehistorical sedimentary records, we can apply the ranking scheme to the pre-historical record to determine the likely mode of deposition of various samples. In the European period all storm bed samples yielded an allochthonous ranking of 4. By contrast, in the pre-European period the proportion of aerophilic species is reduced and many units have a ranking of only 2 or 3. A ranking of 3 is likely to indicate storm-related deposition, but during pre-historical times sediment sources were probably more localized and partly protected under forest cover, whereas in the historical period allochthonous watershed components were much more exposed and available under open pasture. An allochthonous ranking of 2 represents a transitional state between storm and non-storm deposition whereby some allochthonous components were introduced via less extreme processes."

    "text": "Initial characterisation of well-graded, sandy mud deposits and yellow clays (Types 4 and 5) that have been attributed to historical storms (cf. Page et al., 1994) show that they have low pollen concentrations (typically b50,000/g; Table 1), presumably diluted by\nthe rapid influx of soil and regolith-derived sediment (Table 2). In addition, trilete spores tended to be more abundant (N160 in a spore count of 300) in historical storm deposits in spite of the possibility that source sediment may be either surficial, with abundant spores in the soil, or from deeper landslides, with no trilete spores preserved in the sediment. The wide range in preservation of the trilete spores in historical storm events attests to their various sources (abundant in modern soil, reworked fossil, or subfossil). Organic-rich layers (Type 2) have high pollen concentrations and low trilete counts (Table 2). Collectively, this template was applied to aid interpretation of prehistoric samples, and broadly consistent with results from the historical section of the core, graded storm beds (Type 4) and yellow clays (Type 5B) have low pollen concentrations and relatively abundant trilete spores. Despite the apparent consistency of this trend, pollen concentrations are still high at the sandy basal sections of graded storm deposits and only attain low concentrations at the clay cap, perhaps indicative of storm-induced source changes and dilution effects. In addition, high trilete spore concentrations are often accompanied bymarine dinoflagellates (Table 1) possibly transported inland from the nearby coast by strong onshore winds that typically accompany large storms (Fig. 6). Brown silty clays (Type 3) are of intermediate character with high but variable pollen concentrations, and low but variable trilete spore counts."

Thin clays have high percent C and low N values indicative of a terrestrial source, but other measured values (e.g. magnetic susceptibility, allochthoneity ranking) are mixed; thin clays may reflect calmer settling conditions, perhaps indicative of minor storms.

    "text": "Type 1 units that are composed entirely of ash and lapilli are interpreted to be primary airfall deposits, although there is evidence of overlying irregular, finer-textured ash lenses of coarse to fine sand, interspersed with the coarse lapilli. Such textural variability can be attributed to either multiple eruption phases (e.g. Walker, 1981), downwind lateral shifts in the dispersal axis of the ash cloud, and/or localized reworking of tephra (Fig. 2, core section 12). The relative thicknesses of tephra are compatible with the downwind distance of Lake Tutira, from theTaupoVolcanic Zone (Walker, 1981;Wilson, 1993).\nModern, Type 2A black, algal-rich layers are products of eutrophic (nutrient enriched) conditions caused by nutrient run-off from surrounding fertilised pasture (e.g. Page et al., 1994). Prior to conversion to pasture, the seasonal organic build-up within the forested landscape was less dramatic and resulted in brown, rather than black, organic layers (Type 2B). Concentrations of detritus and humic material in the organic component of these sediments presumably originated as wash-in during storms. Type 2 beds have low diatom allochthoneity rankings and we interpret them as mostly typical of ambient lake sedimentation between storms. The thickest, algal-rich organic accumulations likely occurred during droughts or extended periods between large storm events. The core has conspicuously few dark organic layers between 245 and 377 cm (ca 0.42–0.92 ka), with N300 years between organic-rich deposits; a significant hiatus compared with the average interval of ca 5 years for the complete core. This same section of the core has several thin, silty clays (Type 5), massive units (Type 3), and an absence of thick, graded storm deposits (Type 4). These observations suggest that the prePolynesian period (prior to ca 0.49 ka) coincided with a lower frequency of large storms (Eden and Page, 1998).\n5.1.2. Homogenites: brown mud layers emplaced as sediment gravity flows\nType 3 lithologies comprise brown, massive to weakly graded units withmud contents of 60–46%, respectively (Fig. 2). They contain\nhigher concentrations of disseminated organics, have abundant planktic diatoms, and low allochthoneity ranking that indicate an intra-lake source. Several attributes of the Type 3 brown mud layers point to emplacement as sediment gravity flows: (1) beds have a sharp basal contact that varies from linear, slightly wavy, to load casted; (2) overall, beds exhibit weak grading with thin, fine sandy to coarse silty mud bases, passing up into the thick, brown and occasionally grey mud section, capped by a thin, light yellow–brown layer of clay. Throughout these beds, clay content varies within a range of ∼15%. It is only at a bed top that clay content significantly increases, presumably as a consequence of settling once the main body of the bed was emplaced (e.g. Kneller and McCaffrey, 2003); (3) sedimentary structures are sparse in hand specimen, but X-radiographs reveal a few, very faint laminae in the lower parts of a unit that imply deposition under a weak flow (cf. Bouma, 1962); and, (4) some units contain sand-sized, carbonaceous debris that appears to have been entrained from underlying, organic-rich lake sediments.\nThe above features are consistent with deposition from sediment density flows. The general lack of structure, coupled with poor sorting probably reflects accumulation of Type 3 from a turbid flow in which turbulence is insufficient to support the suspended load (e.g. Kneller and McCaffrey, 2003). This state is usually reached when a flow decelerates; in the case of Lake Tutira where the current enters the main basin at the southern end of the lake. Nonetheless, the flows probably retained sufficient momentum to produce faint basal laminae and to entrain low density, organic detritus from the lake bed. Specifically, the deposits can be categorised as homogenites on the basis of their near-massive appearance, relatively thick zones of weak, normal grading and thin top layer of clay-rich mud (e.g. Sturm and Matter, 1978; Kastens and Cita, 1981; Sturm et al., 1995; McHugh et al., 2006; Bertand et al., 2008).\nMany of the homogenites are brown with the remainder grey. A clue to the source of the brown homogenites is their abundant diatom flora, which is overwhelmingly dominated by planktic species, representative of central lake environments, and tychoplanktic species typical of littoral lake settings (Table 1). Conspicuously absent are soil or aerophilic diatoms, which appear to be restricted to major storm deposits (Table 1). Furthermore, the high carbon content of the brown homogenites (N3% C) also compares favourably with normal lake sediments, in contrast to their grey counterparts (b2%C).We conclude that the brown homogenites probably formed through remobilisation of lake-margin sediments. By comparison, the grey homogenites, with their low carbon contents, are likely to be flood deposits that were delivered more or less directly to the depocentre by sediment gravity flows whose weak turbulence and/or high sediment load favoured a massive structure (Kneller and McCaffrey, 2003).\nWhether sediment deposits along the lake margin were remobilized by storms, earthquakes, or both is unclear (cf. Osleger et al., 2003). But, the history of homogenite deposits at the lake's centre reveals distinct phases of high recurrence (b25 years between deposits) especially between 0.6–1.0, 1.5–1.8, 2.1–2.5, 4.3–5.0, and 5.6–5.7 ka (Fig. 8), given the uncertainties in the age model (Fig. 4). These phases are separated by lengthy periods when the number of homogenites reduced markedly and their return periods rose from b25 years to N50 years (Fig. 8).\nWith regard to earthquake initiation, the homogenite record was compared with the palaeoseismic history of the Hawke's Bay region compiled from Berryman (1993), Berryman et al. (1989), Cochran et al. (2006) and Hayward et al. (2006). On the basis of uplifted terrace sequences and marked palaeoecological changes in coastal settings, these authors record a maximum of 13 major earthquakes of estimatedmagnitude exceedingMw=7.4 (Fig. 8). Given uncertainties estimating the age of some events, it is possible that earthquakes occurring within a few centuries of each other, such as those of ∼7 ka (Hayward et al., 2006) and ∼7.1 ka (Cochran et al., 2006), are the same event, and possibly the trigger for the landslide that formed Lake\nTutira. Nevertheless, there is a tentative correlation of homogenite bed thickness with the composite palaeoseismic history (Fig. 8).\nOne or more homogenites, N6 cm thick, occur within several decades of an earthquake. Those deposits timed closest to an earthquake age tend to be thickest, with 65% N10 cm thick. This correlation reinforces the role of earthquakes generally in priming the landscape and increasing sediment yields. For example, coseismic weakening of substrate after theMw 7.6 Chi Chi earthquake in Taiwan triggered 20,000 landslides, which together with subsequent storms, elevated river sediment loads (e.g. Dadson et al., 2004). The earthquakes dated at ∼7 and ∼7.1 ka are preceded by a stack of homogenites with individual thickness up to 33 cm. Strong lakeorigin sources evident in some units suggest that gravity-driven failures may also result from overloading of lake-margin slopes. The ∼5.4 and ∼4.2 ka events (Berryman et al., 1989; Hayward et al., 2006) correlate with beds of physically mixed sediment indicating deposition from a subaqueous mass flow. Not all homogenites correlate with the known palaeoseismic record (Fig. 8). But this is not surprising as the record represents estimated magnitudes Mw≥7.4. Smaller, earthquakes may also be capable of initiating homogenite deposition.\nThe possible effect of loading the lake margin with storm inputs, which are subsequently incorporated into down-slope mass-transport deposits and homogenites, is also examined in Fig. 8. Here, the thickness of large, graded storm beds is used as a proxy for significant pulses of sediment into the lake. The frequency of homogenite beds is also shown to compare with the earthquake record. There are three hiatuses in large earthquake activity 0.6–1.6, 1.9–3.0, and 4.5–5.4 ka. Thick homogenite deposits occurduring thesehiatuses, after loadingof the lakemargin from storm-transported sediment as inferred from the thick graded storm beds, particularly in the hiatuses beginning at 5.4 and 3.0 ka (Fig. 8).\nOn balance, the thickest brown homogenites are regarded as redeposited lake-margin sedimentswhose remobilisationwas probably triggered by earthquakes. Grey homogenites aremore closely related to bona fide storm deposits but it is unclear whether they deposited directly from floods or formed by remobilisation of flood material deposited at the lake margin."

    "heading": "5.1.3. Storm beds: evidence of landscape response to rain events",
    "text": "Building on observations and analysis from earlier Lake Tutira cores (Page et al., 1994; Page and Trustrum, 1997; Eden and Page, 1998), during the 20th century, major flooding and lake storm deposits occurred in years when: (i) the annual number of wet days exceeded 100 (with the exception of 1933 with 97 days); and, (ii) a rainfall event N200 mm/day occurred during that year (Fig. 5). These rainfall events are correlated to Type 4 and thick Type 5 storm bed deposits in LT24. However, some years exceeded the average annual number of wet days of 103 (N130 days in 1907, 1935, 1956, 1974, and 1976), but in the absence of rainfall intensity N200 mm/day, no terrestrial flood deposit was recognised.\nIs the generation of a flood deposit by a rainfall event affected by precursor conditions in thewatershed? Such conditionsmight include enhanced soil erodibility due to a sustained period of wetter or drier climate, or earthquake activation of landslides (see Dadson et al., 2005). The answer is partly addressed empirically by the positive correlation between storm layer thickness and maximum daily rainfall with a R2 of 0.65 (Fig. 9). This first-order result suggests that a storm today with a rain intensity of 300 mm/day, similar in magnitude to that during cyclone Bola, will generate a sediment deposit around 17 cm thickness at the lake's centre. However, landscape preconditioning may also affect the sediment yield, so rainfall might only provide an indicative estimate of flood layer thickness (Gomez et al., 2002). Furthermore, using the historical landscape response to hindcast the pre-historic record has large uncertainties because of the erosion response of a pre-colonisation forested rather than a modern pastured landscape. Eden and Page (1998) suggest that sediment thickness for a given rainfall event was\nreduced by about 6 times under forest cover. Hence, a pre-historic storm bed of ca 3 cm thickness might result from rainfall ca 300 mm/ day. Similarly, the mean pre-historic storm bed thickness of 0.5 cm might have resulted from rainfall ca 200 mm/day, or a monthly rainfall ca 400 mm – an amount around half the intensity of Cyclone Bola. In the complete pre-European section of LT24, 1130 storm beds are b0.5 cm thickness, and 235 beds are thicker, of which 54 are ≥2 cm (one standard deviation above the mean) and point to an estimated rainfall intensity ca 270 mm/day – a rate slightly weaker than Cyclone Bola. Only 7 pre-historic storm beds, all of which are Type 4 graded beds, are thicker than 10 cm, the result of catastrophic rainfall perhaps N500 mm/day."

    "heading": "5.2. Long term landscape erosion from fluctuations in sedimentation rate",
    "text": "The long-term sedimentation rate of ca 3.3 mm/year over the preEuropean period derived from the current study, is higher than the\naverage pre-Polynesian and Polynesian rates of 1.3 and 2.4 mm/year, respectively, estimated by Page and Trustrum (1997) from shorter Lake Tutira cores (LT15, LT16, and LT17). However, fluctuations in sedimentation rate are problematic to unravel for the pre-historic period, compounded by uncertainties in the ages for the Hinemaiaia N,M and K tephras(4.680±0.160, 4.825±0.215, and 5.127±0.106 ka respectively, after Wilson, 1993; Lowe et al., 2008). Nonetheless, the apparent increase in sedimentation rate between the K and N tephras (Fig. 4) could reflect the availability of easily erodible ash-rich sediments or a rise in the storm frequency/intensity. An alternative explanation that the watershed was destabilized by a major earthquake is unlikely, as large earthquake ground-shaking events recorded elsewhere in the region at 4.2 and 5.8 ka (Berryman, 1993; Hayward et al., 2006), which are likely to have affected the Lake Tutira area, are not reflected in the sedimentation rate curve. Smaller earthquakes occur in the palaeoseismic record and these could have promoted landscape destabilization, although their net effect at Tutira is uncertain. Similarly, increases in\nsedimentation rate are evident in the intervals between theMotutere H andWhakatane tephras, and to a lesser extent between theMapara and Taupo tephras (Fig. 4). Only provisional identification of Tufa Trig 5 tephra (ca 0.650 ka, after Donoghue et al., 1995, 1997) and the apparent absence of Kaharoa tephra (0.636 ka) in LT24, currently precludes confident tephrochronological quantification of post-Polynesian sedimentation rates. Changes in pollen stratigraphy described by Wilmshurst (1997) show the impact of forestfires and landclearance, and the proliferation of bracken, fern and scrub. Evidence summarised in Page and Trustrum (1997) indicates that this change began shortly after the Kaharoa eruption. They infer only moderate increases in sedimentation rate for this post-Polynesian period as the valley floors and riparian cover buffered sediment shed from landslide-prone hillslopes.\nOther local records of similar temporal duration to the Lake Tutira cores are limited to the pre-Taupo section of a 16.57 m-long core (P4), located at the former swamp at the northern end of the lake (Eden et al., 1993; Page and Trustrum, 1997). Here, Page and Trustrum (1997) noted a sharp rise in sedimentation rate immediately prior to the Taupo tephra, which they hypothesized to be in response to increased storm frequency (cf. Eden and Page, 1998). Earlier studies of shorter cores suggest that significant natural variability in sedimentation rates occurred even under forest cover, and the watershed was responding to the cumulative effect of environmental change, including climate, sediment erodibility and landscape preconditioning. In contrast, the general trend of sedimentation rate yielded from the longer core LT24 at the lake's centre shows relatively less variability. Here, sedimentation rates are broadly consistent throughout the Holocene to the European colonisation, with a slight increase immediately prior to the Taupo eruption (Fig. 4). This could reflect the longer and more integrated record captured in LT24 that will tend to deemphasize the punctuated input of thick storm deposits. Furthermore, LT24 is located at the deepest point of the lake rather than at the lake foreshore, where vertical accumulation rates are likely to change markedly in response to shoreline processes.\nA summation of the total percent thickness of each of the preserved lithotypes (Fig. 10) at the lake's centre primarily comprises five sedimentary components: homogenites (30%), massive deposits (22%), organics (17%), graded storm beds (17%) and storm clay (9%). Tephra (3%) units constitute only a minor amount of sediment, nonstormclays (1%), and unassigned (1%). Assuming sediment densities are broadly consistent, a simplistic sediment budget for the core suggests that intra-lake units of terrigenous-dominant homogenite and massive units plus organic deposits, make up 69% of the preserved record. Units identified as storm deposits only constitute 26% of the preserved total sediment thickness. The corollary of this analysis is that the preserved event record was formed in response to a number of drivers, and the direct impact of climate on lake sedimentation is limited."

    "heading": "5.3. Lake Tutira in the context of Source-to-Sink",
    "text": "The pre-European Lake Tutira sedimentary record is a microcosm of sediment generating processes likely operating at the Waipaoa upper watershed and fluvial dispersal system. The lake record\nroportion of the major lithotypes is shown in grey circles based on the total measured schematically and assigned to watershed, lake, or volcanic airfall sources. The inferred e or tectonic forcing.\nidentifies the key role played by low-frequency episodic storms, of different magnitudes, in the generation and delivery of sediment (cf. Trustrum et al., 1999). Studies of themarine sedimentary record at the adjacent Poverty Bay margin show that shelf deposition centres are also sensitive to changes in terrigenous sediment production (e.g. Gomez et al., 2004, 2007; Kuehl et al., 2006; Brackley et al., 2010-this volume). As a result of Lake Tutira being an efficient sediment capture and storage centre, and the high sedimentation rate (ca 330 cm/ky), many individual events are preserved in LT24 yielding a highresolution record (Fig. 11). Progressing down theWaipaoawatershed, a diminished sedimentation rate of ca 120 cm/ky occurs at the midand lower-flood plain (cores P11 and W4; Gomez et al., 2007). Here, the dispersal system dilutes the event record, with floodplain sedimentation biased to preserve the large low-frequency floods, with disproportionately more suspended sediment sourced from gullied watersheds (Phillips and Gomez, 2007). On the adjacent Poverty Bay continental shelf depocentres, both terrestrial and marine inputs are captured and modified. Here, terrigenous-dominant mud accumulation rates are similar, ca 150 cm/ky (core MD97-2122; Gomez et al., 2004, 2007), but further seaward rates reduce markedly to ca 50 cm/ ky on the mid-slope trough (Orpin, 2004), to ca 35 cm/ky at lower slope depths (core MD97-2121; Carter et al., 2002). This progressive 10-fold reduction in vertical Holocene accumulation rate results in a\nsympathetic loss in resolution of the watershed source record. This is manifest as an apparent condensation and smoothing of the magnetic susceptibility record offshore (Fig. 11), presumably in response to lower rates of sediment supply, wave resuspension (to shelf depths) and bioturbation. The shelf, therefore, preserves both terrestrial and marine signals at a range of frequencies and magnitudes (e.g. Gomez et al., 2007; Kettner et al., 2007), and marks the junction of source versus sink-dominated influence on the preserved record.\nAt first glance these accumulation rates suggest that sufficient resolutionmight exist for correlative pre-historic storm deposits to be preserved in the upper watershed, floodplain, and perhaps themiddle shelf. (see Gomez et al., 2004, 2007). However, post-deforestation preservation potential improves significantly offshore when accumulation rates exceeded 1000 cm/ky (Miller and Kuehl, 2010-this volume), rates compatible with that observed at Lake Tutira during the 20th century. This hypothesis is supported by chemical and physical evidence for flood deposits resulting from recent high discharge events, namely Cyclone Bola in 1988 (Brackley et al., 2010-this volume; Rose and Kuehl, 2010-this volume). But, slow Holocene andmodern hemipelagic accumulation rates will reduce the preservation potential of a flood deposit on the continental slope and beyond. Here, sediment supply is still ultimately linked to watershed sources (e.g. Orpin et al., 2006; Alexander et al., 2010-this volume),\n(LT24) against marine sediment cores from the southern Hawke's Bay slope (after Carter 07). The spectral reflectance for LT24 is also shown to highlight changes in core colour. gy and calibrated radiocarbon dates (Carter et al., 2002; Gomez et al., 2004, 2007). Dated 1989), and Cochran et al. (2006) are indicated on the y-axis. Because of the high sample ied to smooth the magnetic susceptibility and spectral reflectance curves.\nbut dispersal mechanisms and the preserved stratigraphy reflect marine environmental drivers and mixing rather than floods.\nAt active margins the interconnectivity of short, steep watersheds with the adjacent marine depocentre can lead to the rapid propagation of sediment supply through the dispersal system. Immediately after the 1999 Mw 7.6 Chi Chi earthquake in Taiwan, riverine sediment loads draining the epicentral area rose dramatically especially under typhoon forcing. This leads to an almost three-fold increase in the magnitude and frequency of hyperpycnal floods to the adjacent shelf (Dadson et al., 2005). Similarly at Lake Tutira, graded storm beds increase in thickness after the 3, 4.2, and 5.4 ka earthquakes (Fig. 8), presumably in response to hillslope weakening and an increase in easily erodible material. Earthquakes cause remobilisation of the lake-bottom, with perhaps half of the preserved deposits (Fig. 10) related to earthquake-triggered mass-transport deposits of lake-margin sediments. However, it is important to note that although the lake record indicates a marked response to earthquakes, over-steepened lake slopes will be more sensitive to ground-shaking than terrestrial slopes by virtue of water saturation, buoyancy and reduced friction, analogous to marine settings (e.g. Tripsanas et al., 2008).\nThe broad regional extent of tephras is clearly evident across the margin, with strongly magnetic signatures for the three largest eruptions of Taupo, Waimihia and Whakatane (Fig. 11). Taupo and Waimihia tephras appear to give the most consistent and strongest magnetic susceptibility signature. The thickness of the Waimihia Tephra is also evident as a spike in spectral reflectance, resulting from light-coloured ash and lapilli (Fig. 11). A broad, weak shift in magnetic susceptibility is observed in continental slope sediments around the time of the Taupo Tephra. Similarly, coincident with the Hinemaiaia series of eruptions, the lake record shows considerably more variation in physical properties compared to the marine and lower floodplain records, presumably because these events were relatively small and of limited aerial extent, and therefore, airfall deposits are not preserved offshore. In addition, lake, floodplain, and shelf sediment properties change post-Taupo eruption: the shelf and floodplain records have stronger magnetic susceptibilities, and the lake spectral reflectance shifts to longer and more variable wavelengths. Consistent with the detailed analysis by Gomez et al. (2007), the event-types universally preserved throughout the Waipaoa sedimentary system are lowfrequency, high magnitude perturbations, namely the largest volcanic eruptions and European deforestation."

    "text": "1. The 27.14 m-long, 7.2 ky record of sedimentation at Lake Tutira consists of alternating lithotypes of: tephras; organic-rich muds; massive to weakly graded, brown silty clays (homogenites); wellgraded sandy muds, and, thin clay layers. These lithotypes are sedimentary responses to various mechanisms including volcanic eruption and ashfall, lacustrine algal productivity, earthquake shaking and lake sediment remobilization, and severe to lowintensity rainfall and watershed run-off, respectively. The central lake bottom is primarily comprised of five sedimentary components: terrigenous-dominant homogenites (30%), terrigenous massive deposits (22%), organics (17%), graded storm beds (17%) and storm clay (9%). Tephras constitute only 3% of the sediment. Proportionally, the balance of intra-lake and mixed-terrigenous units versus deposits directly from storm events is 69% and 26%, respectively. Hence, the preserved event record was formed in response to a number of drivers. 2. The long-term sedimentation rate from the current study is 3.3 mm/year, slightly higher and less variable than that estimated previously. European settlement is accompanied by a large increase in sedimentation rate to N10 mm/year.\n3. Comparison with the historical seasonal Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and seasonal total rainfall shows that the largest events are derived from tropical and ex-tropical cyclones with no obvious correlation to the polarity or relative strength of the ENSO phase. The two largest historical flood deposits (1938 and 1988) occurred when the seasonal SOI was relatively neutral. No single climate measure offers an avenue to fully unravel the sedimentary record. 4. When compiled with other depositional proxies, a diatom allochthonous ranking scheme can differentiate between intra-lake deposition, resedimentation of lake-margin deposits, and watershed-sourced storm sediments in the historical and pre-historical record. 5. A relationship of storm bed thickness and rain intensity, derived from the historical record and used to hindcast over the 7.1 ky prehistoric period, indicates that around 53 storms occurred similar in magnitude to a so-called “1 in 100 year” event, like Cyclone Bola (1988). A further 7 storm beds are even thicker (N10 cm), and are inferred to reflect extreme, catastrophic rainfall events. 6. The relationship between palaeoearthquakes and the occurrence of homogenite beds suggests that bed thickness varies with earthquake frequency, with thinner beds occurring when earthquakes are more frequent. The thickest brown homogenites are regarded as redeposited lake-margin sediments whose remobilisation was probably triggered by earthquakes. Grey homogenites are more closely related to bona fide storm deposits, but it is unclear whether they deposited directly from floods or formed by remobilisation of flood material accumulated at the lake margin. 7. Both high and low-frequency terrestrial events of varying magnitudes are captured in Lake Tutira and the Waipaoa floodplain, reflecting close hillslope connections. However, high frequency low magnitude events are seldom preserved in the marine stratigraphy on account of strong physical and biological mixing processes. Consistent with earlier studies, only low-frequency, high magnitude perturbations, namely the largest volcanic eruptions and European deforestation are preserved universally in core records across the Source-to-Sink sedimentary system. Individual storms appear to be preserved only on the shelf during the last 100 years because deforestation has increased erosion and sediment accumulation rates."
