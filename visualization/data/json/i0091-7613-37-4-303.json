    "text": "Volcanic eruptions have long been considered as potential triggers of climate variations on many time scales. Volcanically induced climate cooling was fi rst postulated by Benjamin Franklin (1784), who suggested that the unusually cold, gray winter of 1783 in Paris was associated with the eruption of Laki, Iceland. Kennett and Thunell (1975) noted that an increase in explosive circum-Pacifi c volcanism can be correlated with intensifi cation of Northern Hemisphere glaciations since the late Pliocene. They also suggested that a pulse of circum-Pacifi c volcanism from 16 to 14 Ma may have contributed to mid-Miocene cooling. However, conclusions could not be made about Eocene or Oligocene volcano-climate inter actions at that time because of the limited number of age determinations greater than 20 Ma. A decade later, Kennett et al. (1985), without much corresponding age information, suggested that a surge in volcanic activity in the circum-Pacifi c region during the late Eocene was responsible for climatic cooling. However, the increase in volcanism was attributed to the change in Pacifi c plate motion and development of an Australian-Pacifi c plate boundary, both of which we now know formed ca. 15 Ma, prior to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (Sharp and Clague, 2006). Sigurdsson (2000) showed a correlation between the forami niferal oxygen isotope record and a global compilation of tephra layers in deep-sea cores from drilling of ocean basins but did not explore the causeand-effect relationship. We revisit this issue now that a wealth of high-precision age information is available for Eocene to Quaternary arc volcanics."

    "heading": "GEOCHRONOLOGIC DATA",
    "text": "A database containing 2814 previously published K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar ages of subductionrelated volcanic and plutonic rocks from four circum-Pacifi c arcs (Izu-Bonin-Marianas, Aleutians/Alaska, Western United States and Canada, Sierra Madre Occidental/Mexican volcanic belt) (Fig. 1) was compiled based on careful screening of the NAVDAT database (http:// navdat.kgs.ku.edu/) and hundreds of publications (see the GSA Data Repository1 for data and references). Several other circum-Pacifi c arcs (Tonga, Kuriles) have insuffi cient geochronologic control and were excluded. Most ages range from 50 Ma to the present, and all were calculated or recalculated using International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) decay constants (Steiger and Jäger, 1977). A compilation of this type has the potential to be biased by low-quality age determinations or studies focused on particular events, episodes, or individual volcanoes. To eliminate this concern, data that did not agree with stratigraphy, had discordant 40Ar/39Ar spectra, or lacked age uncertainties were discarded. Duplicate sampling of a specifi c unit was minimal, and the spatial coverage within each arc is excellent because most of the ages older than 1 Ma from these four circum-Pacifi c arcs came from regionally motivated studies. Abundant geochronologic data available for active arc volcanoes younger than 1 Ma have been omitted to avoid any biasing of the data set. Because we have chosen to focus on the episodic nature of arc processes in addition to their climatic infl uence, age information on volcanic material not related to subduction processes was not considered, even though non-subduction-related eruptions have been shown to have signifi cant climatic impact (e.g., Laki in 1783). Histograms and probability density curves were generated to assess age-time variations and identify periods of elevated arc magmatism (fl are-ups) (Fig. 2). Even though volumetric estimates for many of these rocks are unavailable, peaks in Figure 2 likely refl ect actual pulses of magmatic activity. Preservation of pre-Quaternary material in active arcs is a major concern because of erosion, rifting, and burial. Therefore, we interpret a cluster of ages at a given time period to represent a volumetrically signifi cant period of magmatism."

    "text": "Circum-Pacifi c volcanism has been episodic, characterized by pulses of high magmatic fl ux lasting between 5 and 10 m.y., which is in accord with prior observations (Kennett et al., 1977; McBirney et al., 1974; Scholl et al., 1976; Jicha et al., 2006) (Fig. 2).

The link between climate cooling and voluminous volcanic eruptions has remained speculative due to a lack of supporting evidence. A compilation of 2814 K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar age determinations from four circum-Pacifi c arcs indicates that periods of high volcanic output (i.e., fl are-ups) have been episodic and, in some cases, synchronous. Peak periods and subsequent lulls in arc magmatism over the past 50 m.y. have occurred coeval with major fl uctuations in global climate, including the Eocene-Oligocene transition, one of the most prominent global climate reorganizations in the Cenozoic. Hundreds of intermediate to silicic eruptions occurred during an extremely vigorous period of circum-Pacifi c volcanism beginning in the late Eocene, which likely led to the production of sulfur aerosols in the stratosphere and fertilization of surface waters of the Pacifi c Ocean. We provide a mechanism that may have been partly responsible for the climatic preconditioning that must have preceded and ultimately promoted Antarctic ice sheet growth ~34 m.y. ago.\n1GSA Data Repository item 2009079, Table DR1, database of K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar ages from circumPacifi c arcs, is available online at www.geosociety. org/pubs/ft2009.htm, or on request from editing@ geosociety.org or Documents Secretary, GSA, P.O.

The inception of subduction and associated pulses of magmatism between 50 and 45 Ma in the Aleutians (Jicha et al., 2006), Izu-Bonin-Mariana (Ishizuka et al., 2006), and Tonga-Kermadec arcs (Arculus, 2004) were coincident with volcanism and plutonism along the 2500 km Challis-Kamloops belt, which spans from Wyoming to the Yukon Territory, as well as volcanism in south-central Alaska (Cole et al., 2006), both of which have been linked to Kula-Resurrection (Cole et al., 2006) or KulaFarallon (Breitsprecher et al., 2003) slab window magmatism. All of these events occurred coeval with the proposed major change in Pacifi c plate motion and formation of the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend (Sharp and Clague, 2006), although alternative mantle-driven (Tarduno, 2007) and plateshifting hypotheses (Whittaker et al., 2007) have been proposed for the Hawaii-Emperor Bend. Whether or not widespread volcanism was linked to a plate-motion change can continue to be debated. Notwithstanding, the early to middle Eocene was a period of intense circum-Pacifi c volcanism and tectonism.\nThe next distinct pulse of circum-Pacifi c arc magmatism occurred from 35 to 26 Ma (Fig. 2), which was a period marked by extensive plutonism in the Aleutians (Jicha et al., 2006), arcwide eruptions of mafi c to intermediate lavas in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc (Ishizuka et al., 2006), development of the 15,000 km3 Southern Rocky Mountain volcanic fi eld (Lipman, 2007), and formation of a large silicic igneous province in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Ferrari et al., 2007). More than 250,000 km3 of silicic ignimbrites were emplaced in the Sierra Madre Occidental from 35 to 28 Ma; they have been attributed to the rapid increase in subduction angle of the Farallon plate due to slab rollback or tearing of the Farallon slab at depth, which permitted an upwelling of asthenosphere, creating a slab window effect (Ferrari et al., 2007). This concentration of\nvoluminous, explosive, silicic eruptions was the largest extrusion of magma in the Cenozoic, during which the rate of volcanic output (3.5 × 10−2 km3/yr) was an order of magnitude greater than the annual global average for silicic volcanism (4 × 10−3 km3/yr) (White et al., 2006). CLIMATIC EFFECTS The late Eocene to early Oligocene circumPacifi c fl are-up consisted mostly of intermediate to silicic eruptions that must have been of\nconsiderable volume in order to be preserved for >25 m.y. in such dynamic tectonic settings. These eruptions undoubtedly were accompanied by enormous fl uxes of gases, sulfur species (mainly SO\n2 ), and ash into the atmosphere, although quantitative measurements of S concentration in these deposits (e.g., Self et al., 2008) are lacking. Addition of CO\n2 and H 2 O from volcanic\neruptions should have had a negligible effect on the atmosphere because of the existing high atmospheric CO\n2 content and because the H 2 O\nconcentration is modulated via evapotranspiration and precipitation. However, the emission of SO\n2 into the stratosphere may have a sig-\nnifi cant climatic effect because SO 2 reacts with OH and H 2 O to form H 2 SO 4 aerosols (Robock , 2000). Partly frozen sulfate aerosol droplets in the stratosphere are about the same size (0.1–1 µm) as visible light and can back scatter and/or absorb solar radiation (Robock, 2000). Incoming sunlight is refl ected back into space, which reduces the amount of solar energy that reaches Earth’s surface, resulting in net cooling. Climate cooling in response to individual volcanic eruptions with a total eruptive volume of a few cubic kilometers lasts for several years, as has been observed following the 1991 Pinatubo, 1982 El Chichón, 1963 Agung, 1815 Tambora, and 1600 Huaynaputina eruptions. A single large volcanic event, such as the 2800 km3 Toba eruption ~74,000 yr ago, can have a more dramatic cooling effect. Climate modeling that simulated the response to the Toba eruption indicates dramatic cooling with global temperatures dropping by as much as 10 °C, followed by a long-term recovery period of a decade or two (Jones et al., 2005). However, eruptions of this magnitude are very rare, with an average frequency of only one every ~100,000 yr (Mason et al., 2004).\nTens of arc volcanoes erupt annually, but most of these eruptions do not release enough gases or solid aerosols to have noticeable climatic impact. Our data indicate that more than 500 eruptions of considerable volume occurred between 35 and 28 Ma, which corresponds to a minimum frequency of one “large” eruption every ~13,000 yr. Although it cannot be resolved given the individual age uncertainties in our data set, it is conceivable that the shorter-term volcanic record was episodic, as in our long-term record. Consequently, a series of eruptions could have occurred more frequently on the order of every few centuries or decades. Pyle (1998) showed that >30 “large” explosive eruptions, defi ned as those with a volcanic explosivity index of four or more, have occurred per century in the circum-Pacifi c over the past 400 yr. The climatic implications of a series of volcanic eruptions closely spaced in time was highlighted by Prueher and Rea (1998), who suggested that numerous silicic eruptions in the Kurile-Kamchatka and Aleutian arcs, and cooling associated with these eruptions, brought on\nIzuBoninMariana Arc\nAleutians\nAlaska\nWestern U.S. and Canada\nSMO/ MVB\n120°E 180°W 150°W\n60°N\n45°N\n0°\n30°N\n15°N\n150°E 120°W 90°W\nFigure 1.

However, we suggest that the volume of material erupted into the atmosphere from the circum-Pacifi c during the late Eocene–early Oligocene would have had a much more severe infl uence on global climate.\nAnother by-product of explosive vol canic eruptions that has the potential to strongly infl uence the atmosphere and climate is the introduction of volcanic glass and ash into the ocean. When erupted volcanic ash comes in contact with seawater, salts that are adsorbed onto volcanic glass dissolve and release nutrients, metals such as iron, and anions into surface water (Frogner et al., 2001). Open-ocean iron concentrations in surface water are commonly at picomolar (10−12) concentrations. Ironseeding experiments in the equatorial Pacifi c and Southern Pacifi c Ocean have shown that addition of iron in nanomolar (10−9) concentrations promotes a several-fold increase in algal biomass, resulting in a large decrease in the ocean-to-atmosphere CO\n2 fl ux (Cooper et al.,\n1996). Sarmiento (1993) showed that <0.1% of the total iron available in the ~4 km3 of 1991 Pinatubo ash would have to be released to ocean surface water to provide the requisite amount to stimulate biological drawdown of CO\n2 . Flow-\nthrough experiments of Frogner et al. (2001) using ash from the 2000 Hekla eruption yielded similar results, but they noted that a large eruption close to the equatorial Pacifi c, such as that of Pinatubo, may have a more profound effect on atmospheric CO\n2 via iron fertilization of the\nocean. Recent biogeochemical experiments and satellite data also confi rm that volcanic ash can excite marine algal productivity (Duggen et al., 2007). We suggest that a prolonged period of widespread Fe fertilization of the Pacifi c Ocean and subsequent drawdown of atmospheric CO\n2\nlikely occurred during the voluminous episode of circum-Pacifi c magmatism in the late Eocene–early Oligocene. The introduction of volcanic glass and ash to the Pacifi c Ocean was inevitable because the Aleutian and IzuBonin-Mariana island arcs were bounded by the Pacifi c, and the prevailing easterly winds in the Sierra Madre Occidental would have brought fallout and ignimbrite deposits to the ocean (Cather et al., 2003)."

    "text": "The sudden shift toward cooler temperatures and the major expansion of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary ~34 m.y. ago is considered to be one of the most prominent global climate reorganizations in the Cenozoic. One limitation of the volcanic record is that it cannot directly record climate changes such as the dramatic transition from the greenhouse world to the icehouse world near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. However, Cenozoic climate changes are recorded in a number\nof marine and terrestrial sediment archives. A compilation of oxygen isotope records of deep-sea benthic foraminifera documents a >1‰ increase in δ18O at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (Zachos et al., 2001). The pronounced increase in δ18O is synchronous with deepening of the calcite compensation depth (CCD) and the stepwise onset of Antarctic ice-sheet growth (Coxall et al., 2005). We plotted a histogram and probability density curve of all the circumPacifi c age determinations assembled in our database alongside the δ18O curve of Zachos et al. (2001) for the past 50 m.y. to evaluate the relationship between volcanism and global climate (Fig. 3). Fluctuations in δ18O since the early Eocene coincide with peaks and lulls in the circum-Pacifi c volcanic record. The onset of voluminous late Eocene volcanism precedes Eocene-Oligocene cooling by more than 1 m.y., which contrasts with previous suggestions that a shift toward a cooler climate promotes vol canic activity (Rampino et al., 1979). The decline in δ18O at ca. 26 Ma was also broadly concurrent with waning of circum-Pacifi c magmatism (Fig. 3). Recent biostratigraphic and geochemical correlations in Tanzanian sediments (Pearson et al., 2008) indicate that plankton extinctions occurred during an extended phase of ecological disruption that preceded the δ18O shift by ~500 k.y. The circum-Pacifi c volcanic record and aforementioned ecological trend suggest that signifi cant changes were beginning to take place well before the Eocene-Oligocene climate transition.\nThe origin of Eocene-Oligocene cooling has been debated for decades. A number of hypotheses have been proposed, including orbital\nmodulation, the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways and the development of an Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and the long-term decline in atmospheric CO\n2 levels. Global climate mod-\neling indicates that the 20% change in ocean heat transport associated with onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current had a smaller than expected effect on climate change (DeConto and Pollard, 2003). It also recognized that the increase in δ18O near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary requires a climate conditioning factor such as declining pCO\n2 because the 1‰ shift is too large to be explained solely by Antarctic ice-sheet growth. CO\n2 concentrations during the middle to late Eocene ranged between 1000 and 1500 ppm by volume (ppmv) and then rapidly decreased in the Oligocene (Pagani et al., 2005). However, CO\n2 concentrations were already beginning to decline from the middle to late Eocene (Pagani et al., 2005), reaching levels that could have triggered the rapid expansion of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. Even though declining atmospheric CO\n2 has\nbeen recognized as an important factor in global cooling and the expansion of ice in Antarctica, very few causes for a decrease in CO\n2 have been\nproposed. Enhanced continental weathering due to uplift of the Tibetan Plateau is one proposed mechanism (Raymo et al., 1988). We suggest that the prolonged period of voluminous circumPacifi c volcanism in the late Eocene provided an enormous supply of ash that fertilized the Pacifi c Ocean and adjacent waters, promoting algal growth and the uptake of CO\n2 .\nRepeated episodes of volcanic cooling may have provided the “kick” or additional cooling and drop in pCO\n2 necessary to facilitate\nEocene Oligocene Miocene Plio.

  "abstractText": "Explosive eruptions from subaerial arc volcanoes can have signifi cant environmental impact because of the discharge of ash and volatiles directly into the atmosphere and oceans. The link between climate cooling and voluminous volcanic eruptions has remained speculative due to a lack of supporting evidence. A compilation of 2814 K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar age determinations from four circum-Pacifi c arcs indicates that periods of high volcanic output (i.e., fl are-ups) have been episodic and, in some cases, synchronous. Peak periods and subsequent lulls in arc magmatism over the past 50 m.y. have occurred coeval with major fl uctuations in global climate, including the Eocene-Oligocene transition, one of the most prominent global climate reorganizations in the Cenozoic. Hundreds of intermediate to silicic eruptions occurred during an extremely vigorous period of circum-Pacifi c volcanism beginning in the late Eocene, which likely led to the production of sulfur aerosols in the stratosphere and fertilization of surface waters of the Pacifi c Ocean. We provide a mechanism that may have been partly responsible for the climatic preconditioning that must have preceded and ultimately promoted Antarctic ice sheet growth ~34 m.y. ago.

The inception of subduction and associated pulses of magmatism between 50 and 45 Ma in the Aleutians (Jicha et al., 2006), Izu-Bonin-Mariana (Ishizuka et al., 2006), and Tonga-Kermadec arcs (Arculus, 2004) were coincident with volcanism and plutonism along the 2500 km Challis-Kamloops belt, which spans from Wyoming to the Yukon Territory, as well as volcanism in south-central Alaska (Cole et al., 2006), both of which have been linked to Kula-Resurrection (Cole et al., 2006) or KulaFarallon (Breitsprecher et al., 2003) slab window magmatism. All of these events occurred coeval with the proposed major change in Pacifi c plate motion and formation of the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend (Sharp and Clague, 2006), although alternative mantle-driven (Tarduno, 2007) and plateshifting hypotheses (Whittaker et al., 2007) have been proposed for the Hawaii-Emperor Bend. Whether or not widespread volcanism was linked to a plate-motion change can continue to be debated. Notwithstanding, the early to middle Eocene was a period of intense circum-Pacifi c volcanism and tectonism. The next distinct pulse of circum-Pacifi c arc magmatism occurred from 35 to 26 Ma (Fig. 2), which was a period marked by extensive plutonism in the Aleutians (Jicha et al., 2006), arcwide eruptions of mafi c to intermediate lavas in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc (Ishizuka et al., 2006), development of the 15,000 km Southern Rocky Mountain volcanic fi eld (Lipman, 2007), and formation of a large silicic igneous province in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Ferrari et al., 2007). More than 250,000 km of silicic ignimbrites were emplaced in the Sierra Madre Occidental from 35 to 28 Ma; they have been attributed to the rapid increase in subduction angle of the Farallon plate due to slab rollback or tearing of the Farallon slab at depth, which permitted an upwelling of asthenosphere, creating a slab window effect (Ferrari et al., 2007). This concentration of voluminous, explosive, silicic eruptions was the largest extrusion of magma in the Cenozoic, during which the rate of volcanic output (3.5 × 10−2 km/yr) was an order of magnitude greater than the annual global average for silicic volcanism (4 × 10−3 km/yr) (White et al., 2006). CLIMATIC EFFECTS The late Eocene to early Oligocene circumPacifi c fl are-up consisted mostly of intermediate to silicic eruptions that must have been of considerable volume in order to be preserved for >25 m.y. in such dynamic tectonic settings. These eruptions undoubtedly were accompanied by enormous fl uxes of gases, sulfur species (mainly SO 2 ), and ash into the atmosphere, although quantitative measurements of S concentration in these deposits (e.g., Self et al., 2008) are lacking. Addition of CO 2 and H 2 O from volcanic eruptions should have had a negligible effect on the atmosphere because of the existing high atmospheric CO 2 content and because the H 2 O concentration is modulated via evapotranspiration and precipitation. However, the emission of SO 2 into the stratosphere may have a signifi cant climatic effect because SO 2 reacts with OH and H 2 O to form H 2 SO 4 aerosols (Robock , 2000). Partly frozen sulfate aerosol droplets in the stratosphere are about the same size (0.1–1 μm) as visible light and can back scatter and/or absorb solar radiation (Robock, 2000). Incoming sunlight is refl ected back into space, which reduces the amount of solar energy that reaches Earth’s surface, resulting in net cooling. Climate cooling in response to individual volcanic eruptions with a total eruptive volume of a few cubic kilometers lasts for several years, as has been observed following the 1991 Pinatubo, 1982 El Chichón, 1963 Agung, 1815 Tambora, and 1600 Huaynaputina eruptions. A single large volcanic event, such as the 2800 km Toba eruption ~74,000 yr ago, can have a more dramatic cooling effect. Climate modeling that simulated the response to the Toba eruption indicates dramatic cooling with global temperatures dropping by as much as 10 °C, followed by a long-term recovery period of a decade or two (Jones et al., 2005). However, eruptions of this magnitude are very rare, with an average frequency of only one every ~100,000 yr (Mason et al., 2004). Tens of arc volcanoes erupt annually, but most of these eruptions do not release enough gases or solid aerosols to have noticeable climatic impact. Our data indicate that more than 500 eruptions of considerable volume occurred between 35 and 28 Ma, which corresponds to a minimum frequency of one “large” eruption every ~13,000 yr. Although it cannot be resolved given the individual age uncertainties in our data set, it is conceivable that the shorter-term volcanic record was episodic, as in our long-term record. Consequently, a series of eruptions could have occurred more frequently on the order of every few centuries or decades. Pyle (1998) showed that >30 “large” explosive eruptions, defi ned as those with a volcanic explosivity index of four or more, have occurred per century in the circum-Pacifi c over the past 400 yr. The climatic implications of a series of volcanic eruptions closely spaced in time was highlighted by Prueher and Rea (1998), who suggested that numerous silicic eruptions in the Kurile-Kamchatka and Aleutian arcs, and cooling associated with these eruptions, brought on IzuBoninMariana Arc Aleutians Alaska Western U.S. and Canada SMO/ MVB 120°E 180°W 150°W"
