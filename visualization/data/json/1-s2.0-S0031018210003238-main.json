The Greenhouse is the default state, representing N70% of the Phanerozoic. It is characterized by a weak thermal mode (pole-driven deep-water formation), with little or no continental sea ice, and weakly oxic cool-water sinking near the poles. Nitrogen limitation characterizes Greenhouse oceans in which ammonium may be the dominant bioavailable form of nitrogen. The steady-state Greenhouse default must be forced to produce either of the other two states. Continent–continent collision produces the intense chemical weathering that draws down atmospheric CO2 and results in the Icehouse state that comprises 20–25% of the Phanerozoic. Icehouses have ice caps in contact with the ocean that produce icebergs and foster sea-ice formation. Sea-ice formation fills the ocean with highly oxic phosphorus-limited icewater except for a thin layer of warm surface water in the tropics. Of the 23 most conspicuous mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic (including the late Ediacaran), 4 are associated with ice-volume-related regressions, and 3 are problematic. We suggest that the other 16 mass extinctions occurred when Greenhouse climate was forced to Hothouse climate. Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) can trigger the HEATT (Haline Euxinic Acidic Thermal Transgression)mechanism, which can force Greenhouse climate to a Hothouse climate state. The rapid, voluminous CO2 emissions of LIPs cause a series of events that result in very slow but pronounced haline-mode circulation (mid-latitude-driven deep-water formation) that produceswarmsalinebottomwater at verydry, hot subtropical andmiddle latitudes. This water upwells at the poles, causing warm and moist equable climate. Hothouse development promotes deep-sea anoxia that is generated in concert with CO2 buildup andwarming. The spread of anoxia favors reduced nitrogen over nitrate, and limited iron dust curtails nitrogen fixation. This leads to dominance of primary productivity by primitive green algae and/or cyanobacteria. Progression to euxinia that reaches the photic zone severely curtails primary productivity via poisoning, even as availability of usable nitrogen plummets. The result is eukaryotic mass extinction.We suggest that the 16 Phanerozoic mass extinctions referred to above resulted at least in part from the HEATT process. Evidence for this relationship at 11 of the most severe extinctions is convincing.Data sets for the other 5 are strongly suggestive ofHEATT-relatedmass extinction, but do not yet have enough documentation to reliably characterize them as HEATT episodes.\nmworsley@aol.com\naho 83616, USA.\nll rights reserved.\n© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "Five mass extinctions stand out in evolutionary history, and many more less-intensemass extinctions are evident in the record. A plethora of causes have been offered as possible explanations for Phanerozoic mass extinctions. Examples include anoxia (e.g. Berry andWilde, 1978; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996), habitat loss (e.g. Valentine and Moores, 1970), cooling (e.g. Stanley, 1988), warming (e.g. Mayhew et al., 2007; Ward, 2007), sea-level change (Newell, 1967; Hallam and Wignall,\n1999), hypercapnia (Knoll et al., 1996;Knoll et al., 2007), volcanism(e.g. Courtillot et al., 1986; Courtillot and Renne, 2003), and bolide impact (Alvarez et al., 1980; Raup, 1992). More complete reviews of the broad array of proposed extinction causes have been summarized elsewhere (e.g. McGhee, 1996; Hallam and Wignall, 1997; Erwin, 2006; Ward, 2007).\nWe offered a systemic model for global changes in paleoclimate and paleoceanography that intensified ecological stresses before, during, and after the end-Permian extinction (Kidder andWorsley, 2004). That model demonstrated strong linkages among many of the potential extinction causes noted above (e.g. anoxia, warming, and rising sea level). Since 2004, sufficient new information has convinced us that at least ten and perhaps as many as 16 of the most severe Phanerozoic mass extinctionswere caused by the samemechanismwe proposed for the extinction at the end of the Permian (Kidder and Worsley, 2004).\nBoth Keith (1982) and Kerr (1998) suggested systemic models that link major volcanism to oceanic and climatic changes and extinctions. Their prescient thinking, when far fewer data were available, anticipated many aspects of our model."

    "heading": "2. Permian–Triassic update and introduction to the HEATT model",
    "text": "Much of the basis for HEATT episodes comes from the Kidder and Worsley (2004) model for the Permian–Triassic interval. That model focused mainly on the interplay among conditions that had been developing since the ending of Permian glaciation. Factors such as expansion of desert belts, climatic warming, poleward movement of forests and many more (Kidder and Worsley, 2004) served as the basis for promoting a long-term weakening of ecosystems that would make them susceptible to extinction. Several points that prompted model refinement are outlined briefly below.\nAlthough we did suggest that Siberian Traps volcanism would have intensified some of the developing climatic and oceanographic conditions leading up to the end-Permian extinction, we did not invoke the Siberian Traps as a trigger. Wignall (2001) and Wignall and Twitchett (2002) pointed to the possibility of a direct trigger. Such a trigger is now a key part of our revised model for not only the end Permian, but also for the other HEATT episodes. The end-Permian HEATT episode was probably particularly severe not only because of the magnitude of the Siberian Traps eruptions, but also because of the long and widespread developmentof preconditions in themid–late Permian. Thepronounced ∂13C shifts that mark the early Triassic (Payne et al., 2004) were suggested to have been stimulated by continuing eruptive episodes of the Siberian Traps (Payne and Kump, 2007).\nErwin (2006) drew attention to the reinterpretation of late Permian fungal spores (Visscher et al., 1996) as being of algal affinity (Afonin et al., 2001; Foster et al., 2002). Ouyang and Utting (1990) had already suggested an algal affinity for one of these taxa (Tympanicysta) and Elsik (1999) had synonomized the Reduviasporonites Wilson discussed by Foster et al. (2002) with Tympanicysta. Afonin et al. (2001) noted that the original interpretation of ReduviasporonitesWilson was as a marine fungus. That these potentially marine algae became turned out to have beenaround for some10 million years before and leadingup to the endPermian extinction (Foster et al., 2002) led us to adjust some of our thinking on nutrients and productivity associatedwith the late Permian, particularly since other mass extinction horizons appeared to preserve blooms of primitive green algae (e.g. van de Schootbrugge et al., 2005a; van de Schootbrugge et al., 2007).\nThe Papineau et al. (2005) long-term summary of ∂15N datamade us aware of increasingly frequent reports of anomalously low ∂15N atmany HEATThorizons (Fig. 6) including the recently discovered ∂15N anomaly at the end of the Permian (Cao et al., 2009). The implications of the low ∂15N are thatwith increased anoxia in the oceans (see below) ammanox bacteria promote denitrification to a much greater degree than in the modern ocean. The low ∂15N signal reflects a dominance of new nitrogenfixation by diazotrophs. Thatfixation is limited by iron delivery to the oceans. Our updated model predicts that the sharp reductions in planetarywindbelt velocity (Figs. 2, 3; Table 2)will reduce iron delivery to the oceans much lower levels than in an Icehouse climate. Productivity will be generally limited under these conditions. This may explain why much late Permian anoxia was not marked by black shale (Wignall and Hallam, 1992; Wignall and Hallam, 1993; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996). However, opportunists which can thrive on reduced nitrogen such as ammoniumwill thrive inwaters similar to the Proterozoic ones in which their primitive green-algal ancestors arose. This allows very high productivity just before and/or just after the climax of a HEATT episodewhen these primitive disaster taxa become a key factor in ocean primary productivity.\nUpwelling-driven chemocline upward excursons were suggested for the terminal Permian and several other intervals (Kump et al., 2005; Riccardi et al., 2007). This, coupledwith the report of late Permian\nphotic-zone euxinia (Grice et al., 2005) increased attention on the possibility that euxinia in shallow waters was a possible cause of the end-Permian extinction. However, Nielsen et al. (2010) reported that the extinction in high paleolatitude sections of East Greenland precedes the onset of sulfidic conditions, suggesting that euxinia was not an extinction cause there. Algeo et al. (2008) noted that the extinction horizon in Vietnam coincides with the first of nine distinct pyrite horizons that continue into the early Triassic. They suggested that upwelling events may have been responsible for these pyrite occurrences during carbonate platform sedimentation. Given our model predictions for weakened planetary windbelt-generated upwelling we speculate that the increasingly deep-reaching cyclonic storms predicted in theHEATTmodelmayhave been responsible for the upwellingpulses suggested by Kump et al. (2005) and Algeo et al. (2008). The likelihood that botheuxinia andelevatedCO2 are important causative factors in the extinction is becoming increasingly accepted (e.g. Bottjer et al., 2008).\nA coupledmodel simulation by Kiehl and Shields (2005) that ran for 900 years used a fixed boundary condition in which atmospheric CO2 was fixed at levels approximately 10 times those of modern values (3550 ppmv). Their model generated a warm late Permian world, with warm water persisting to depths of 3000 m. The sinking polar waters that dominate modern thermohaline circulation are virtually absent in the late Permianmodel of Kiehl and Shields (2005). They also concluded that CO2 was chiefly responsible for this warming, but that ocean heat transport also contributes to high-latitude warming poleward of 60° latitude. The Kiehl and Shields (2005) results are the closest yet to approachingmeasured late Permian conditions, and they are consistent with our less quantitative considerations."

    "heading": "3. Model generalization and the importance of preconditions",
    "text": "Having surveyed the correspondence between 11 of themost severe extinctions to Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) in the Phanerozoic (Fig. 1; Table 1), we support the suggestion of Wignall and Hallam (1993) that the volcanism generated by the Siberian Traps LIP was the likely trigger for intense warming. This trigger instigated feedbacks that propelled Earth from a Greenhouse climate into a new planetary state known as a Hothouse, which we define herein. The LIP triggering of Hothouse conditions ismost effectivewhen the precondition of a Greenhouse climate is in force, particularly when continental collisional orogeny is at a minimum.We also generalize the 2004model to suggest that the rise of LIP-induced, short-lived Hothouse conditions caused up to 16 extinctions (Fig. 1). In each case, LIPs trigger what we call HEATT (Haline Euxinic Acidic Thermal Transgression) episodes that explain why numerous extinction factors arose at those times. Beerling and Berner (2002) showed that CO2 emissions from the end-Triassic Central Atlantic Magmatic Province LIP were insufficient to account for values of greenhouse gases expected from analysis of either leaf stomate data or carbon isotopes. They suggested that release of sea-floor methane hydrates can balance the carbon budget along the lines of earlier suggestions (Erwin, 1993;Morante, 1996) for the latest Permian.Wedonot suggest that volcanism alone changes the global state from Greenhouse to Hothouse. Although methane release is a likely consequence and amplifier of warming, we contend that many more factors come into play as a Hothouse develops.\nChanges in sea level have long been considered a potential critical influence on Phanerozoic extinctions since Newell's (1967) initial suggestion. Rapid regressions can seriously decrease marine ecosystem space, leading to marine extinction. Regression appears to be an important factor in several Phanerozoic extinctions (Fig. 1). The Hawke Bay (Toyonian) event (Hallam and Wignall, 1997) and the SPICE event (Saltzman et al., 2000a) are two Cambrian examples, although some work on the SPICE suggested a transgression at that horizon (Saltzman et al., 1995). Onset of the latest Ordovician glaciation and the associated sea-level drop have long been implicated in the first pulse of end-Ordovician extinction (e.g. Hallam andWignall, 1999). The\nend-Mississippian extinction has been suggested to be linked to cooling and sea level drop as Gondwanan glaciation intensified (e.g. Saunders and Ramsbottom, 1986; Stanley and Powell, 2003). However, Hallam and Wignall (1997) suggest that mid-Carboniferous extinction is more localized and selective than most mass extinctions, and Powell (2005) reported that brachiopod extinctions were mainly at tropical paleolatitudes. That it appears more conspicuous in the Sepkoski (2002) database (Fig. 1) is perplexing. Controversy surrounds the terminal Eocene extinction in terms of its duration and cause (see Hallam and Wignall, 1997). Our only point here is that rather than coinciding with transgression and warming, this enigmatic extinction occurs during a time of cooling and regression (Fig. 1). The end-Pennsylvanian andend-Jurassic extinctions are even lesswell understood than theendMississippian and end-Eocene crises, and are not considered further herein. The end-Guadalpian extinction has been attributed to regression (e.g. Hallam andWignall, 1997), although recent work (Retallack et al., 2006; Wignall et al., 2009a) suggests rapid transgression at certain key extinction localities. Rapid regressions that are glacioeustatically driven will not only be accompanied by the cooling that drives sea level down as ice sheets form, but also oceanographic changes in state of oxygenation and nutrient balance will also affect many taxa that are adapted to different conditions. Transgressions may also result in\nchanges in oceanic oxidation state, nutrient cycling, and other factors. However, in order to trigger mass extinctions, transgressions and regressionsmust be rapid enough to prevent life from adapting.Waxing and waning glaciers drive rapid shifts in sea level, but mass extinctions during Icehouse intervals seem to result only during regressive phases (Fig. 1). Themajority of Phanerozoicmass extinctions (Fig. 1) do appear to coincide with fairly rapid transgressions (Newell, 1967; Hallam and Wignall, 1999). These transgressions do not appear to have been driven byglacioeustatic changes because of a lackof significant ice caps at those times. Furthermore, tectonic factors were probably too slow to drive such transgressions. Kidder andWorsley (2004)made the case that the rapid transgression that extended across the Permo-Triassic boundary was driven by thermal expansion of oceanwater. Such a changewas the result of catastrophic warming at the close of the Paleozoic. Linkage between anoxia, transgression, and warming has been noted for other horizons (e.g. Jenkyns, 1980; Arthur et al., 1987; Summerhayes, 1987; Hesselbo et al., 2004), particularly at oceanic anoxic event horizons. The cause of those transgressions has not often been discussed, although Kerr (1998) invoked transgression via seawater displacement during formation of oceanic plateaus. In recent years, the coeval occurrence of additional factors such as nutrient crises, calcification crises, photiczone euxinia, and more have prompted us to expand the scope of the\nmodel developed for the Permo-Triassic boundary and apply it to these other horizons.\nLarge Igneous Provinces (LIPs) have been suggested as a significant extinction driver by some workers (e.g. Courtillot and Renne, 2003). Some have focused on the short-term catastrophic effects such as emissions of ash and sulfate (Courtillot et al., 1986). Others have looked more at the longer-term systemic effects as slower causes of extinctions (e.g. Kerr, 1998; 2005;Wignall, 2001). That LIPs coincide or nearly coincidewithmanyextinctions in the record (Fig. 1) tempts consideration of these events as serial extinction culprits through Earth history. Both Wignall (2001) andWhite and Saunders (2005) point out that although temporal coincidence between LIP and extinction appears reasonable at some horizons, there are others where the relationship seems not to hold. However, our current compilation of more recent data (Fig. 1) suggests stronger temporal linkages than reported in some recent summaries.\nWe hypothesize that the HEATTmodel accounts for a style of global catastrophic change that is a more likely cause for many Phanerozoic extinctions than either impact or short-term volcanic effects. Crowley andNorth (1988) drewattention to the possibility of gradual changes in theEarth system leading to abrupt climate changeswhenkey thresholds were crossed. They went further to suggest that such changes might be responsible for some extinctions. In support of that conceptwe propose that the HEATT episodes are examples of Earth switching from one fundamental state (Greenhouse) to another (Hothouse) following a\nseries of climatic/oceanographic steps. The HEATT model unites the climate change model for initiating the thermal-expansion-driven transgression across the Permian–Triassic boundary (Kidder and Worsley, 2004) with the Siberian Traps LIP as a trigger of, rather than an accessory to, the climate change. In this updated model, the LIP initiates atmospheric warming that leads to a change in ocean circulation. That change manifests itself as what Zhang et al. (2001) called the halinemode of ocean circulation (Fig. 2). The halinemode generates warm saline bottom water that heats the ocean enough to result in a thermal-expansion-driven transgression. In addition to intense warming, other factors such as anoxia and euxinia, hypercapnia, and ocean acidification likewise intensify aspart of the interlinked aspects outlined in the HEATT model. Additionally, changing nutrient availability significantly affects the base of the food webs, and bioassimilation of nitrogen is hampered by sulfide scavenging of key transition metals such as Fe and Mo (e.g. Glass et al., 2009). Many other feedbacks are involved with this fundamental alteration of the climate shift, but each of those already mentioned here should contribute significantly to extinction. We apply this model through the Phanerozoic and suggest that it has application at least the following horizons (Table 1): 1) early Cambrian Sinsk (Botomian) event, 2) end Ordovician transgression, 3) late Devonian (Frasnian–Famennian), 4) end Permian, 5) end Triassic, 6) Toarcian, 7) Aptian, 8) Cenomanian–Turonian, 9) end Cretaceous (weak HEATT; large bolide), and 10) Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). As many as 6 additional horizons (including the\nplanetary states. Climate in each state is controlled by fundamental differences in deep power, latitudinal distribution of cyclonic storms, latent heat transport, and relative e to Hothouse.

    "heading": "4. Fundamental changes in planetary state: Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse",
    "text": "We suggest that Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse are unique and mutually exclusive planetary states that are distinguished by more than just temperature. Each state is marked by fundamental differences in atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Kidder and Worsley (2004) reviewed and modeled the changes from an Icehouse in the Carboniferous and early Permian to a Greenhouse in the late Permian that then warmed rapidly at the very end of the Permian to a Hothouse that persisted through the early Triassic. The differences between the three climate states are generalized and formalized herein, and a significant addition is the employment of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) as triggers for pushing a Greenhouse into a Hothouse state. The LIP is also postulated to be a key factor in perpetuating the Hothouse state, which is otherwise unstable without maintenance of high atmospheric CO2 levels (Kiehl and Shields, 2005). Sustained LIP activity was recently implicated as a key factor in driving multiple pulses of greenhouse gas release in the early Triassic (Payne and Kump, 2007).\nAlthough many factors and feedbacks are involved in shifts among the three planetary states, we suggest that the style of thermohaline circulation in each planetary state is critical to setting up many of the feedbacks that are exemplified by that state. Below, we define the three possible climate states according to their unique styles of thermohaline circulation. We then discuss the likely triggers for each state, and consider the feedbacks that result from its thermohaline style."

    "heading": "4.1. The three planetary states",
    "text": "We consider the Greenhouse state to be the default state for the Phanerozoic (Table 2). More than 70% of the Phanerozoic appears to have been in Greenhouse mode. About 20–25% of the Phanerozoic was in Icehouse mode, and that climate was probably orogenically forced. Hothouses, presumably forced by LIPs, characterized less than 4% of Phanerozoic time. The forcing effects of LIPs were unable to generate Hothouse conditions during major Phanerozoic Icehouses, probably because they were not potent enough to overpower the strong thermohaline sinking of cold polar waters (thermal mode of Zhang et al., 2001). Such “thermal mode” circulation is sustained in Icehouse climates by the intense silicate weathering generated by continental collision orogenies (e.g. Chamberlin, 1899; Raymo, 1991). Table 2 and\nFigs. 2–4 illustrate the unique aspects of Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse planetary states. Fig. 5 focuses in depth on the key steps involved in the changeover from a Greenhouse to a Hothouse."

    "heading": "4.1.1. Icehouses",
    "text": "Icehouses (Figs. 2–4; Table 2) aremarkedbyextensive polar ice caps, significant alpine glaciation, and a strong ocean thermocline. The polar ice caps drivemodern-style thermohaline circulation via what Zhang et al. (2001) defined as the thermal mode of ocean circulation. Freezing polar oceanwater into ice expels salt. The resulting sinking cold brine is a key driver of thermohaline circulation in an Icehouseworld suchas the modern one (Colling, 2001; Charrassin et al., 2008). The thermal mode in the Icehouse is stronger than that in the Greenhouse because of the vastly greater abundance of ice to drive polar Icehouse sinking. The oxygen-rich sinking brines result in highly oxic bottom water in Icehouse oceans because high gas solubility and high photosynthetic productivity in polar waters keeps the bottom-water producing surface waters rich in dissolved oxygen.\nAn important precondition for Icehouse development is major continental collisional orogeny (e.g. Chamberlin, 1899; Raymo, 1991) (Fig. 1). The silicateweathering that characterizes suchmajormountain building events stimulates global cooling. For example, the exposure of fresh, unweathered silicate rock leads to direct removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide as carbonic acid in rainwater reacts with the silicates (e.g. Chamberlin, 1899; Walker et al., 1981; Moore and Worsley, 1994; Worsley et al., 1994; Berner, 2004). That the same weathering releases nutrients that stimulate photosynthesis. Also released are transition metals, particularly Fe and Mo that contribute to N-fixation, but also play a significant role in bioassimilation of nitrogen (e.g. Glass et al., 2009). Copper and nickel also contribute in this regard (Glass et al., 2009), but we focus our discussion herein on Fe and Mo. In terrestrial systems, much of the carbon drawn down by either silicate weathering or photosynthesis has strong potential to return to the atmosphere. Obvious exceptions are carbon burial in lakes, soils, and coal swamps. The carbon that reaches the ocean can be recycled as well, but Icehouse conditions favor enough burial to promote global cooling. High poleequator thermal contrasts in Icehouse climates promote high planetary windbelt speeds that result in extensive delivery of windblown dust to oceans (Martin, 1990; Johnston and Alley, 2006). Dust production is maximized during Icehouse climates as a result of glacial grinding of rocks. This dust bears iron coatings that stimulate diazotrophic (Nfixing) bacteria to fix nitrogen. Phytoplankton take advantage of the resulting nitrate and increase the ratio of carbon burial to recycling. The highwind speeds also foster strong upwelling that recycles nutrients so as to stimulate productivity and bury yet more carbon. Continental\ntext for discussion).\ncollision orogenic triggers have been suggested for the two major Phanerozoic Icehouses. The low-latitude collision that produced the Himalayas has been considered a chief culprit for stimulating the Cenozoic Icehouse (Raymo, 1991). The major mountain belt that resulted from the low-latitude collision of Gondwanaland and Laurasia to form the Pangean supercontinent was the likely trigger for the long-lasting (N70 m.y.) Carboniferous through early Permian Icehouse (Moore and Worsley, 1994). The minor Devonian and Ordovician short-lived\nglaciations have also been suggested to have resulted from smaller collisions between terranes and continents (Kumpet al., 1999; Saltzman et al., 2000b). Major collisional orogenies do seem to stimulate major glaciations (Fig. 1).Whetherminor orogenies trigger smaller glaciations remains problematic. This uncertainty stems partly from the fact that there aremany suchminor orogenies (e.g. Murphy et al., 2009) that did not result in glaciation, and because the Devonian and Ordovician glaciations developed and waned rapidly as compared to the slow\nprocess of orogenesis. Although the rapid onset of those glaciations could possibly have resulted from the reaching of a threshold in the oceans that quickly generated them, we later suggest an alternative."

    "heading": "4.1.2. Greenhouses",
    "text": "Greenhouses (Figs. 2–4; Table 2) arewarmerworlds than Icehouses, characterized by weaker thermoclines. They may have some alpine glaciation and at least seasonal sea ice in polar regions. Major icebergproducing polar glaciation, however, is not evident in Greenhouse worlds. Nevertheless, the predominance of oxygenated oceans in Greenhouse climates suggests sufficient ventilation to keep deepoceans oxic. Thermalmode ocean circulation is therefore likely in such aworld, but it probably weakens substantially as Greenhouse conditions move toward a Hothouse state. Such circulation was proposed for the late Permian Greenhouse (Kidder andWorsley, 2004), and was successfully modeled by Kiehl and Shields (2005). Arthur et al. (1987) suggested the expansion of the oxygen-minimum zone during the Cenomanian– Turonian oceanic anoxic event. Chamberlin (1906) andWilde and Berry (1982) suggested that sucha zone is a likely destination for evaporationgenerated brines that deliver warmth to intermediate-depth ocean waters. We suggest that such conditions that begin in a Greenhouse climate can rapidly evolve into a Hothouse climate as warming drives a transgression. A weak thermal mode would greatly reduce the sinking and oxygenation of polar surface waters to the sea floor. A concurrent feeding of the oxygen-minimum zone with low-oxygen waters generated by mid-latitude evaporation would favor expansion of the oxygen-minimum zone. This would lead to greatly reduced oxygen at depth, and the likelihoodofwidespreadanoxia. The linkbetweenanoxia\nand weak ocean circulation and/or ocean stratification has often been emphasized (e.g. Fischer and Arthur, 1977; Jenkyns, 1980; Arthur et al., 1987; Schlanger et al., 1987; Jenkyns, 2003). Sluggish Greenhouse thermohaline circulation produces long deep-water residence times (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Kiehl and Shields, 2005), resulting in increased anoxia. Anoxia that does not progress to euxinia keeps iron and ammonium in solution, and so favors diazotrophs and ammoniumloving primary producers such as green algae in areas where anoxia occupies the photic zone. Retention of Fe and Mo in solution favors bioassimilation of N. We suggest that when pushed to extremes by LIP eruptions, such conditions resulted in the oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic. We view OAEs as an initial step in the development HEATT episodes and as a condition likely to return after the HEATT climax (Fig. 5). In other words, OAEs can be considered a transitional phase between Greenhouse and Hothouse conditions.\nTriggers for initiating a Greenhouse state have not been as widely discussed, perhaps because they are unnecessary. The Greenhouse state seems to have been the norm for much of the Phanerozoic. As noted above, Greenhouse climates persisted for over 70% of the Phanerozoic (Table 2), and they represent the default climate state that requires impetus to propel it to either an Icehouse or Hothouse. Kidder and Worsley (2004) suggested that the transition from Icehouse to Greenhouse during the Permian was chiefly a result of the waning of the orogeny that produced Pangea. Because reduced orogenic activity yields a lower volume of readily weatherable silicates, burial of atmospheric carbon should be diminished given the lesser production of carbonates and nutrients that favor organic carbon burial. The shift from Icehouse to Greenhouse may thus simply result from shutdown of the active\nmechanism that initiates and maintains the Icehouse. In the case of the Cenozoic and Permo-Carboniferous Icehouses, this was probably continental–collisional orogeny."

    "heading": "4.1.3. The Hothouse",
    "text": "The Hothouse (Figs. 2–4; Table 2) is a planetary statemarked by icefree polar regions, and weak oceanic haloclines (Kidder and Worsley, 2004). In the absence of sinking cold brine drivenbypolar ice formation, the Hothouse ocean is characterized by the haline-mode thermohaline style described by Zhang et al. (2001). Sinkingmid-latitude brines drive deep-ocean circulation in a Hothouse (Fig. 2). Warm saline bottom water (WSBW) (e.g. Chamberlin, 1906; Stommel, 1961; Keith, 1982; Brass et al., 1982) results from this mechanism. Generation of WSBW is especially effective where mid-latitude coastal embayments and marginal seas (e.g. Mediterranean), in which salinity can be elevated, deliver brine to the deeper ocean as governed by sub-pycnocline circulation dynamics (Fig. 3).Warmbrines tend to form in downwelling (e.g. anti-estuarine) areas where nutrient replenishment is minimal. Consequently, such waters are low in productivity and photosynthetic oxygenation.Adding in the gas loss fromwarmwaters, thesewaterswill be lower in dissolved oxygen thanmore oxygenated polarwaters. These sinking warm brines will supply less oxygen and fewer nutrients to the deep sea than the oxygen- and nutrient-rich brines that sink in polar\nregions of Icehouses.Warm saline bottomwater generation increases as subtropics and mid-latitudes become less cloudy owing to lower relative humidity (Kidder and Worsley, 2004). Kump and Pollard (2008) suggest that lower productivity would contribute to cloud cover reduction via a decrease in biogenic cloud condensation nuclei. As midlatitude Hothouse waters sink, they also deliver sulfate to anoxic deep waters. Anoxic deep waters then reduce the sulfate to sulfide, and euxinia expands as theHothouseworld develops. Euxinia sets up a oneway shuttle system in which reduced iron precipitates as pyrite framboids in the water column (Wilkin et al., 1996; Wilkin and Barnes, 1997) that sink to the bottom. Molybdenum is also removed from solution, and it accumulates in anoxic and euxinic shales (e.g. Anbar and Knoll, 2002; Algeo, 2004; Arnold et al., 2004). Thus, Hothousewindbeltdriven upwelling fails to supply iron to the bacteria that require it to fix nitrogen, making the surface ocean dependent on greatly-diminished windblown dust for its iron supply.\nZhang et al. (2001) suggested that the haline mode was unstable in their partially coupled model, and thought it could not persist for any considerable duration. Contrastingly, fully coupled modeling by Kiehl and Shields (2005) showed that their steady-state mode (=haline mode) was sustainable for the upper 2 km of the ocean under high CO2 conditions. However, after that model reached steady state, a small patch of Gondwanan ice remained to feed the deep sea (b2 km deep)\nwater at∼4 °C, thus keeping the deeper ocean in the thermalmode. This inferred icemaybeanartifact of coupledmodeling that still has not been resolved (J. Kiehl, personal communication). We will give our reasons later as towhywebelieve that ice is totally incompatiblewith thehaline mode. We suggest that the rapid CO2 input from Large Igneous Provinces can tip the world from a Greenhouse to a Hothouse state as warming and drying in mid-latitudes switches deep-ocean circulation from a thermal to a halinemode.We also suggest that the initial plumeheaderuptions of LIPs are a sustaining factor forHothouseworlds.When plume-head activity of LIPs wanes, the Hothouse planetary state reverts to the default Greenhouse state. Because Hothouse climates associated with Phanerozoic LIPs are always hot, we postulate (as did Wignall, 2001) that the warming effects of LIP-generated greenhouse gases outweigh the short-term cooling influences of particulates and sulfates. However, thewarming LIP effect is negatedwhen continental collisional orogeny is sustaining amajor glaciation and thermalmode (Zhang et al., 2001) thermohaline circulation such as that of the Cenozoic or PermoCarboniferous. For example, Cenozoic Icehouse LIPs such as the large Afar and relatively small Columbia River outpourings had lesser impact than LIPs initiated during Greenhouse climates (Fig. 1)."

    "text": "Wind velocity, wind shear, and wind erosive power differ markedly between Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse states. This is because a key thermal difference among the three states is the pole-equator thermal gradient (Fig. 2; Table 2). This contrast is strongest for Icehouses and weakest in Hothouses. The linkage between thermal contrast and wind is quantifiable to some degree (e.g. Wells, 1997). Kidder and Worsley (2004) assumed a value of 1.0 as a starting point in Icehouse climate for comparing aspects of wind among planetary states. By noting that planetary windbelt speed is proportional to pole-equator thermal contrast (Wells, 1997), they derived a drop inwindbelt speed of one-sixth from Icehouse toGreenhouse and a decrease of one third from Icehouse to Hothouse (Fig. 2; Table 2). Because wind shear is proportional to the square of wind velocity, sharper reductions are evident there (Fig. 2; Table 2). A new factor not considered by Kidder and Worsley (2004) iswinderosive power,which is proportional to the cube of wind speed. This relationship means that wind erosive power (and hence dust transport) could be reduced by more than 40% when changing from Icehouse to Greenhouse (Fig. 2; Table 2). The total reduction in wind erosive power from Icehouse to Hothouse is 70%."

    "heading": "4.2.2. Nutrients",
    "text": "The sharp differences in planetary windbelt velocity have profound implications for nutrients, and hence life, among the three planetary states. If winds and surface currents weaken, then planetary windbeltforced upwelling will likely diminish from Icehouse to Greenhouse to Hothouse, although local dynamicsmight still allow for someupwelling areas. More importantly for the open oceans though, the severe loss in wind erosive power from Icehouse to Greenhouse to Hothouse will sharply reducedeliveryof eolian irondust to the oceans. Thismeans that the iron-obligate diazotrophs (N-fixing bacteria) will be seriously curtailed as they become dependent upon upwelling dissolved iron from anoxic (but not euxinic) sub-pycnocline waters. Such iron is available in Greenhouses, but not Hothouses. Saltzman (2005) used carbon isotopic patterns to infer switches in nutrient limitation between Icehouse and Greenhouse paleoclimates. He did not distinguish the Hothouse world, so these are, by default, lumped into the Greenhouse data sets. Saltzman's (2005) results suggest that Icehouseoceans tend to be phosphorus limited whereas Greenhouse oceans are nitrogen limited. Given the likely shortages of iron in surface waters because of reductions in dust input, we suggest that the nitrogen-limited oceans of the Hothouse state were stressed by iron limitation that prevented diazotrophic bacteria from fixing sufficient nitrogen to sustain produc-\ntivity. Alternatively, anoxic oceans that do not become euxinic will recycle dissolved iron fromdeeperwaters. This abundant dissolved iron will cause diazotrophs to fix considerable amounts of reduced nitrogen such as ammonium and nitrite. This Fe and accompanying Mo will facilitate bioassimilation of N (Glass et al., 2009). Given that some phytoplankton are more productive when using reduced nitrogen instead of nitrate (e.g. Litchman, 2007), it becomes unsurprising to see extensive accumulation of organic-rich shales when both high surface productivity and high preservation potential in deeper anoxic waters coincide (e.g. Arthur et al., 1987; Kuypers et al., 2004). We predict that this coincidence of high surface productivity and strong preservation potential inmore acidic carbonate-dissolving deeper anoxic waters will bemaximized during the transition into and out of (but not during) the peak of the Hothouse state (Fig. 5).\nFactors other than wind and upwelling will affect nutrients among the planetary states. Because of the substantial amounts of fresh, unweathered rock generated by continental–collision orogenies, Icehouse oceans will receive and retain more nutrients from silicate weathering than either Greenhouses or Hothouses. The two warmer states will havemore favorable weathering conditions because they are warmer, but Icehouse will remain the most effective nutrientgenerating state because of more silicate weathering in that state. This is so for three reasons: 1) Icehouses will be marked by more weatherable silicates because of the orogenic activity that generates them, 2) glacial grinding and mechanical weathering will break down silicates so as to increase weatherable surface area, and 3) Icehouse desert belts are least extensive, so dry regions that will retard chemical weathering will be minimized.\nIcehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse oceans will differ considerably in style of nutrient limitation as well as in the tracemetals such as Fe and Mo that facilitate N fixation. For example, without glacial grinding in Greenhouse and Hothouse worlds, there will be less dust available for the already weaker winds to entrain and deliver to the oceans (Fig. 4; Table 1). The lessening of planetary windbelt velocity will weaken surface ocean currents and will decrease the intensity of wind-driven upwelling in Greenhouses and particularly Hothouses. Saltzman's (2005) suggestion of a P-limited Icehouse and N-limited Greenhouse is consistent with the expectation that the oxic nature of an Icehouse ocean readily returns nitrate from deeper waters to the photic zone via strong planetary windbelt-driven upwelling, and that strong Icehouse winds deliver ample iron dust to oceans to assure abundant N-fixation by photosynthetic bacteria. Ready availability of Fe facilitates abundant N fixation and bioassimilation, as does the abundance of Mo in an oxic ocean (e.g. Anbar and Knoll, 2002; Glass et al., 2009). The ability to fix N to nitrate in the Icehouse easily relative to Greenhouses and Hothouses helps to keep Icehouse oceans P-limited, but productive.\nThe weakened wind delivery of Fe dust in Greenhouse climates is compensated for to some degree by upwelling of recycled Fe from the thick O2-minimum zone (Fig. 4). Despite this offset, Greenhouse oceans will not be P-limited for three other reasons. First, P becomes more soluble under reducing conditions (e.g. Hotinski et al., 2000). Second, the bacterially driven anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) reaction is a particularly effective destroyer of bioavailable nitrogen under reducing conditions (Dalsgaard et al., 2003). Anammoxwould be especially important in Greenhouse oceans characterized by a thick and widespread oxygen-minimum zone. Third, Mo abundance in the more common anoxic waters of the thick O2-minimum zone would fall, reducing N fixation.\nHothouse oceans would be highly depleted in bioavailable nitrogen. Not only would iron input be even more greatly reduced as winds weakened (Table 2), but also the reduced iron common to Greenhouse anoxic zoneswould be scavenged by sulfide in euxinic Hothouse oceans to form pyrite. Small pyrite framboids (≤6 μm) form in the euxinic water column, and then sink to the bottom (Wilkin et al., 1996; Wilkin and Barnes, 1997). In addition to iron,molybdenum also accumulates in\neuxinic oceans (Anbar and Knoll, 2002; Arnold et al., 2004) so much so that Algeo (2004) has suggested that transition metals (including Mo) are drawn down from the ocean reservoir during anoxic and euxinic intervals.\nThe diminished supply of Fe and Mo in anoxic and euxinic oceans of Greenhouses and Hothouses impact life not only by curtailing N fixation, but also by sharply reducing N assimilation by life (e.g. Anbar and Knoll, 2002; Glass et al., 2009). Thus, even if residual nutrients remained in oceans as a Greenhouse shifted into a Hothouse via a HEATT episode, the scarcity of Fe and Mo would sharply limit the capability of life to use what little N was likely to be available. Furthermore, given that cyclonic storms may well be the most effective Hothouse upwelling mechanism (see later discussion) and that such upwelling would likely be drawing up poisonous sulfidic waters, extinction in Hothouse climates becomes unsurprising.\nWith Fe, Mo, and N governing productivity so effectively at HEATT horizons, the role of phosphorus becomes interesting. Hotinski et al. (2000, 2001) suggested that phosphorus concentration was high in deep waters like the late Permian ocean because phosphorus regenerated from bottom sediments (Ingall et al., 1993; Van Cappellen and Ingall, 1994) remains in solution in reducing waters. Another reason for high dissolved phosphorus is the iron-limited conditions described above. With productivity already low, and with iron and nitrogen serving as the limiting nutrients, phosphorus would seemingly be in excess. Counterintuitively, the phosphorus excess coincides with the phosphorite gap that marks the long early Triassic HEATT interval (Trappe, 1994, 1998). The end-Permian extinction eliminated the biological/fecal mechanism that locally concentrates it to phosphorite in Icehouses and Greenhouses. Similar phosphorite gaps are expected at other HEATT horizons, but such gaps may be difficult to detect if the HEATT episode is short. When biological productivity is high, such as beneath an upwelling zone, significant phosphorite deposits tend to be nodular or bedded (Cook and McElhinny, 1979; Follmi, 1996) indicating concentration bymetazoan activities. Most of these are likely the result of burial of phosphate-rich fecal material that may have been further enriched by phosphate mineral replacement of carbonates (e.g. Ames, 1959) or by precipitation of cements that nucleate on skeletal material during diagenesis in the top few centimeters of organic-rich sediment beneath upwelling zones (e.g. Burnett, 1977; Kidder, 1985). Phosphorite (oregrade phosphate deposits) presence reflects significant usage by biotas when productivity is high. Therefore, it is likely that metazoanconcentrated phosphorite should largely be absent at HEATT-related extinction horizons despite relatively high oceanic phosphorus concentration. However, other non-phosphorite phosphate types may accumulate as phosphorus concentration gets high enough for direct precipitation, for example as primary oolites. Primary oolitic phosphatic coatings are known from the early Cambrian (Swett and Crowder, 1982) when seawater phosphate concentration is thought to have been higher. Primary phosphatic oolites are also present at the close of the end-Triassic HEATT episode (Wignall et al., 2007). We speculate that inconspicuous disseminated phosphate precipitates should characterize HEATT-episode sediments. Perhaps the optimum place to look for such inorganic phosphates is just after the HEATT episode when oxygen becomes more available, facilitating removal of “excess” dissolved phosphorus. The end-Triassic phosphate oolites described above (Wignall et al., 2007) are in the regressive sediments just following the transgressive phase that marks the HEATT episode.\nThe tendency of dysoxic to anoxic oceans of the Greenhouse and Hothouse worlds will favor reduced nitrogen forms such as ammonium (NH4+) rather than themore oxidized nitrate (NO3−) of Icehouse surface waters. This will leave a distinctive signal among primary producers, in the sterane biomarkers (Schwark and Empt, 2006), and in the ∂15N record (Fig. 6). Green algae such as prasinophytes will be more prevalent when nitrogen is in reduced form because they are more effective at using reduced N than are plankton with red-algal affinities\nsuch as diatoms, dinoflagellates, and, to a lesser extent, coccolithophorids (e.g. Litchman, 2007). Although modern plankton with red-algal affinities actually are more productive in ammonium-bearing waters than in nitrate-bearing ones, green algae are even more adept at using reduced nitrogen, and therefore proliferate. The advantage that redalgal plankton have in oxic waters is that, unlike their green-algal counterparts, they can use nitrate effectively. Presumably, the advantage held by green algae arose in NH4+-bearing waters arose when they evolved in Proterozoic and/or early Paleozoic anoxic oceans. Ammoniumwasmore available than nitrate then, so when oceans revert to that more primitive anoxic chemical state, the green algae thrive. A number of extinction horizons bear this out by preserving abundantmicrofloras dominated by acritarchs and/or prasinophytes (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2005a, b; Litchman, 2007; Prauss, 2007).\nSterane biomarkers display a shift in C28/C29 ratio that rises from lower values of less than0.4 in theearly Paleozoic tomore than1.3 in the Cenozoic (Schwark and Empt, 2006). We suggest here that the higher values reflect adaptation to nitrate assimilation in the more advanced C28-producing forms. The Devonian and Ordovician extinction zones appear to temporarily jump tomore advanced ratios, perhaps reflecting nitrate availability in oxic Icehouse oceans. Conversely, sterane biomarker values should drop at just before and after younger HEATT horizons (Fig. 5) as plankton revert to more primitive assemblages that favor ammonium over nitrate in anoxic oceans.\nNitrogen isotopes (∂15N) drop when reduced nitrogen species such as ammonium and nitrite prevail over nitrate (Fig. 6). Probably a more important driver of ∂15N is the biological selection of light values of ∂15N during nitrogen fixation. The intensive levels of N-fixation by primitive green-algal plankton that thrive on reduced nitrogen support this contention. If life is to thrive in planetary states inwhichnewdelivery of nutrients is minimized and nutrient recycling via wind-driven upwelling is also minimized, biological nitrogen fixation must necessarily increase, decreasing ∂15N levels in the process. As expected, the ∂15N values are low, and often negative near and/or at HEATT-related extinction horizons (Fig. 6). This presumably reflects high N-fixation just before and just after the extinction when iron was available via diazotrophy to thriving green-algal plankton such as prasinophytes (Fig. 5). At the extinctionhorizon, productivity is sharply curtailed as the rise of sulfidic waters cut off the dissolved iron supply. The ∂15N signaturemayhave remained at pre-extinction levels because itwasnot being used. Unused ammonium will persist in surface waters until the minimal life presentmanages tomake use of it. Suchusewill be difficult, however, as both Fe and Mo will be minimal, hampering the ability of primary producers to assimilate N (Glass et al., 2009). If annamox bacteria can survive in these waters, they will destroy bioavailable N."

    "text": "Positive excursions in ∂34S should characterize HEATT episodes (Table 1). Increased brine formation in evaporative basins (Holser, 1977; Claypool et al., 1980) and/or increased burial of framboidal pyrite can drive these excursions (e.g. HallamandWignall, 1997). Large inputs of volcanic sulfur from LIP activity can also contribute (Adams et al., 2010). Kidder andWorsley (2004) suggested that Hothouse conditions developing across the Permo-Triassic boundary would be consistent with both increased evaporative brines carrying sulfate to deep water and formation of abundant framboidal pyrite in the water column. Newer literature that has focused ∂34S analyses on extinctions horizons is revealing key data missed by long-term secular surveys. Positive ∂34S excursions are present in the Botomian, late Devonian, end-Permian, end-Triassic, and Cenomanian–Turonian (Table 1). Furthermore, Kampschulte and Strauss (2006) modeled biological sulfate reduction (BSR) through the Phanerozoic based on integration of ∂34S analyses from evaporites with many gaps between evaporite deposits filled by ∂34S values from new carbonate associated sulfur (CAS). Allowing for some inconsistencies in their time scale that mute the sharp positive excursions of HEATTs (their Fig. 8), their model curve for BSR is\nconsistent with high values during times of euxinia, including positive spikes at some HEATT horizons. Many of the low values match times of more ventilated oceans.\nThe framboid-producing euxinia that first developed in deeper water has been documented to rise into the photic zone during many HEATT episodes (Table 1), and we expect it will be demonstrated for others. Isorenieratane and maliemide are biomarkers that record the presence of green sulfur bacteria that photosynthesize in euxinicwaters (Table 1). Kump et al. (2005) suggested that such intervals of photiczone euxinia at the end-Permian, late Devonian, and Cenomanian– Turonian were the result of chemocline upward excursions (CUE). An important question pertaining to a rising chemocline is that of why it happens. Delivery of toxic sulfides to the photic zone should have serious negative implications for primary productivity except for the few bacteria that thrive in such waters if they can acquire sufficient Fe andMo. Kumpet al. (2005) note that CUEswouldmost likely develop in upwelling areas. Although planetary windbelt-driven upwelling would seeminglybea likely candidate,wehave already suggested that reduced wind velocity would weaken this mechanism somewhat in Greenhouses and more in Hothouses. An alternative mechanism for bringing deeper waters to the surface is one that we argue is necessary for meriodonal heat transport considerations — cyclonic storms."

    "heading": "4.2.4. Cyclonic storms",
    "text": "Kidder and Worsley (2004) suggested that cyclonic storm (hurricane/typhoon) activity intensified as Earth shifted from an early Permian Icehouse to a late Permian Greenhouse, and thence to a Hothouse that developed at the end of the Permian and continued through the early Triassic. Kiehl and Shields (2007) showed that such\nstorms can persist to high latitudes in a warm equable climate. Several consequences of storm intensification are expected as Hothouse conditions are approached and achieved (Table 3). This intensification is critical for increasing atmospheric heat transport to high latitudes and for mining it from warm high-latitude waters. As planetary windbeltdriven surface ocean circulation and upwelling weakens in the Greenhouse state, increasing frequency and intensity of the storms may also be beneficial in generating upwelling of usable nitrogen and iron to\nsustain productivity in the open ocean. This increased role for cyclonic storms probably explains why the black shales deposited during many oceanic anoxic events are widespread rather than being confined to predicted positions of wind-driven upwelling zones. Much of the widespread late Permian anoxia, however, is not marked by black shale (Wignall and Hallam, 1992; Wignall and Hallam, 1993; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996). With storm-generated upwelling increasing even as windbelt-driven upwelling weakens, productivity is no longer confined to weakened wind-driven upwelling zones. Instead, productivity in Greenhouse climates may correspond more closely to cyclonic storm tracks for that climate regime. However, such cyclonic storms become deadly in a Hothouse world because they reach deeper (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Korty et al., 2008) and draw up the Mo and Fe deficient and poisonous euxinicwaters that contribute significantly to extinction.\nAs warmth expands poleward from the tropics, the latitudinal reach of cyclonic storms should increase because the warm waters to sustain those storms will be available in those formerly cooler-water settings. Mid-latitude storms are thought to be the main atmospheric vehicle by which heat is transported from the equator to the poles today (Barry et al., 2002). We maintain that tropical cyclonic storms have even greater heat transporting capability (Table 3), but because they are confined to the tropics in Icehouses, their importance dissipates in the middle latitudes. Positive feedback would be critical (Table 3). As storms reached to higher latitudes, they would help deliver more heat to those regions. That would, in turn, further warm higher latitude surface waters, making it more likely that subsequent storms would have an ever-greater poleward reach. Polar storms would lead also to increased polar cloudiness (Fig. 2), which would impede surface heat radiation to space, thus warming the poles even more (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Abbot andTziperman, 2008). InGreenhouse andHothouse climates, this increased cyclonic storm activity would supplant poleward heat transport by surface winds and the surface currents driven by those winds. As planetarywindbelt velocity dropped, sowould the strength of its wind-driven surface currents. As a consequence, surface currents would diminish from their Icehouse role as important heat transporters as the world warmed. With ocean surface currents diminishing in importance in the two warmest planetary states, Kidder and Worsley (2004) suggested that atmospheric transport (latent heat and cyclones) in a warmer and more humid world as well as deep-ocean heat transport would have to increase greatly (Table 2). Such an increase would intensify total meriodonal heat transport as Earth shifted into ever more equable Greenhouse and Hothouse climates (Table 3).\nThe magnitude of cyclonic storms also is likely to have increased from Icehouse to Greenhouse to Hothouse (Table 3). Such increases have been suggested even for the relatively small changes in ocean surface temperature in the modern world (e.g. Emanuel, 2005). We extend this concept to the much larger surface- and deep-ocean temperature increases between the three planetary states. Evidence from increased wavelength of hummocky cross-stratified storm beds during times of highest atmospheric carbon dioxide in Mesozoic storm beds (Ito et al., 2001) supports the contention of increased cyclonic stormmagnitude in warmer planetary states. Another reason to expect cyclonic storms to increase in magnitude in Greenhouse and Hothouse worlds is because the tropical thermocline is likely to have been replaced by a weak halocline as warm saline bottomwater invaded the deep ocean (see Fig. 8 of Kidder and Worsley, 2004). Modern cyclonic storms are limited in size by the presence of the thermocline that stops their growth as theyburrow intodeeperwaters.Once theyhit those cold waters, they cannot extend themselves any deeper, and indeed tapping these waters will weaken them (e.g. Wells, 1997; Korty et al., 2008). Kidder and Worsley (2004) argued that this restraint would be weakened or removed in warmer worlds (Table 3), allowing cyclones to increase theirdepthof reach. The cyclone-magnitude governorwould be completely removed in a Hothouse and at least weakened in a Greenhouse relative to an Icehouse. Recent modeling by Korty et al. (2008) using today's ocean supports the likelihood of deeper-reaching\ncyclonic storms in warmer climates. Korty et al. (2008) also evaluated the effect of storm mixing at various depths with varying water temperatures. Mixing was clearly far more effective at greater depths when model temperatures were increased. For example, if the mixedlayer model temperature is increased from 14 °C to 22 °C, the depth of storm mixing increases by 50–75 m (Korty et al., 2008, p. 651). If the mixed-layer temperature is further increased to 28 °C, the depth of stormmixing increases by an additional 100 m to a potential maximum depth of 400 m or more. Storm mining of warm waters results in positive feedback in which warming surface waters will favor cyclonic storms. In an Icehouse world, negative feedback caused by bringing up cold thermoclinewaters cools the tropics, limiting the size of the storms. This is one reasonwhy tropical latitudes inHothouses shouldbewarmer than those of either Icehouses or Greenhouses where low-latitude stormswill tend to cool the tropics. Recent evidence supports thewarmtropic scenario (Forster et al., 2007; Friedrich et al., 2008).\nCyclonic storms should be more persistent in Greenhouses and especially Hothouses because the storms will be harder to terminate in such worlds. The two things that are most likely to shut down a cyclonic storm are deprivation of heat and/or moisture. High-latitude storms that reach into deeper waters would maintain strength because the deeper waters would be uniformly warm worldwide. This is the heat-mining activity referred to earlier that is important for keeping polar climates reasonably warm and moist. Cyclonic storms in Greenhouse climates would still likely weaken or shut down in high latitudes because surface waters would be cooler there than during Hothouse and because warm saline bottom waters below the surface would not be available to sustain them as in Hothouses.\nAn effective way to shut down cyclonic storms in any climate, but perhaps the only one in Hothouse climates, would be for them to move over land. In the late Permian Greenhouse and the early Triassic Hothouse, vast regions of Pangea were dry. These expanded deserts would have been a most potent shutdown setting for cyclonic storms (Fig. 1 of Kidder and Worsley, 2004). However, storms that remained at sea would probably persist for long intervals. Such storms would probably have been large, as already discussed. Given the weakened steering winds discussed earlier (Tables 2, 3; Fig. 2), these cyclonic storms would probably also be slow moving (Table 3). Their slow pace would allow them to generate local upwelling of warm water thatwould serve to enlarge them.Contrastingly, Icehouse tropical cyclones weaken when they pump up cold water upon reaching the thermocline.\nThe increases in cyclonic storm duration, depth of storm mixing, and latitudinal reach have profound implications for nutrients and the photic-zone euxinia noted briefly earlier. If planetary windbeltdriven upwelling is weakened, the compensating increased role of cyclonic storms may go well beyond that of moving heat. Those storms would replace planetary windbelt upwelling as the major way to deliver nutrients from deeper waters to the surface. In the progression toward a Hothouse ocean, this would chiefly be ammonium (Fig. 5). Later in the Hothouse, ammonium would be depleted as euxinia removed Fe via pyrite framboids and diminished dust transport in windbelts delivered less iron to open oceans. Molybdenum would accumulate significantly in bottom sediments beneath euxinic waters, much as had been the case beneath anoxic Greenhouse waters. Hothouse cyclones would then mix the near-surface suboxic layer and deliver sulfidic waters to the surface if they were shallow enough for the storms to reach. Therefore, stormsmay be the chief reason for the chemocline upward excursions proposed by Kump et al. (2005). Suchwaters would be deadly, wiping out existing life and allowing only photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria to thrive ondiminishingpreformed ammonium.Uniformlymixed sulfidicwaters in the wake of those storms would oxidize, perhaps quickly enough to allow opportunistic plankton to capitalize on any preformed ammonium still remaining in deeper Fe-poor water that is brought to the surface."

    "text": "The above discussion of Icehouse-to-Hothouse upper ocean overturn and effects on tropical cyclone mixing makes the tacit assumption that all ocean/atmosphere heating is solar and so, neglects geothermal heating. This simplifying assumption is reasonable for icehouses where geothermal heating raises the lower 2 km of the ocean only 1.2 °C if only diapycnal diffusion is considered, or 0.4 °C if advection to higher (but not polar) latitudes is considered (Table 4). However Table 4 also shows that as the rapid polar sinking of the thermal mode is progressively replaced by the sluggish subtropical to mid-latitudinal sinking and polar upwelling of the haline mode, the effects of deep-ocean geothermal heating become considerable and cannot be neglected. Given the putative warming (Table 4) caused by the very long potential residence time of haline-mode bottomwaters, it is unlikely that the already-hot deep layers can remain stable. Instead, it is highly likely that the geothermal heat will serve to concentrate and accelerate haline-mode polar upwelling rather than being allowed to warm the deep ocean to the extent shown in Table 4. Such a scenario would keep the whole-ocean temperature very slightly warmer and further disrupt the already-weak pycnocline."

    "heading": "4.3. Generation of thermal-expansion transgressions",
    "text": "Kidder and Worsley (2004) suggested that the end-Permian was characterized by transgression via whole-ocean thermal expansion due to severe global warming. We generalize that conclusion here and propose that a HEATT episode is a shift from Greenhouse to Hothouse that causes a third-order transgression that is driven by thermal expansion of ocean water (Fig. 5). This transgression occurs when the sub-pycnocline zone fills with mid-latitude-generated warm brines. This deep-ocean warming drives the transgression. Alternatively, for Greenhouse oceans operating in a weak thermal mode, a transgression of smaller magnitude might result (e.g. end Cretaceous) if deep brines were cooler and less saline as modeled by Kiehl and Shields (2005) for the end Permian. Furthermore, these brines may reach down only to the O2-minimum layer, not to the bottom. Brines feeding the O2minimum zone have been previously discussed (Chamberlin, 1906; Wilde and Berry, 1982; Arthur et al., 1987), and the case forwarm saline intermediate waters has been reiterated by Friedrich et al. (2008). In addition to this, however, we believe that in a Hothouse, intense warming will also penetrate all the way to the ocean bottom (Table 3) resulting in the hallmark transgression of a HEATT episode. The HEATT transgression and the factors that lead to its development can potentially take place in less than 200,000 years if most feedbacks are positive and if the LIP trigger is strong and unimpeded by competing factors. The ∼170,000-year development of the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (Zachos et al., 2008) is the fastest-known HEATT-like event, although it abortedbefore achieving full developmentas comparedwith other HEATT episodes. Slower (∼500,000 years) and/or stepwise transgressions may occur if the LIP trigger is weak or intermittent or is in competitionwithminor orogenic activity thatprovides enoughnegative feedback to slow and/or weaken the HEATT episode."

    "text": "The steps involved in the HEATT episode are outlined in Fig. 5. Assuming that the minimal orogeny Greenhouse-state precondition is met, step one is the initiation of LIP activity. In addition to massive outpourings of lava, substantial emissions of particulates, sulfur dioxide, and greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere (Kerr, 1998, 2005; Heydari et al., 2008: Pearce et al., 2008). The particulates and sulfur emissionsdonot remain in theatmosphere long(years toperhaps decades), although repeated eruptions can keep renewing these materials. Both the particulates and sulfur compounds will generate a global cooling effect by blocking incoming solar radiation, but cooling will be short-lived because sunlight-reflecting emissions will quickly settle out of the atmosphere and the sulfur will oxidize to sulfate, consumingO2 in the process.We suggest, however, that the greenhouse gas emissions will ultimately outcompete the short-term effects of particulates and sulfur because the rock record reveals warming and transgression at HEATT-related LIP horizons (Table 1) rather than evidence for cooling and regression. Greenhouse gases emitted by LIPs are probably chiefly carbon dioxide. However, in some cases such as the North Atlantic Igneous Province (Paleocene/Eocene) and the Siberian Traps (Permian/Triassic), considerable release of methane may have occurred because the LIP was erupting throughmethane-rich sediment (Svensen et al., 2004; McElwain et al., 2005; Storey et al., 2007; Ganino and Arndt, 2009). LIPs that are thereby enriched in methane might be more climatically potent than others, and LIPs erupting under such conditions might not need to be as massive as others not assisted by methane. Ganino and Arndt (2009) showed that LIPs degassing carbonate-rich strata can cause CO2 release that is disproportionate to LIP size.\nStep two is further atmospheric warming. The greenhouse gas emissions from the LIP are NOT sufficient to generate the warmth that characterizes the HEATT episode on their own (Beerling and Berner, 2002). However, the warming caused by LIP greenhouse gases are probably sufficient to drive step three, which we break down into two closely-related components. One is that any seasonal polar ice that persisted in a preceding Greenhouse world is either wholly eliminated or is sogreatly reduced that its effects onocean thermohaline circulation arenullified. Theother is thatdesert belts inmid-latitude regions greatly expand their latitudinal range and get warmer as the climate shifts in response to LIP greenhouse gas emissions.\nStep four consists of coeval processes operating in the deep ocean and in the atmosphere. First is the generation of sinkingwarm brines in the middle latitudes. Sinking is driven by evaporation at the expanded dry latitudes mentioned above. Such brine generation will be most effective where there are coastal embayments that can maximize evaporation and can deliver those brines across the shelf and down into the deep sea. In the absence of ice-driven sinking of cold polar brines, these warm brines become the dominant, albeit weak, driver of thermohaline circulation in the ocean. It is the replacement of polar sinkingby thesemiddle, andperhaps low-latitudebrines thatultimately drive up ocean temperatures so as to force a thermal-expansion-driven transgression. Once thermal expansion is initiated, positive feedback\nsets in (Fig. 3). Evaporation generates brine which warms the deep ocean. Warmer ocean water drives transgression which expands the embayments. The enlarged embayments deliver more warm brine to the deep sea, intensifying the transgression until the loop is broken by LIP cessation or steady-state Hothouse is reached.\nStep four continues as the deep ocean fills with warm saline brine. This is an effective method of poleward heat transport that partially replaces weakened winds and surface currents (Figs. 2, 3; Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Kiehl and Shields, 2005). Deep-sea bottom geothermal heat augments the process (Table 4). The atmosphere accounts for the remainder of the poleward heat transport via two processes. First, the warmer global surface temperatures entail higher saturation vapor pressure and therefore higher absolute humidity. Therefore, the lower planetary windbelt speeds are more than compensated by increased latent heat transfer, owing to the higher humidity. This moisture becomes clouds and heat-producing rain at polar latitudes (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Abbot and Tziperman, 2008). The polar cloudsminimize heat loss to space (Fig. 2). Second, cyclonic storms in Greenhouses and Hothouseswill reach to higher latitudes, and those stormswill probably be larger and longer lasting (Fig. 2; Kidder andWorsley, 2004; Kiehl and Shields, 2005). The storms will provide even more meriodonal heat transport. Poleward flow ofwarm saline bottomwaterwill also be a key factor in delivering heat to polar regions (Kidder andWorsley, 2004 and Fig. 2). The warm water delivered to polar regions must reach the surface in order to be effective in helping to warm the high latitudes. Because it will likely bewarmer than cool (but not frozen) polarwaters, owing to geothermal heat addition, it may rise of its own accord so as to deliver heat. However, the polar surface waters will also be fresher because polar climate will have become wetter. It may be that a strong haloclinewould impede penetration of risingwarm salinewaters to the surface, causing them to upwell in slightly lower latitudes. Therefore, the extended reach of deep-mixing cyclonic storms into the high latitudes might be critical in pulling warm waters to the surface. The combined action of warm saline bottomwater, atmospheric latent heat transport, and subhalocline heatmining by cyclones ultimately serve to flatten the pole-to-equator thermal gradient to about 20 °C or less.\nThe timing of these steps leads to some predictions. First, organisms that are particularly susceptible to effects of rising carbon dioxide, warming and ocean acidification may begin to exhibit a record of extinction prior to the major portion of the thermal transgression and intensified warming that develops just before delivery of toxic euxinic waters into the photic zone. Corals are one example of a sensitive group in this regard. Veron (2008) outlined a stepwise progression of ocean acidification effects on coral reefs, with deep, azoothanthellate taxa being eliminated first, followed by shallow, fast-growing branching taxa, and finally bymassive corals. Devonian data do not, to date, match the predictions for reef loss either via anoxia or acidification although corals do make early departures. Devonian coral diversity underwent multiple declines before the Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) extinction (Copper, 2002). The end-Givetian extinctions for tabulates, rugosans, stromatoporoids, and reef-associated brachiopods was more severe than the F/F, and Givetian reef diversity had been substantially reduced prior to the Frasnian (Copper, 2002). Younger reefs disappeared before the F/F extinction. Copper (2002) suggested that these extinctions preceded the F/F horizon by one to two conodont zones. Copper (2002) also emphasized that the departure of Frasnian reefswasnot temporally linked with anoxic horizons, and reef loss coincided with regression rather than transgressive black shales, although the demise of latest Frasnian reefs has been linked to anoxic transgression in Poland (Bond et al., 2004). Furthermore, deep-water rugose corals passed through the extinction unscathed (Sorauf and Pedder, 1986; Copper, 2002), suggesting that neither anoxia nor acidification affected them to any great extent. It is clear that stepwise reef extinctions in the lateDevonian march to their own tempo relative to thoseof other organisms.Although pulses of transgressive anoxia consistent with HEATT predictions characterized this interval, these pulses to not appear to match reef\nextinctions or the main F/F event (Sandberg et al., 2002). Both tabulate and rugose corals went extinct just prior to the main end-Permian extinction event (Knoll et al., 1996; Jin et al., 2000), although they were no longer reef formers. Terrestrial biotas might similarly record some early extinctions as the atmospherewarms and themiddle latitudes dry out. This seems to be the case for the end-Triassic extinction (Pálfy et al., 2002) and for the end-Permian extinction (Ward, 2007). We caution that the backsmearing of extinction via the Signor-Lipps effect (Signor and Lipps, 1982) must be filtered out before major significance can be attached to all precursor extinctions.\nThe sharply negative ∂13C excursion common to many HEATT episodes (Table 1) has often been explained by methane release (see Erwin, 1993; Kidder andWorsley, 2004; Zachos et al., 2008 for reviews). Methane release as a result of deep-oceanwarmingwould intensify the climatic warming already underway in a HEATT episode. We note here that the drop in ∂13C can also be explained by productivity loss (Berner, 1989; Broecker and Peacock, 1999) and by luxury feeding of photosynthesizers in a CO2-rich atmosphere (Galimov, 1985; Worsley and Nance, 1989). Luxury feeding can reduce ∂13C by −1‰ for each doubling of atmospheric CO2. Three such doublings, for example, were postulated by Kidder and Worsley (2004) across the Permo-Triassic boundary.\nAs the thermal transgression begins, changes in themarine nutrient cycle will strongly feed back into accelerating the transgression if allowed to progress to a fully developed HEATT event (Fig. 5). In this early phase of the transgression, green algae such as prasinophytes take over the chief role in carbon burial, fueled by intense diazotrophy as storms pull up reduced iron. This high productivity above anoxic deep waters will result in considerable black shale accumulation, slowing the rate ofwarming instigated by other factors discussed so far. However, as euxinia develops, dissolved iron and molybdenum become insoluble and accumulate in bottom sediments. Cyclones and any other upwelling then bring poisonous sulfide to the surface instead of beneficial iron. Productivity shuts down as anammox and photosynthesizers rapidly denitrify the remaining ammonium, removing a key restraint on the warming factors such as volcanically generated CO2 and the positive feedbacks that it triggers. Warming is now maximized, and the transgression reaches its peak at the culmination of the HEATT episode. It is possible that the total denitrification and mass extinction can precede the peak of the transgression. In that case, productivity will remain shut down until the peak transgression begins to subside. Euxinic conditions are now very close to the surface, and episodically reach the surface during storms. The HEATT episode is maintained until the LIP emissions of greenhouse gas ease, allowing theworld to revert to Greenhouse conditions."

The end-Cretaceous and PETMdonotfit aswell as the other nine, and those discrepancieswill be discussed separately later. These factors are all specified by the HEATT model, and many of them have separately been proposed as extinction causes. The horizons are not discussed in chronological order for a reason.Mesozoic HEATT episodes are discussed first because alongwith the Permo-Triassic episode, these tend to fit the model best. The endCretaceous episode is last within that group because it is a weak HEATT episode, and it was amplified by the Chicxulub impact. Although the Botomian (early Cambrian) HEATT episode does fit the model reasonably well, the Ordovician and Devonian HEATT episodes are more complicated by their slower development and because they are both associated with brief glaciation that appears to interrupt their development. The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) is discussed last because although we consider it an aborted HEATT episode, and access to the data that reveal the timing and quantitative\naspects of its development is considerably better than for older HEATT episodes, it remains aberrant relative to the other HEATT episodes for reasons we will discuss."

    "text": "The end-Triassic, Toarcian, Cenomanian–Turonian, and end-Cretaceous as HEATT episodes are all related to major extinctions. The Aptian is another HEATT episode to which we allude, even though its associated extinction is minor. We predict that there are a number of other lesser HEATT episodes in the Mesozoic. The Albian and Valanginian are both likely contenders that we briefly introduce herein. Previous workers have already recognized linkages between some of the factors that we include in the HEATT model. Connections between widespread anoxia and/or warmth and/or marine sea-level rise have been noted (e.g. Jenkyns, 1980; Arthur et al., 1987; Schlanger et al., 1987; Kerr, 1998; Wignall, 2001; Hesselbo et al., 2002, 2004; Jenkyns, 2003; Pearce et al., 2008). Schlanger et al. (1987) termed such intervals oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). Connection to extinctions has been suggested as well (Hallam and Wignall, 1997, 1999; Ward, 2007). Kerr (1998) was even bolder, suggesting that the Cenomanian–Turonian warming, anoxia, and extinction were not only linked, but also were related to LIP volcanism, which drove the transgression via ocean plateau formation. Although ages for two LIPs (Madagascar and the Caribbean–Columbian region) appear to be too young to have initiated Cenomanian–Turonian HEATT (Wignall, 2001; White and Saunders, 2005), the Ontong–Java LIP does appear old enough (Fig. 1), and we acknowledge Kerr's (1998) prescient view and assimilate his contentions into the HEATT model. Pearce et al. (2008) noted strong connections between sharp swings in ∂13C and conspicuous changes in ocean redox at the Toarcian and Cretaceous OAEs. They also link these changes with global warming episodes. Pálfy and Smith (2000) proposed that the Karoo–Ferrer LIP triggered the changes, much like many aspects of Kerr's (1998) suggestion for the Cenomanian–Turonian OAE and its triggering LIP(s)."

    "heading": "6.1. Terminal Triassic HEATT",
    "text": "The end of the Triassic is fairly consistent with HEATT model predictions, and it appears to include two pulses of crisis. A sharply negative spike in ∂15N (Fig. 6) has been recognized (Sephton et al., 2002; Quan et al., 2008) at the base of the Rhaetian. Anoxia is well developed from this point on (e.g. Hesselbo et al., 2004; Ward, 2007; Wignall et al., 2007). Some extinction marked the end-Norian (e.g. Ward, 2007). The Rhaetian did not seemuch in theway of post-Norian recovery prior to the terminal blow to Triassic assemblages. The Rhaetian–Hettangian boundary zone is distinguished by a phytoplankton progression of dinoflagellates giving way to prasinophytes and then acritarchs (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2007). Green and purple sulfur bacteria suggest chemocline euxinic excursions (Richoz et al., 2008). A calcification crisis is suggested by thin-shelled pectinids (Wignall et al., 2007) and scarcity and dwarfism in calcareous nannoliths (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2007). This crisis has been linked with volcanic degassing leading to an ocean undersaturated in CaCO3 at the end of the Triassic (Berner and Beerling, 2007). The post-regression transgression within the boundary horizon (Hesselbo et al., 2004; Tanner et al., 2004) coincides with the negative ∂13C anomaly (Ward et al., 2001; Hesselbo et al., 2002). The CAMP LIP is the likely HEATT trigger as most recent work except Whiteside et al. (2007, 2010) puts it temporally close to the extinction (e.g. Wignall, 2001; Hesselbo et al., 2002; Pálfy et al., 2002; Marzoli et al., 2004). Warmth is evident (McElwain et al., 1999; Beerling and Berner, 2002; Berner and Beerling, 2007; Cohen and Coe, 2007; van de Schootbrugge et al., 2007), and modeling (Huynh and Poulsen, 2005) is consistent with CO2 driving that warming.\nBeerling and Berner (2002) anticipated aspects of the HEATT model when they pointed out that although the CAMP LIP eruptions were massive, they could not have produced sufficient warming to drive the carbon shift. They noted the call of Pálfy et al. (2001) for release of methane hydates to drive the isotopic shift. The sinking warm brines of the HEATT model provide the connection between terrestrial warmth caused by volcanic emissions of CO2 and the release of oceanic methane that would have intensified the warming. The evidence for elevated CO2 is not just a modeling artifact, but arises from direct measurements of leave stomates in fossil leaves (McElwain et al., 1999).\nThe HEATT model predicts precursor extinctions in the terrestrial realm and in selected marine faunas affected by warmth, acidification or anoxia. The multiphase aspects of the end-Triassic extinction(s) seem evident in the reported loss of monotid bivalves at the end of the Norian at the Kennecott Point (Queen Charlotte Islands) in British Columbia as deep waters became anoxic (Ward et al., 2001). Pálfy et al. (2002) suggested that terrestrial extinctions may have preceded the marine ones, but more recent work (Whiteside et al., 2010) suggests terminal Triassic extinction is synchronous in themarine and nonmarine realms. The transgression reported within the boundary horizon (Hesselbo et al., 2004) was probably the final knockout blow during this HEATT episode. The lack of a transgression at the end of the Norian may simply mark the initial spread of anoxia during the early part of the HEATT episode. Given the two-phase nature of late Triassic development of warming, anoxia, and extinction, we speculate that there may have been an end-Norian transgression that has not yet been recognized. Hori et al. (2007) note that deep-sea sediments of the Panthalassic Ocean were oxic, in contrast to the anoxic continental margin sections discussed above. This is consistent with an expanded oxygen-minimum zone (Figs. 2 and 3) that would not reach all deep-sea sediments."

    "heading": "6.2. Toarcian HEATT",
    "text": "The Toarcian extinction exemplifies many aspects of a HEATT episode (Table 1). It is a well-known anoxic horizon (e.g. Jenkyns, 1988; Jenkyns and Clayton, 1997; Pearce et al., 2008). It is marked by a negative carbon isotopic excursion (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2005a, b; Wignall et al., 2006). A significant rise in global temperature based on Mg/Ca ratios and ∂18O is also evident (Bailey et al., 2003). As is the case with many carbon isotopic excursions, the cause of the negative ∂13C spike has been a topic of debate. Recent review and evaluation of potential causes (Beerling and Brentnall, 2007) fail to resolve whether release of light carbon by heating Gondwanan coal (McElwain et al., 2005) or release of such carbon from oceanic clathrates (e.g. Hesselbo et al., 2000; Cohen et al., 2004; Kemp et al., 2005) can sufficiently perturb the carbon cycle to cause the sharply negative excursion. The HEATT model offers the opportunity to initiate global warming by carbon dioxide release during the Karoo–Ferrar LIP, which Pálfy and Smith (2000) and Pearce et al. (2008) also suggested as a trigger. That warming would lead to the sinking warm waters that could liberate methane hydrates from sub-sea-floor sediments, triggering the ∂13C anomaly. This, of course, calls for some warming before the excursion, and more warming as the oceanic methane is released. Although the coals called upon by McElwain et al. (2005) do not seem to be sufficient to trigger the ∂13C anomaly on their own, they could be a supplemental light carbon source. As noted earlier, luxury feeding by life can cause a drop of approximately −1‰ in ∂13C values for each doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (e.g. Galimov, 1985; Kump and Arthur, 1999). This should affect results obtained from both carbonate and organic matter, though the dynamics can be complex (Kump and Arthur, 1999). As with any HEATT episode, the release of carbon dioxide and methane that creates the warming that ultimately leads to transgression will also acidify the ocean. It is not surprising,\nthen, that calcareous phytoplankton undergo calcification challenges during the ∂13C excursion (Tremolada et al., 2005).\nAlthough the ∂13C excursion itself lasted only about 200 k.y. (Kemp et al., 2005; Cohen and Coe, 2007), the HEATT effects may have been longer lasting leading up to the ∂13C spike. The main extinction event, however, should be rapid, coinciding with the transgression and the ∂13C spike. As predicted by the HEATT model, dinoflagellates are replaced by green algae (Tasmanites) at the boundary (Palliani et al., 2002). Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2005a) note that even though the dinoflagellates were outstripping green algae such as acritarchs and prasinophytes as primary producers in the late Pleinsbachian oxic seas, the green algae replaced the dinoflagellates when the latter disappeared at the euxinic extinction horizon (Table 1). The negative ∂15N spike at this same horizon (Fig. 6) occurs as expected. Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2005a) suggested that the redox changes were responsible for the plankton shifts. This is also consistent with a switch to ammonium-favored green algae. Toarcian euxinia (Jenkyns et al., 2007) reached the photic zone (Pancost et al., 2004; van Breugel et al., 2005) in accordance with HEATT model predictions."

    "heading": "6.3. Early–mid Cretaceous minor HEATTs",
    "text": "The Lower Cretaceous is marked by several probable lesser HEATT episodes. Each of these shows some HEATT characteristics, but the records of these are not as fully explored as many of the other HEATT intervals we identify. The lesser amount of study is likely because these episodes are associated only with minor extinctions.\nBoth the Aptian (OAE 1a) and Albian (OAE 1b) are well-known anoxic intervals (e.g. Jenkyns, 1980; Bralower et al., 1994; Jenkyns, 2003 and references therein). Photic-zone euxinia has been recognized as well (Heimhofer et al., 2008). The Valanginian has recently been suggested as another OAE (Erba et al., 2004).Warming is evident at least some of these (Jenkyns, 2003), and transgression is less well documented, but likely. The Aptian HEATT episode (Table 1) occurred during the first major phase of activity of the massive Ontong–Java oceanic LIP. The Albian was probably another minor HEATT episode. The Kerguelen LIP is a tempting trigger, although it seems to have initiated at 111 Ma, just after the Albian (112 Ma) OAE. It has been argued that plume and mid-ocean ridge activity was most intense during the early Cretaceous (e.g. Larson, 1991). Such volcanismmight have lowered the threshold needed to instigate a HEATT episode, so even relatively small LIPs might serve as HEATT triggers. The Albian warming appears to have left a record consistent with increased atmospheric heat transport. Ufnar et al. (2004) suggested from ∂18O values in sphaerosiderite samples that rainfall intensified at mid and high Albian latitudes while leaving a record of a moisture deficit at low paleolatitudes. The Valanginian OAE coincides with the Parana– Etendeka LIP (Fig. 1). Erba et al. (2004) suggested that the associated positive ∂13C excursion and black shale occurrences in the Pacific and the southern Alps marked a newly recognized OAE. However, they interpreted this interval as a cooling event based on oxygen isotope records and nannofossils.\nIn addition to being a likely HEATT episode, the Albian OAE is suggested to have recorded a significant long-term shift in primary productivity (Kuypers et al., 2001). The marine archaea that appear to increase in importance at this time may have bearing on ∂13C patterns for the Albian that is atypical for other HEATTs. Erbacher et al. (2001) noted aminor negative carbon excursion at the baseof theAlbianOAE in the western tropical Atlantic. After discounting productivity changes as a driver of this anomaly, they tentatively suggested a CO2 degassing mechanism for the small negative spike. Methane offers another possibility. Erbacher et al. (2001) noted a decrease in ∂18O (their Fig. 1) that coincideswith the brief decline in ∂13C. They argued that this change of roughly −3‰ ∂18O was not likely to be a result of warming, because thatwould require an increase in temperature of about 10 °C in a geologically rapid interval of time. We agree with Erbacher et al.\n(2001) in that the ∂18O shift need not have been entirely driven by temperature, but the negative ∂13C shift, supports HEATT initiation at the base of theOAE. Carbon isotopic values donot changemuch through the rest of the OAEwhere Erbacher et al. (2001) analyzed it. Kuypers et al. (2001) proposed that increases in ∂13C in bulk organic carbon may reflect a massive expansion of marine archaea in the Albian. It is becoming increasingly evident that archaea are no longer relegated to the extremophile niche (Herschberger et al., 1996). It may be that chemoautotrophic marine archaea are normally outcompeted by photoautotrophs in surface waters. The coincident collapse of many phytoplankton during a HEATT episode combined with bringing the chemocline into the photic zone during least 7 of the HEATT intervals (Table 1)may have allowed archaea to thrive on sulfur and/or ammonia and/or organic matter during the HEATT. Marine archaea do not isotopically discriminate in the type of carbon they use, and as a result, they can lead to positive ∂13C isotopic shifts. This may apply to other HEATTs that aremarkedbypositive ∂13C shifts such as theCenomanian– Turonian, Valanginian, and Devonian (Frasnian–Famennian). Archaea considerations aside, the positive ∂13C excursions may have a simpler explanation. The high productivity expected just prior to a HEATT climax, when abundant upwelled iron fuels intensive N fixation should generate a positive ∂13C excursion. Those few HEATTs marked by positive ∂13C excursions may simply not have fully developed into HEATT episodes, or may have done so only regionally."

    "heading": "6.4. Cenomanian–Turonian HEATT",
    "text": "The Cenomanian–Turonian oceanic anoxic event (OAE) has long been well known (e.g. Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976; Jenkyns, 1980; Arthur et al., 1987; Schlanger et al., 1987; Jenkyns et al., 2007). The widespread anoxia has been linked to transgression (e.g. Jenkyns, 1980; Arthur et al., 1987; Kerr, 1998; Jenkyns, 2003), and photic-zone euxina marks the interval (Kuypers et al., 2002; Pancost et al., 2004). The characteristic positive ∂13C spike (Arthur et al., 1987, 1988) at this horizon distinguishes this interval from many other HEATT horizons. However, there is a brief negative ∂13C excursion at the base of the Livello Bonarelli black shale in Italy (Jenkyns et al., 2007; Kuroda et al., 2007). Although this horizon has long been considered a thermal maximum (Jenkyns et al., 1994; Wilson and Norris, 2001; Norris et al., 2002), others have supported cooling as well (Arthur et al., 1988; Kuypers et al., 1999; Jenkyns, 2003). Recent work suggests that both occurred. Forster et al. (2007) found good agreement between TEX86 and ∂18O records suggesting that the most intense warming of tropical sea surface temperatures (to∼35°–36 °C) were achieved at the onset of the OAE, consistent with the HEATT model. Subsequent cooling within theOAEdropped the temperatureby∼4 °Cwithin theearly stagesof the OAE. Norris et al. (2002) suggested that the warming recorded in oxygen isotopes warranted the intensification of atmospheric heat transport, which is consistent with the HEATT model.\nKerr (1998) took an intuitive leap in proposing linkage between extensive ocean plateau volcanism and a number of aspects that are critical components of HEATT episodes at the Cenomanian–Turonian extinction horizon. He suggested that oceanic and atmospheric warming and widespread anoxia were a result of the eruptions, as was the transgression and the positive ∂13C anomaly. He argued that the warming was a result of CO2 release from the volcanism, and that other emissions would lead to acidic oceans and carbonate dissolution. Kerr (1998) was using an age of 90.4 Ma for the age of the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary, which was then consistent with the timing of activity at both the Caribbean–Columbian and the Ontong– Java LIPs with LIP eruptions at Madagascar and the Kerguelen Plateau occurring just a little later. The connections he suggested fell by the wayside to some extent when the accepted age for this boundary was pushed back to 93.5 Ma. Wignall (2001) and White and Saunders (2005) both noted this mismatch in timing, with the episodes at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary happening before the eruption ages.\nHowever, new work on the Ontong–Java Plateau suggested that its renewed pulse in activity began at 94 Ma (Fig. 1). Leapfrogging between dates of anoxia/extinction events and LIP activity may continue with further work, but the temporal connection between major volcanism and the Cenomanian/Turonian events presently appears robust. Furthermore, new results from the measurements of 187Os/188Os in black shale strongly suggest substantial magmatic activity (Turgeon and Creaser, 2008). These new results support the linkage between major oceanic magmatism and Cenomanian– Turonian boundary anoxia in a fashion consistent with the HEATT model. However, Kerr's (1998) suggestion that CO2 emissions alone drove thewarming is probably too optimistic. As we contend for other HEATTs, the initial LIP contributions were probably only sufficient to initiate warming rather than cause all of it. Switching on the haline mode was an important next step in delivering heat to polar regions. The recent estimate of the magnitude of the transgression at 22–28 m (Voigt et al., 2006) is comparable to the 20 m of thermal-expansiondriven components of sea-level rise calculated for the Permo-Triassic boundary transgression driven by haline-mode heating of the deep sea (Kidder and Worsley, 2004).\nThe predominant positive ∂13C anomaly suggests that methane may not have been a key factor in the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary warming. It also argues against luxury feeding. On the other hand, there are some interesting aspects to the nutrient and plankton dynamics that may have offset factors that would tend to produce a negative ∂13C excursion. Prauss (2007) noted that prasinophyte abundance dropped at the Toarcian transgressive horizon whereas prasinophytes actually become more abundant at the Cenomanian–Turonian maximum flooding surface, just above the positive ∂13C anomaly. Both the Toarcian and Cenomanian–Turonian anoxic horizons are marked by negative spikes in ∂15N (Fig. 6). The proposed expansion of marine archaea during Albian anoxia offers another possible explanation for the increase in ∂13C (Kuypers et al., 2001). If there were an increase in archaea at the Cenomanian– Turonian, it could perhaps have left a positive ∂13C signal despite negative influences such as luxury feeding or sea-floor methane. Cooling has been invoked as a result of the impressive carbon burial recorded at the Cenomanian–Turonian boundary (Arthur et al., 1988; Kuypers et al., 1999; Jenkyns, 2003; Forster et al., 2007). Although intensive carbon burial could have resulted in some cooling, we contend that cooling is inconsistent with the transgression that is clearly present and is within the range predicted for a thermal transgression cause. Another consideration is that cyanobacteria have been suggested as a strong influence on ∂13Corg in the Livello Bonarelli black shale (Kashiyama et al., 2008). If this cyanobacterial influence is strong enough, carbon burial might have been somewhat less important that much current thinking suggests. We suggest that the brief negative ∂13C shift at the base of the Bonarelli bed (Jenkyns et al., 2007; Kuroda et al., 2007) might signal quick onset of HEATT conditions. The subsequent and more conspicuous positive ∂13C excursion may simply represent intensive organic carbon burial and/ or increased cyanobacterial influence on productivity following rapid initiation of this HEATT episode."

    "text": "Since the initial proposal of Alvarez et al. (1980), extraterrestrial impact has become the most widely accepted cause for the terminal Cretaceous extinction (e.g. D'Hondt, 2005). However, the Deccan Traps LIP has also been proposed as the causal factor (Courtillot et al., 1986; Courtillot and Renne, 2003). These massive eruptions should have generated a HEATT episode comparable to others discussed herein. However, although some aspects of the latest Cretaceous are consistent with expected HEATT activity, other key factors are less evident than during other HEATTs. What we interpret as a weakly developed HEATT that started just before the end-Cretaceous impact\n(Chenet et al., 2008; Robinson et al., 2009) leaves an intriguing and complex record before, during, and after the extinction that ended the Mesozoic. A striking difference between the K–Pg extinction and extinctions during other HEATT episodes is that shallow-water organisms are much more affected at the K–Pg extinction relative to a greater emphasis on deeper-water taxa. The Cenomanian–Turonian is the next oldest horizon below the K–Pg, and this selective difference between these two Cretaceous extinctions is particularly evident (Kerr, 1998).\nTwo factors are consistent with a HEATT episode. The first is the presence of a minor transgression (Keller and Stinnesbeck, 1996; Adatte et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2003) that interrupts a long-term regressive pattern through the latest Cretaceous and follows a sharp Maastrichtian regressive episode (Haq et al., 1987). The second is a sharply negative ∂13C excursion that marks the K–Pg boundary (e.g. Zachos and Arthur, 1986), but this is only from the planktonic foraminiferal records (Zachos and Arthur, 1986). The deep-sea foraminifers are unaffected with respect to carbon isotopes. This sudden drop in ∂13C has been widely interpreted as a drop in productivity in the surface ocean (Zachos et al., 1989). Some workers have argued that this dramatic drop in productivity may have meant that there was a Strangelove (lifeless) ocean at this time (e.g. Hsu et al., 1982). However, Kump (1991) points out that because surface ocean productivity is a key driver of the ocean's carbon systematics, carbon isotopes in shallow and deep settings would quickly have been homogenized in a lifeless surface ocean. Because this did not occur, Kump (1991) argues that productivity would have continued on land and/or in the surface ocean at reduced rates. The calcareous nannoplankton and planktonic foraminifera underwent substantial extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. The preferential suffering of calcareous plankton at the K–Pg extinction is consistent with ocean acidification at that time (D'Hondt et al., 1994). However, the dinoflagellates weathered the extinction reasonably well, perhaps because of their ability to exist as cysts, enabling them to wait out a short-term crisis (Hallam andWignall, 1997; D'Hondt, 2005). Diatoms suffered only moderate extinctions (Hallam and Wignall, 1997).\nThe anoxia that marks other HEATT episodes discussed herein does not appear to be of much consequence at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Local examples do exist (e.g. Parra et al., 2003), but anoxia hardly seems to be a common theme at the boundary. Evidence for photic-zone euxinia that marks a number of other HEATT episodes is also absent. Despite a brief drop in ∂15N at the base of the Fish Clay (Sepúlveda et al., 2009), effects of reduced nitrogen influence appear minimal. The fact that thedinoflagellatesmade it through the extinction relatively unscathed rather than being displaced by primitive plankton such as prasinophytes that thrive on reduced nitrogen supports maintenance of an oxic ocean. “Red” algal offshoots such as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and coccoliths thrive in waters in which nitrate is the dominant form of usable nitrogen, so although productivity was interrupted or at least greatly reduced at the extinction, dinoflagellates, diatoms, and coccolithswere able touse nitrate during the recovery. The coccoliths, of course, were significantly reduced as noted earlier, but nutrient changes would not likely be that selective, particularly since coccoliths aremore adept at using reduced nitrogen than either diatoms or dinoflagellates (Litchman, 2007). The ocean acidification (D'Hondt et al., 1994) mentioned earlier explains this selective coccolith loss. Collectively, these factors suggest that the end-Cretaceous ocean remained oxygenated. This would argue that the thermal mode of ocean circulation remained strong enough to prevent development of a strong HEATT episode. The thermal mode would have to be relatively strong to retard the influence of massive greenhouse gas emissions expected from the Deccan Traps. Dominance by thermal-mode circulation also helps explain temperature changes recorded in the oceans.\nAttention with regard to warming climate at the end of the Cretaceous tends to focus on CO2 generated by impact in and presumed\nvaporization of the Yucatan carbonates at Chicxulub, whichwould have vaporized massive amounts of carbonate deposits. Leaf stomate data (Beerling et al., 2002) suggests that most of the atmospheric CO2 increase postdates the extinction. Some evidence supports warming across the boundary that coincideswith the transgression (e.g. Adatte et al., 2002). Other studies argue for a warming pulse some 300,000 years before the extinction followed by cooling across the boundary (Li and Keller, 1998; Keller et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2009). It makes more sense for a warming pulse to coincide with transgression as opposed to a regression. Furthermore, the short-term sea-level changes described by Miller et al. (2003) are reported to have been on the order of 20–30 m. This is a value of sea-level change consistent withwhat can be achieved by HEATT episodes. It is tempting to speculate that the transgression across the boundary was caused by thermal expansion of the oceans.\nIf the transgression was not generated by thermal expansion, the case for a HEATT episode at the end of the Cretaceous looks even weaker. However, Keller et al. (2009) noted that the planktonic foramifera found in the ∼1.5 m of strata they report between the Chicxulub impact layer and the terminal Cretaceous in Texas are dwarf species able to tolerate low-oxygen conditions. This could be a weak signal of dysoxic waters that developed in the post-impact ocean. Given the inability of the Deccan Traps warming to generate HEATT-driven anoxia, this dysoxic fauna might reflect the short-lived impact-generated warming followed by sinking of warm, oxygenpoor brines. Recent work, however, suggests that the Deccan Traps may not have erupted until about the time of the extinction (Chenet et al., 2008). That paleomagnetic work confines the eruptions to the upper part of the C29r magnetic chron and the overlying basal portion of the C29n chron. If this is so, the Deccan Traps could not have begun to initiate a HEATT episode until virtually the same time as the impact and extinction. Chenet et al. (2008) suggest that the Deccan Traps eruptions may have predated the impact slightly. Either way, this would represent an extremely unlikely and unique coincidence. Recent results from Robinson et al. (2009) suggest that the main (2nd) phase of the Deccan Traps eruptions predated the extinction horizon by about 200,000 to 300,000 years.Whatever the Deccan Trap eruptive timing turns out to be, this significant LIP triggered only a weak HEATT episode. This difficulty may well reflect the preceding long-term regression and possible presence of small polar ice caps in a cool Greenhouse climate that kept thermohaline circulation in a weak thermal mode. This precondition would have to be overcome before a HEATT episode could get underway.\nWe suggest that the impact instantaneously amplified a weak HEATT episode that was already in progress. The combined effect of CO2-based greenhouse warming by volcanism and impact generated a short-term CO2-driven thermal pulse that rapidly decayed. The sinking warm brines characteristic of other HEATTs did not develop beyond the ability to generate only minor dysoxia and no deep-ocean warming. Given that this particular HEATT was a weak one, it alone might not have been as devastating to life as many of the other ones that were accompanied by anoxia. The occurrence of a large impact during a weak HEATT episode may well have been a unique event in Phanerozoic history given that HEATT episodes represent less than 4% of the Phanerozoic record and that other large impacts did not cause major extinction."

    "text": "Multiple Cambrian HEATT episodes are suggested by Fig. 1 and other factors. The Botomian episodes are best supported by the factors in Table 1. HEATT conditionsmay have been operating just prior to the Cambrian (Fig. 1; Table 1) in association with the demise of the Ediacaran Fauna. The upper Cambrian SPICE (Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion) has several attributes of a HEATT episode\nsuch as low 87Sr/86Sr (LIP-driven?) and intensified carbon burial (Saltzman et al., 1995; Saltzman et al., 2000a). However, despite an early suggestion of a transgression (Saltzman et al., 1995), the prevailing view now favors a HEATT-incompatible regression at this horizon instead (Saltzman et al., 2004). Also, the SPICE event is marked by a strongly positive ∂13C excursion (Saltzman et al., 1995; Saltzman et al., 2000a; Saltzman et al., 2004). Haq and Schutter (2008) noted a high-frequency (Milankovitch) sea-level oscillation interval bracketing the SPICE excursion that adds further complication. Although the positive ∂13C shift does not disqualify the SPICE as a HEATT episode, it does require explanation. The fundamental Mesozoic shift in marine archaea and its implications for positive ∂13C shifts (Kuypers et al., 2001) cannot be used for Paleozoic HEATT episodes. The possibility of sustaining near-HEATT conditions that favor intense productivity of green algae (Fig. 5) could explain the positive carbon isotopic shift, but if regression rather than transgression characterizes the SPICE interval, the case for a HEATT event remains weak. The Cambro-Ordovician boundary shows some features consistent with a HEATT episode (Fig. 1), but, like the late Precambrian and SPICE possibilities, we have not yet delved deeply into this horizon.\nThe stratigraphically distinct, but poorly radiometrically dated midBotomian displays many earmarks of a sharply focused HEATT episode (Fig. 1). This HEATT interval is a fairly straightforward fit to the model for a rapid shift from Greenhouse to Hothouse conditions. The cause of the extinction has been linked to anoxia at this time (Zhuravlev and Wood, 1996). Anoxia is expected for aHothouse climate (Fig. 1; Table 1). Isotopic anomalies that characterize this interval include a sharply negative pre-SPICE ∂13C spike (Brasier et al., 1994; Saltzman et al., 2000a) and a strongly positive shift in ∂34S (Hough et al., 2006). Although direct evidence for euxinia has yet to emerge, the strong sulfur isotopic shift suggests that euxinic conditions probably existed. The north Australian flood basalts of the Kalkarindji LIP (Glass and Phillips, 2006)were the likely trigger of this HEATT episode, but age datingmust be refined for acceptance of a Kalkarindji trigger for the mid-Botomian HEATT episode. The extensive anoxia has been linked by Zhuravlev and Wood (1996) with a transgression (Rowland and Gangloff, 1988) that probably marked the HEATT climax.\nThis selective Botomian extinction has been called the Sinsk event by Zhuravlev and Wood (1996). The “Tommotian fauna” was sharply curtailed, and both trilobites and archaeocyathans were reduced to a lesser extent. Echinoderms and lingulid brachiopods, by contrast, passed through this event relatively unscathed. Fleshy chlorophytic green algae were abundant on both the Siberian and Yangtze platforms (Zhuravlev and Wood, 1996).\nAlthough available data on the Botomian are consistent with the HEATT model, this interval is not without its complications. Age relationships are somewhat loosely constrained. Recently obtained ages on the Kalkarindji basalts of 508 Ma and 505 Ma appear too young for LIP triggering of a HEATT at the 510 Ma horizon at which the sulfur isotope anomaly and extinction occur. Other dates of 510 Ma for the Antrim province of the Kalkarindji LIP (e.g. Bultitude, 1976) favor a closer match. There is enough general agreement in timing to hope for resolution of the age issues asmore age date relationships are collected. A minor paradox has to do with archaeocyathans. Although archaeocyathans suffered minor extinctions during the Botomian Sinsk event, they underwent amuchmore substantial extinction during the subsequent Hawke Bay event in the Toyonian (Rowland and Shapiro, 2002). The Hawke Bay event is closely associated with a regression (Hallam andWignall, 1997), and it is bracketed by a series of high-frequency sea-level oscillations at Milankovitch scale (Haq and Schutter, 2008). Loss of ecosystem space may have been a key factor in the sharp reduction in archaeocyathan diversity at this extinction horizon. As noted earlier, it is our expectation that coral reefs can potentially serve as a “coal-mine canary” as HEATT episodes develop. The sponge-like archaeocyathans (Rowland, 2001) did not conform to\nthat expectation. That they suffered only minimally during the HEATT episode suggests thatmanyof the ill effects generatedduring theHEATT episodemay have been stresses towhich theywere readily adaptable. A third inconsistency with regard to the Botomian is that the HEATT episodehas been suggested tohave beenphosphate rich (Zhuravlev and Wood, 1996). Younger HEATT episodes are consistent with model predictions in that they tend to be associatedwithminima or even gaps in phosphorite deposition such as the conspicuous one in the early Triassic (Trappe, 1998). If iron-limitation and increased importance of ammonium as leading fertilizers of marine productivity developed, as seems common onmost HEATT episodes, phosphorus should have been present in excess relative to normal nutrient requirements. The stratigraphy on the Siberian Platform suggests that although the Botomian sections there are generally phosphate rich, the phosphatic horizons noted by Shergold and Brasier (1986) occur at horizons two zones above and three zones below the negative ∂13C excursion (Brasier et al., 1994) that marks the HEATT. So, even in the P-rich Cambrian ocean, there may have been phosphorite gaps at HEATT horizons. We predict this relationship to hold in other phosphate-rich Cambrian sections that preserve the Sinsk event and at the other potential Cambrian HEATTs should they turn out to be Hothouses."

    "heading": "7.2. Ordovician and Devonian glacial interruptions",
    "text": "The obvious concern with the suggestion of HEATT episodes in both the late Ordovician and late Devonian is the brief glaciations at each interval. We have already suggested that LIPs will be most effective in stimulating HEATT episodes when competing factors are minimized. For example, themajor glaciations of the Cenozoic and the Carboniferous–early Permian are Icehouses that were probably stimulated and sustained by silicate weathering and carbon burial during significant continental-collisions such as that of India and Asia in the Cenozoic and the collision of Gondwanaland and Laurasia in the Carboniferous.We speculate that the relativelyminor orogenies of the Devonian and late Ordovician (e.g. Murphy et al., 2009) were not potent enough to stimulate glaciations. Rather than causing glaciations such as has been proposed for the Taconic orogeny (Kump et al., 1999) and the Antler orogeny (Saltzman et al., 2000b), the silicate weathering of these small mountain belts may merely have exerted a cooling influence. If small orogenic events can generate glaciation, there should be more glaciations in the geologic record.\nInnovations in terrestrial vegetation can potentially stimulate glaciation. Algeo and Scheckler (1998) invoked plant-driven glacial stimulation in the late Devonian. The increase in depth of rooting as trees originated and radiated in the Givetian would have deepened the zone of silicate weathering (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998). Additionally, the Famennian rise and expansion of seeds would allow plant life to reproduce in areas other than the wet, lowland settings required by seedless plants into upland areas where protective seed coatings allowed reproductive materials to persist in drier regions until moisture became available (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998). This increase in vegetated land area coupledwith the increased depth of weathering in soils may well have been the key to stimulating the late Devonian glaciation. Carbon burial in marine black shales and in limited late Devonian coals would also have been important (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998). We suggest that these plant innovations were sufficient to stifle HEATT-favoring conditions because of the cooling and the expected oxygenation of the oceans with the strengthening of the thermal mode of deep-ocean circulation (Fig. 2).\nWe speculate that the increase in plant biomass would have further contributed to cooling by fertilizing the oceans with nitrate and phosphate, stimulating productivity and carbon burial (Fig. 7). Plants would draw these nutrients from soils, but then those nutrients would be released during plant decay. Some of those nutrients would be recycled into new plant life, but some would escape to the oceans\nvia rivers. Additionally, plant material carried by rivers would deliver nutrients to the oceans (e.g. Berner and Rao, 1994).\nA speculative case for vegetation-stimulated glaciation can also be made for the late Ordovician. It is increasingly apparent that primitive vegetation such as liverworts and/or fungi had begun to populate late Ordovician terrestrial landscapes (Gensel, 2008). The spread of such vegetation across the landscapewould have increased levels of silicate weathering, though not to the degree achieved by trees and seed plants in the late Devonian. Furthermore, terrestrial carbon burial in coal was nonexistent in the late Ordovician. Some carbonwould likely be stored in newly developing soils, but probably most important would be ocean fertilization from runoff laden with nutrients extracted from rock and primitive soils by these liverworts and/or fungi (Fig. 7).\nVegetation-driven glacial pulses would probably develop rapidly, and would be likely to be short lived. We speculate that the initiation of such a glaciation would be due to a new style of carbon burial that would be substantial enough to cool the planet until carbon consumers adapted or evolved to recycle much of that carbon."

    "heading": "7.3. Ordovician HEATT",
    "text": "The prescient suggestion by Railsback et al. (1990) that the Caradocian ocean was characterized by evaporation-driven warm waters that sank at low-to-mid latitudes and flowed poleward at depth is characteristic of a HEATT episode. The Caradocian is well known as a warm interval marked by a significant transgression in the middle (Barnes et al., 1996) and several other smaller transgressive events (Qing et al., 1998; Haq and Schutter, 2008). However, the late Ordovician glaciation interrupts that warmth (Brenchley et al., 1994; Marshall et al., 1997), and the first pulse of the two-phase extinction coincides with onset of this brief Icehouse climate (Sheehan, 2001). The second pulse of the extinction takes place during the warming at the end of the glaciation (Sheehan, 2001). Although it seems logical to expect that this warmingmay simply have been post-glacial warming, it is also worth considering that the glaciation is a brief interruption of a developing HEATT episode that peaked after the ice melted.\nThe lack of a known late Ordovician LIP weakens the case for a HEATT episode. However, the well-known Caradocian volcanism (e.g. Huff et al., 1992; Barnes et al., 1996) coupled with the sharp drop in 87Sr/86Sr throughout the Caradocian (Qing et al., 1998) is consistent with themajor volcanism needed to generate a late Ordovician HEATT episode having been an oceanic LIP. The sharp pulse in ophiolite abundance in the late Ordovician (Vaughan and Scarrow, 2003) is also consistent with the suggestion of a significant oceanic LIP (Dilek and Ernst, 2008).\nModel results based on a new carbon-associated sulfur (CAS)based ∂34S curve for the Phanerozoic show a pattern of bacterial sulfate reduction that increases in a series of pulses through the late Ordovician (Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). The Kampschulte and Strauss (2004) curve appears to be plotted on a less-than-current time scale, and some short-term events are smeared. Nevertheless, the patterns are intriguing. Bacterial sulfate reduction peaked in the late Caradoc, andwas sharply curtailedwhen the glaciation began.We speculate that these bacterial sulfate reduction pulses correspond to the transgressive events that mark the late Ordovician (e.g. Qing et al., 1998; Haq and Schutter, 2008). Such transgressive pulses would have spread anoxic and/or euxinic waters. The last such pre-glacial pulse was probably the Boda global warming event that is marked by transgressive graptolitic black shale (Fortey and Cocks, 2005). Pyrite framboids and/or isorenieratene characterize the post-glacial black shales of the basal Silurian of Jordan (Armstrong et al., 2009). Although extinction does not appear to have been linkedwith the preglacial transgressive pulses, we interpret the post-glacial transgression as the culmination of the HEATT episode. The immediacy of the appearance of post-glacial euxina (Armstrong et al., 2009) supports\nthe idea of rapid onset of HEATT conditions. The HEATT component of thermal expansion would be masked by the volume of melted ice. We suggest that rapid development of Hothouse conditions is a more likely driver of extinction than transgression driven simply by glacial melting. A melt-only-driven transgression would expand shelf ecosystem space and be more likely affiliated with a radiation than with extinction, particularly in the tropics. Transgression accompanied by euxinia in a HEATT event is likely to have been deadly to life.\nThe selectivity of the late Ordovician two-phase extinction shows aspects that are consistent with an interrupted HEATT episode. However, in a warmworld such as the pre-glacial late Ordovician, it is not surprising that the abrupt onset of a short enigmatic glaciation caused the first wave of late Ordovician extinctions. Graptolites, trilobites, brachiopods, bryozoans, and echinoderms, for example, suffered from either cold and/or regression-induced loss of habitat (see Hallam and Wignall, 1997).\nAlthough the rugose corals suffered reductions at both the onset and termination of the glaciation, the tabulate coral-stromatoporoid reefs were only minimally affected as the glaciation got underway. However, this tabulate-stromatoporoid ecosystem was decimated during the warmup, and a pronounced gap followed that lasted about halfway through the Llandoverian (Hallam and Wignall, 1997; Berry et al., 2002; Veron, 2008). The sponge-affinities of the stromatoporoids mean that these taxa may not have been directly affected by the warming, but the demise of the probably-more-sensitive corals led to stromatoporoid extinction because of their close ecosystem ties with the tabulates. The delayed recovery of the tabulates may well have been what allowed the rugosans to replace tabulates as the dominant corals following the end of the Ordovician.\nIf the warmup were a mere recovery from glaciation, it would be expected that tropical tabulates might adapt as readily to the end of glaciation as they did to its beginning. However, that they survived the cooling and were then devastated during the warming suggests that warming and related factors were the consummate causes of their demise. Tabulates in the tropics would be expected to survive glaciation given theminimal cooling there. Although habitat loss from sea-level fall must have occurred, these effects appear minor with respect to the overall tabulate survival.\nAcritarchs underwent extinctions during the onset of glaciation (Hallam and Wignall, 1997). A likely cause for this diversity drop is because of a surge in nitrate production as glacially oxygenated oceans favored oxidized nitrogen (nitrate), to which these microbes were not well adapted. During HEATT episodes, primitive plankton such as green algae (e.g. prasinophytes) thrive. The same goes for the acritarchs. Green algae are not very productive when nitrate is their nutrient source (Litchman, 2007). The same probably goes for the acritarchs. We predict that a late Ordovician acritarch gap is the likely result of a spike in oceanic nitrate abundance during the glaciationdriven ocean ventilation. Recent ∂15N results (LaPorte et al., 2009) support this prediction (Table 1; Fig. 6). Most ∂15N values in the Nevada sections studied by LaPorte et al. (2009) are below 2‰. Their Vinni Creek section is marked by a positive ∂15N spike that is consistent with the onset of glaciation."

    "text": "The mid–late Devonian is marked by multiple transgressive– regressive pulses (Johnson et al., 1985; Sandberg et al., 2002).Warming\n(Thompson and Newton, 1988; Joachimski et al., 2009), Famennian glaciation (Caputo and Crowell, 1985), widespread anoxia (Buggisch, 1991; Joachimski and Buggisch, 1993; Murphy et al., 2000), positive ∂13C excursions (Joachimski et al., 2002), and a negative ∂15N at the Frasnian–Fammenian boundary (Levman and von Bitter, 2002) also characterize this complex interval. The transgressions have been linked with anoxia (e.g. Bond andWignall, 2005; Bond andWignall, 2008). The mid–late Devonian extinction pulses (see McGhee, 1996 review) have been attributed to a range of causes including anoxia (Bond et al., 2004; Bond and Wignall, 2005; Bond and Wignall, 2008), warming (Thompson and Newton, 1988; Hillbun et al., 2008) and cooling in the Famennian (Copper, 1986; Joachimski and Buggisch, 2002).\nWe interpret the series of transgressions that Johnson et al. (1985) identified through the middle and late Devonian as the result of conditions that reflect nascent HEATT conditions and finally become a HEATT episode at the Frasnian–Famennian boundary. The Frasnian– Famennian boundary has recently been reinterpreted as coincident with a widespread anoxic transgressive pulse (Bond and Wignall, 2008), and negative ∂13C excursion mark this horizon in Iran, south China, and the Urals (Gharaie et al., 2007).\nDirect evidence for a LIP trigger for late Devonian HEATT activity is tenuous. Famennian age dates on the East European Craton LIP (Fig. 1) indicate that this volcanism was too little and too late to stimulate thermal-expansion-driven transgressive pulses. However, the 365 Ma LIP age dates may be recording only late-stage activity such as feeder dikes. Additionally, the sharp and strongly negative 87Sr/86Sr excursion (van Geldern et al., 2006; John, et al., 2008) is consistent with strong basaltic volcanism through the Givetian and Frasnian.\nPositive ∂13C anomalies are common in the late Devonian (e.g. Joachimski and Buggisch, 2002). Like the Cenomanian–Turonian and earlier Cretaceous positive ∂13C anomalies, the late Devonian positive excursions are consistent with high oceanic productivity. The negative excursion in ∂15N at the Frasnian/Famennian boundary black shale in western Canada as well as at the next two succeeding Famennian black shales (Levman and Von Bitter, 2002) is expected under HEATT conditions.\nGoddéris and Joachimski (2004) modeled late Devonian positive ∂13C shifts. To account for a +3‰ excursion, they suggested that weathering of carbonates could account for +0.7‰, and that another +1.0‰ could be generated by the rise of arborescence that began in the Givetian (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998). The additional phosphorus input to the oceans that Goddéris and Joachimski (2004) call upon to stimulate enough carbon burial tomake up the remaining+1.3‰ is not consistent with the HEATT model. Their model requires a 40% increase in delivery of continental phosphorus to the oceans to generate the needed carbon burial.\nMurphy et al. (2000) looked to deeper waters for nutrient supplies to stimulate oceanic productivity. They suggested that seasonal overturn could bring up regenerated N and P to sustain high productivity during deposition of late Devonian black shales. The C: N:P ratios reported by Murphy et al. (2000) suggest that nitrogen abundance jumped substantially in each black shale. That productivity and nitrogen appear to be rising in lock step is consistent with our prediction and that of Saltzman (2005) that phosphorus is not limiting during Devonian warmth.\nWe suggest alternative solutions to the positive ∂13C excursions and underlying high productivity in the black shales. First, the HEATT model predicts that because phosphorus is not the limiting nutrient, phosphorus will be in excess relative to Icehouses (see Saltzman, 2005) when it is limiting. Iron will be the limiting nutrient in oceans during HEATT episodes because the reduced winds will not deliver sufficient iron dust to most oceanic areas to feed the diazotrophic bacteria that produce ammonium. Delivery of nutrients from beneath the photic zone by major cyclonic storm activity presents an alternative to the seasonal overturn events proposed by Murphy et al. (2000). As outlined in the model section earlier in this paper, these\nstorms will reach far deeper than modern cyclonic storms. Storms might approach a wave-base depth of 400 m based on assumptions of deep-water temperatures N20 °C (Korty et al., 2008). With reduced planetary windbelt velocities leading to reductions in coastal upwelling, these storms may well have been the dominant supplier of nutrients from deep water. Ammonium and reduced iron would be delivered from deeper waters. This mechanism would be most effective just before and just after the HEATT peak (Fig. 5). During the deadly HEATT climax, poisonous euxinic waters would be mined by the large cyclones.\nDevonian planktonic productivity may have benefitted from one other factor. Schwark and Empt (2006) noted a brief late Devonian change from relatively primitive C29-sterane producing algae to modern-like C28-sterane producing algae. After the Devonian, that short-lived pulse reverted to more primitive steranes (C29) until the Triassic when advanced levels return during the dinoflagellate radiation. The upward shift in C28/C29 ratio continued later with the rise of other plankton with red-algal ancestry such as coccoliths, silicoflagellates, and diatoms (Schwark and Empt, 2006). We suggest that the temporary shift to more evolutionary advanced biomarker values may reflect superior productivity, probably by prasinophytes, which tend to be enriched in C28 steroid biomarkers. Pronounced spikes in C28/C29 ratio mark four key anoxic horizons (Upper Kacak; both Kellwasser horizons; Hangenberg) in the mid–late Devonian (Schwark and Empt, 2006), supporting this contention. Ammonium was probably the dominant nutrient under the conditions of the HEATT model, and this is supported by the negative ∂15N spike (Fig. 6). Prasinophytes are particularly effective at using ammonium, as discussed earlier (and see Litchman, 2007). They were able to flourish most effectively under these conditions, probably at the expense of the acritarchs. The acritarchs probably also “preferred” ammonium, but for some reason not yet known, the prasinophytes were able to succeed most effectively. The acritarchs declined markedly after the Devonian (Downie, 1984; Strother, 1996).\nGiven a number of similarities between the Ordovician and Devonian HEATT intervals, it is worth noting that the sterane biomarkers show a sharp increase in C28/C29 ratio at the upper extinction horizon in the late Hirnantian (Schwark and Empt, 2006). This coincides with the warming, transgression, and tabulate coral extinction discussed earlier that we interpret as a rapid return to the Hothouse that had been briefly interrupted by glaciation.\nCopper (2002) reported Devonian coral extinctions that preceded the Frasnian–Famennian (F/F) extinction. He noted the loss of eight tabulate families and twelve rugose families by the end of the Givetian, whereas only one tabulate family and six rugose families went extinct at the F/F boundary. The extinction pulses in the stepwise departure of the coral-based ecosystem do not correlate with anoxic late Devonian episodes (Copper, 2002). Although it is tempting to suggest that these sensitive taxa may have succumbed to intense warmth and/or hypercapnia and/or ocean acidification as HEATT conditions were developing, the Devonian coral extinctions coincide with regression (Copper, 2002; Gharaie et al., 2007)."

    "text": "The end-Guadalupian extinction tempts consideration as a HEATT event because it is associated with the Emeishan LIP (Fig. 1). It has been considered as the first pulse in a 2-phase extinction in the Permian that was followed by the end-Permian extinction (Stanley and Yang 1994). This extinction affected biotas in both terrestrial and marine settings (Stanley and Yang 1994; Retallack et al., 2006; Groves et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2008). However, the marine extinction in Sichuan, China is selective in that it mainly affected fusilinaceans and perhaps calcareous algae. Hallam andWignall (1997) synthesized the diversity contractions at the end of the Maokouan (= end of middle Permian = end Guadalupian). They noted abrupt extinctions among\nammonoids, rugose corals, complex foraminiferans, and articulate brachiopods. They also showed diversity declines in bryozoans and crinioids that continued further into the overlying Wujiapingian. Retallack et al. (2006) called attention to a marine transgression in southeastern Australia and Arctic Canada. They also recognized a −4‰ excursion in ∂13C, suggesting methane release as the driver of excursion, and calling for intense global warming as a result of that greenhouse gas emission that was emitted when the Emeishan LIP intruded coal measures. The Emeishan is a small LIP (Fig. 1), and it is not entirely certain that it precedes the extinction. However, recent work by Ganino and Arndt (2009) shows that considerable degassing of carbonate and sulfate strata resulted from contact with the relatively small Emeishan LIP. Wignall et al. (2009a) showed that extinctions of fusulinid foraminifers and calcareous algae coincided with the Emeishan LIP eruptions, but preceded the negative ∂13C excursion. Wignall et al. (2009b) pointed out that transgression and the spread of dysoxic waters also followed the foraminiferan extinction. This supports our earlier suggestion that sensitive organisms like foraminiferans may suffer extinction prior to HEATT climax. Furthermore, seed ferns record stomatal evidence of high atmospheric CO2 (Retallack, 2002), consistent with global warmth. Detrimental to HEATT considerations, however, are the lack of widespread anoxia in shallow-marine facies and the prevailing view that sea level fell at the end of the Guadalupian (e.g. Haq and Schutter, 2008; Lai et al., 2008). Our evaluation of the Guadalupian as a possible HEATT event is inconclusive and, in many respects, comparable to the similarly enigmatic Upper Cambrian SPICE event. Finally, a reassessment of the late Permian paleontological data base (Clapham et al., 2009) suggests that a prolonged gradual decline in diversity characterized the Permian from the Wordian up to the end-Permian extinction event, and that there was no distinct mass extinction event in the Guadalupian."

    "heading": "8.1. Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)",
    "text": "The PETM was a severe, but short-lived global warming event marked by only minimal extinctions (Fig. 1). The PETM was first recognized on the basis of the formation of warm, deep water and the possible link between that deep-water warming and the extinction of deep-water foraminifera (Kennett and Stott, 1991). The intense, rapid rise in global average temperature of 5 °C in less than 10,000 years (Zachos et al., 2008) illustrates just how rapidly a HEATT episode can be initiated. The increase in tropical sea surface temperatures of 5 °C in the tropics and 6 °C in the Arctic (see Storey et al., 2007) is consistent with those modeled for the much longer lasting terminal Permian HEATT (Kidder and Worsley, 2004). The doubling of Arctic humidity in the Eocene (Jahren and Sternberg, 2003) is also comparable with end-Permian conditions (Kidder and Worsley, 2004), and increased poleward latent heat transport for the PETM (Ludvigson et al., 2008) is also consistent with HEATT predictions. The ocean acidification (Zachos et al., 2005) and the linkage of sinking, warm, dysoxic waters to the deep ocean to extinction of 30–50% of the benthic Paleocene foram species (Thomas, 2007) are consistent with the HEATT model, although anoxia and euxinia appear not to have fully developed during the PETM. The rapid reversal in deep-ocean circulation and its linkage to increased warming of deep-sea waters (Bice and Marotzke, 2002; Nunes and Norris, 2006) attests to the rapidity of involvement in thermohaline circulation in rapid climate changes, although the style of circulation they model differs from that proposed herein.\nThe increasing likelihood that the release of ocean methane may not be the primary driver of warming at the PETM supports inclusion of the PETM within the family of HEATT episodes. Recent work suggests that althoughmethanemaywell have produced the negative\n∂13C spike, there was not enough sea-floor dissolution of calcium carbonate to compensate for the 2000 Gt of methane commonly invoked for explaining the magnitude of the ∂13C spike (Panchuk et al., 2008). Furthermore, there does not seem to have been enough methane to cause the deep-seawarming. Tripati and Elderfield (2005) suggest that the 2000 Gt could have generated only about 1 °C in deep sea warming as opposed to the 4°–5 °C increase that has been recognized. In addition, the ∂13C spike appears to have come some 3000 years after the main LIP heating (Sluijs et al., 2007). Zachos (2008) recently proposed a new methane emission scenario to better explain these new developments. He called for two pulses of methane emission, with the first being 3000 Gt and the second 1400 Gt. If the larger of the two suggested methane pulses came first though, a negative ∂13C spike would be expected to have occurred in association with that earlier negative spike. If the initial warming was not methane driven, the single, later negative carbon isotopic spikemakes more sense. The 3000-year delay is enough time for sinking warm brines to make one pass through the deep ocean, but that brief window was too short for such brines to have heated the deep ocean. Nevertheless, methane remains the most likely explanation for the negative ∂13C spike at the PETM.\nRecent results suggest a chronology of steps for the PETM that are consistent with the HEATT model. These include: 1) LIP injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as the North Atlantic Volcanic Province (NAVP) became active (Fig. 1). Svensen et al. (2004) and Storey et al. (2007) both suggested that the NAVP intruded through methane-rich ocean sediments, perhaps increasing the potency of this LIP relative to older examples that may have mainly emitted only carbon dioxide. This explains the likely source of the first methane pulse called for by Zachos (2008), but does not explain why there is only one negative ∂13C spike. 2) The mid-latitude heating with temperature increases of up to 8 °C in shallow water (Zachos et al., 2006) would be a next step predicted by the HEATT model (Figs. 2, 3), but it is not clear if this heating followed the LIP. 3) The warm, deepwater formation was documented long ago as mentioned above (Kennett and Stott, 1991) as was 4) the extinction of deep-water forams (Kennett and Stott, 1991). The timing of 5) the transgression is predicted herein to have coincided with the formation of deep warm water.\nThe transgression (Speijer and Wagner, 2002) is not yet established as a global event. It is present at southern Tethyan margin sections in Egypt and Israel as well as on the northern Tethyanmargin and New Jersey, USA. Speijer and Wagner (2002) suggest that this transgression may have been a eustatic event. They also note its association with dysoxia and, in places, anoxia. Speijer and Wagner (2002) suggest that the transgression was on the order of 20 m. They propose that the temperature changeswere responsible for 8 mworth of that transgression by thermal expansion of ocean water. The absence of radiolaria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates at this horizon prompted Speijer andWagner (2002) to suggest decreased upwelling strength. Such a decrease is consistent with the predicted weakening of wind, lessened iron dust input to oceans and increased iron limitation.\nAnoxia does not seem to have developed as fully at the PETM as in other HEATT episodes (Table 1). Anoxia has not been reported in deep waters at the PETM (Zachos et al., 2008). Accordingly, we would not expect any euxinia and so would not expect major extinctions either. Deep-water forams do appear to have suffered from oxygen deficiency though (Tripati and Elderfield, 2005). We are aware of no reports of anomalous ∂34S or ∂15N. Neither do we know of the presence of sterane biomarkers or prasinophyte-rich horizons.\nThe PETM was a more rapid and less devastating HEATT episode than the others proposed herein. Anoxia did not develop as fully, and extinction was not nearly as drastic as at other HEATT horizons, possibly due to the very short duration of the overall episode, which was probably 170,000 years or less (Zachos et al., 2008) and lack of\neuxinia. The short duration of the HEATT episode could be due to short-lived LIP activity or perhaps weak LIP activity that was intensified by the NAVP intruding through methane-rich sediments, leading to a brief, but methane-amplified HEATT episode. The strong possibility that many other PETM-like events exist in the Paleozoic geologic record will be challenging to recognize without the benefit of the deep-sea record of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic."

    "heading": "9. Conclusions",
    "text": "The HEATT model offers a systemic explanation of the feedbacks that result from the volcanic outpourings associated with major Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). HEATT episodes are much more likely, and have only been recognized, when LIPs erupt amid the precondition of a Greenhouse climate when silicate weathering is minimal. The Icehouse climate precondition of vigorous, thermal-mode ocean circulation (Zhang et al., 2001) retards HEATT episode development. Active continental collisional orogenies compete with LIPs by favoring glaciation or at least thermal-mode circulation. Under Greenhouse preconditions, emission of greenhouse gases from these LIPs only begins planetary warming. That warming melts polar ice (if present), and latitudinal expansion of warmth and dryness leads to brine formation in evaporative basins connected to the world ocean. These sinking brines deliver heat and sulfate to deep waters. The sinking, warm, oxygen-poor brine (e.g. Brass et al., 1982) becomes the dominant driver of haline-mode ocean circulation (Zhang et al., 2001). This style of circulation is sustainable only as long as the LIP CO2 production remains voluminous. Expansion of anoxia at depth is a conspicuous result of oceans in which minimal oxygen is delivered to the deep sea. Warm brines deliver heat to high latitudes. That warm water rises until obstructed by a strong halocline that developed as high-latitude climates became warm and wet enough to sustain forests (e.g. Taylor and Ryberg, 2007).\nNumerous positive feedbacks intensify the conditions that lead to and characterize the Hothouse planetary climate state. Reduced poleequator thermal gradients sharply lower planetarywindbelt velocities progressing from Icehouse to Greenhouse to Hothouse planetary states. Wind shear drops as a function of the square of velocity, and wind erosive power falls as the cube of wind velocity. Surface ocean currents weaken as wind strength fades, so delivery of heat to high latitudes by those currents and winds diminishes. The atmosphere's role in poleward heat transport will increase in two ways. First, latent heat transport will increase with increased evaporation in warmer tropics. The increased moisture in polar regions will result in moist climates, and polar clouds will trap heat at those latitudes, minimizing its escape to space. Second, cyclonic storms will play an increasingly important heat-transport role in Greenhouse and Hothouse climates (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Korty et al., 2008). Weakened winds and warming oceans allow tropical cyclonic storms to form more readily. In Hothouses, cyclones are larger, more frequent, and longer lasting than in Icehouses or Greenhouses. Because deep waters will have warmed in the Hothouse, such cyclones no longer draw up cool water to limit tropical warming as they do today. Instead, they tap warm water so as to become even stronger and reach even deeper. Cyclonic storms escape the tropics in Hothouse climates. At high latitudes, intense cyclonic storms will mine heat from rising warm waters beneath the halocline, further weakening pole-equator thermal gradients and intensifying warming. Expansion of warm waters to high latitudes, helped in part by the storms themselves and also by geothermal heating will enable cyclones to travel to high latitudes. These slow-moving heat engines will be stopped only where they lose moisture by drifting over large landmasses.\nWith the loss of wind-driven upwelling, the cyclonic storms become the chief mechanism for bringing nutrients from deep to shallow waters. The exponentially diminished erosive power of the wind will deliver minimal dust to the oceans, resulting in severe iron\nlimitation and hence, nitrogen limitation. During the initial onset of a Hothouse, bioavailable nitrogen will occur as reduced forms such as ammonium. The minimal nutrient recycling in the Hothouse requires intensive nitrogen fixation where levels of iron and molybdenumwill permit it. The dominance of usable nutrients by freshly fixed nitrogen will drive down ∂15N values. With iron, molybdenum, and nitrogen serving as the chief limitation on nutrients, phosphorus will be in excess, leading to gaps in phosphate deposition or even primary precipitation. Primary producers will adjust to these shifts in nutrient cycling with profound results. “Red” algal forms such as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and coccoliths will have difficulty because the nitrate that normally gives them an advantage over more primitive “green” algal plankton will diminish. The “green” algal plankton, which are not well adapted to using nitrate, will thrive on reduced nitrogen species such as ammonium that they are more efficient at using than their “red” algal cousins. Preliminary results in sterane biomarker analysis confirm this conclusion.\nAs the oceanwarms, thermal expansionwill drive a transgression of about 10–30 m, depending on the conditions in a given HEATT episode. If methane hydrates are released from sea-floor sediments by the warming they will further intensify heating and will contribute to a negative ∂13C anomaly. At some HEATTs, the negative anomaly is offset enough by other factors to generate a positive ∂13C excursion. We suggest that methane may be a less important factor than is often suggested in the literature. Most or all of the warming can be achieved without the methane because the CO2 sets up the ocean–atmosphere feedbacks discussed above that are probably greater than the methane effect. The negative ∂13C anomalies commonly attributed to methane can be explained by productivity loss (Broecker and Peacock, 1999) and by shifts to light carbon isotopes as luxury feeding is driven by increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. For each doubling of atmospheric CO2, ∂13C can drop by 1‰ (e.g. Galimov (1985)). The several doublings suggested by Kidder and Worsley (2004) can easily account for the negative ∂13C spike at the Permo-Triassic boundary. The intensification of Hothouse conditions such as heat, anoxia, euxinia, shifts in nutrient cycling, ocean acidification, and hypercapnia probably caused mass extinction at least ten times during the Phanerozoic.\nFig. 1 illustrates 21 Phanerozoic extinction horizons. The late Edicaran extinction is not shown on that figure, and only one extinction appears where two exist in the late Ordovician. Of those 23 extinctions, 4 are attributable to regression/cooling, and 3 others are problematic. We interpret the remaining 16 as HEATT episodes (Fig. 1; Table 1). We recognize well-defined HEATT episodes during the Cenomanian– Turonian, Toarcian, end-Triassic, end-Permian, and Cambrian (Botomian). Frequent and less well-studied HEATTs mark the early Cretaceous during Aptian, Albian, and Valanginian. The late Ordovician and late Devonian were pulsed HEATT episodes that were briefly interrupted by glaciation. The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum was a HEATT episode that developed quickly, and then aborted before reaching the deadly climax recognized at other HEATTs. The brevity and unsustainability of the PETM may reflect a short-lived trigger such as intrusion of the long-lived North Atlantic Volcanic Province into methane-rich sediments. Each HEATT episode has unique aspects depending on factors such as magnitude of LIP and other competing factors that may generate negative feedback such as orogenic activity and new innovations in plant life that stimulate increases in silicate weathering. The late Ediacaran, Cambro-Ordovician, and Pragian are potential HEATT episodes that have not been investigated as thoroughly as those discussed above.\nThe end-CretaceousHEATT is quiteweak, andwe attribute this to the precondition of a strengthening thermalmode of deep-ocean circulation as middle to late Cretaceous climates cooled and sea level generally fell. The weak HEATT effects instigated by the Deccan Traps were greatly amplified by the Chicxulub impact in the Yucatan carbonates. Vaporization of carbonates released considerable CO2 to the atmosphere, creating a short-lived HEATT episode. Recentmagnetostratigraphic ages\nshorten and focus the powerful Deccan eruptions to a brief interval quite close to the K–Pg boundary (Chenet et al., 2008). The anoxia typical of most HEATTs did not develop to any great extent at the end of the Cretaceous. The newly shortened duration of the Deccan Traps trigger maybepart of the reasonwhytheHEATTdidnotdevelopas fully as older ones.\nThe progressive development of a HEATT event should yield a stepwise record of detrimental biotic effects leading up to the extinction climax. During the initial stages of the HEATT episode, the rising atmospheric CO2, warming, and mid-latitude drying should affect terrestrial life, perhaps leading to precursor extinctions on land. Sensitive shallow-marine organisms will be stressed to extinction by heat, ocean acidification, and hypercapnia. Next, as sinking of warm brines intensifies, deep-water benthic species will suffer fromwarming and/or stress from low-oxygen levels. As anoxia expands and euxinia develops, outer-shelf biotasmaybe stressed before inner shelf-dwellers. Outer-shelf extinctionsmay precede inner shelf ones and/or outer-shelf organisms may move into shallower waters until the transgression brings about the peak in extinction.\nOf the Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse planetary states, the Greenhouse was the default state for the Phanerozoic climate system. Shifting the world to an Icehouse requires forcing via enhanced silicate weathering, typically generated by major continental collisional orogeny and associated positive biogeochemical feedbacks. Forcing the world from Greenhouse to Hothouse generates a HEATT episode. This requires strong LIP input to stimulate and sustain a full-fledged HEATT episode. Weaker, unsustainable, and short-lived HEATTs can be triggered by bolide impact if preconditions are favorable, but these aborted HEATT episodes leave distinctive characteristics in the record that enable them to be distinguished from fully developed and longer lasting “ideal” HEATT episodes. The long-term persistence of Hothouse conditions through the Mesoproterozoic suggests that the Hothouse planetary state was the default planetary state then, andmajor impetus was required to shift the planet out of that mode."
