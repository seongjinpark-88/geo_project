McKinnon\nKeywords: Mars subsurface biosphere radiolysis hydrogen habitability\nProtected from harmful radiation, subfreezing temperatures, and low pressures, subsurface rock-hosted habitats provide potentially sustainable refugia for microbial ecosystems inside small rocky planets, such as Mars. For many chemolithotrophic communities on Earth, water–rock alteration reactions have been shown to produce the key electron donors and acceptors necessary to sustain microbial life on geologic timescales. Here we quantitatively demonstrate that radiolysis likely generated concentrations of dissolved H2 capable of sustaining microbial communities in the subsurface of Noachian Mars (3.7–4.1 Gyr ago). When considering an environment with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations reach up to ∼55 mM in a cold early Mars climate scenario and ∼35 mM in a warm early Mars climate scenario; whereas when considering an environment with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations reach up to ∼85 mM in a cold early Mars climate scenario and ∼45 mM in a warm early Mars climate scenario. Specifically within the subsurface habitable zone, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼50–55 mM for a cold climate scenario with H2O groundwater. For a warm climate scenario with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations within the subsurface habitable zone range from ∼1–30 mM. For a cold climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations within the subsurface habitable zone range from ∼65–85 mM. For a warm climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations within the subsurface habitable zone range from ∼1-40 mM. Radiolysis likely produced [1.3–4.8] × 1010 moles H2 per year globally during the Noachian depending on the assumed porosity and groundwater composition. Radiolytic H2, and CH4 derived from radiolytic H2, can be locked in hybrid clathrate hydrates within the cryosphere and released by large impacts, volcanism, or obliquity variations. This process could warm the Noachian climate to above-freezing temperatures, and we predict that ∼1–8 warming events would be possible during the Noachian and Hesperian solely from radiolytically produced H2. We demonstrate that the region immediately beneath the cryosphere, termed the subcryospheric highly-fractured zone (SHZ), likely contained dissolved H2 concentrations and temperatures suitable for life regardless of the background climate scenario, making it the most consistently habitable environment on ancient Mars in terms of reductant availability. Material from this zone can be exposed by faulting and in the ejecta and uplifts of impacts, making the SHZ a crucial astrobiological target for testing the subsurface biosphere hypothesis.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Orbital and lander investigations have discovered valley networks (e.g. Hynek et al., 2010), paleolakes (e.g. Fassett and Head, 2008), and hydrated minerals (e.g. Ehlmann et al., 2011) on Mars, indicating that liquid water flowed across and beneath the planet’s surface during the course of its evolution. The frequency and duration of these periods of liquid water at the surface remains unresolved, but their existence\nrequires the martian surface to periodically meet habitability requirements 1 and 2. In contrast to the abundant geologic evidence for flowing liquid water at the surface, recent climate modeling analyses suggest that the Noachian (3.7–4.1 Gyr ago) was primarily defined by subfreezing temperatures punctuated by transient warming events due to drastic atmospheric change, such as development of a reducing greenhouse atmosphere via catastrophic CH4 release (Wordsworth et al., 2017). The inability of climate models to produce conditions suitable for a long-lived Noachian surface habitat has drawn focus to characterizing the habitability of the subsurface (Michalski et al., 2013) and the possibility of biosignature preservation there (Summons et al., 2011). Future astrobiological investigations of Mars will search for, among other indicators, the biosignature trifecta of preserved organic molecules, biotically induced isotope fractionation, and morphological features characteristic of life (Westall et al., 2015).\nSubsurface chemolithotrophic microbial ecosystems are prevalent throughout the terrestrial and marine crust on Earth (Lin et al., 2006; D’Hondt et al., 2009; Schrenk et al., 2013; Li et al., 2016). In these subsurface rock-hosted habitats, microbial metabolisms are driven by energy derived from non-photosynthetic redox reactions, in systems referred to as Subsurface Lithotrophic Microbial Ecosystems, or SLiMEs (Stevens and McKinley, 1995). Aquiferhosted habitats on ancient Mars analogous to SLiMEs are modeled here based on radioactive element concentrations, porosity, surface temperatures, geothermal heat flux, and H2 diffusion and dissolution. On Earth, many redox reactions powering subsurface ecosystems involve H2 as a reductant, which can be abiotically generated through water–rock reactions including serpentinization (Kelley et al., 2005; Sleep et al., 2004), cataclasis (Kita et al., 1982; Telling et al., 2015), and radiolysis (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2005a, 2005b; D’Hondt et al., 2009; Dzaugis et al., 2016). Because groundwater systems existed on Noachian Mars (Clifford et al., 2010; Ehlmann et al., 2011; Grimm et al., 2017), these same water–rock alteration reactions would have occurred, generating key nutrients for a subsurface biosphere (Onstott et al., 2006; Vance et al., 2016).\nIn radiolysis, the decay of K, Th, and U in rocks generates α, β , and γ radiation that breaks apart water molecules in rock pore spaces and fractures, producing an estimated [1.6–4.7] × 1010 moles H2 per year on a global scale from the Earth’s Precambrian cratons (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2014). Together with H2 production during serpentinization, global H2 production from the Precambrian crust from water–rock reactions is roughly equal to that produced from the entire marine lithosphere (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2014 and references therein). Mg-rich serpentine has been observed on the martian surface in the Nili Fossae region located near the Isidis Basin, and in the central peaks, walls, and ejecta of impact craters in the southern highlands (Ehlmann et al., 2010; Amador et al., 2018). Detection of Fe-rich serpentines, such as greenalite and cronstedtite, is hampered by their lack of unique diagnostic features in the VNIR, making them indistinguishable from other Fe/Mg phyllosilicates, carbonates, and their mixtures (Ehlmann et al., 2010). Serpentinization has been considered as a source of H2 production on Noachian Mars (Oze and Sharma, 2005; Schulte et al., 2006; Michalski et al., 2013; Holm et al., 2015; Vance et al., 2016), but it is a series of reactions restricted to a specific mineralogy and range of temperatures (Sleep et al., 2004; Kelley et al., 2005; Schrenk et al., 2013; Vance et al., 2016), in contrast to radiolysis that is a ubiquitous process in the presence of radionuclides and H2O.\nIn an extraterrestrial context, radiolysis has been considered as an H2 production mechanism on Europa (Bouquet et al., 2017), on modern Mars (Onstott et al., 2006), and as a source for H2 detected in the plumes of Enceladus (Waite et al., 2017). In addition to reductants, radiolysis produces oxidizing compounds\nsuch as H2O2, O2, O−2 , ·OH, and O− (Bjergbakke, 1989), providing the second key chemical component of a habitable environment for chemolithotrophs. In deep fracture waters in Precambrian Shield settings in both South Africa and Canada, such oxidants produced by radiolysis have been shown to oxidize pyrite, forming dissolved sulfate, which the local subsurface microbial ecosystem metabolically utilizes by coupling hydrogen oxidation to sulfate reduction (Lefticariu et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2006; Li et al., 2016). Radiolysis differs from serpentinization as an abiotic chemical energy production mechanism because radiolysis is capable of generating both reductants and soluble complementary oxidants, while serpentinization generates insoluble oxidants (e.g. magnetite, Fe3+-bearing serpentine). Availability of both soluble reductants and oxidants provides all the essential chemical feedstocks for a chemolithotrophic biosphere (Li et al., 2016). Here we quantitatively model radiolytic reductant production, and future work should consider radiolytic oxidant production on Noachian Mars."

K and Th elemental abundances are derived from Mars Odyssey’s Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) (Boynton et al., 2007) and those values are extrapolated on Noachian terrains to concentrations during the Noachian by modeling their half-life decay, assuming a Th/U ratio of 3.6 based on elemental abundances from martian meteorites (SNCs) (see Supplementary Info.)."

We use results from the 1850 K initial mantle temperature heat flux model and run our model for both warm and cold Noachian climate scenarios (Fig. 1). To achieve an above-freezing mean annual temperature in our warm climate model, we must add 7.5 × 10−5 m2 kg−1 of infrared-absorbing gray gas to artificially increase the surface temperature. No gray gas is added in the cold Noachian climate model."

    "heading": "2.2. Porosity",
    "text": "The key parameters in the Clifford et al. (2010) porosity model are surface porosity and the gravitationally scaled decay constant. This model calculates porosity as Φ(z) = Φ(0) exp(−z/K ), where Φ is porosity, z is depth, and K is the porosity decay constant.\nBecause we are modeling radiolytic H2 production on heavily impacted Noachian terrains, the closest planetary analogue with a measured porosity profile is the Moon, recently characterized by GRAIL to have a surface porosity range of 22–26% (Besserer et al., 2014). Because groundwater activity on Noachian Mars likely caused mineralization that may have reduced pore space (Ehlmann et al., 2011), we use a more conservative surface porosity range of 5–15% in our model. Recent gravity and topographic mapping of Mars indicates a low average bulk crustal density of 2582 ± 209 kg m−3, indicating porosities of 10–23% (Goossens et al., 2017), which is within or above the range presented in our model. Mars’ low bulk crustal density may also indicate the presence of deeply buried clay developed through alteration immediately following differentiation and crust formation (Cannon et al., 2017), or the presence of buried pyroclastics and sedimentary rocks (Banfield et al., 2013), or some combination of the three. With a thick buried clay layer (3–20 km) in a 50 km thick crust, and conservatively low grain densities (2000 kg m−3 for clay, 3100 kg m−3 for basalt), the bulk crustal density of 2582 ± 209 kg m−3 from Goossens et al. (2017) would still require >5–15% crustal porosity. Even in this lowest-porosity endmember scenario, the range of porosities from gravitational and topographic data encompass our range of assumed surface porosities (5–15%), thus the results presented here are largely conservative, as considering higher porosities leads to higher estimated H2 production in our calculations.\nFor the gravitationally scaled decay constant, we find a value of 4.3 km by scaling the lunar porosity decay constant of 9.8 km, measured by GRAIL (Besserer et al., 2014), to martian gravity (Weiss and Head, 2017). Porosity in the martian crust is likely het-\nerogeneous with respect to latitude and longitude, as it is on Earth. On Mars, Goossens et al. (2017) find crustal densities are higher in younger volcanic complexes (2600–3100 kg m−3) and significantly lower (1800–2500 kg m−3) in the Noachian-aged terrains that we consider in this model, showing that Noachian terrains have significantly higher porosities than younger terrains. At a finer spatial scale, porosity is likely lower in the floors of impact basins and higher around their fractured rims (Tornabene et al., 2013). Radiolytic H2 production will therefore be higher in fractured crater rims than in surrounding areas due to increased porosity. Serpentinization reactions will also produce H2 around crater rims in ultramafic terrain due to increased permeability, making locations such as the Isidis Basin rim tantalizing zones of potential chemical energy production (Ehlmann et al., 2010)."

    "heading": "2.3. K and Th data",
    "text": "K and Th elemental abundance maps were produced using data from the Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft and were obtained from the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) Geosciences Node at Washington University in St. Louis. We use the smoothed 5◦ × 5◦ latitude–longitude binned data. We normalize the data to correct for contributions from Cl, H, and S, as discussed in Hahn et al. (2011) (Fig. 2). Previous modeling of radiolytic H2 production on modern Mars (Onstott et al., 2006) used radionuclide concentrations derived from shergottite– nakhlite–chassigny (SNC) martian meteorites. GRS observations find significantly higher radionuclide concentrations than those found in SNCs (Boynton et al., 2007) (Fig. S1). Using radionuclide\nconcentrations derived from GRS data rather than measured SNC abundances increases H2 production estimates in our calculations. We assume a Th/U ratio of 3.6 to estimate U elemental abundance (Fig. S2). We then extrapolate back to K, Th, and U values 4 Gyr ago using a half-life decay model (Fig. 2) that calculates abundances as N (t) = N0e−λt/T , where N0 is the modern concentration, λ is ln(2), T is the half-life, and t is time, set to 4 Gyr. We use half-lives of 1.248 Gyr for 40K, 14.05 Gyr for 232Th, and 4.468 Gyr for 238U. We only calculate local variations in H2 production on Noachianaged terrains, since those are the only terrains with radionuclide concentrations representative of the Noachian crust. To estimate global H2 production during the Noachian, we take the average depth profile of H2 production on Noachian-aged terrain and globally integrate it over the top 10 km of martian crust. As such, radionuclide values on Hesperian and Amazonian-aged terrains do not influence our results. We model radiolytic H2 production in the top 10 km of Noachian crust in order to maintain conservative minimum estimates of Noachian crustal thickness.\nThe accuracy of our model would be significantly improved if U concentrations on the martian surface were characterized. U decays to radon, a gas that diffuses through the crust and enters the atmosphere, making it difficult to spatially tie gamma ray detections to their origin on the surface without accurate atmospheric transport models. Because the half-life of U is significantly shorter than that of Th, U concentrations increase more significantly when extrapolating to Noachian values using the half-life decay model. There is, however, no actual data to constrain the distribution and concentration of U on modern Mars; therefore, we must infer it using a Th/U ratio of 3.6, which is valid based on SNC elemental abundances (Fig. S2). Dependable measurements of U concentrations on modern Mars will allow us to more accurately estimate U concentrations on Noachian Mars, which could significantly affect our model results."

    "heading": "2.4. Radiolysis",
    "text": "The radiolytic H2 production model used here is analogous to that applied to terrestrial settings by Lin et al. (2005b), to Europa by Bouquet et al. (2017), and to modern Mars by Onstott et al. (2006). The model calculates radiogenic dose rates as\nEnet,i = Ei × W × Si/(1 + W + Si) (2) where i is an α, β , or γ particle, Enet is the net dosage absorbed by pore water (eV kg−1 s−1), E is the apparent dosage from radioactive element decay (eV kg−1 s−1), W is the weight ratio of pore water to rock, and S is the stopping powers of minerals with respect to each type of particle (Sα = 1.5, Sβ = 1.25, Sγ = 1.14) (Lin et al., 2005b and references therein). Stopping power of minerals is typically accurately estimated by Bragg’s rule (Bragg and Kleeman, 1905) and varies by <0.5 for silicate minerals (Nogami and Hurley, 1948). The pore-water-to-rock weight ratio depends on the porosity and water phase, which affects water density. We obtain our E values for 1 wt.% K, 1 ppm Th, and 1 ppm U for α, β , and γ from Adamiec and Aitken (1998), which gives values of EK,α = 0 (Gy ka−1), EK,β = 0.782 (Gy ka−1), EK,γ = 0.243 (Gy ka−1), ETh,α = 0.061 (Gy ka−1), ETh,β = 0.027 (Gy ka−1), ETh,γ = 0.048 (Gy ka−1), EU,α = 0.218 (Gy ka−1), EU,β = 0.146 (Gy ka−1), and EU,γ = 0.113 (Gy ka−1). We convert from (Gy ka−1) to (eV kg−1 s−1). Our range of W values is (0.03–2.1) × 10−2 for liquid water and (1.9–3.3) ×10−2 for water ice. The weight ratio is generally substantially higher for ice because it occupies the more porous upper crust. H2 yield is calculated as\nY = Σ Enet,i × Gi (3) where G is the number of H2 molecules produced per 100 eV of radiation (for H2O Gα (H2) = 0.96 molecules (100 eV)−1,\nGβ (H2) = 0.6 molecules (100 eV)−1, Gγ (H2) = 0.4 molecules (100 eV)−1) (Lin et al., 2005b and references therein) and Y is total H2 yield in molecules (Lin et al., 2005b and references therein). The value of G changes depending on the substance filling the pore space. Here we assume that the Noachian crust was water or brine-saturated rather than dry. If the Noachian crust was dry beneath the cryosphere, radiolysis would not produce any subcryospheric H2, except in the presence of hydrated salts (LaVerne and Tandon, 2005).\nFor a 5 M NaCl brine, the efficiency value, G(H2), increases to 1.52 molecules (100 eV)−1 and 0.6 molecules (100 eV)−1 for α and γ decay, respectively (Buck et al., 2012). 2 M CaCl2 brine, MgCl2·2H2O (hydrated salt), and 2 M MgCl2 brine all have higher gamma ray H2 production efficiencies relative to H2O (0.49, 0.72, 0.56 molecules (100 eV)−1 respectively), while hydrated salts CaCl2·6H2O, CaCl2·2H2O, and MgCl2·6H2O all have lower gamma ray H2 production efficiencies relative to H2O (0.098, 0.2, 0.042 molecules (100 eV)−1 respectively) (LaVerne and Tandon, 2005). Based on these studies, we conclude that the presence of brine within the pore space of the Noachian crust rather than pure liquid water would increase radiolytic H2 production. Hence our estimates of H2 production by radiolysis are largely conservative. If hydrated salts filled pore space in the Noachian crust rather than water or brine, H2 would still be produced radiolytically, but in lower quantities than those estimated in this study. Oxidants (including O2, O−2 , ·OH, and H2O2) are also produced during H2O radiolysis (Bjergbakke, 1989). On Earth, these oxidants have been shown to result in indirect radiolytic oxidation of sulfide minerals (Li et al., 2016; Lefticariu et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2006) to produce a source of dissolved sulfate and of ammonia to produce nitrite and nitrate (Silver et al., 2012) in the terrestrial subsurface, all of which are essential electron acceptors for the deep subsurface biosphere. We do not quantify oxidant production here."

    "text": "For our H2 diffusion model, we primarily follow the methodology of Onstott et al. (2006) and references therein. We assume that local equilibrium is achieved between free gas and dissolved H2 phases, meaning the concentration gradient of H2 is similar for both gas and dissolved phases. Modeling H2 transport in the martian crust in nonequilibrium conditions is beyond the scope of this study. Because dissolved H2 concentrations only reach saturation levels in the top ∼0.5 km of crust in the warm Noachian climate scenario, H2 diffusion occurs almost solely in dissolved phase. Assuming that H2 diffusivity through rock is zero, the diffusivity of H2 is treated as diffusion through water or ice in pore space\nDbulk = ΦD j (4) where Dbulk is the bulk diffusivity (m2 yr−1), Φ is the porosity, and D j is the diffusivity in water or ice (m2 yr−1). D j is H2 diffusivity through ice when calculating diffusion through the cryosphere and it is the diffusivity through liquid water when calculating diffusion below the cryosphere. Following Onstott et al. (2006) and references therein, we calculate H2 diffusivity through ice as"

We calculate water viscosity as μ = μ0 exp (\naP + E − bP R(T − θ − c P )\n) (7)\nwhere P is pressure, T is temperature, and E , μ0, θ , a, b, and c are constants (Likhachev, 2003). We use H2 diffusivity through ice (Di ) and liquid water (D w ) to calculate the bulk diffusivity through the cryosphere and subcryosphere, respectively.\nWe derive an explicit finite difference numerical solution to steady-state diffusion of H2 through the martian crust, assuming H2 surface fluxes of 4.8 × 10−12 mol m−2 s−1 and 3.5 × 10−12 mol m−2 s−1 for NaCl and H2O groundwater scenarios, respectively. These surface fluxes are the average integrated radiolytic H2 production with depth for each groundwater scenario assuming 15% surface porosity, as this is the porosity scenario for which we model diffusion. In order for the system to exist at steady state, the surface flux of H2 exiting the crust must be equal to the total quantity of H2 produced radiolytically within the crust. We assume a basal H2 flux of 0 at 10 km depth, which neglects H2 formed at greater depths through radiolysis or other processes. Accounting for H2 produced at depths greater than 10 km would only increase the calculated H2 concentrations at all depths. A more complex model of H2 transport through the Noachian crust would account for the buoyant nature of H2 gas, which would increase its rate of ascent in the top ∼0.5 km of the crust where dissolved H2 saturation concentrations are reached in the warm Noachian climate scenario. Dissolved H2 can “bubble out” in gas phase upon depressurization via crater formation or, to a lesser extent, via latitudinal surface ice migration."

    "heading": "2.6. Solubility",
    "text": "To calculate the dissolved H2 concentration in pore water within the martian crust, we employ the CHNOSZ model (Dick, 2008), which uses the SUPCRT thermodynamic database (Shock et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1992), to calculate Henry’s Law constant (K H ) for H2 at different temperatures and pressures in the crust. Our K H values range from [0.58–9.65] × 10−3 moles H2 gasLsoln·atm in the warm Noachian climate scenario and from [0.49–3.32] × 10−3 moles H2 gasLsoln·atm in the cold Noachian climate scenario. Our values for Henry’s Law constant assume an ideal solution and ideal gas, which is sufficiently precise for the purposes of this model. We calculate the saturation concentration of dissolved H2 with respect to depth using the relation Cmax = K H · Phydrostatic , where Cmax is the saturation concentration, K H is Henry’s Law constant, and Phydrostatic is the hydrostatic pressure. This relation shows the increase in saturation concentration with respect to hydrostatic pressure. Because H2 produced by radiolysis is in the dissolved phase, the saturation concentration must be reached before H2 can “bubble out” in the gas phase. To convert between H2 concentration from our diffusion model (moles per cubic meter) and H2 concentration in the pore water (moles per cubic meter pore space) we divide the former by the porosity, Φ(z). H2 solubility in water decreases with increasing salinity (Crozier and Yamamoto, 1974); therefore, our calculated dissolved H2 concentrations in NaCl groundwater will be overestimations, but will be valid within an order of magnitude, as even solutions with 40% NaCl salinity have solubilities within the same order of magnitude as their nonsaline counterparts (Crozier and Yamamoto, 1974)."

Fracture aperture, b, is calculated as b(σeff ) = b0 ·exp[σfrac,0βfrac,0 × (e−σ eff /σfrac,0 − 1)], where b0 is the uncompressed fracture aperture, σfrac,0 is the scale-stress of exponential decrease in fracture compressibility, βfrac,0 is the surface fracture compressibility, and σeff is the effective stress.

Effective stress, σeff , is calculated as σeff = gz(ρrock −ρwater), where g is the gravitational acceleration constant for Mars, z is depth, ρrock is rock density, and ρwater is water density.

Our ρrock value differs from that used by Hanna and Phillips (2005), who assume a granitic density for the martian crust, while we assume a basaltic density, causing our permeability values to be lower.

    "text": "While previous cryosphere models (Clifford et al., 2010) do not vary with longitude, an additional novel element of our approach is that we model the variation of cryosphere depth 4 Gyr ago with respect to both latitude and longitude based on current models of Noachian surface temperature (Palumbo et al., 2018) and heat flux (Plesa et al., 2016). We model H2 production under two initial mantle temperature assumptions (1650 K and 1850 K, Plesa et al., 2016), and for both water and NaCl brine-saturated pore space. Assuming a H2O-filled pore space and an initial Mars mantle temperature of 1650 K (1377 ◦C) generates cryosphere depth ranges from 1.1–2.5 km, as shown in Fig. 3a. For a 1850 K (1577 ◦C) initial mantle temperature and H2O-filled pore space, the cryosphere depth ranges from 0.9–2.2 km, thus considering a 1850 K initial mantle temperature decreases cryosphere depth by 10–20% regionally relative to cryosphere depth estimations using a 1650 K initial mantle temperature. Subsurface pore and fracture space during the Noachian were potentially filled with brine (Burt and Knauth, 2003; Michalski et al., 2013) rather than pure water. A eutectic NaCl brine-filled porosity would lower the melting temperature of the cryosphere to 252 K (−21 ◦C) and increase the efficiency of generating H2 from incoming radiation (Buck et al., 2012). Eutectic NaCl brine-filled porosity and initial mantle temperatures of 1650 K (1377 ◦C) and 1850 K (1577 ◦C) would equate to cryosphere depth ranges of 0–1.8 km and 0–1.6 km, respectively, where Hellas Basin does not have a cryosphere layer in either case due to\nits low elevation and correspondingly high surface temperatures, as shown in Fig. 3b. In summary, increased initial mantle temperature and a brine-filled pore space shallow the cryosphere depth in our calculations."

    "text": "Local H2 production rates are shown in Fig. 4 for both water and NaCl brine-filled pore space and an initial mantle temperature of 1850 K. Production rates are highest where porosity is highest at the top of the crust because higher porosity equates to a larger local water inventory, allowing for higher local H2 production. We take the average depth profile of H2 production in Noachian-aged terrain and globally integrate it across the top 10 km of the martian crust to generate our estimates for global H2 production. This ensures our results are not affected by radionuclide abundances on Amazonian and Hesperian-aged terrain. For water-filled pore space, global H2 production ranges from ∼[0.4–1.2] × 1010 moles H2 per year in the cryosphere and ∼[0.9–2.3] ×1010 moles H2 per year in the subcryosphere. For NaCl brine-filled pore space, global H2 production ranges from ∼[0.3–0.9] × 1010 moles H2 per year in the cryosphere and ∼[1.4–3.9] × 1010 moles H2 per year in the subcryosphere. The lower value in these estimates is for 5% surface porosity, while the upper value is for 15% surface porosity. The resulting minimum H2 production rates for the top 10 km of crust on Noachian Mars (volume 1.44 × 109 km3) are all approximately equal to the present-day radiolytic H2 production rate calculated for the Earth’s Precambrian crust (volume 0.53 × 109 km3), which has been shown to support abundant chemolithotrophic microbial life in the terrestrial subsurface (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2006; Schrenk et al., 2013). Based on our model of H2 diffusion and solubility in the Noachian crust, we propose that radiolytic H2 production during the Noachian would have been sufficient to support microbial life in the martian subsurface, especially when produced in tandem with additional H2 from serpentinization, which in the top 12 km of crust produces roughly the same amount of H2 as radiolysis 4 Gyr ago, according to a recent model (Vance et al., 2016)."

    "heading": "3.3. Diffusion & dissolution",
    "text": "H2 concentration profiles are shown in Fig. 5 for both a warm (mean annual temperature ∼273 K) and cold (mean annual temperature ∼225 K) early Mars. Significantly higher dissolved H2 concentrations exist in the cold early Mars scenario because the cryosphere effectively provides a diffusivity cap that slows H2 diffusion to the surface. For a non-saline groundwater scenario (H2O), H2 concentrations range from ∼0–5.8 mol m−3 in a cold Noachian\nMars climate and from ∼0–3.2 mol m−3 in a warm Noachian Mars climate (Fig. 5c). For a saline (eutectic NaCl brine) groundwater scenario, H2 concentrations range from ∼0–9.2 mol m−3 in a cold Noachian Mars climate and from ∼0–4.4 mol m−3 in a warm Noachian Mars climate (Fig. 5c). Lower porosity and water volume at depth causes the maximum dissolved H2 concentrations to exist near ∼7 km depth in both groundwater models, despite H2 production being maximized near the surface.\nFor the cold climate scenario with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼0–55 mM. For the warm climate scenario with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼0–35 mM. For the cold climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼0–85 mM. For the warm climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼0–45 mM (Fig. 5d). Because the dissolved H2 concentration exceeds the saturation concentration of H2 at depths < ∼0.5 km in the warm climate scenario, these dissolved concentrations are the saturation concentrations of H2 at those temperatures and pressures. These steady-state dissolved H2 concentrations will not change when considering buoyant H2 gas ascent in addition to H2 transport via diffusion, as gas bubbles are only generated after H2 saturation concentration is reached. Specifically within the SHZ (habitable zone, defined by temperature limits discussed below), for the cold climate scenario with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼50–55 mM. For the warm climate scenario with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼1–30 mM. For the cold climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range\nfrom ∼65–85 mM. For the warm climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼1–40 mM (Fig. 5d). The minimum dissolved H2 concentrations required for SO4 reduction and CH4 production via CO2 reduction are 1 nM and 13 nM, respectively (Lovely and Goodwin, 1988). Dissolved H2 concentrations in the Noachian crust generated by our model are multiple orders of magnitude higher than these baseline requirements, demonstrating that H2 generated via radiolysis during the Noachian was likely more than sufficient to support a subsurface biosphere of chemolithotrophs."
  }, {
    "heading": "4. Discussion",
    "text": "The combined results from our radiolytic H2 production, diffusion, and dissolution models offer strong evidence that dissolved H2 concentrations in the Noachian subcryospheric crust were sufficient to support a subsurface biosphere. Furthermore, we expect that radiolysis would have created habitable environments during the pre-Noachian after crystallization of the crust, as radionuclide concentrations would only be higher during that time period. Our cryosphere depth model allows us to constrain the expected depth range in which a subcryospheric aquifer-based rock-hosted habitat—termed the SHZ (subcryospheric highly-fractured zone)— would have existed in various scenarios of Noachian climate and groundwater composition, as shown in Fig. 6. We propose that organic, isotopic, and morphological biosignatures from this subsurface habitat could be excavated through faulting and in the ejecta and uplift zones of impacts in Noachian terrain that penetrate beneath the depth of the Noachian cryosphere. Mars 2020, ExoMars, and future missions could feasibly detect these biosigna-\ntures in ejected megabreccia blocks or layers exposed by faulting, if a subsurface biosphere did indeed exist on ancient Mars. While finer spatial scale heterogeneities in porosity, radionuclide concentrations, and groundwater flow will vary our results on a local scale, they remain valid on macroscopic scales, showing powerful general trends in the habitability of the crust during the Noachian. This allows us to make reasonable assessments regarding the potential biosignature content of specific layers exposed by faulting and of megabreccia units, if we can successfully tie these ejecta blocks back to their parent craters and assess the depth range from which they could have been excavated, providing excellent targets for future testing of the subsurface biosphere hypothesis.\nWe highlight the SHZ as the region of Noachian crust in which temperature conditions are between 0–122 ◦C and dissolved H2 concentrations are sufficient to support a subsurface chemolithotrophic biosphere, regardless of the background climate scenario. Most low temperature serpentinization in the Noachian crust would also occur in the SHZ, as initial impact-generated permeability and subsequent fracture propagation over time via crystallization pressure would be sufficient to consistently drive water– rock alteration (Kelemen and Hirth, 2012). The SHZ will be more habitable in regions with olivine and pyroxene-rich units, which contain more reactants for serpentinization (Vance et al., 2016; Sleep et al., 2004) that would produce H2 in addition to radioly-\nsis. Serpentinization and other hydration reactions at temperatures even as low as 30–50 ◦C produce H2 in sufficient concentrations to sustain microbial communities (Mayhew et al., 2013). While some experiments have suggested limited H2 production from serpentinization at low temperatures at the relatively short laboratory timescale (McCollom and Donaldson, 2016), on a planetary time scale of billions of years, fractures in the deep crust of Earth have been demonstrated to accumulate and concentrate the products of even extremely slow water–rock reactions (Sherwood Lollar et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2005a; Lin et al., 2006).\nWe have assumed anoxic conditions in the Noachian crust, similar to those expected on early Earth 4 Gyr ago. Assuming the Noachian atmosphere was predominantly CO2, some H2 would be consumed abiotically at high temperatures (>300 ◦C) via the Sabatier reaction. If conditions on Noachian Mars were periodically oxic, H2 would be consumed via Fe3+ reduction. H2 consumption by both Fe3+ reduction and CH4 formation via CO2 reduction can also be microbially facilitated (Lovely and Goodwin, 1988), but could clearly still occur in the absence of a subsurface biosphere.\nThe spatial resolution of our model is equivalent to that of the input GRS data, 5 × 5 degrees per pixel. The trends of H2 production, gas concentrations, and dissolved concentrations presented in our model are valid when considering the Noachian crust at macroscopic scales. Akin to Earth, smaller-scale heterogeneities\nin radionuclide concentrations and porosity will cause H2 production, diffusion, and dissolution to vary on finer spatial scales than presented here. As such, characterizing local-scale variations in radionuclide concentrations and porosity will help constrain estimates for radiolytic H2 production and concentration in both gas and aqueous phase during the Noachian. Future high resolution gravity mapping could constrain local porosity variations, which would help identify regions on Noachian Mars that were especially habitable from an H2 availability standpoint. The bulk radionuclide concentrations of the modern martian crust are similar to oceanic basalt on Earth, which is significantly lower than that of Earth’s continental crust (Fig. S1). Still, radiolysis on Noachian Mars likely produced H2 in similar quantities as Precambrian cratons on Earth today due to higher porosities on the more heavily bombarded and highly-fractured Noachian terrain, as well as higher radionuclide concentrations 4 Gyr ago.\nThe cryosphere serves to increase subsurface H2 concentrations in dissolved phase by acting as a diffusively-insulating cap that reduces the rate of H2 escape, which increases the habitability of the Noachian crust in cold climate conditions from the standpoint of reductant availability. Still, dissolved H2 concentrations at the surface are more than sufficient to support a chemolithotrophic microbial biosphere in the warm climate scenario (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Detectable biosignatures from a radiolyticallypowered surface Noachian biosphere may exist on or near the surface depending on the duration of transient warming events, the thawing timescale of the cryosphere, and the biosphere’s migration timescale. In the absence of biosignatures from these po-\ntentially shorter-lived near-surface habitats, the deeper subsurface radiolytically-powered biosphere that could have persisted in the SHZ for hundreds of millions of years may have imprinted detectable organic, morphological, and isotopic biosignatures in its host rock. Material from these ancient groundwater-based rockhosted habitats can be excavated via faulting in regions such as Valles Marineris, Nili Fossae, or Claritas Fossae, or in the ejecta (Osinski et al., 2011) and central uplifts (Grieve and Pilkington, 1996) of impact craters that penetrate beneath the Noachian cryosphere depth on Noachian-aged terrain, potentially exposing rocks and granting access to biosignatures of ancient microbial life in and around craters such as Radau, Ritchey, Reuyl, and Hargraves, which meet the aforementioned criteria. A survey of all martian craters and heavily faulted regions meeting these criteria will be presented in future work.\nMegabreccia blocks on Mars commonly contain hydrated minerals such as phyllosilicates formed by hydrothermal alteration either in the subsurface before the impact event (Ehlmann et al., 2011) or from hydrothermal systems generated by impacts (Osinski et al., 2013; Tornabene et al., 2013). These units could contain biosignatures from both the SHZ and proposed younger, transient, impact-induced hydrothermal environments (Osinski et al., 2013). Many megabreccia blocks also contain unaltered megaclasts with their original mafic or ultramafic composition (Osinski et al., 2013; Tornabene et al., 2013), revealing the H2 production potential from serpentinization of this precursor material, as this is largely controlled by composition. Megabreccia blocks that contain both aqueously altered and unaltered facies are thus potentially valuable\nastrobiological targets, as they may contain organic, morphological, and isotopic biosignatures from both the SHZ and possible impactinduced transient hydrothermal habitats.\nSome quantity of radiolytically produced H2 may be abiotically converted to CH4 (Onstott et al., 2006), which can be stored along with H2 in clathrates within the cryosphere to a capacity of 2.1 × 1019 − 2.2 × 1020 moles CH4 (Lasue et al., 2015). In the Noachian cryosphere, H2 clathrates would only be stable in hybrid clathrates with larger molecules, such as CO2 and/or CH4 (Sloan, 1998). Perturbation of the cryosphere via large impact, volcanism, or obliquity variations would release H2 and CH4 from these clathrates (Chassefière et al., 2016; Kite et al., 2017) and potentially drive transient warming events during the Noachian through CO2–CH4 and CO2–H2 collision induced absorption and associated atmospheric heating, in tandem with preexisting atmospheric CO2 (Wordsworth et al., 2017). Radiative transfer models paired with ab-initio calculations (Wordsworth et al., 2017) show surface temperatures of 273 K (0 ◦C) would be achieved with an atmosphere of 1.25–2 bar CO2 with 2–10% H2 and CH4. This atmosphere could be generated by CO2 released from volcanism and impacts as well as H2/CH4 clathrate destabilization. This could generate a positive feedback loop by further melting the cryosphere and releasing more CH4 from clathrates.\nThe predominantly CO2 reducing greenhouse atmosphere proposed by Wordsworth et al. (2017) to warm the Noachian surface to above 273 K requires 4.4 × 1018 and 8.8 × 1018 moles H2 for 2 and 1 bar atmospheres, respectively. In the presence of equal amounts of CH4, it requires 3.5 × 1018 and 4.4 × 1018 moles H2 for 2 and 1 bar atmospheres, respectively. Assuming all CH4 in these atmospheres was derived from H2 reduction of CO2 via the Sabatier reaction, the true amount of H2 required for warming above 273 K with H2 and CH4 mixed in equal molar concentrations is 1.8 × 1019 and 2.2 × 1019 moles H2 for 2 and 1 bar atmospheres, respectively. Given a combined H2 production rate of 6 × 1010 moles H2 per year from radiolysis and serpentinization (Vance et al., 2016), in the most optimistic scenario, where 100% of produced H2 is locked in clathrate hydrates within the cryosphere, ∼[0.6–7] × 108 years would be required for H2 to build up in sufficient quantities to generate this reducing greenhouse atmosphere upon major cryospheric perturbation. Based on these findings, radiolytic H2 production in tandem with H2 production from serpentinization would have generated sufficient H2 and/or CH4 to contribute to ∼1–17 transient greenhouse atmosphere warming episodes over 1 Gyr of the Noachian and Hesperian, assuming 100% of these compounds were locked in clathrate hydrates within the cryosphere and were released instantaneously. Radiolysis alone would have generated sufficient H2 and/or CH4 to contribute to ∼1–8 transient greenhouse atmosphere warming episodes over the same time period, assuming all H2 and CH4 were locked in clathrate hydrates and released instantaneously."

    "text": "We find that radiolysis likely generated [1.3–4.8] × 1010 moles H2 per year globally during the Noachian depending on the assumed porosity and groundwater composition. When considering an environment with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼0–55 mM in a cold early Mars climate scenario and ∼0–35 mM in a warm early Mars climate scenario, while when considering an environment with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼0–85 mM in a cold early Mars climate scenario and ∼0–45 mM in a warm early Mars climate scenario. Specifically within the SHZ, for the cold climate scenario with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼50–55 mM. For the warm climate scenario with H2O groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations\nrange from ∼1–30 mM. For the cold climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼65–85 mM. For the warm climate scenario with eutectic NaCl brine groundwater, dissolved H2 concentrations range from ∼1–40 mM (Fig. 5d). These concentrations are sufficient for sustainment of chemolithotrophic life on Earth (Lovely and Goodwin, 1988). Based on our modeled crustal temperature profile, a subsurface aquifer-hosted habitable environment bounded by the cryosphere base and the depth at which the high temperature limit for life (122 ◦C; Takai et al., 2008) is reached could have persisted in the Noachian crust for hundreds of millions of years. In a cold Noachian climate, the depth range of this habitable environment— the SHZ—would be 2–5 km in an H2O groundwater scenario and 1–5 km in a NaCl groundwater scenario. In a warm Noachian climate, the depth range of this habitable environment would be 0–4 km in both H2O and NaCl groundwater scenarios.\nOur model shows that the cryosphere depth in a cold Noachian climate would range from 1.1–2.5 km for an H2O-filled pore space and an initial Mars mantle temperature of 1650 K. In a cold Noachian climate with H2O-filled pore space and an initial Mars mantle temperature of 1850 K, the cryosphere depth would range from 0.9–2.2 km. In a cold Noachian climate with NaCl-filled pore space and an initial Mars mantle temperature of 1650 K, the cryosphere depth ranges from 0–1.8 km. In a cold Noachian climate with NaCl-filled pore space and an initial Mars mantle temperature of 1850 K, the cryosphere depth ranges from 0–1.6 km. Hellas Basin does not have a cryosphere layer in either case with NaClfilled pore space. Assuming that all H2 and CH4 derived from H2 are locked in clathrate hydrates within the cryosphere, radiolysis alone would require ∼[1.2–14] ×108 years to build up in sufficient quantities to drive formation of a transient greenhouse atmosphere proposed by Wordsworth et al. (2017). When combined with H2 from serpentinization (Vance et al., 2016), ∼[0.6–7] × 108 years would be required for H2 to build up in sufficient quantities to generate this reducing greenhouse atmosphere upon cryospheric perturbation. Radiolysis alone could have produced enough H2 to drive ∼1–8 greenhouse atmosphere warming episodes during 1 Gyr of the Noachian and Hesperian, assuming all H2 is locked in clathrates within the cryosphere. ∼1–17 greenhouse atmosphere warming episodes could be produced during 1 Gyr of the Noachian and Hesperian through H2 from both radiolysis and serpentinization (Vance et al., 2016) being locked in the cryosphere.\nWe have demonstrated that radiolysis alone produced sufficient quantities of reductants to have sustained a subsurface biosphere during the Noachian for hundreds of millions of years. Given sufficient oxidant availability, this habitat could have fostered chemolithotrophic microbial communities that would have imprinted organic, morphological, and isotopic biosignatures on their habitat’s host rock. Material containing these biosignatures may be excavated via faulting or in the uplift zones and ejecta of impacts on Noachian terrain that penetrate beneath the depth of the Noachian cryosphere. Depending on the duration of transient warming events, the melting timescale of the cryosphere, and the migration timescale of the biosphere, biosignatures may have also imprinted in rocks at shallower depths during warming periods, as dissolved H2 concentrations at these depths would be sufficient to support a biosphere. This should be considered in the context of Mars 2020, ExoMars, and future robotic and human exploration of the red planet.\nData availability The radioactive element datasets analyzed during the current study are available in the NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) Geosciences Node at Washington University in St. Louis http://pds -geosciences .wustl .edu /missions /odyssey /grs _ elements .html.
