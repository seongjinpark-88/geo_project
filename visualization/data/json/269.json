    "text": "Keywords: East Greenland, rifting, tephras, volcanism, climate.\nThe early Tertiary North Atlantic igneous province, formed during the rifting of the continents of Eurasia and North America, is one of the largest exposed igneous provinces in the world (Eldholm & Grue 1994; Macdougall 1988). Continental break-up produced voluminous extrusive volcanic deposits and associated igneous intrusions, and had a major impact on long-term climatic conditions in the early Tertiary (Thiede et al. 1989; Eldholm & Thomas 1993; Nevle et al. 1994). The volcanic stratigraphy, consisting dominantly of flood basalts with interbedded pyroclastic deposits, is well-exposed in East Greenland. Tephra deposits, believed to have been derived from East Greenland, have been described in sediments from drill cores on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean and from outcrops in Northern Europe (Knox & Morton 1988; Morton & Knox 1990; Eldholm & Thomas 1993). However, the pyroclastic deposits within the East Greenland stratigraphy have not been studied extensively, nor have they been correlated to regional time-equivalent strata. In addition, the sources of explosive regional volcanism have not been identified.\nIn this study, we present field, mineralogical, and geochemical data on basaltic tephra deposits and on a chemically distinct alkaline tuff found within a c. 1 km section of basalt flows exposed on the Gronau West Nunatak of East Greenland. Based on the age, stratigraphic position, and chemical composition of these pyroclastic rocks, we identify their possible sources and examine regional correlations with tephras of the North Atlantic region. Our study suggests that the frequency and regional extent of explosive volcanic events during this time may have been previously underestimated, which bears on models of volcanic volatile flux and climate change during the early Tertiary."

    "text": "The coastal mountains of central East Greenland contain a largely undeformed early Tertiary flood basalt succession cut by numerous high-level plutons, dikes, and faults formed during rifting of Eurasia and North America (Brooks & Nielsen 1982). Basaltic volcanism along the East Greenland rifted margin occurred in three distinct events at 62–59 Ma (lavas and dykes), at 57–54 Ma (lavas, dykes, sills, and plutons), and at 50–47 Ma (plutons and dykes; Tegner et al. 1998a). The continental flood basalt succession is dominated by a sequence (up to 7 km thick) of mostly tholeiitic basaltic lavas. The bulk of this sequence was erupted in a short-lived event, approximately c. 57 to c. 54 Ma, that is presently exposed over approximately 65 000 km2 between Scoresby Sund and Kangerlussuaq (Fig. 1). This subaerial flood basalt sequence spread over a terrain of Pre-Cambrian gneisses, late-Cretaceous to early-Tertiary sediments, and early Tertiary lavas, tuffs, and hyaloclastites that infilled local continental grabens (Fig. 1; Wager 1934; Brooks & Nielsen 1982).\nThe lavas of central East Greenland have been divided into three discrete stages, the lower, the middle, and the upper series lavas, based on their mineralogy and geochemistry (Larsen et al. 1989; Pedersen et al. 1997). The lower lavas are relatively minor and were accreted in the early stages of rifting (60–59 Ma; Nielsen et al. 1981). The middle series (Magga Dan, Milne Land, Geikie Plateau, Rømer Fjord, and Skrænterne formations) makes up the overwhelming volume of the 7 km thick flood basalts which are associated with continental rifting (Larsen et al. 1989). Minor volumes of alkaline lavas of the Prinsen af Wales Formation constitute the upper series and locally overlie the flood basalt succession\n269\n(Fig. 1; Wager 1947; Anwar 1955; Brown et al. 1996). Numerous alkaline intrusions and dykes are exposed in the coastal mountains of East Greenland (Fig. 1; Deer 1976; Brooks & Nielsen 1982; Nielsen 1987; Brooks 1991a, b; Brown et al. 1996). The majority of the alkaline intrusions and lavas (55–33 Ma) are the result of post-basaltic magmatism produced by variable amounts of melting, fractionation, and interaction of the continental lithosphere with melanephelinite, alkaline, and basanite magmas (Nielsen 1987).\nPyroclastic deposits have been recognized in the volcanic stratigraphy underlying the middle series flood basalts (described as main tuffs within the lower series lavas of Wager 1934, 1935, 1947; Nielsen et al. 1981; Brooks & Nielsen 1982). However, their stratigraphic distribution, origin, petrology, and geochemistry within the middle and upper series basalts are poorly known. Two nephelinite tuffs (see Fig. 1) have been identified at Sydbræ within the Rømer Fjord Formation (Larsen et al. 1989) which was erupted in the middle– late stages of flood basalt magmatism (c. 55 Ma; M. Storey unpublished data). Palaeocene and early Eocene tephras of alkaline to basaltic composition are present on the NW European margin and in drill cores throughout the North Atlantic (Bøgglid 1918; Andersen 1937; Pedersen et al. 1975; Sigurdsson & Loebner 1981; Knox 1984, 1997; Knox & Morton 1988; Morton & Knox 1990; Viereck et al. 1988; Emeleus et al. 1996). Many of these tephras are interbedded with sediments that are considered to be time-equivalent to the flood basalts in East Greenland (Knox & Morton 1988)."

    "text": "Pyroclastic deposits were sampled over a 1070 m traverse of the Gronau West Nunatak (Fig. 2a). The section was measured, and flows and tephras were distinguished using multi-model photogrammetry (Pedersen et al. 1997). Field sampling was conducted in 1995 as part of a comprehensive study by the Danish Lithosphere Centre (DLC).\nThe least altered pyroclastic samples were analysed by several geochemical and petrographic methods. Secondary minerals were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on whole rock and clay-size fractions with a Rigaku D/Mx-II B X-ray Powder Diffractometer at Arizona State University, using the JCPDS-ICDD mineral database.\nWhole rock major oxides and trace elements (Rb, Zr, and Nb) were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry on fused discs prepared from 2 g samples. Loss on ignition (LOI) was measured after fusion of the sample. Trace and rare earth elements (Be, Sc, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Ba) were analysed by ICP-MS. Whole rock 87Sr/86Sr was analysed by thermal ionization mass spectroscopy (TIMS) at Washington University.\nMajor oxide compositions of minerals and melt inclusions were obtained using a JEOL JXA-8600 electron microprobe with Noran 5500/5600 Energy Dispersive Spectrometers (EDS) on an automated system at Arizona State University. X-ray matrix corrections were based on a modified CITZAF routine incorporated in the software. Standardization was performed using a combination of natural and synthetic standards. All microprobe analyses of melt inclusions are given in weight % oxide normalized to 100% on a volatile-free basis. Trace element concentrations in melt inclusions were obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) using a Cameca IMS 3f instrument and a c. 10 KeV O- beam with a c. 20 µm spot size at Arizona State University. Analytical procedures are from Hervig et al. (1989). Trace elements were calibrated against NBS 610, a glass standard containing approximately 500 ppm of 61 trace elements."

    "text": "Six 40Ar–39Ar laser total-fusion ages were measured from optically clear, colourless, and inclusion-free sanidine crystals separated from the Gronau alkaline tuff (GGU421564B). Samples were heated using a Spectra-Physics 2016 continuous argon-ion laser with a maximum output power in multi-line mode of 6.0 W. The evolved gas was purified using SAES Zr-Al getters and analysed with a Mass Analyzer Products 216 model mass spectrometer with a Baur-Signer ion source and an electron multiplier. Approximately 18 grains were heated in six analyses. A weighted average age was calculated using four congruent ages and their uncertainty. The mean-squared-weighted deviation (MSWD) for the isochron is 0.18, suggesting that the age uncertainty can be explained by experimental error alone.\nThe ages quoted are referenced to the Taylor Creek Rhyolite sanidine (TCR) standard, with an assumed age of 27.92 Ma based upon the SB-3 biotite, which has a K–Ar age of 162.9 Ma (Duffield & Dalrymple 1990). Different flux monitors and standards have been used to date material throughout the North Atlantic and to correlate absolute and relative time scales (i.e. Berggren et al. 1995). There exists significant variation among laboratories regarding the ages for different standards. To compare our reported age of the Gronau alkaline tuff to other dated material, we employed the algorithm of Dalrymple et al. (1993) for revising 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained using a flux monitor\nwith a different age. In converting to the FCT-3 (Fish Canyon Tuff) sanidine flux monitor (28.04 Ma), we have assumed that it is referenced to McClure Mountain hornblende standard (MMhb-1) at 523.5 Ma (Renne et al. 1994)."

    "text": "The Gronau West Nunatak, located c. 200 km NE of Kangerlussuaq (approximately 69 N/30 W, see Fig. 1), comprises almost entirely extrusive volcanic units. The measured stratigraphic section (1070 m between locations I and III in Fig. 2a) is dominated by a series of approximately 60 basaltic lava flows (Fig. 2b). Most of the lavas form resistant cliffs, while interlayered, less resistant tephra deposits weather into talus slopes (Fig. 3a). The basalt lavas are single flows 15–20 m in thickness, characterized by massive flow centres, vesicular or scoriaceous flowtops, and vesicular flow bottoms (occasionally with well-developed tube vesicles). Compound pahoehoe units occur sporadically through the section, exposed as 3–10 intercalated tongues of generally vesicular flows 0.5–3 m in thickness.\nBased on petrographic observations and chemical analyses, most of the flows within the sampled profile belong to the Geikie Plateau, Rømer Fjord, and Skrænterne Formations described by Larsen et al. (1989) and A. K. Pedersen & L. M. Larsen (pers. comm.). The stratigraphic locations of formation boundaries on the Gronau West Nunatak are depicted in Fig. 2. Near the top of the nunatak (2500–2580 m), within the largely uniform Skrænterne Formation, are numerous picrite and interfingered basalt+picrite flows. The uppermost flows on the nunatak are distinctly alkaline in composition, rest uncomformably on lavas of the Skrænterne Formation (A. K. Pedersen & L. M. Larsen pers. comm.), and may be equivalent to the alkaline lavas of the Prinsen af Wales Formation (Figs 1 and 2).\nSecondary mineral assemblages formed in vesicular flow tops and bottoms indicate that the stratigraphic section at Gronau West experienced extremely low grades of regional metamorphism (see Fig. 2a; Neuhoff et al. 1997). The uppermost alkaline lavas are essentially devoid of secondary minerals, corresponding to Walker’s (1960) ‘zone of no zeolites’ described in basalts of Eastern Iceland. Most of the underlying stratigraphy contains secondary mineral assemblages characterized by chabazite, thomsonite, and phillipsite with minor stilbite and heulandite that are indicative of the chabazite+thomsonite zeolite zone (Walker 1960; Neuhoff et al. 1997). The lowermost exposed lavas contain abundant analcime along with chabazite and thomsonite, indicative of the analcime isograd (cf. Neuhoff et al. 1997). The distribution of zeolite mineral assemblages is consistent with burial temperatures of c. 30 and c. 70 C at points III and I, respectively, in Fig. 2a (Neuhoff et al. 1997).\nMafic dykes crop out sporadically on the Gronau West Nunatak and comprise less than 1% of the nunatak. A volcanic\nneck is exposed NE of the measured stratigraphic section which may be the source for some of the Skrænterne Formation lavas on the nunatak (Pedersen et al. 1997). Intercalated within the volcanic stratigraphy are c. 17 basaltic pyroclastic deposits and one alkaline tuff layer which are described in detail below."

    "heading": "Basaltic pyroclastic deposits",
    "text": "We identified and sampled seventeen variably reworked basaltic pyroclastic deposits interlayered among the basalt flows of the Gronau West Nunatak (Fig. 2b). They crop out as bright red-orange, oxidized layers between c. 10 and 50 cm in thickness that weather into the colluvium (Fig. 3a). Where exposed, the tephras are comformably deposited on top of massive basalt flows which have locally irregular, brecciated flow tops. Contacts with the underlying basalt flows are sharp, and some of the pyroclastic layers appear to have been physically disturbed and entrained into the overlying lava flow. The majority of the samples are well lithified, presumably due to contact metamorphism from the overlying flow or to significant secondary mineralization. One of the tephra horizons (2226 m) immediately above GGU421512 (Fig. 2b) contains zeolite-filled tree and limb casts, suggesting the development of soils, the presence of surface water, and the establishment of mature plant communities between some of the eruptions. The majority of the tephras (13 of 17) were deposited during the emplacement of the Geikie Plateau Formation (Fig. 2b). The frequency of tephras per lava flow is highest in the Geikie Plateau Formation, with about one tephra per two lava flows. In the Rømer Fjord Formation, the ratio is one tephra per eight lava flows and in the Skrænterne Formation, the ratio is one tephra to seven lava flows.\nMineralogy and Geochemistry. Six of the least-weathered basaltic tephra samples were selected for petrographic and geochemical analysis (Fig. 2b). Samples are mostly variably palagonitized sideromelane glass shards with lesser amounts of lithic fragments and crystals of plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Glass shards range from over 1 mm to <50 µm, but most are 100–200 µm. The majority of shards are vesiculated and blocky (Fig. 3b) which is typical of phreatomagmatic eruptions produced by interaction between basaltic lava and external water (Heiken & Wohletz 1985). Some are scoriaceous in morphology with numerous elongate vesicles (Fig. 3c). Tephra samples contain between 5 and 15% crystals of plagioclase (Fig. 3d), clinopyroxene (Fig. 3e) with occasional apatite crystal inclusions, and minor titanite. Lithic fragments (50– 1000 µm) are rounded, variably altered basalt (aphyric to plagioclase-phyric).\nThe least-altered plagioclase and clinopyroxene crystals have compositions of An65-74 and Wo28-45En24-48Fs10-33, respectively, by electron microprobe (averages analyses are given in Table 1; ranges are shown in Fig. 4). Plagioclase crystals and fragments are typically zoned and have a wide size range (25–400 µm; average=150 µm), appearing as shattered\nFig. 3.

Clinopyroxene crystals are euhedral to subhedral (Fig. 3e) and are smaller than plagioclase (25–200 µm; average=50 µm). All of the compositions are within the range reported for plagioclase and clinopyroxene in the surrounding flood basalts (Larsen et al. 1989).\nSecondary phases identified by X-ray diffraction are dioctahedral smectite (nontronite), hematite and amorphous iron oxides, and zeolites. Up to 80% of the samples consist of secondary minerals. Glass shards and matrix have been replaced by smectite, hematite, and amorphous iron oxides. Zeolites are present as pore replacement minerals, with their mineralogy determined by burial temperature and depth (Neuhoff et al. 1997).\nDifferences in major and trace element composition between the basaltic tephras and surrounding lavas can be explained by post-depositional alteration. The high loss on ignition (LOI; 8–14 wt%) of the tephra samples is consistent with hydration associated with palagonitization and also reflects the presence of smectite, silica polymorphs, and zeolites in the samples (Heister 1997). The ratio of Zr to Y and the concentrations of TiO2 (wt%) and Sr (ppm) measured in six tephras samples are compared to those of the basaltic lavas in Fig. 2b. Ratios of the incompatible elements Zr and Y in the basaltic tephras are identical (within error) to those of the lavas. Tephra sample GGU421534 is much higher in TiO2 concentration (c. 2 wt%) than in the adjacent lavas, which may be due to contact metamorphism from a nearby mafic dyke. In contrast to Zr/Y and TiO2, the Sr concentrations in the tephras are systematically lower by c. 100 ppm than those of the lavas. This is\npossibly due to a lower abundance of plagioclase in the tephras, the likely host mineral for Sr, but may also be due to Sr mobility during low-grade metamorphism."

    "heading": "Gronau alkaline pyroclastic tuff",
    "text": "At 2565 m elevation on the Gronau West Nunatak near the base of the Skrænterne Formation (Fig. 5a), a 5–10 cm thick alkaline pyroclastic horizon (Gronau alkaline tuff) is interbedded conformably between plagioclase-phyric and picritic lavas. In exposure, the Gronau alkaline tuff is composed of two layers: a fine-grained, light green, mostly aphyric horizon overlying a light brown, pumice-and-crystal-rich layer. Both layers crop out discontinuously as they weather into the colluvium and appear to mantle the slightly irregular topography of the underlying basalt flow. The upper green layer is more abundant, well lithified, and crystal-poor (sample GGU421564A). Greater than 90% of the sample is altered green groundmass composed of montmorillonite and phillipsite. The presence of phillipsite is consistent with the uppermost chabazite–thomsonite zeolite zone assemblage, a burial depth of 500–600 m, and a burial metamorphic temperature of 30–50 C (Neuhoff et al. 1997). Less than 5% of the sample is optically clear sodian sanidine crystals (Or37-42Ab58-63), 200– 300 µm in size, that exhibit no obvious alteration. A representative chemical analysis is given in Table 1. Aegirine-augite, ilmenite, and apatite are present as accessory phases that are <1% of the modal abundance.\nThe less abundant light-brown tuff (sample GGU421564B) is poorly-sorted, crystal-rich, and contains undeformed but devitrified pumice clasts (<1–2 mm in diameter; Fig. 5b). Unlike the overlying crystal-poor deposit, this horizon contains approximately 25% crystals of sodian sanidine (Or41-44Ab56-59), amphibole, and diopside in addition to numerous angular lithic fragments. Altered groundmass and pumice comprise approximately 75% of the total sample. Much of the groundmass has altered to the secondary mineral phases montmorillonite and phillipsite, which are present both in the groundmass and as euhedral crystals filling void spaces (Fig. 5c). The sodian sanidine grains (c. 75% of the crystals) are optically clear but vary in morphology from large (300– 500 µm), euhedral-to-subhedral crystals to much smaller, apparently shattered, tabular grains (50–150 µm; Fig. 5d). Many sodian sanidine crystals contain round melt inclusions up to 20–40 µm in diameter (Fig. 5d). Tabular, green apatite inclusions are also common. Black-brown, tabular (50– 250 µm) crystals of magnesio-katophorite comprise up to 20% of the crystals (Table 1). Diopside is 4–5% of the crystals, appearing as clear, green subhedral crystals (Fig. 5e) that are 50–100 µm in size (see Table 1 for composition). Accessory mineral phases (<2% of the crystals) are ilmenite, acicular Ti-aegirine, aegirine-augite, apatite, perovskite, and biotite. Representative electron microprobe analyses of Ti-aegirine, biotite, and perovskite are given in Table 1. Based on the degree of alteration in the green layer and the presence of undeformed pumice clasts in the brown layer (Fig. 5b), we suspect that the green layer shielded the underlying brown layer from thermal alteration by the overlying basalt flow. The crystal-rich layer also has larger crystals than the green layer, suggesting that these samples represent two different airfall deposits from a single volcanic eruption. However, for the remainder of this manuscript, these deposits will be referred to collectively as the Gronau alkaline tuff.\nTable 1.\nMajor elements. Major oxide compositions of the green aphyric tuff (GGU421564A) and of melt inclusions in sanidine and clinopyroxene from the brown, crystal-rich tuff (GGU421564B) are given in Table 2. The high loss on ignition (LOI= 8.4 wt%) for the whole rock analysis is consistent with hydration accompanying alteration of glass and formation of clays and zeolites. In contrast, analyses of melt inclusions within crystals have major oxide totals between 96 and 97 wt%. Petrographic and backscattered electron images show that melt inclusions are compositionally homogeneous and do not show evidence of devitrification, leaking, or crystallization. Analysed inclusions were light brown or light green in colour. Melt inclusions in diopside and sodian sanidine are compositionally distinct. Analyses of 16 inclusions in sodian sanidine contain between 55 and 57 wt% SiO2. The melt inclusion in diopside contains c. 48 wt% SiO2. All inclusions are alkali-rich, with total alkali elements (Na2O+K2O) ranging from 11– 15 wt%. The most alkaline and silica-rich inclusions are in sodian sanidine.\nCompositions of the analysed melt inclusions are presented graphically in Fig. 6 in terms of Na2O+K2O as a function of SiO2 (after Cox et al. 1979; Le Bas et al. 1986). The melt inclusion in diopside has the composition of phonolitic nephelinite, whereas the compositions of the melt inclusions in sodian sanidine are phonolitic (Fig. 6). The measured Mg no. (Mg no.=100*Mg/(Mg+Fe)) in the diopside inclusion (41) is higher than those of inclusions in sodian sanidine which range from 15 to 21 (Table 2). Volatile contents (Cl, F, and H2O) of melt inclusions in sanidine and diopside are reported in Table 2. The water content of a sanidine melt inclusion is 0.78 wt%\nand the F concentration is 0.73 wt%. The average chlorine concentration is 0.47 wt% in the sanidine inclusions (average of 16 melt inclusion analyses) and 0.26 wt% in the diopside inclusion.\nTrace elements. Trace element concentrations from a wholerock sample of the aphyric tuff (GGU421564A) and a melt inclusion in a sanidine crystal from the crystal-rich tuff (GGU421564B) are given in Table 3. The Gronau alkaline tuff is enriched in the large ion lithophile elements (LILE) Sr, Ba, and Rb and in incompatible elements compared to the basaltic tephra deposits (Fig. 2b and Table 3; Heister 1997). High (>600 ppm Sr) concentrations of LILE and extremely low concentrations (<100 ppm) of Ni, Cr, Sc, and V in the Gronau alkaline tuff (Table 3) are consistent with a highly fractionated magma from which large quantities of olivine and clinopyroxene crystallized.\nThe measured whole rock 87Sr/86Sr of the green aphyric unit (GGU421564A) of the Gronau alkaline tuff is 0.70448 0.00002. The age-corrected initial ratio (87Sr/ 86Srinitial) at 54 Ma is 0.7040 ( Rb=1.42 10\n11 a 1). Comparison of the Gronau alkaline tuff 87Sr/86Sr ratio with the range for the surrounding basaltic lavas of the Skrænterne formation (0.7032–0.7036; Carter et al. 1979; Holm 1988) indicates a significant difference in 87Sr/86Sr ratios between the tuff and the lavas.\nWhole-rock, chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the Gronau alkaline tuff are compared in Fig. 7 with the range reported for the surrounding basaltic lavas (Skrænterne Formation; Tegner et al. 1998b) and to two North Sea tephras\nFig. 5.

The two Gronau alkaline tuff samples are almost identical in absolute and chondritic-normalized abundance, showing enrichment in L REE (200–600 times chondritic abundance) and in H REE (30–40 times chondritic abundance; Heister 1997). Concentrations of La, Ce, and Eu in a melt inclusion in sodian sanidine and in the whole rock are similar, indicating that alteration has not significantly changed the REE concentration. The lack of an Eu anomaly and high LILE concentrations imply that plagioclase was not a significant fractionating phase during magma evolution. The Gronau alkaline tuff has a high LREE/HREE ratio ([La/Yb]CN=22.8). By comparison, the surrounding flood basalts have low LREE/ HREE ratios ([La/Yb]CN between 1.0 and 3.5; Tegner et al. 1998b).\n40Ar/39Ar Age determination. Dating of individual inclusionfree sodian sanidine crystals from the brown, crystal-rich tuff (sample GGU421564B) yielded an average age of 53.8 0.3 Ma (2 uncertainty; Fig. 8). The isochron age (53.8 0.2 Ma; MSWD=0.18) shown in Fig. 8a and the apparent age (53.8 Ma) defined by the average of four congruent total fusion ages (Fig. 8b) are coincident. The 40Ar/36Ar intercept is 328 65 (Fig. 8a), which indicates that the sample has inherited little atmospheric argon. Therefore, the age of the tuff, its stratigraphic position, and the amount of erosion (c. 400 m) estimated from zeolite assemblages (Neuhoff et al. 1997) indicate that the Gronau alkaline tuff was erupted at 53.8 0.3 Ma, late in the development of the flood basalt sequence. According to the algorithm given by Dalrymple et al. (1993), our age of the Gronau alkaline tuff is equivalent to 55.0 0.3 Ma relative to the Fish Canyon Tuff (FCT-3)"

    "text": "Field relations, mineralogy, and geochemistry of volcanic deposits exposed in the Gronau West Nunatak demonstrate that pyroclastic eruptions were common during the extrusion of the Geikie Plateau Formation, but were less common during deposition of the Rømer Fjord Formation and increase slightly in abundance in the overlying Skrænterne Formation. Based on field evidence and glass shard morphology, we interpret the basaltic tephra horizons as variably reworked phreatomagmatic deposits. These were produced by interaction between basaltic lavas and meteoric water, which was also responsible for the generation of sporadic hyaloclastites throughout the sequence (Larsen et al. 1989). Previously, these tephra deposits have been desribed as ‘red partings’, ‘boles’, or fossil soil horizons derived by in situ weathering of the lava (Wager 1947; Brooks & Nielsen 1982; Larsen et al. 1989). Compositions of plagioclase and clinopyroxene crystals, ratios of incompatible and immobile elements Zr and Y, and the concentrations of TiO2 and Sr indicate that the basaltic tephras are mineralogically and chemically similar to the surrounding tholeiitic flood basalts.\nThe Gronau alkaline pyroclastic tuff, in contrast, contains crystals from both nephelinite and phonolite magmas. Melt inclusions in sanidine and diopside crystals are compositionally distinct (Fig. 6). The presence of vesiculated pumice and lithic clasts suggests that the tuff was produced by an explosive magmatic eruption. Incompatible elements, REE, and strontium isotope ratios of the alkaline tuff are distinctly different from those of the basaltic tephra deposits and the basaltic lavas within the Gronau West stratigraphic sequence. The mineralogy, chemistry, age, and frequency of basaltic and alkaline deposits within the flood basalt sequence clearly demonstrate that compositionally variable explosive volcanism occurred during the height of continental rifting and was contemporaneous with the eruption of massive volumes of basaltic lava (c. 57–54 Ma). Below, we discuss possible volcanic sources of tephras on the Gronau West Nunatak and their relationship to tephra deposits from North Sea cores and exposures in northern Europe.\nSources of the basaltic tephra deposits Local sources of the flood basalt lavas preserved on the Gronau West Nunatak are also the likely volcanic sources for the interlayered basaltic tephras. The basalt formations comprising the middle series lavas of East Greenland have been correlated by Pederson et al. (1997) to multiple eruption sites (see Fig. 1). Within the Geikie Plateau Formation, two proposed volcanic source sites are <50 km south of the Gronau West Nunatak, and other volcanic sources are approximately 40–150 km NNW of the nunatak (Pedersen et al. 1997). Within the Skrænterne Formation, one possible source of both the lavas and tephras of the Gronau West Nunatak is the volcanic neck exposed northeast of our measured section (Pedersen et al. 1997). The significant reduction in tephra deposits in the younger Rømer Fjord Formation relative to the underlying Geikie Plateau Formation may be due to factors such as less access to near-surface water at the eruption sites or changes in\nwind direction. To date, however, systematic investigation of the thickness and aerial extent of individual tephra horizons has not been conducted, precluding construction of tephra isopach maps and definitive correlation to proposed sources. Based on observations of historic phreatomagmatic basaltic eruptions at Tarawera, New Zealand (Walker et al. 1984), and Crater Hill, New Zealand (Houghton et al. 1996), the basaltic tephras described here were probably erupted from volcanic sources for the flood basalt lavas and were deposited mostly near their eruption sites.\nSource of the Gronau alkaline pyroclastic tuff At least 20 intrusive subvolcanic and plutonic complexes have been identified in the early Tertiary igneous province of East Greenland (Deer 1976; Brooks & Nielsen 1982; Nielsen 1987). They are distributed from Myggbukta to Sulugssut located 500 km north and 375 km SSW, respectively, of the Gronau West Nunatak. The majority of these intrusions can be eliminated as possible sources because their age and mineralogy do not match that of the Gronau alkaline tuff. The presence of perovskite in the tuff also limits the possible sources to undersaturated intrusive centers because perovskite is only stable at very low silica activities and is restricted to nephelinites, melilites, and carbonatites (Carmichael et al. 1974). Furthermore, the presence of sanidine indicates an evolved felsic magma. Such rocks have been found to date in East Greenland only at the Sulugssut complex (Brooks et al. 1989) and the Gardiner complex (Nielsen 1979, 1980, 1994). Sulugssut has an age of approximately 57.8 Ma (adjusted to TCR flux monitor, M. Storey, pers. comm.; Fig. 9a) which is significantly older than our age for the Gronau alkaline tuff (53.8 0.3 Ma). The Gardiner complex, on the other hand, has a K–Ar age of 53.9 1.1 Ma (Fig. 9a; Noble et al. 1988), which overlaps with measured age of 53.8 0.3 Ma for the Gronau tuff.\nThe Gronau alkaline tuff and intrusive rocks of the Gardiner melanephelinite-carbonatite subvolcanic complex are mineralogically and geochemically similar. Exposures of the Gardiner complex represent the interior of a melanephelinite– carbonatite volcano where the volcanic edifice and related extrusive products have been removed by erosion (Nielsen 1994). Strontium isotope ratios are similar between the Gronau alkaline tuff (0.7040; Table 3) and the Gardiner complex (0.7037–0.7062; Nielsen & Buchardt 1985; Nielsen & Holm 1993). The average (87Sr/86Sr)initial isotope ratio for uncontaminated magmas of the Gardiner complex is 0.7040 (Nielsen & Holm 1993). Within the Gardiner complex, middle-stage peralkaline syenites (Nielsen 1979) and Trend G dykes of Nielsen (1994) have mineral assemblages (Ti-aegirine, K-rich perthite, albite, microcline, Mg-katophorite, biotite, titanite, nepheline, apatite, and ilmenite) similar to those of the phonolitic component of the Gronau alkaline tuff. The composition of amphiboles and Ti-aegirine from the tuff and the Gardiner syenites are nearly identical (Table 4). Mineralogical similarities are also present between the tuff and older Trend R dykes (regional dyke swarm) which represent the earliest melanephelinitic magmas within the complex (Nielsen 1994). Compositions of diopside in the tuff and in Trend R dykes are nearly identical (Table 4) and both lithologies contain perovskite. Trend G dykes evolved from primitive members of Trend R dykes under vapour-deficient conditions, but continued to evolve to water-saturated phonolitic compositions,\nallowing for crystallization of hydrous minerals (Nielsen 1994). The mixed phonolitic ash now exposed on the Gronau Nunatak could have resulted from a plinian-style, volatile-rich eruption from the Gardiner complex. Phenocrysts (sanidine, Mg-katophorite, and biotite) characteristic of the Trend G\nassemblage could have mixed with crystals such as perovskite and diopside, which represent crystallization products of the earlier, less evolved magmas of Trend R. We conclude that age, mineralogical, and geochemical similarities strongly suggest that the Gronau alkaline tuff was erupted from the\n17, North Sea Phase 2.2a, and the Gronau alkaline tuff.

Reconstruction based on Skogseid et al.

Knox & Morton (1988) report two main periods of tephra deposition based on core samples from the North Sea, which they designate Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 occurs in nannoplankton zones (NP) 5–6 (Fig. 9a) and is older than main flood basalt lavas in East Greenland, but is roughly equivalent to the basaltic volcanism in the Hebridean Province (56–62 Ma; Musset et al. 1988). Knox (1997) further subdivided Phase 2 into Phase 2.1, found mostly in NP9, Phases 2.2a, 2.2b, and 2.2c in NP10, and Phase 3 in NP11-12 (see Fig. 9a). The majority of tephra deposits in the North Sea were deposited during Phase 2.2b and are Fe-Ti tholeiites. These deposits have been correlated to a series of c. 200 basaltic tephras in the ‘Mo-Clay’ in Denmark described by Bøgglid (1918) and Andersen (1937). Variations in regional thickness, age, and mineralogy of these basaltic tephras led Knox & Morton (1988) to postulate that their volcanic source lay to the north or NW in East Greenland. The majority of basaltic tephras preserved on the Gronau West Nunatak are within the Geikie Plateau Formation, which is time equivalent to Phase 2.1 as shown in Fig. 9a. The hiatus in tephra deposition in the North Sea sediments between phases 2.1 and 2.2 appears to correlate in East Greenland to the Rømer Fjord Formation. At Gronau West Nunatak, we have identified only one basaltic tephra in the upper Rømer Fjord Formation (see Figs 2b and 9a). The basaltic tephras reported in Phases 2.2a and 2.2b are roughly time equivalent to the East Greenland Skrænterne Formation. In the Gronau West stratigraphy, erosion of c. 400 m of the Skrænterne Formation may have removed much of the section correlative to Phase 2.2b. Correlation of basaltic tephra deposits among East Greenland, the North Sea, and the Danish Mo-Clay (Fig. 9a)\nsuggest periods during the opening of the North Atlantic ocean characterized by abundant mafic pyroclastic eruptions. These tephra deposits were produced by similar eruptive processes but were probably derived from local sources and thus, individual tephras are not necessarily regionally correlative.\nUnlike the numerous basaltic tephras of the North Atlantic igneous province, chemically-evolved tephras (ranging in composition from rhyolites to dacites to phonolites) are infrequent in the regional stratigraphy, and therefore are readily correlated based on their unique chemistry and mineralogy (Pedersen et al. 1975; Knox 1984; Knox & Morton 1988; Morton & Knox 1990; Emeleus et al. 1996). Morton & Knox correlated one tephra horizon in Phase 2.2a and one in Phase 2.2b in three boreholes (Fig. 9b; 81/46A, 16/7a-2, and 25/8-1) to Danish tephras 17 and +19 in the Mo-Clay, respectively (Bøgglid 1918; Pedersen et al. 1975). Single-crystal laser-fusion 40Ar/39Ar ages from sanidine by Swisher & Knox (1993) for tephras 17 and +19 are 53.7 0.1 Ma and 53.2 Ma 0.5 Ma, respectively (ages have been converted to TCR flux monitor). Both are within the uncertainty of our age for the Gronau alkaline tuff (Fig. 9a). In addition, rare earth element patterns for these North Sea alkaline tephras and the Gronau alkaline tuff are strikingly similar (Fig. 8).\nDanish tephras 17 and +19 in the Mo-clay are of critical importance because they are used to calibrate the geomagnetic polarity time scale (see Fig. 9a). In DSDP hole 550 (Goban Spur), Berggren et al. (1995) correlate tephras 17 and +19 directly to two deposits in this borehole. Viereck et al. (1988) also noted mineralogical and stratigraphic similarities between deposits at ODP drill site 642 (Fig 9b; Vøring Plateau) and Danish tephras 17 and +19. The majority of correlations have been made based on stratigraphy and mineralogy, specifically, on the occurrence of Na-pyroxene (aegirine). Although detailed analyses have not been performed, the unique mineral assemblage of tephra 17 (sanidine, Ti-aegirine, katophorite, and perovskite) is nearly identical to that of the Gronau alkaline tuff. Table 4 shows the similarity in the compositions of Ti-aegirine from a tephra layer in borehole 81/46A, from Danish tephra 17, from the Gronau alkaline tuff, and from a syenite sheet of the Gardiner complex. Based on geochemical, mineralogical, and age correlations, we propose\nthat the Gronau alkaline tuff is a direct equivalent to Danish tephra 17, and is therefore, equivalent to the alkaline tephra horizon in North Sea boreholes, on the southeast England shore, on the Goban Spur and possibly on the Vøring Plateau.\nThe widespread distribution of this alkaline tephra requires a Plinian-scale eruption. As discussed previously, we suggest that the Gardiner alkaline complex was the source of this regionally distributed deposit, although we cannot rule out a similar, yet undiscovered, volcanic source of identical age and composition. Because this alkaline tephra deposit was apparently widely dispersed and is easily identified by its unique mineralogy and composition, it is likely to be found in other East Greenland exposures. It may serve as a reliable regional time-stratigraphic marker for onshore and offshore sequences at c. 54 Ma (Fig. 9a). In contrast, the presence of numerous tephras within the North Atlantic stratigraphic record which have mineral assemblages different from those of the Gronau tuff suggest that other felsic volcanoes were also active during rifting. For example, felsic tephra horizons within the timeequivalent stratigraphy of the main flood basalt lavas that are not similar to the Gronau alkaline tuff include Danish ashes +19 (dacite) and 33 (liparite), a trachyandesite tephra in Phase 2.2a, and rhyolite and trachyte tephras in Phase 2.2b (Bøgglid 1918; Andersen 1937; Pedersen et al. 1975; Morton & Knox 1990; Knox 1997). None of these deposits can be related compositionally to any exposed lithologies in the Gardiner complex. Based on stratigraphic location, they were erupted both before and after Danish tephra 17/Gronau alkaline tuff. Although detailed geochemical studies of these felsic tephras are lacking, their stratigraphic and regional distribution during early Tertiary continental rifting suggests that gas-rich plinian eruptions from multiple felsic volcanoes occurred during eruption of the basaltic lavas and must have vented volatiles to the atmosphere."

    "heading": "Concluding remarks",
    "text": "The alkaline and basaltic tephras of this study were erupted during a period of significant global warming in the late Paleocene and early Eocene. One event during this period, called the Late Palaeocene Thermal Maximum (LPTM) at c. 55.5 Ma (Fig. 9a), is evident in deep-sea cores by sharp negative excursions in 13C and 18O isotope ratios in fossil planktonic foraminifera and nannofossils. This event has been correlated with the extinction of benthic foraminifera and with a rapid rise in deep ocean temperatures (e.g. Kennett & Stott 1991; Zachos et al. 1993; Thomas & Shackleton 1996). One recent explanation for the LPTM event, based primarily on carbon isotope ratios and mass balance estimates, is massive melting of oceanic methane hydrates (e.g. Dickens et al. 1995; Dickens et al. 1997; Bralower et al. 1997). Estimates of CO2 flux based on degassing of basaltic lavas show that mafic volcanism alone could not have shifted the carbon isotope signature (Varekamp et al. 1992; Dickens et al. 1995; Dickens et al. 1997). Although the dissociation of methane hydrate is a good explanation for the isotopic shift associated with the LPTM, causes for long-term global atmosphere and deep sea warming that would lead to a substantial change in sediment geotherms and melting of oceanic hydrates are less clear. It has been postulated that high-latitude volcanism, combined with sub-tropical explosive volcanism, contributed to atmospheric warming and changes in ocean circulation (Rea et al. 1990;\nEldholm & Thomas 1993; Bralower et al. 1997). However, quantitative estimates of volatile production from both basaltic and felsic volcanism in the North Atlantic region during the early Tertiary are lacking.\nThe geochemical and stratigraphic evidence presented here suggests that early Tertiary eruptions from evolved alkaline and felsic pyroclastic volcanoes in East Greenland were more frequent and regionally extensive than previously thought. This study indicates that at least one carbonatite/ melanephelinite volcano was active during continental rifting and produced at least one large plinian eruption, in this case, after the LPTM event. The wide dispersal distance (>1000 km) implies a high eruption column, which must have supplied both ash and volatiles to the troposphere and/or stratosphere. We have not attempted to estimate the CO2 production associated with the Gardiner eruption that deposited the Gronau alkaline tuff. We note, however, that carbonatite volcanoes such as Oldoinyo Lengai in East Africa have measured fumarolic gases with up to 74 wt% CO2 (Koepenick et al. 1996) and may potentially supply a large pulse of CO2 to the atmosphere during a relatively short eruption time. In addition, gas fluxes from carbonatite-alkaline volcanic complexes in the Deccan flood basalt province have been invoked to explain the climate change and the resulting extinction during the Maastrichtian (Ray & Pande 1999).\nStudies of the Gardiner complex (Nielsen 1980, 1994) indicate that several generations of magma were emplaced prior to the intrusion of Trend G dikes that are apparently associated with the alkaline tuff eruption. It is therefore likely that the volcano was active and venting volatiles to the atmosphere during the late Paleocene. The data presented here and additional evidence in the North Atlantic stratigraphic record for tephras produced by explosive volcanism suggest that estimates of gas flux during North Atlantic rifting may be underestimated and should be reappraised. Additional age dating, geochemical characterization, and correlation of pyroclastic deposits in East Greenland, the North Atlantic, and in northern Europe will provide better quantitative estimates of the size, aerial extent, and climatic impact of explosive volcanism during the early Tertiary.\nThe field work for this study was conducted by D.K.B., P.A.O., and P.S.N. during the 1995 expedition to East Greenland funded by the Danish Lithosphere Centre and the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.

  "abstractText": "Stratigraphic, geochemical and mineralogical characterization of pyroclastic deposits on the Gronau West Nunatak of East Greenland indicates that both alkaline and basaltic tephras occurred during the eruption of flood basalts associated with the opening of the North Atlantic ocean in the early Tertiary. Within the exposed section of Gronau West Nunatak, c. 1 km thick representing c. 1.6 Ma, 17 of the horizons are phreatomagmatic basaltic tephras. Near the top of the section, an alkaline tuff was dated at 53.8 0.3 Ma by Ar/Ar method. This tuff contains a distinctive mineralogy (sanidine, Mgkatophorite, aegirine) and geochemistry (melt inclusion compositions, and trace and rare earth element abundances) that indicate it was erupted from the Gardiner melanephelinite-carbonatite volcanic complex located 175 km to the SE, which was active from c. 55 to 52 Ma. The alkaline tuff can be correlated to age-equivalent, compositionally similar alkaline pyroclastic horizons reported in North Atlantic sediment cores and in outcrops in Northern Europe, making it an important regional time-stratigraphic marker. This study indicates that North Atlantic explosive volcanic events were prevalent, regionally widespread, and originated in East Greenland during continental rifting, suggesting the need for reappraisal of the impact of North Atlantic volcanism on climate change during the early Tertiary.",
