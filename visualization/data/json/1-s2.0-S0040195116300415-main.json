About 2700m of Carnian to Bajocian sedimentary rocks is documented in the Meizhou region, Guangdong Province. The Carnian to Rhaetian sequence is characterized by deltaic facies that are succeeded by Hettangian fluvial, shallow marine and volcaniclastic facies, and by Sinemurian to early Toarcian interdistributary bay and floodplain facies. The late Toarcian to Bajocian sequence comprises proximal alluvial to lacustrine facies that changed upwards to fluvial facies. Fossil assemblages indicate that climatic conditions changed from tropical/subtropical warm humid, to temperate humid, and then to hot arid through the Late Triassic to the Middle Jurassic. Climatically induced changes (e.g., in precipitation, vegetation and erosion) exerted a strong influence on sediment supply, whereas tectonics played a dominant role in stratigraphic evolution, accommodation generation, sedimentation pattern and volcanism. Tectonostratigraphic analysis shows that the T3–J2 basin was initiated on an orogenic belt during late-stage orogeny, and evolved into shallow-marine and volcanic environments and then back to terrestrial facies during the post-orogenic stage. This was followed by regional uplift and the development of a basin-andrange province. The order of these events is similar to that of the central Rocky Mountains, western North America during the Palaeogene. The Mesozoic basin of South China and the Eocene basins of the central Rocky Mountains highlight the importance of subduction-related subsidence above young and broad orogens.\n© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Shallow-marine platform carbonates and coal-bearing siliciclastic sedimentary sequences developed on the southeastern South China Block during the Late Palaeozoic (Liu and Xu, 1994; Wang, 1985). Those sequenceswere followed by a period of Late Permian to EarlyMesozoic deformation, metamorphism and magmatism that is known as the Indosinian Orogeny (Cui and Li, 1983; Hsu et al., 1990; Li and Li, 2007; Li, 1998; Pang et al., 2014; Ren, 1984; Wang et al., 2005b; Wang et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2006). Li and Li (2007) and Li et al. (2012) proposed that the Indosinian Orogeny initiated at ca. 280Ma at the onset of subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Ocean, proceeding into a period of flatslab subduction during the ca. 250–190 Ma period. This resulted in the formation of a 1300 km-wide magmatic fold-thrust (i.e., orogenic) belt recording a northwestward younging of magmatism and deformation in southeastern South China. In contrast, Zhou et al. (2006)\nuilin University of Technology,\n.\nconsidered that 250–205 Ma granitoids in the region were generated by collision between the South China Block and the Indochina Block, followed at ca. 180Ma by subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Ocean. Nonetheless, orogenic movements were interpreted to have ended by ca. 195–190 Ma (Li and Li, 2007; Zhu et al., 2010).\nA Late Triassic to Early Jurassic (T3–J1) basin formed on top of the Indosinian Orogen, evolving from terrestrial to shallow-marine and then back to terrestrial environments (Fig. 1A; Li and Li, 2007; Liu and Xu, 1994; Pang et al., 2014; Wang, 1985). The T3–J1 basin was interpreted to be a sag basin (Li and Li, 2007) or a post-orogenic basin developed during late stage Indosinian Orogeny (Shu et al., 2009). Deposition in the T3–J1 basin was followed by terrestrial fault-bounded red-bed sedimentation and extensive magmatism throughout eastern South China from the Middle Jurassic to the Cretaceous (Pang et al., 2014; Shu et al., 2004, 2009; Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhou et al., 2006), in what is commonly referred to as a basin-and-range type province (Gilder et al., 1991; Li and Li, 2007) or an intracontinental extensional basin (Shu et al., 2009). New field and geochronological investigations show that the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic deposits are conformably overlain by the early Middle Jurassic terrestrial succession (named the\nT3–J2 basin hereafter), which is overlain disconformably by late Middle Jurassic-Cretaceous strata in northeastern Guangdong Province (Figs. 1B–C and 2; GDBGMR, 1988, 1996; Guo et al., 2012; Pang et al., 2014; Shu et al., 2009). Therefore, the T3–J2 basin spans late-stage orogeny and post-orogenic extension (Pang et al., 2014), such that its stratigraphic architecture andhistory are key to anunderstanding of tectonic processes and basin evolution behind active convergent continental margins.\nThe Indosinian Orogeny records important climatic changes throughout southeastern South China. For instance, coal-bearing siliciclastic sequences of Late Permian age or of Late Triassic–Early Jurassic age are overlain by the Middle Jurassic to Cretaceous red-beds. Palaeontological and geochemical data indicate a climatic change from warm humid during the Late Triassic to hot arid during the Middle Jurassic-Cretaceous (Qian et al., 1987; Xiong et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010, 2012). However, the role of such climatic change on depositional systems within the T3–J2 basin is poorly constrained.\nLate Triassic to early Middle Jurassic (T3–J2) sedimentary rocks are widely distributed throughout southeastern South China, but are particularly well preserved and continuously exposed in the Gaosi-Songxi sections, Meizhou region, northeastern Guangdong Province (Fig. 1B– C), despite poor preservation in places due to weathering and\nvegetation cover. Therefore, the aims of this paper are to: (1) reconstruct the temporal and spatial evolution of depositional environments in southeastern South China; (2) evaluate the relative importance of climatic and tectonic controls on sedimentation; and (3) provide insights into the link between evolving palaeogeography and lithospheric processes. Thework presented here builds on the field and laboratory studies reported in Pang (2014)."

    "text": "The South China Block comprises the Yangtze Block to the northwest and the Cathaysia Block to the southeast. Collision between the two blocks during the Early Neoproterozoic (1200–880 Ma) produced the present-day South China Block (Li et al., 2002; Li et al., 2008). The studied section in Jiaoling County,Meizhou region, northeastern Guangdong Province is located in the south-central Cathaysia Block (Fig. 1B; GDBGMR, 1971). Upper Palaeozoic–Lower Mesozoic strata comprise Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, Upper Carboniferous–Lower Permian carbonates, Middle to Upper Permian coal-bearing siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, and Lower Triassic carbonates and mudstones (Fig. 1C; GDBGMR, 1971, 1988), which are collectively defined as foreland deposits (Li and Li, 2007).\nThe T3–J2 siliciclastic sedimentary rocks overlie the foreland deposits on an angular unconformity, and are overlain by lateMiddle JurassicCretaceous volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Gaojiping Group) on a disconformity (Fig. 2; GDBGMR, 1971; Guo et al., 2012). Mesozoic granites are widespread in the region, whereas Mesozoic-aged mafic intrusions, i.e., the ca. 195 Ma Xialan complex, are reported to the west of the study area (Fig. 1B; Zhu et al., 2010).\nThe Gaosi-Songxi sections crop out along a county road between Gaosi and Baidu (Fig. 1C). Strata were measured in the field to a resolution of 5–10 cm. Because good exposures are generally between 5 and 30 mwide in road cuttings, this study relies primarily on vertical variations of sedimentary facies. Fossils found in the section were identified in the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nStratigraphic subdivision of T3–J2 strata in southeastern South China has evolved recently with the availability of new age constraints. Four formations (Xiaoping, Jinji, Qiaoyuan and Zhangping) have previously been defined that span the lower to upper parts of themeasured section\n(Fig. 2). For this study, we redefine the age limits of some of the formations based on new geochronological data (Fig. 2).\nThe Xiaoping Formation overlies Lower Triassic or older rocks on an angular unconformity (Fig. 2; GDBGMR, 1988), and is composed of conglomerates, sandstones, shales andmudstones. The chronostratigraphic equivalent of the Xiaoping Formation in northern Guangdong Province is the Genkou Group, which contains Carnian-Rhaetian brackish to shallow-marine bivalves (e.g., Guangdongella-Bakevelloides, Palaeophorus-Oxytoma and Jiangxiella-Modiolus assemblages) and fossil plants (e.g., Ptilozamites-Lepidopteris assemblage; GDBGMR, 1988, 1996; Qian et al., 1987; Zhou, 1989; Zhou and Zhou, 1983). CarnianRhaetian bivalves (e.g., Bakevelloids hekiensis, Palaeopharus oblongatus and Pleuromya oblongata) and fossil plants are also present in the Xiaoping Formation in central Guangdong Province south of the study area (Fig. 2; GDBGMR, 1996), but only fossil plants (the PtilozamitesLepidopteris assemblage) were found in the Meizhou region. The Xiaoping Formation is interpreted to be of Carnian to Rhaetian age (ca. 235 to 201 Ma; Fig. 2).\nLower Jurassic shallow-marine siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are generally assigned to the Jinji Formation in Guangdong Province. In the studied section, the Jinji Formation, which conformably overlies the Xiaoping Formation, comprises conglomerates, sandstones and mudstones in its lower to middle parts, and volcanic rocks in its uppermost part (GDBGMR, 1971). Shallow-marine bivalves, such as Cardinia toriyamai Hayami, Hiatella cf. arenicola Terquem present in this Formation are interpreted to be of Hettangian to Sinemurian age (Chen, 1987; GDBGMR, 1996). A tuff sample from the uppermost part of this formation has a SHRIMP zircon 206Pb/238U age of 199 ± 1.9 Ma (Fig. 3; Appendix Table S1), consistent with the biostratigraphic age. Thus, the Jinji Formation in the Meizhou region was deposited from the Hettangian to early Sinemurian (ca. 201 to 199 Ma; Fig. 2), a much shorter interval than the Jinji Formation in northern and central Guangdong Province (Hettangian to early Pliensbachian; GDBGMR, 1988, 1996; Qian et al., 1987).\nConformably overlying the Jinji Formation, the Qiaoyuan Formation chiefly comprises sandstones and mudstones, and is in turn conformably overlain by the Zhangping Formation (Fig. 2; GDBGMR, 1988; Zhang, 1985). The Qiaoyuan Formation was previously considered to be of late Pliensbachian to Toarcian age (GDBGMR, 1988). Detrital zircon U–Pb ages from a sandstone sample collected in the upper part of the Formation establish a maximum depositional age of ca. 182 Ma (Pang, 2014). Thus, the Qiaoyuan Formation was probably deposited from the Sinemurian to the early Toarcian in this region (ca. 199 to 182 Ma; Fig. 2).\nThe Zhangping Formation comprises tuffaceous conglomerates, sandstones, mudstones and siltstones, and is overlain by the Gaojiping Group volcaniclastic and volcanic rocks on an unconformity (Fig. 2; GDBGMR, 1988, 1996). LA-ICPMS zircon U–Pb age dating indicates that the age of the Gaojiping Group is ca. 168–145 Ma (Guo et al., 2012). Consequently, the Zhangping Formation is interpreted to have been deposited between the late Toarcian and the Bajocian (ca. 182 to 168 Ma; Fig. 2)."

    "text": "This association, identified in the 1st and 2nd units, comprises massive mudstones and siltstones (Mm), carbonaceous mudstones and shales (C), massive sandstones (Sm) and lenticular bedded sandstones (St) (Fig. 4; Table 1). Mudstone beds are from 8 cm- to several 10's of cm-thick, whereas sandstone beds vary from 5 to 80 cm-thick. Sandstones range in grain size from fine- to coarse-grained, with lenticular bedding, pyrite nodules and thin coal-seams (about 10 cm-thick). The association is dominated by siltstones, mudstones and carbonaceous mudstones, particularly in the 2ndunit. The thickness of this association is respectively about 115 m and about 130 m in the 1st and the 2nd units. Poorly to well preserved fossil plants are present in these units.\nMassive mudstones and siltstones are attributed to suspension deposition with little or no current activity. These mudrock-dominated units are interpreted to have formed in a prodelta environment, where fossil plants may have been introduced by river processes. Absence of marine fossil implies that the deltaic system may have prograded into a lacustrine setting. The lowermost part of the Xiaoping Formation is not exposed, however, it was reported to be composed of conglomerates and sandstones with a thickness of tens of metres (GDBGMR, 1988), and which represent basal fluvial deposits."

    "heading": "3.1.2. Delta-front facies association",

Sandstone beds are 20 cm- to 1.5 m-thick, and dark grey to yellowish white in colour. No fossils were found.\nThis association is interpreted to be the product of a delta-front on the basis of lithofacies and stacking patterns (cf., Bhattacharya, 2010). Coarsening-upward trends, defined by upward change from mud-rich to sand-rich facies, are interpreted to record delta progradation. The absence of obvious sedimentary structures indicates that sands settled quickly before being reworked by wave and tidal processes, implying rapid deposition of sand-laden currents in a fluvial-dominated deltaic setting."

    "heading": "3.1.3. Delta-plain fluvial facies association",
    "text": "A package of fining-upward rhythms (3rd unit) is present in the upper part of the Xiaoping Formation. For each rhythm, conglomerates\nand pebbly coarse-grained sandstones are present in the lower part, whereas siltstones, mudstones and shales make up the upper part, showing a fining-upward pattern (Fig. 4).\nTwo types of conglomerate are present: (1) massive, sorted, clastsupported cobble-pebble conglomerate (Gcm); and (2) matrixsupported, poorly sorted pebble-sandy conglomerate (Gmg) (Table 1; Fig. 4). Clasts are commonly rounded to sub-rounded, and composed of quartzite, sandstone, chert and granite, ranging from 20 to 10 cm in size in beds that fine upwards (Fig. 7A). Conglomerate beds range from 10’s of cm to 5 m in thickness, and laterally pinch out in some places. There is no clast imbrication, whereas normal grading is present in Gmg. Basal contacts of conglomerates are generally erosional and sharp, whereas top contacts are always gradational (Fig. 7B). Sandstones vary from fine to pebbly coarse-grained, with planar bedding, horizontal lamination (Sh), planar cross-lamination (Sp), lenticular bedding and trough cross-stratification (St) (Table 1), with shale and mudstone lenses and clasts within bedsets. Sandstone beds are generally 20 cm- to 2 m-thick. Palaeocurrents, calculated by the EZ-ROSE program (Baas, 2000), indicate that palaeoflow was initially to the southwest but then to the northeast during the Late Triassic (Fig. 4). The upper part of each upward-fining unit comprises mainly Mm, along with minor horizontal lamination mudstones (Mh), varying from 10 cm- to 2 m-thick in individual beds. The maximum proportion of mudrocks can reach 60%, implying a meandering fluvial style. Plant fossils are abundant in these mudrocks (Fig. 4).\nThe basal conglomerates are interpreted to have been deposited during high discharge in bedload channels (Miall, 1996; Ghazi and Mountney, 2009). Pinch-out conglomerate beds represent gravel lags on channel bases. Poorly sorted conglomerates possibly relate to high river discharges and short transport distances. The channel bases show only slightly curved surfaces without evident disconformities (Fig. 7B), implying that the basin underwent no major episodes of degradation (Hajek et al., 2012). Lateral pinch-out sandstone beds are interpreted to be point-bar deposits of fluvial channels (Fig. 7B; Ghazi and Mountney, 2009; Miall, 1996). Planar and horizontal crosslaminations are interpreted to have formed during upper-flow regime in channels, and indicate either a peaked hydrograph or high channel sedimentation rates because otherwise theywould have been reworked by the waning flow stage (Fielding, 2006; Foreman et al., 2012). The massive mudstone is interpreted to have been deposited from suspension infloodplain areas (Alves et al., 2003). Thus, a delta-plain fluvial association is suggested for this unit, and the fining-upward trends could be the product of the lateral migration of river channels (Allen, 1964; Ghazi and Mountney, 2009). The abundance of plant fossils indicates\nthat water tables were high relative to local topography (Allen et al., 2013)."

Features of channel incision are present in outcrops (Fig. 7C). Conglomerates are pebbly, matrixsupported and poorly sorted, and sharply underlie thin mudstone beds (Fig. 7C–E). Palaeoflow directions interpreted from planar crosslaminations are to the north and northeast (Figs. 5 and 7F). Fossil plants are present but sparse. This association shows fining-upward to aggradational trends.\nSharp contacts between pebbly conglomerates and overlying mudstones (Fig. 7E) indicate that either subaerial or subaqueous erosion may have occurred. The ball-and-pillow structure is interpreted to have formed by gravitational loading of sandstones (Fig. 7D; Mills, 1983; Collinson et al., 2006). The lithofacies and sedimentary structures are consistent with a fluvial origin for this association. In contrast to the fluvial association of the Xiaoping Formation, this unit is characterized by a lower proportion of mudrock and a scarcity of fossil plants (Figs. 4–5), implying that either fluvial styles or vegetation cover may have changed."

Mudstones and siltstone beds vary from 3 cm- to several 10's tens of cm-thick, and are dark grey, yellowish and brown (Fig. 8). Sheet-like tabular sandstone beds are present and range from 3 to 40 cm-thick. The conglomerate layer is only\n30 cm-thick in the studied sections. Shallow-marine bivalves are abundant in the lower part of this unit (Fig. 5; Appendix Table S2).\nThe massive mudstones are interpreted to have formed from suspension deposition (Miall, 1996). The tabular sandstone sheets were possibly deposited due to flood events, which rapidly spread the sands into the reservoir. A shallow-marine environment is interpreted for the Jinji Formation on the basis of lithofacies, fossils and sedimentary structures (Fig. 8). Thus, the Jinji Formation documents a third-order marine transgression during the Early Jurassic in the Meizhou region."

However, fossil plants (e.g., Nilssonia sp.) have been documented previously (GDBGMR, 1971). This unit is interpreted to have been deposited in a distributary bay. The massive mudstones and siltstones are interpreted to have been deposited from suspension, whereas the nested coarsening-upward rhythms are interpreted to represent infilling of the bay by overbank flooding (Elliott, 1974)."

Sandstones are very fine to coarsegrained, and vary from dark grey to white yellowish. Tabular sandstone beds are from 5 cm- to 10's cm-thick, showing thickening-upward trends (Fig. 9B). Mudrocks range from lenticular to very thick (1.5 m), and are dark to dark grey. Fossil plants and shell fragments are preserved scarcely, and sedimentary structures are uncommon (Fig. 5). This unit is covered by Late Jurassic volcanic rocks of the Gaojiping Group in the Gaosi section, but it is conformably overlain by the Zhangping Formation in Songxi town (Zhang, 1985; Fig. 1C).\nCoals are characteristic of marsh, swamp or mire deposits of fluvial plain and coastal environments (Aloui et al., 2012; McCabe, 1984).\nInterbedded siltstones and fine-grained sandstones (Fig. 9A) are interpreted to be fluvial levee deposits. The high proportion of mudrock in this unit suggests that depositional energies were relatively low, which is consistent with the absence of sedimentary structure. The presence of shell fragment indicates that the environment was occasionally influenced by marine processes. This association is interpreted to be the product of a flood plain setting. Nested sandstone sheets (Fig. 5) may have formed due to overbank flooding or crevassing."

The coexistence of conglomerates and fresh-water bivalve-bearing mudrocks implies that this facies association may have been deposited along a faultbounded margin of a lacustrine environment, as discussed below."

Sandstones are generally highly weathered such that primary sedimentary structures were not observed, although minor cross laminations are present. Fresh-water bivalves have been documented (GDBGMR, 1988).\nThe dominance of multicoloured mudrocks and tuffaceous rocks indicates that this unit may have formed in a shallow-water lake, with input of volcanic ashes. A lacustrine environment is thus postulated (e.g., GDBGMR, 1988), but more detailed field studies are required to support that interpretation."

Mudstones and siltstones are multicoloured, being dark grey, purple reddish, yellowish, brown grey and greenish grey (Fig. 9C–F). Sand-filled shrinkage cracks are preserved on the bedding surfaces of purple reddish mudstones (Fig. 9C). The uppermost part of the Zhangping Formation is unconformably overlain by the Upper Jurassic Gaojiping Group (Fig. 9F).\nA fluvial depositional environment is implied by lithofacies and stacking patterns (Miall, 1996, 2010). The tabular sandstones were probably deposited in bedload channels, whereas mudstones and siltstones were deposited on a flood plain. Shrinkage cracks can form not only by desiccation processes on subaerial surfaces but also by synaeresis processes in subaqueous environments (Plummer and Gostin, 1981). As well as shrinkage cracks, small sand-filled depressions are present on bedding planes, and these may be raindrop imprints. Thus, shrinkage cracks in this unit are interpreted to be of desiccation origin. Variegated colours may be due to fluctuations of groundwater during diagenetic processes following deposition: the fluctuations of the water table probably altered redoximorphic (oxidation–reduction) environments in the subsurface. Drab colours (grey, green and brown) were generated largely by the formation of ferrous oxides in a reducing environment, whereas red and yellow colours relate to the formation of ferric oxides (e.g., hematite) in oxidizing environments (Miall, 1996)."

    "text": "The floral assemblage of the T3–J2 strata mainly consists of the Cycadophytes, Filicales, Equisetales, Ginkgoales and Coniferophytes, together with the Pteridosperms and incertae sedis genera. Cycadophytes are represented by the genera Otozamites, Anomozamites,\nPterophyllum, Dictyozamites, Ptilophyllum, Nilssonia, Ctenis, Ctenozamites and Zamites (Figs. 10 and 11A–C). Filicales are characterized by the genera Dictyophyllum, Clathropteris, Todites, Cladophlebis, Danaeopsis, Marattiopsis, Thaumatopteris, Gleichemites, Phlebopteris and Coniopteris. Equisetales are represented by the genera Taeniocladopsis, Neocalamites and Equisetites, whereas Ginkgoales include the genera Sphenobaiera, Baiera, Phoenicopsis, Sagenopteris and Ginkgoites. Coniferophytes mainly comprise the genera Podozamites, Elatocladus and Pityophyllum. Pteridosperms are represented by the genera Ptilozamites, Lepidopteris and Thinnfeldia.\nIn the lower half of the Xiaoping Formation, the floral assemblage comprises 40 species, belonging to the Cycadophytes (13 taxa, 32.5%), Filicales (8 taxa, 20%), Equisetales (7 taxa, 17.5%), Pteridosperms (2 taxa, 5%), Ginkgoales (4 taxa, 10%), Coniferophytes (4 taxa, 10%;\nTable S2; Figs. 10 and S1) and incertae sedis (2 taxa, 5%). However, in the upper part of the Xiaoping Formation, the floral assemblage is more diverse (48 taxa) (Table S2; Figs. 10 and S1), comprising the Cycadophytes (24 taxa, 50%), Filicales (9 taxa, 19%), Equisetales (5 taxa, 10%), Ginkgoales (2 taxa, 4%), Coniferophytes (5 taxa, 10%), seed (1 taxon, 2%) and incertae sedis species (2 taxa, 4%). This Late Triassic floral assemblage in southeast South China is characterized by the genera Ptiozamites, Lepidopteris, Neocalamites, Dictyophyllum, Todites, Cladophlebis, Anomozamites, Pterophyllum, Nilssonia and Sphenobaiera, assigned as the Ptiozamites-Lepidopteris assemblage (Figs. 10 and S1; GDBGMR, 1988, 1996; Qian et al., 1987; Zhou and Zhou, 1983). Similar flora of Late Triassic age are documented in Sweden, eastern Greenland, Poland and Germany (Bonis et al., 2010 and references therein), and in eastern Russia (Volynets and Shorokhova, 2007).\nTwenty-eight species of plant fossils are recognized in the Jinji Formation, comprising the Filicales (10 taxa, 36%), Cycadophytes (5 taxa, 18%), Ginkgoales (4 taxa, 14%), Coniferophytes (4 taxa, 14%), Equisetales (3 taxa, 10%), Pteridosperms (1 taxon, 3.5%) and incertae sedis (1 taxon, 3.5%; Table S2; Figs. 10 and S2). Similarly, 32 species are identified in the Qiaoyuan Formation (Table S2; Figs. 10 and S2), comprising the Filicales (11 taxa, 34%), Cycadophytes (10 taxa, 31%), Equisetales (4 taxa, 13%), Coniferophytes (3 taxa, 9%), Ginkgoales (2 taxa, 6%), Pteridosperms (1 taxon, 3%) and incertae sedis (1 taxon, 3%). Fossils are rare in the Zhangping Formation; only a few species of the Cycadophytes (2 taxa, Nilssonia sp. and Otozamites sp.), Ginkgoales (2 taxa, Baiera sp. and Sphenobaiera sp.) and Filicales (1 taxon, Cladophlebis sp.), accompanied by fresh-water bivalves (Tutuella rotunda, Farganoconcha and Pseudocardinia sp.) were documented in the lower part (Table S2; Figs. 10 and S2; GDBGMR, 1988).\nShallow-marine bivalves (Cardinia tutchei Palmer, Cardinia elongate Dunker, Cardinia toriyamai Hayami, and Hiatella cf. arenicola Terquem) were found in mudstones in the Jinji Formation (Table S2; Figs. 10 and 11D–F). Species such as Saxicava arenicola Terquem (Hiatella arenicola Terquem), Saxicava arenicola, Mytilus sp., Pleuromya oblonga Fan and Nuculana sp. are also documented (GDBGMR, 1971). Hiatella cf.\narenicola Terquem and Cardinia toriyamai Hayami are characteristic species of the Jinji Formation."

    "text": "Fossil plants in the lower half of the Xiaoping Formation are poorly preserved, and may have been subjected to transport that would bias both the richness and the dominance-diversity relationship of the source forest (McElwain et al., 2007). In contrast, fossil plants in the upper half of the Xiaoping Formation are preserved in overbank mudstones and show little evidence of long-distance transportation, indicating primarily autochthonous burial. Nonetheless, fossil plants from both the lower and the upper parts are dominated by the Cycadophytes (33% and 50%, respectively), subordinated by the Filicales (20% and 19%) and Equisetales (18% and 10%) accompanied by the Coniferophytes (10% and 10%) andGinkgoales (10% and 4%), indicating similar richness and diversity. These species are commonly preserved in coal-bearing strata in southeast South China (FJBGMR, 1985; GDBGMR, 1988; JXBGMR, 1984; Qian et al., 1987). Thus, the fossil plants of theXiaoping Formation can be used to unravel the Late Triassic palaeoclimate in southeast South China.\nCycadophytes (e.g., Pterophyllum/Nilssonia) generally grew in lowland subtropical to tropical areas with warm moist conditions during theMesozoic (Wang et al., 2005a; Kustatscher et al., 2010). Most Mesozoic Filicales (ferns), such as the genera Todites, Cladophlebis,Danaeopsis and Marattiopsis in Eurasia also grew under warm moist conditions in subtropical to tropical regions, although some (e.g., Dictyophyllum and Clathropteris)mainly occupiedmoist areas in temperate-warm and subtropical zones (Van Konijnenburg-Van Cittert, 2002). Modern Equisetales generally grow in tropical to subtropical and temperate zones with humid conditions (Wang et al., 2005a), and their Mesozoic species may have occupied similar habitats. Coniferophytes commonly inhabited relatively dry areas of upland forest in tropical to subtropical zones, whereas Ginkgoales were mainly restricted to temperate areas during the Mesozoic (Wang et al., 2005a).\nThe dominance of Cycadophytes, Filicales and Equisetales in the Upper Triassic strata implies that southeast South China was at that time located in a tropical to subtropical zonewithwarmhumid climates (Fig. 10; Qian et al., 1987; Zhou and Zhou, 1983). About 80% of the Cycadophytes disappeared in the Lower Jurassic Jinji Formation, whereas the diversity of Filicales, Equisetales, Ginkgoales and Coniferophytes are similar to those of the Xiaoping Formation. Comparable floral assemblages between the Jinji and Qiaoyuan formations indicate that the formations were deposited under similar palaeoclimatic conditions. Floral assemblages and the presence of coals in the Qiaoyuan Formation imply that the climate remainedwarmhumid, but became cooler (temperate) during the Early Jurassic (Zhou, 1995). There was a change in palaeoclimate from humid to arid during deposition of the Zhangping Formation and its equivalent, as recorded by fossils, lithofacies and mudrock geochemistry (Qian et al., 1987; Sun et al., 1995; Xu et al., 2010). Only minor fossil plants are found in the lowermost Zhangping\nFormation, implying a period of vegetation overturn. On the other hand, the presence of sand-filled desiccation cracks indicates that subaerial exposure occurred under a hot and semiarid to arid climate (Figs. 9C and 10). Climate change and the consequent reduction of vegetation, and subaerial exposure, could have caused changes of oxygenation levels in the water column, thereby resulting in themulticolours of sedimentary rocks in the Zhangping Formation."

Accommodation generation and sediment supply basically dependonallogenic and autogenic factors. Allogenic factors, such as eustasy and basin subsidence, control the generation of accommodation (Allen and Allen, 2005; Dalrymple, 2010; Gomez-Paccard et al., 2012; Hickson et al., 2005; Huerta et al., 2011), whereas climate changes and tectonic evolution of catchments contribute\nAge (Ma)Regional Magmatism\nRegional Climate\nDaxi-Zhuyuan Succession\nG\nto sediment supply (Armitage et al., 2011; Blum and Törnqvist, 2000; Rasmussen, 2004; Smith, 1994).

The Daxi-Zhuyuan succession in the Xinfeng-Lianping region is characterized by four sedimentation units (collectively named the Lantang Group), showing long-term progradational, aggradational and progradational stacking patterns (Fig. 12). Four stages of basin-filling have been invoked based on stratigraphic analysis of the Daxi-Zhuyuan succession (Fig. 12; Pang et al., 2014). Stage 1 records a retrogradation-progradation cycle that was associatedwith an increasing but then slightly decreasing subsidence rate. Stage 2 documents a backstepping-aggradation cycle, responding to a complex interplay between moderate subsidence rates, high sedimentation rates and eustasy. Stage 3 represents a backsteppingprogradation period reflecting a change from high sedimentation and high subsidence rates to lower subsidence and sedimentation rates prior to intracontinental uplift. Stage 4 records continental uplift and the subsequent development of a late Early Jurassic-Cretaceous basinand-range province. Following such a framework of basin evolution, we interpret the stacking patterns of individual formations of the Gaosi-Songxi succession in an attempt to exam the influence of eustasy, climate and tectonics."

    "heading": "5.1.1. Stage 1—Carnian to Rhaetian",
    "text": "This stage corresponds to the Xiaoping Formation in the GaosiSongxi sections. It records a progradation-aggradation cycle formed during the Carnian to Rhaetian (Fig. 12). There are two divisions for the stage.\nThe first division is made up of two coarsening-upward cycles (1st and 2nd units) in the lower part of the Xiaoping Formation, which overall show a progradational trend (A/S b 1; Figs. 4 and 12). This implies that the overall rate of sediment supply (S) outstripped the rate of accommodation generation (A) (Catuneanu et al., 2009). During this interval, two episodes of deltaic deposition were established (Figs. 4 and 12), and that relate to transgression-regression cycles. However, longterm global sea level rose to a maximum at ca. 223 Ma (Fig. 12; Haq et al., 1987), thereby generating a mismatch with the sedimentary response. This indicates that the influence of global sea level on sedimentation patterns was much less than the role of subsidence. Regional stratigraphic correlation suggests that the 1st and 2nd deltaic units of the Xiaoping formation may be coeval with the Hongweikeng and Xiaoshui formations of the Daxi-Zhuyuan succession, which were deposited from ca. 235 to 215 Ma (Fig. 12; Pang et al., 2014). Thus, the estimated overall sedimentation rate of these two sedimentary units is relatively low (15 m/myr; Fig. 12). The implication is that the initial basin subsidence rate in the Meizhou region was lower than that of the Xinfeng-Lianping region (Pang et al., 2014).\nThe second division, corresponding to the upper part (3rd unit) of the Xiaoping Formation, is marked by low sedimentation rates (20 m/ myr) but an aggradational stacking of fluvial facies (Figs. 4 and 12). This implies that the overall rates of accommodation generation and sediment supply were balanced. This period, however, corresponds to a gradual lowering of global sea level, which reached a minimum at ca. 205Ma (Fig. 12; Haq et al., 1987). Such a falling sea level would predict gradual progradation of facies tracts. Thus, the aggradational stacking and high sinuosity of the inferred rivers indicate increasing accumulation caused by increases in subsidence. Calculated sedimentation rates during this time interval are relatively higher than those of the lower part of the Xiaoping Formation (Fig. 12), indicating higher sediment yields. Increases in sediment supply are consistentwith the establishment of a meandering fluvial system (e.g., Constantine et al., 2014). The abundance of fossil plants and coal deposits implies that the Late Triassic climate in South China was predominately characterized by warm humid conditions in a subtropical to tropical zone (Fig. 10; Qian et al., 1987; Sun et al., 1995; Zhou, 1989; Zhou and Zhou, 1983). It is suggested that vegetation could reduce the erosion rates of the catchment areas and thus decrease sediment production and supply (Blum and Törnqvist, 2000; Dalrymple, 2010; Davies and Gibling, 2010; Lopez-Blanco, 1993). However, in subtropical and tropical regimes,\nsediment yields can increase because of great precipitation values (N1000 mm/yr), although land plants are common (Blum and Törnqvist, 2000 and reference therein). It thus highlights the climatic controls on increases in sediment supply during these periods. Nonetheless, in order to transport coarse sediments (sands and pebbles) downstream (Figs. 4 and 7A–B), a sustained steepened river gradient was necessary (Foreman et al., 2012), implying gradual uplift of source areas."

    "heading": "5.1.2. Stages 2 to 3—Hettangian to early Toarcian",
    "text": "Stages 2 to 3 defined at the Daxi-Zhuyuan succession correspond to the Jinji and Qiaoyuan formations of the Gaosi-Songxi succession (Fig. 12). The Jinji Formation is made up of the Hettangian to early Sinemurian transgressive-regressive packages marked by relatively high overall sedimentation rates (85.5 m/myr; Figs. 5 and 12). Depositional environments shifted from fluvial to shallow-marine, and finally to subaerial volcanic and volcaniclastic during this interval (Fig. 5). It corresponds to a period of increasing global sea level and correlates to a shorter-term sea level increasing-decreasing cycle (Fig. 12; Haq et al., 1987). The fluvial facies are characterized by predominant coarse-grained sandstones (Fig. 5), indicating that river sinuosity became lower compared to that of the Xiaoping Formation and river styles changing frommeandering-type to braided-type. Numerous causes are envisaged to trigger the variation of fluvial stratigraphic patterns. At a given subsidence rate, the increasing uplift of source areas can cause the basinward progradation of river and transport of coarse sediments, resulting in proximal deposition. Alternatively, the loss of vegetation possibly related to mass extinction at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (McElwain et al., 1999) could have resulted in intense weathering, erosion in catchment areas and enhanced sediment flux. This is consistent with the decreasing diversity of Early Jurassic flora, particularly the Cycadophytes, compared to those of Late Triassic ages in South China (Zhou, 1995; Table S2). Althoughnew species appeared, the overall coverage of vegetationmay have declined significantly. In that case, climatically controlled changes on the loss of vegetation and the increased sediment flux could have accounted for the shift from a meandering channel to a braided morphology (cf., Ward et al., 2000; Foreman et al., 2012), as well as river progradation during the deposition of the basal sandstones of the Jinji Formation.\nThe change from fluvial facies to shallow-marine facies establishes that there was a rapid backstepping of facies tracts (Figs. 5 and 12), suggesting that accommodation creation rapidly outstripped sediment supply, possibly due to increases in subsidence rates. The presence of thick tabular sandstone sheetswithin the shallow-marine facies records the episodic input of sand (Fig. 8). The time interval for marine deposition in the studied Meizhou region was much shorter than that in the Xinfeng-Lianping region as recorded in the Daxi-Zhuyuan succession (Fig. 12). Nonetheless, the implication is that the basin became broader and deeper. The subsequent occurrence of subaerial volcanism in the upper part of the Jinji Formation signifies a regressive cycle (Fig. 8). The low stands in relative sea level and shift from shallow-marine to subaerial volcanic environments recorded a rapid decrease in subsidence rates and basin shallowing in the study region,whichwas not observed in the Xinfeng-Lianping region (Fig. 12). The eruption of basalts at ca. 200 Ma coincides with the intrusion of ca. 195–190 Ma gabbros and A-type granites in adjacent regions (Fig. 12; Zhu et al., 2010; Pang et al., 2014), thereby identifying a bimodal magmatic cycle. Geochemical and isotopic analyses show that the ca. 195–190 Ma mafic rocks were derived from upwelling asthenospheric mantle (Zhu et al., 2010; Meng et al., 2012), which implies the initiation of anorogenic magmatism and termination of the Indosinian Orogeny at ca. 200 Ma. Thus, variations in subsidence rates, and associated magmatism relate to basin tectonics rather than to eustasy.\nThe Qiaoyuan Formation is characterized by progradationretrogradation cycles and low sedimentation rates (25.5 m/myr; Fig. 12). Such a low sediment flux is consistent with the establishment\nof high proportions ofmudrock in distributary-bay and floodplain facies (Fig. 5). The presence of flora and coal-seams indicates that the water tables were relatively high (Fig. 5). Coal seams were formed due to the balance between vegetation production and organic burial (McCabe, 1984), indicating increases in vegetation cover, which in turn could have resulted in decreases in sedimentflux. The nested sandstone sheets in this Formation (Figs. 5 and 9A–B) possibly resulted from seasonal flooding events (overbank flooding or crevassing), implying that there were seasonal climatic changes that increased rainfall and erosion of source areas.\nThe change from subaerial volcanic facies of the Jinji Formation to interdistributary bay facies of the lower part of the Qiaoyuan Formation records a backstepping of facies tracts (Fig. 5), representing rapid increases in accommodation. Rejuvenated subsidence and gradual global sea level rise could probably have caused the stratigraphic change. During this interval, sea level rose to amaximum at ca. 192Ma and then fell slightly to aminimum at ca. 187Ma, followed by a rise to amaximumat ca. 182Ma (Fig. 12; Haq et al., 1987). However, an overall aggradationalprogradational stacking of the interdistributary bay and floodplain facies is inconsistent with the combined long-term global sea level rise and increasing subsidence (Fig. 5), which predict retrogradational facies stacking. In fact, low sedimentation rates and the long-term progradational stacking pattern of the Qiaoyuan Formation imply decreasing subsidence rates and subsequent shallowing of the basin to the end of the stage, which is consistent with those processes recorded in the Daxi-Zhuyuan succession (Fig. 12), implying that basin-wide sedimentation was controlled by a uniform lithospheric process. Nonetheless, it was suggested that basin shallowing and regional uplift could have initiated earlier in the Daxi-Zhuyuan area (i.e., the basin depocentre; Fig. 12) causing a local depositional hiatus (Pang et al., 2014), followed by rejuvenated subsidence and continued sedimentation in the Meizhou region (see below)."

    "heading": "5.1.3. Stage 4—late Toarcian-Bajocian",
    "text": "This stage corresponds to the Zhangping Formation, and records a retrogradational-progradational-aggradational cycle formed during the late Toarcian to the Bajocian (Figs. 6 and 12). Global sea level began to fall at the same time, to a minimum at ca. 177 Ma, and then rose to a maximum at ca. 168 Ma (Fig. 12; Haq et al., 1987), signifying amismatch between sedimentary response and global sea level. Rather, rejuvenated subsidence is interpreted to have generated new accommodation. The shift from proximal alluvial to lacustrine, and finally back to fluvial facies (Fig. 6), indicates backstepping but then progradation of facies tracts. As estimated overall sedimentation rates were high (86 m/myr; Fig. 12), an increasing but later slightly decreasing subsidence rate can thus be envisaged for this stage. As recorded by the Zhangping Formation, deposition was continuous in the Meizhou and adjacent regions in eastern and northeastern Guangdong Province, whereas a depositional hiatus followed by fluvial facies is recorded in the Xinfeng-Lianping region in northern Guangdong Province, implying a change of depocentre from the Early to early Middle Jurassic (Fig. 12; Pang et al., 2014). This indicates that the earlier T3–J1 basinwas uplifted and broken-up into sub-basins (the initiation of the basin-and-range province; Gilder et al., 1991; Li and Li, 2007; Pang et al., 2014), with rejuvenated rapid subsidence along the coastal region. The deposition of the sub-basins is here interpreted to be terminated by the Bajocian (Fig. 12), followed by sedimentation and volcanism throughout eastern South China during the late Middle Jurassic to Cretaceous (Guo et al., 2012).\nAs shown above, decreases in floral assemblage and formation of reddish deposits and associated desiccation structures record a semiarid to arid climate for South China during this interval (Figs. 10 and 12; Qian et al., 1987; Zhou, 1995). Sedimentary responses to such climate conditions are widely documented in South China (FJBGMR, 1985; GDBGMR, 1988; HNBGMR, 1984; JXBGMR, 1984) and northwest China (i.e., the Qaidam Basin; Wang et al., 2005a). The changes from\ntemperate humid to hot arid climates possibly reflect the Toarcian global warming event (e.g., Dera et al., 2011), or may be linked to regional uplift and extensive contemporaneous magmatism in eastern China. Such a change of climatic conditions could probably be one of the major controls on increases in erosion of source areas and thus sediment supply during this stage (e.g., Lopez-Blanco, 1993). Collectively, combined tectonic and climatic controls determined the evolution of the basin during this stage."

    "heading": "5.2. Palaeogeographic evolution",
    "text": "On the basis of the T3–J2 stratigraphic records in the Guangdong Province (GDBGMR, 1988; Pang et al., 2014; this work), a refined palaeogeographic evolution pattern is reconstructed (Fig. 13). Following a depositional hiatus due to the Indosinian Orogeny in South China (Liu andXu, 1994; Tong and Liu, 2000), a basin initiated on a young orogenic belt during the Late Triassic (during the late stage of the Indosinian Orogeny; Fig. 13A; Li and Li, 2007; Pang et al., 2014). Depositional environments at that time varied from alluvial fan to near-shore lacustrine/swamp and shallow-marine (GDBGMR, 1988) (Fig. 13B). The fluvial and lacustrine facies indicate that the entire basin probably stood above sea level during the Carnian, but the southeastern part of the basin reached sea level during the Norian as reflected by marginal-marine facies in the Daxi-Zhuyuan succession (Figs. 12 and 13B; Pang et al., 2014). However, predominantfluvial facies of the Rhaetian imply that the basinwas again above sea level by that time (Fig. 12). This vertical facies variation indicates a transgression-regression cycle (i.e., basin deepening-shallowing) during the Late Triassic. Late Triassic drainage systems were dominantly towards the east and the northeast in western Guangdong Province (GDBGMR, 1988), whereas they were towards the south in northern Guangdong Province (Fig. 13B; Pang et al., 2014). However, transport directions in northeastern Guangdong Province are more complicated (Fig. 13B) reflecting more variable local topography. The occurrence of coal implies substantial rainfall and vegetation coverage under warm and humid climatic conditions during the Late Triassic. This is consistent with the global Mesozoic palaeogeography, during which the South China Block was located in a tropical to subtropical zone (Golonka, 2007; Li, 1998; Metcalfe, 2006). Overall, the basin in the Guangdong Province underwent varied but relatively slow subsidence during the Late Triassic (Fig. 12; Pang et al., 2014).\nDuring the Hettangian–Pliensbachian, shallow-marine facies were prevalent in Guangdong Province, corresponding to a rejuvenated rapid subsidence of the basin (Fig. 13C; Pang et al., 2014). Drainage remained towards the south into the basin in northern Guangdong Province, but dominantly towards the east and northeast in western Guangdong Province (Fig. 13C; GDBGMR, 1988; Pang et al., 2014). In northeastern Guangdong Province, drainage was dominantly towards the north and northwest (Fig. 13C), consistent with the Rhaetian drainage, whereas the Pliensbachian to Toarcian drainage is unknown at the present time due to a lack of palaeocurrent data. In this region, thick braided-type fluvial deposits at the base of the Jinji Formation can be attributed to large volumes of sediments supplied from source catchments, which were followed by shallow-marine deposits (Fig. 5). The occurrence of shallow-marine deposits across almost the entire Guangdong Province implies basin widening and deepening, sinking below sea level again during the Early Jurassic (Fig. 13C). In the studied Gaosi-Songxi area, sedimentation of shallow-marine sediments was succeeded by volcanism and then by fluvial deposition (Figs. 12 and 13C), reflecting another transgression-regression cycle.\nContinuous regional uplift terminated deposition inmuch of the earlier basin, while localized NE-trending subsidence zones formed in eastern Guangdong Province to receive the Zhangping Formation and its equivalents during the Toarcian to Bajocian (Fig. 13D). The newly formed basins resemble continental rifts, and record the initiation of the basin-and-range province (Fig. 13D; Li and Li, 2007). Depositional\nenvironments changed from alluvial fan to lacustrine and then tofluvial. Fluvial drainage was dominantly towards the north in northern Guangdong Province, whereas it was dominantly towards the southeast and south in northeastern Guangdong Province (Pang, 2014), forming fresh-water or saline lakes (Fig. 13D). The progradationalaggradational stacking pattern of the Zhangping Formation and its unconformity relationship with the overlying Gaojiping Group imply that the basins were eventually filled and uplifted. These overlying volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the late Middle Jurassic to Cretaceous age recorded the succeeding stratigraphic history of the basin-and-range province in southeast South China.\nIn summary, the studied T3–J2 basin is a hybrid basin that comprises a late-orogenic slow subsidence phase during the Late Triassic, a postorogenic rapid subsidence and volcanism phase during the Early Jurassic, and a subsequent late Early to early Middle Jurassic basin-andrange-type extensional phase."

    "heading": "5.3. Geodynamic implications",
    "text": "Stratigraphic data from the Gaosi-Songxi sections indicate that the T3–J2 basin initiated on top of a young magmatic fold-thrust belt, and evolved from terrestrial to shallow-marine, and then back to terrestrial\nfacies from the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, followed by basin uplift and subsequent development of a basin-and-range province since the Middle Jurassic (Figs. 12–13). Although much attention have been paid to these sedimentary rocks, the mechanism of basin formation is still poorly known.\nThe T3–J2 basin in southeast South China is a time equivalent to basins around the North Atlantic (e.g., the Lusitanian basin and the North Sea). The North Atlantic basins evolved from fluvial tomarine environments, and then to basin uplift during the Late Triassic–Middle Jurassic (Sinclair et al., 1994; Alves et al., 2003, 2009; Tucholke et al., 2007), thereby showing a similar evolutionary pattern to the South China basin. Those North Atlantic basins formed on a Paleozoic-aged orogen (Caledonian-Hercynian orogenic events; Færseth, 1996) and originated as half-gräben and gräben due to intracontinental lithospheric extension (Driscoll et al., 1995; Alves et al., 2003, 2009; Tucholke et al., 2007). The timing of basin formation relative to preceding orogeny, and therefore possibly the initiating tectonic driver, is in sharp contrast to the South China basin.\nThe size and basin-filling pattern of the South China T3–J2 basin is similar to Eocene sedimentary “ponded basins” (also called the “Eocene Great Basin System” in Li (2015)) in the central Rocky Mountains of western North America (Dickinson et al., 1988). Those Eocene basins sit in the centre of the young Laramide Orogen that has been related to latest Cretaceous-Paleogene flat subduction of an oceanic plateau on the Farallon plate (Coney and Reynolds, 1977; Dickinson and Snyder, 1978). The basins underwent nonmarine sedimentation and evolved from fluvial to lacustrine to volcaniclastic facies during the early Eocene (ca. 53–47 Ma), followed by a basin-wide unconformity (Dickinson et al., 1988; Smith et al., 2014). A recent study by Smith et al. (2014, 2015) suggested that the basins relate to subsidence above the hinge of the flat-subducted Farallon slab as it rolled back. However, thatmodel appears to be inconsistentwith the broad, roughly circular geometry and the relative position of the basin system in western North America (Li, 2015). Instead, a slab-density-driven subsidence modelwas favoured by Li (2015). In that lattermodel, a subducting oceanic plateau was gradually transformed from basalt to denser eclogite, the gravitational pull of which caused subsidence of the young and broad orogen.\nIn southeast South China, prior to T3–J2 sedimentation, Permo-Triassic magmatism, deformation and foreland basin migrated towards the continent interior, generating the 1300-km wide Indosinian Orogen (Fig. 13A; Li and Li, 2007). Interpretations of the tectonic driver of the Indosinian Orogeny are controversial. Li and Li (2007) and Li et al. (2012) proposed flat subduction of a Palaeo-Pacific oceanic plateau to account for Early Mesozoic orogenesis and magmatism in South China (Fig. 13A), whereas others (Shu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2006) suggested that Mesozoic tectonic events were caused by collision between the Indochina and South China blocks within the Tethyan tectonic domain. The latter interpretation is inconsistent with the regional NE-trending folds and thrusts (Chen, 1999), and a Late Permian to Early Triassic NE-trending foreland basin and its northwestward migration trend during the orogeny (inserted figure in Fig. 13A). The most likely tectonic scenario is that the Indosinian Orogen was a back-arc magmatic fold-thrust belt, the evolution of which relates to low-angle subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Ocean.\nInitiation of the T3–J2 basin on top of that magmatic fold-thrust belt began in Guangdong Province during late-stage orogeny (Pang et al., 2014). The basin experienced relatively low subsidence rates and underwent terrestrial to marginal shallow-marine then terrestrial sedimentation during the Late Triassic (Figs. 12 and 13B). Detrital zircon grains in sandstones from the Upper Triassic Xiaoping Formation are dominated by 430 Ma, 970 Ma and 2530 Ma ages, with subordinate 240 Ma, 360–370 Ma, 520 Ma, 780 Ma, 1200 Ma, 1830 Ma and 3120 Ma ages (Pang, 2014). This indicates that the sediments were mostly recycled from the orogen, i.e., pre-Middle Triassic rocks uplifted and exposed by the Indosinian Orogeny. Late Triassic subsidence rates\nare atypical of foreland basins, which initiate with very high rates of subsidence (Pang et al., 2014). Gravitational pull of an eclogitizing oceanic flat slab was thus interpreted to have driven the subsidence of the orogen, and also the initiation of the basin, the same way as the formation of the western American Eocene “ponded basins” (Fig. 13B; Li, 2015; Li and Li, 2007).\nThe basin subsided continuously, evolving from terrestrial to shallow-marine facies at the beginning of the Early Jurassic in Guangdong Province (Fig. 13C). Shallow-marine siltstone facies were rapidly succeeded by volcanic facies at ca. 200 Ma in the Meizhou region (Figs. 5 and 12). Provenance of sediments during this stage is consistent with a mixture of recycled orogen and synvolcanic sources (Pang, 2014). The occurrence of ca. 195–190Ma anorogenic mafic magmatism (Fig. 13C; Meng et al., 2012; Pang et al., 2014 and references therein) and the termination of flat-slab progradation by around 200 Ma (Li and Li, 2007) imply that the flat-slab likely started to breakup, thereby allowing asthenospheric upwelling at that time.\nSubsequent basin shallowing, changing from shallow-marine to terrestrial facies accompanied by regional uplift, has been interpreted to have been caused by lithospheric rebound following foundering of the flat-slab after ca. 190Ma (Li and Li, 2007; Meng et al., 2015), and the return to a normal (high-angle) subduction system along the coastal region (Fig. 13D; Li et al., 2012). The development of the basin-andrange province may relate to extension due to lithospheric rebound and to back-arc extension in East China since the Middle Jurassic (Gilder et al., 1991; Tian et al., 1992; Zhou and Li, 2000; Ren et al., 2002; Shu et al., 2009; Li and Li, 2007; Li et al., 2012), thereby defining a protracted tectonic cycle of back-arc compression and extension that began during the Late Palaeozoic."

    "text": "About 2700 m of sedimentary rocks are preserved in the GaosiSongxi succession, which comprises the Xiaoping Formation of Late Triassic age, the Jinji Formation of Hettangian to early Sinemurian age, the Qiaoyuan Formation of late Sinemurian to early Toarcian age, and the Zhangping Formation of late Toarcian to Bajocian age.\nProdelta, delta-front and delta-plain facies associations are identified in the Xiaoping Formation, and these are succeeded by fluvial, shallowmarine, volcaniclastic, interdistributary bay andfloodplain facies associations in the Jinji and Qiaoyuan formations, thereby defining a progradational-retrogradational-progradational cycle. The Zhangping Formation is made up of proximal alluvial, lacustrine and fluvial facies associations, thereby representing a retrogradational-progradational cycle. Fossil plants are abundant and establish that palaeoclimates varied from tropical to subtropical warm humid during the Late Triassic, to temperate humid during the early-Early Jurassic, and to hot arid during the late-Early Jurassic to Cretaceous.\nWhereas palaeontological, lithofacies and colour variations appear to reflect changes in climate over time, long-term facies stacking patterns undoubtedly reflect tectonic controls on stratigraphic evolution, sedimentation patterns and volcanism. The basin initiated on a young magmatic fold-thrust belt, evolved into shallow-marine but then back to terrestrial fluvial during the Late Triassic to the Early Jurassic interval. The basinwas then uplifted and broke up into smaller-scale basins from the Middle Jurassic. Basin evolution and associated magmatism record cyclic episodes of intercontinental vertical tectonics that have been related to subduction and later foundering of a Palaeo-Pacific oceanic slab."
