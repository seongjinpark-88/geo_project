The lower Daeri Member is composed of siliciclastic deposits formed in a semi‐arid floodplain environment, which is overlain by the middle Daeri Member consisting mainly of andesite lava flow. After the emplacement of the andesite, activities of intrabasinal normal faults created accommodation on hanging wall blocks together with the development of intrabasinal topographic relief. The upper Daeri Member occurs only in hanging wall blocks and is composed of rhyolitic volcaniclastic sediments formed during an explosive volcanic eruption. Following the eruption, owing to semi‐arid climatic conditions and the destruction of vegetation, the eruptive materials were easily remobilized and deposited by episodic sediment gravity flows, resulting in deposition of the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits with sheet‐like geometry. Away from the intrabasinal normal faults, the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits show a decrease in grain size together with changes in inferred depositional processes from debris flows to hyperconcentrated flows and supercritical sheetfloods. This suggests that the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits were stacked on alluvial fan environments induced by intrabasinal topographic relief associated with normal fault activities. In addition, episodic movement of the faults gave rise to periodic fluctuation of the accommodation and an increase in gradient of the alluvial fan surface, resulting in the development of coarsening‐upward trends in the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits. The development of the alluvial fan and the coarsening‐upward trends indicate that dynamic tectonic subsidence and concomitant changes in the intrabasinal physiographic relief influenced the depositional processes and sizes of the transported volcaniclastic sediments of the upper Daeri Member. Thus, it is necessary to carefully observe tectonic signatures in volcaniclastic successions, particularly the syneruptive lithofacies, in order to reconstruct the tectonic and volcanic histories of receiving basins.\nKEYWORDS\naccommodation, climate, pyroclastic density current, remobilization, sediment gravity flows, volcanism"

    "text": "A growing number of studies suggest that ancient volcanic–sedimentary successions were formed commonly under the dual influence of tectonic and volcanic activities (Cole & Ridgway, 1993;\nKhalaf, 2012; Kokelaar, 1992; Lerch, Miller, Mcwilliams, & Colgan, 2008; Morgan, Ranero, & Vannucchi, 2008; Muravchik, D'elia, Bilmes, & Franzese, 2011; Riggs & Busby‐Spera, 1990; Smith, 1991; Smith, Snee, & Taylor, 1987; Sohn et al., 2013; Stollhofen & Stanistreet, 1994; Waresback & Turbeville, 1990). Episodic\nhttps://doi.org/10.1111/iar.12183 © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltdwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/iar 1 of 20\nvolcanic activities give rise to an abrupt increase in volcaniclastic sediment supply to the nearby basins and lowlands and lead to disturbances of pre‐existing drainage systems, which results in abrupt changes in depositional features of basin‐fill sediments such as stacking patterns, lithofacies, and the composition of constituent sediments (Kataoka, 2005; Manville, 2002; Manville, Németh, & Kano, 2009; Smith, 1991). In tectonically active basins, volcaniclastic sedimentation can also be modulated by changes in the physiography and accommodation of the receiving basins induced by contemporaneous tectonic activities, resulting in the development of temporospatially complex depositional records (e. g. Muravchik et al., 2011; Sohn et al., 2013). Although it is difficult to discriminate between tectonic and volcanic influence from the complex records, understanding their controls on sedimentation is highly important to unravel the volcanic and tectonic evolutions of receiving basins.\nThe Cretaceous upper Daeri Member, exposed on Wido Island, is represented by volcaniclastic deposits composed mainly of rhyolitic pumices and fine‐grained ash (Figures 1, 2). Detailed mapping and sedimentologic analysis show that the spatial distribution of this member is closely related to intrabasinal normal faults (Faults A to C; Figure 2b,c). The upper Daeri Member occurs only on hanging wall blocks (Blocks II and III) and shows systematic changes in depositional features such as grain size, bed thickness, and sedimentary structure away from the intrabasinal normal faults. This indicates a coeval influence of tectonism during volcaniclastic sedimentation, offering\na chance to study depositional records formed under the contemporaneous influence of tectonism and volcanism. Based on the rock records of the upper Daeri Member, the present study will discuss the depositional history of this member and the syndepositional tectonic influence on volcaniclastic sedimentation."

    "text": "During the Cretaceous, oblique subduction of the Paleo‐Pacific Plate (Izanagi Plate) beneath the Eurasian Plate led to the development of sinistral strike‐slip fault systems in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula together with the formation of a continental volcanic arc and back‐arc system (Gyeongsang Basin; Chough, Kwon, Ree, & Choi, 2000; Chough & Sohn, 2010; Figure 1). Many strike‐slip basins were formed along the fault systems, and non‐marine siliciclastic sediments filled the basins under semi‐arid climatic conditions (Chough & Sohn, 2010; Chough et al., 2000; Kim, Kim, Jo, Jeong, & Chough, 2009; Lee & Chough, 1999; Ryang & Chough, 1997; Shinn, Chough, & Hwang, 2010). The basin‐fill sediments are commonly intercalated with basaltic to rhyolitic volcanic rocks, forming Cretaceous volcanic–sedimentary successions (Kim, Chun, & Chough, 1997; Lee & Chough, 1999; Ryang, 2013; Ryang & Chough, 1997). Recent geological surveys (Gihm & Hwang, 2014; Koh, Kwon, Park, Park, & Kee, 2013) reveal that Cretaceous volcanic–sedimentary successions (88. 7 to 84. 9Ma) are also well developed in the Wido Formation on Wido Island and in the\nSeonunsan and Buan volcanics in the surrounding areas (Figure 2a). The volcanic–sedimentary successions are composed mainly of rhyolitic tuff and lava as well as siliciclastic deposits and andesite (Figure 2a). Trace element analysis (Nb/Y ratio and Rb/Y + Nb ratio) indicates that these rhyolitic volcaniclastic rocks originated from magmatism in a volcanic arc (Koh et al., 2013)."

    "text": "The Cretaceous volcanic–sedimentary succession in Wido Island is represented by the Wido Formation. The basement is not exposed. The Wido Formation can be divided into lower, middle, and upper\nparts known as the Daeri, Jinri, and Beolkeum members (Figure 2b; Gihm & Hwang, 2014). The Daeri Member is well exposed along the southern coast of Wido Island and is characterized by vertical changes in composition and origin of the constituent sediments, which were used to subdivide the Daeri Member into lower, middle, and upper parts (Figure 2b). The lower Daeri Member is composed of siliciclastic mudstones and gravelly sandstones. The middle Daeri Member is characterized by widespread andesite (lava flow, up to 250 m in thickness) and coarse‐grained epiclastic deposits. The upper Daeri Member consists mainly of rhyolitic volcaniclastic deposits, which are described below in detail.\nThe spatial distribution of the Daeri Member is largely controlled by three intrabasinal normal faults (Faults A to C) that intersect the depositional area into four blocks (Blocks I to IV; Figure 2b,c). The intrabasinal normal faults can be recognized by fault surfaces (Figure 3a) and vertical separation of the lithostratigraphic units (Figures 2b, 4). The fault planes are inclined northeastward (Faults A and B) or southwestward (Fault C; Figure 2c). According to the stratal thickness variations, the cumulative vertical separations of the faults are estimated to be about 145 m (Fault A), 250 m (Fault B), and 110 m (Fault C), respectively. Numerous small‐scale syndepositional normal faults with dip displacement of a few centimeters to 4 m are also present in the Daeri Member (Figure 3b,c).\nThe Daeri Member is conformably overlain by the Jinri Member (Figure 4) consisting entirely of massive welded lapilli tuff. The Jinri Member is as thick as 600 m and lacks any recognizable bed boundaries and vertical variations in grain size. A Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP) U–Pb zircon age of the Jinri Member is 85.7 2.9 Ma (i.e. Campanian; Koh et al., 2013). The overlying Beolkeum Member is represented by laminated mudstones intercalated with volcaniclastic deposits, which are interpreted to be deposited in lacustrine environments (Gihm & Hwang, 2014)."

    "heading": "4 | LITHOLOGIC AND DEPOSITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DAERI MEMBER",
    "text": "The Daeri Member is composed of a variety of volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks as well as siliciclastic rocks. In this study, the term “epiclastic” is applied to rocks composed of debris derived from the erosion of previously lithified volcanic rocks that were deposited by\nsurface depositional processes (Cas & Wright, 1987; White & Houghton, 2006). These epiclastic rocks will be described with the nomenclatures of siliciclastic rocks such as conglomerates, sandstones, and mudstones (Wentworth, 1922; White & Houghton, 2006). The term “volcaniclastic” is used to describe volcanic rocks composed mainly of volcaniclastic materials (ash) that formed by explosive fragmentation of magma during eruptions and were subsequently deposited either by primary volcanic processes (pyroclastic density current or fallout) or normal surface processes (Fisher, 1961, 1966; White & Houghton, 2006). These rocks have similar depositional features of poor sorting and overall massive nature. However, the primary volcaniclastic deposits can be distinguished from resedimented ones because the former commonly exhibit a welded texture and abundant alkali‐feldspar crystals as well as a considerable thickness (up to more than 50 m) (Bull & Cas, 2000; Cas & Wright, 1987, 1991; Smith, 1991; Sohn, Park, & Yoon, 2008).\nOn the basis of detailed sedimentologic analysis using centimeter‐ scale stratigraphic logs and the observation of thin sections, ten lithofacies were identified (Figure 4); their depositional features are summarized in Table 1."

Debris avalanches are catastrophic mass movement events originating from the collapse of initially coherent rock masses that progressively disintegrate during flows (Davies, 1982). The debris avalanche generally consists of a basal shear layer and an undeformed upper layer known as the plug zone (Voight, Janda, Glicken, & Douglass, 1983). As the velocity of the debris avalanche progressively decreases, the basal shear layer thins; the debris avalanche halts movement when the frictional strength of the basal layer exceeds the driving force (Palmer et al., 1991; Takarada et al., 1999). Poor sorting and the abundance of boulder sized clasts that protrude the upper bed boundary of the boulder‐rich breccias suggest abrupt en masse freezing of moving debris avalanches. The platy clasts aligned parallel to the bedding plane near the base reflect a basal shear zone of the debris avalanches. The jigsaw cracks and abundant platy clasts were formed by collision and shattering of large clasts during the flows (Ui, Kawachi, & Neall, 1986)."

The matrix is made up of welded very fine to fine ash and alkali‐feldspar crystals. Lithic lapilli and blocks are generally scattered; however a block‐rich layer (20 cm thick) is also found (Figure8a). In some cases, elongated lithic lapilli show weakly imbricated fabric (Figure 8b). The lower part passes upward into the middle part accompanied by a decrease in the size and amounts of lithic blocks (Figure 8c). The middle part is generally massive, although planar bedding is rarely developed (Figure 8d). The planar bedding is recognized by alternations of lapilli‐ and ash‐rich layers a few centimeters to 20 cm thick with a sharp lower boundary. Themiddle part passes gradually upward into the pumice‐rich upper part, where flattened pumices are prevalent with their long axes aligned parallel to the bedding plane (Figure 8e).

The poorly sorted andmassive features in the lower part resultedfromrapidaccumulationofpyroclasts fedfromahighlyconcentrated pyroclastic density current (Druitt, 1995; Sohn & Chough, 1989). The weakly imbricated fabric suggests significant shearing over a depositional boundary during the deposition (Sohn et al., 2013). The block‐rich layer may represent a temporal increase in competence of thepyroclasticdensitycurrent (Branney&Kokelaar,2002)or an increase in eruption intensity, which led to incorporation of more conduit wall rocks (Druitt & Bacon, 1986). An upward decrease in lithic blocks is suggestive of a progressive decrease in competence of the pyroclastic density current or waning of an eruption. Locally developed, planar bedding in the middle part represents temporal changes in turbulent intensity or fallout rates over the depositional boundary (Kneller & Branney, 1995). The upper part was formed by settling of the fine‐ grained ash and pumices from the waning current, and the occurrence of large pumices can be attributed to their lower density than that of the lithic component (Whitham& Sparks, 1986)."

The inverse grading can be attributed to clast collision during transportation (Bagnold, 1954; Nemec, 1990) or upward migration of the large clasts toward an upper part of the debris flows where the flow velocity was faster than that of the lower part (Vallance, 2000, 2005)."

The stacking of inversely graded layers in the lower part showing crude planar stratifications was formed by traction carpets in highly concentrated lower part of the hyperconcentrated flows (Pierson, 2005; Sohn, 1997; Todd, 1989). The upward increase in thickness of the layers and size of constituent clasts reflects a gradual increase in the sedimentation rate and competence of the flows. The poorly sorted and coarse‐grained upper part is suggestive of direct accumulation of sediments with no tractional component (Lowe, 1982, 1988; Sumner, Amy, & Talling, 2008). However, the linear alignments of lapilli layers are indicative of temporal changes in turbulence intensity or shear velocity over a depositional boundary. Transversely aligned, lithic blocks are interpreted to have rolled onto the beds and have been trapped by the aggrading depositional boundary (Cronin, Neall, Lecointre, & Palmer, 1997;\nPierson, 2005). The normal grading in the uppermost part with planar or low‐angle cross‐stratifications represents the waning of parental flows with a decrease in sedimentation rate over the depositional boundary."

The laterally extensive occurrence (90 m) and lack of channel geometry is indicative of deposition from unconfined flows. The preservation of an undulatory upper boundary reflects that the antidunes did not undergo modification by waning parental flows, indicating ephemeral and rapidly waning sheetfloods (Blair, 1999; Duller, Mountney, Russell, & Cassidy, 2008). An upward increase in thickness and dip angle of wavy stratifications in the crest region suggests growing stationary waves with an increase in sedimentation rate (Blair, 1999). The scoop‐shaped erosional surfaces suggest the breaking of the waves owing to an increase in instability of the growing stationary waves with time, which resulted in partial erosion of the antidune bedforms (Blair, 1999; Kennedy, 1963; Kubo & Yokokawa, 2001; Middleton, 1965; Russell & Arnott, 2003)."

However, the wavy stratifications in the lower part can represent temporal development of immature dunes (Best, 1992), likely implying deposition from turbulent flows (sheetflood).

The upper Daeri Member is distributed only on hanging wall blocks (Blocks II and III) whereas footwall blocks (Blocks I and IV) are composed of the lower and middle Daeri members, overlain directly by the Jinri Member (Figure 4). The thickness of the upper Daeri Member is estimated to be 95 m and 180 m in Blocks II and III, respectively.\nIn Block III, the upper Daeri Member shows lateral changes in depositional features away from Fault B. Bed thickness of the welded pumiceous lapilli tuff decreases abruptly from 50 m near Fault B (DR‐4 and ‐5) to a few meters in DR‐10 (Figure 4). The resedimented volcaniclastic deposits also decrease in size of ten maximum (largest)\nclasts away from Fault B together with changes in lithofacies from inversely graded volcaniclastic gravelly sandstones to inverse to normally graded volcaniclastic gravelly sandstones and wavy bedded volcaniclastic gravelly sandstones (Figure 7c,d). These lateral variations in bed thickness and size of constituent clasts away from Fault B suggest that both the pyroclastic density current and sediment gravity flows advanced northeastward. The inferred paleoflow directions are consistent with northeastward inclined, scoop‐shaped erosional surfaces in the wavy bedded volcaniclastic gravelly sandstones and low‐ angle cross‐stratifications dipping northeastward in the inverse to normally graded volcaniclastic gravelly sandstones (Figure 10)."

  }, {
    "heading": "6.1 | Depositional history of the Daeri Member",
    "text": "The Daeri Member is characterized by upward changes in the origin and composition of constituent sediments because of the changes in the composition of erupted magma (from andesitic to rhyolitic) and eruption style (from effusive to explosive; Figure 4). The lower Daeri Member is composed of homogeneous reddish mudstones and normally graded gravelly sandstones deposited on a floodplain environment (Figure 11a). The common occurrence of calcrete nodules in the homogeneous reddish mudstones indicates high evaporation rates with a fluctuation of groundwater tables, suggesting deposition under semi‐arid climatic conditions. Abundant metamorphic clasts in the normally graded gravelly sandstones indicate no or insignificant influence of volcanic activities during the deposition (Figure 5c). The overlying disorganized conglomerates of the middle Daeri Member are composed mostly of epiclastic andesite clasts, indicating the onset of andesitic, likely effusive volcanism prior to deposition of the disorganized conglomerates. The overlying widespread and thick andesite (< 250 m) reflects the growing influence of andesitic volcanism (Figures 4, 11b). The northeastward decrease in the andesite thickness can be attributed to accumulation of the lava flows at topographic depression (ponded lava flows).\nThe common occurrence of rhyolitic pumices and fine‐grained ash suggests that the overlying upper Daeri Member was deposited during and after an explosive volcanic eruption. In contrast to the underlying andesite, the upper Daeri Member occurs only in Blocks II and III, which are hanging wall blocks. This suggests that the intrabasinal normal faults began to be active after the emplacement of andesite accompanied by creation of accommodation on the hanging wall blocks (Gawthorpe & Leeder, 2000; Gupta, Cowie, Dawers, & Underhill, 1998; Sohn & Son, 2004). The contrasting cumulative thicknesses of the upper Daeri Member in Blocks II (95 m) and III (180 m) probably indicate contrasting accommodation between Blocks II and III during the deposition because of the different vertical separation of Faults A and B (Figures 2c, 4)\nDuring an explosive volcanic eruption, the welded pumiceous lapilli tuff was deposited on Block III by a pyroclastic density current (Figure 11c). The abundance of lithic blocks in the welded pumiceous lapilli tuff implies the proximity of volcanic sources (Figure 8a). On the basis of the northeastward decrease in bed thickness and grain\nsize, the sources are inferred to be situated near the southwestern part of Wido Island (Figures 2c, 4; Druitt & Bacon, 1986, Sohn et al., 2013). The absence of the tuff on Block II can be attributed to a bypass of the pyroclastic density current likely because of insufficient accommodation or complete erosion after the deposition (Figures 2c, 4). The overlying resedimented volcaniclastic deposits are interpreted to be deposited by remobilization of the eruptive materials through sediment gravity flows (Figure 11d; Cas & Wright, 1987; Major, Janda, & Daag, 1996; Major, Pierson, Dinehart, & Costa, 2000; Manville, 2002; Manville et al., 2009; McPhie et al., 1993; Smith & Lowe, 1991). In Block III, the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits are characterized by the size decreases in ten maximum clasts within 3 km away from Fault B coupled with changes in the depositional processes from debris flows to hyperconcentrated flows and sheetfloods (Figure 7d). The abrupt changes in depositional features such as grain size and thickness of the primary and resedimented volcaniclastic deposits suggest a rapid deceleration of both the pyroclastic density current and sediment gravity flows away from Fault B. This indicates the development of intrabasinal topographic relief between Blocks II and III, which is interpreted to be caused by different vertical separation of the intrabasinal normal fault (Faults A and B). In addition, the common occurrence of sediment gravity flow deposits as well as the lateral changes in depositional features suggests that the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits accumulated on alluvial fan environments (Blair & McPherson, 1994; Heward, 1978; Meyer & Wells, 1997; Smith, 1991; Sohn et al., 1999; Turbeville, 1991; Waresback & Turbeville, 1990). The occurrence of debris avalanche deposits (boulder‐rich breccias) only near Fault B also suggests intrabasinal physiographic relief between Blocks II and III (Figure 4)."

    "heading": "6.2 | Cause of coarsening‐upward trends in the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits in DR‐9",
    "text": "The coarsening‐upward trends of the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits in DR‐9 indicate changes in sediment caliber during the deposition. In alluvial fans, changes in size of the transported sediments are thought to result primarily from fluctuation in the sediment supply\n(Harvey, 2005; Ritter, Miller, Enzel, & Wells, 1995) or accommodation (Blair, 1987a; Fidolini et al., 2013; Gordon & Heller, 1993; Mack & Rasmussen, 1984). In case of the upper Daeri Member, the rates of the sediment supply could have fluctuated due to climate changes (Harvey, 2005; Ritter et al., 1995), volcanic eruptions (Buesch, 1991; Zanchetta, Sulpizio, & Di Vito, 2004), or autogenic control such as feeder channel migrations (Blair, 1987b). The occurrence of the homogeneous reddish mudstones in the Daeri Member suggests that this member was deposited under high evaporation rates, implying relatively constant semi‐arid climate conditions during the deposition. The absence of primary volcaniclastic deposits within the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits implies the lack of major volcanic activities after deposition of the welded pumiceous lapilli tuff. In addition, the conformably stacked resedimented volcaniclastic deposits without an incised surface suggest that feeder channel migrations (or avulsion) were not an important factor for the changes in sediment supply. On the contrary, the presence of intrabasinal normal faults and prevalent small‐scale syndepositional normal faults (Figure 3) suggest dynamic syndepositional tectonic subsidence, and the spatial distribution of the upper Daeri Member indicates that the tectonic subsidence had an influence on the deposition of the volcaniclastic sediments. Therefore, the coarsening‐upward trends are interpreted to have resulted from temporal changes in accommodation induced by the episodic tectonic subsidence of Block III (Blair & Bilodeau, 1988; Fidolini et al., 2013; Gordon & Heller, 1993; Steel, 1976; Steel, Maehle, Nilsen, Roe, & Spinnanger, 1977) (Figure 12).\nOnce Block III had subsided through the activity of Fault B, the accommodation abruptly increased (Figure 12a,b). Volcaniclastic sediments including lapilli to block sized lithic clasts rapidly filled the newly created accommodation by debris flows. Residual fine‐grained sediments were subsequently transported farther from Fault B through hyperconcentrated flows and sheetfloods to DR‐9. With time, the newly created accommodation was gradually consumed by stacking of the debris flow deposits together with an increase in the gradient of the alluvial fan surface (e.g. Blair & McPherson, 1994), giving rise to transportation of coarse‐grained volcaniclastic sediments to further distal areas (DR‐9). Therefore, the coarse‐grained debris rested\nprogressively on relatively fine‐grained volcaniclastic deposits, resulting in the development of the coarsening‐upward trends in DR‐9 (Figure 12c). The cyclic occurrence of the coarsening‐upward trends reflects that the periodic subsidence of Block III was induced by movement of Fault B during the deposition of the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits."

    "heading": "6.3 | Volcaniclastic sedimentation under the influence of tectonic subsidence",
    "text": "The above discussion suggests that the upper Daeri Member was deposited under the contemporary influence of explosive volcanism and syndepositional tectonic subsidence. Smith (1991) classified terrestrial volcaniclastic sedimentation largely into two essential conditions, i.e. syneruption and intereruption periods, according to the temporal changes in the supply rates of volcaniclastic sediments.\nDuring and immediately after volcanic eruptions, known as the syneruption period, variable surface runoff and sediment gravity flows frequently occur and supply huge amounts of volcaniclastic sediments into nearby basins and lowlands, commonly leveling pre‐existing topographic relief such as channels. The resulting deposits are typically widespread, poorly sorted, and composed mainly of eruptive materials of the syneruptive lithofacies. As the available eruptive materials decrease followed by a gradual recovery of vegetation (intereruption period), the sediment yields return to pre‐eruptive states, and drainage systems are re‐established with incision of the syneruptive lithofacies. Thus, intereruptive lithofacies are composed of relatively well sorted, hinterland‐ or basement‐driven sediments deposited in and around drainage systems. These eruption‐dependent, aggradational and degradational depositional cycles were also reported in volcaniclastic fans (Palmer, Purves, & Donoghue, 1993) and alluvial fans affected by explosive volcanic eruptions (Zanchetta et al., 2004).\nThe abundances of rhyolitic pumice and fine‐grained ash as well as the lack of basement‐derived sediments suggest that the upper Daeri Member can be regarded as syneruptive lithofacies. The conformable accumulation of both primary and resedimented volcaniclastic deposits with no degradational surface reflects that syneruption periods were maintained during the deposition of the upper Daeri Member. According to existing paleoclimate studies, the Cretaceous volcanic–sedimentary successions in the Korean Peninsula were formed under warm and semi‐arid climatic conditions based on the common occurrences of calcrete nodules, desiccation cracks, raindrop impression, and evaporite minerals such as halite and gypsum (Chun & Chough, 1995; Paik, Huh, So, Lee, & Kim, 2007; Paik & Kim, 2006; Paik et al., 2000). In the present study, deposition of the homogeneous reddish mudstones bearing calcrete nodules in the lower to upper Daeri Member is also suggestive of high evaporation rates (semi‐arid climatic conditions), which possibly prevented the blooming of sediment‐stabilizing vegetation on the inferred volcanic sources and surrounding areas (Smith, 1991). In addition, the preservation of undulatory relief of the wavy bedded\nvolcaniclastic gravelly sandstones (antidune bedforms) suggests deposition from rapidly waning, supercritical sheetfloods and protection from bed modification by perennial channel systems following the deposition. This indicates that the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits were formed during episodic flooding events triggered by infrequent rainfall (Bull, 1997). Thus, the lack of sediment‐stabilizing vegetation together with episodic flooding events provided favorable conditions for remobilization of the unconsolidated volcaniclastic sediments and led to high rates of sediment supply after the eruption (Smith, 1991; Valentine, Palladino, Agosta, Taddeucci, & Trigila, 1998).\nThe overall sheet‐like geometry of the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits indicates that the syndepositional tectonic subsidence accommodated the remobilized volcaniclastic sediments, preventing the development of a degradational surface in the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits (Figure 7b). In addition, the development of the alluvial fan in Block III induced by intrabasinal fault activity suggests that remobilized volcaniclastic sediment failed to level the topographic relief, despite the favorable climatic conditions for remobilization of volcaniclastic sediments. This is attributed to dynamic tectonic activities during the deposition, particularly ones by Fault B, that created accommodation as well as intrabasinal physiographic relief (Muravchik et al., 2011; Sohn et al., 2013). In addition, the temporal variations in accommodation influenced the size of the transported volcaniclastic sediments, resulting in cyclic occurrence of coarsening‐upward trends in the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits (Figure 7c). This indicates that contemporaneous tectonic activities affected the dispersal patterns and depositional processes of the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits (syneruptive lithofacies). Thus, the tectonic influence on volcaniclastic sedimentation was imprinted in the syneruptive lithofacies, and the upper Daeri Member is regarded as syntectonic volcaniclastic succession. The coeval tectonic and volcanic activities are attributed to the contemporary influence of sinistral strike‐slip crustal deformation and continental arc volcanism in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula during the Cretaceous, which resulted from oblique subduction of the Paleo‐Pacific Plate (Izanagi Plate) under the Eurasian Plate."

    "heading": "7 | SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "The Cretaceous Daeri Member is characterized by vertical variations in the composition and origin of constituent sediments in response to changes in volcanic activities such as magma composition (from andesitic to rhyolitic) and eruption style (from effusive to explosive). The lower Daeri Member was deposited on a semi‐arid floodplain environment with no or insignificant volcanic activities. The middle Daeri Member was formed largely under andesitic effusive volcanism, resulting in laterally extensive andesite with a maximum thickness of 250 m.\nAfterward, intrabasinal normal faults (Faults A to C) divided the basin into four blocks (Blocks I to IV), creating accommodation for the overlying upper Daeri Member on hanging wall blocks (Blocks II and III). The upper Daeri Member is composed of syneruptive lithofacies that were deposited by the pyroclastic density current during an explosive volcanic eruption and resedimentation processes\nin semi‐arid climatic conditions. The deposition of unconsolidated volcaniclastic sediments coupled with semi‐arid climatic conditions provided favorable conditions for remobilization by sediment gravity flows during infrequent rain fall events. Despite the high rates of sediment supply, episodic movement of the intrabasinal normal faults sufficiently created accommodation for the remobilized volcaniclastic sediment on hanging wall blocks (Blocks II and III) in addition to physiographic relief, resulting in the formation of an alluvial fan on Block III. Moreover, temporal variations in the accommodation led to the development of coarsening‐upward trends in the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits on Block III.\nThe upper Daeri Member demonstrates that if tectonic subsidence exceeds the supply rates of the remobilized volcaniclastic sediments, the depositional features of the syneruptive lithofacies are affected by temporospatial changes in physiographic relief and accommodation. Thus, in order to reconstruct tectonic and volcanic evolutions of ancient volcanic–sedimentary successions, it is necessary to not only focus on the stratigraphic relationships between syneruptive and intereruptive lithofacies (Smith, 1991), but also make careful observation of tectonic signatures within the syneruptive lithofacies."

Email: ighwang@kigam.re.kr Abstract The Daeri Member, a Cretaceous volcanic–sedimentary succession, can be divided into lower, middle, and upper parts based on vertical changes in its lithologic characters. The lower Daeri Member is composed of siliciclastic deposits formed in a semi‐arid floodplain environment, which is overlain by the middle Daeri Member consisting mainly of andesite lava flow. After the emplacement of the andesite, activities of intrabasinal normal faults created accommodation on hanging wall blocks together with the development of intrabasinal topographic relief. The upper Daeri Member occurs only in hanging wall blocks and is composed of rhyolitic volcaniclastic sediments formed during an explosive volcanic eruption. Following the eruption, owing to semi‐arid climatic conditions and the destruction of vegetation, the eruptive materials were easily remobilized and deposited by episodic sediment gravity flows, resulting in deposition of the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits with sheet‐like geometry. Away from the intrabasinal normal faults, the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits show a decrease in grain size together with changes in inferred depositional processes from debris flows to hyperconcentrated flows and supercritical sheetfloods. This suggests that the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits were stacked on alluvial fan environments induced by intrabasinal topographic relief associated with normal fault activities. In addition, episodic movement of the faults gave rise to periodic fluctuation of the accommodation and an increase in gradient of the alluvial fan surface, resulting in the development of coarsening‐upward trends in the resedimented volcaniclastic deposits. The development of the alluvial fan and the coarsening‐upward trends indicate that dynamic tectonic subsidence and concomitant changes in the intrabasinal physiographic relief influenced the depositional processes and sizes of the transported volcaniclastic sediments of the upper Daeri Member. Thus, it is necessary to carefully observe tectonic signatures in volcaniclastic successions, particularly the syneruptive lithofacies, in order to reconstruct the tectonic and volcanic histories of receiving basins.",
