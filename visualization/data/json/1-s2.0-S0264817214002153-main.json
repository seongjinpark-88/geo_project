We have taken advantage of the hundreds of geochemical analyses of sandstones and shales from conventional core that are available from the Scotian Basin to test the relationship of the elements K, U and Th measured by spectral gamma to sedimentary facies. These elements are also known to be useful in characterising provenance of sediment to different parts of the basin. The geochemical and spectral gamma data both show that there are subtle differences in K, U and Th in different lithofacies, such as higher Th/U in low sedimentation rate facies, but they are not sufficiently distinctive to identify the lithofacies of any unknown interval. The main control on abundance of these elements is the effect of grain size, that is the proportion of sand to mud in sediment. Volcanic sources have a high K/Th ratio, and early Albian sediments with relatively high volcanic component have unusually high K/Th. In distal shale-prone successions, the grain size effect is sufficiently small that climate controlled variations in Th/K ratio are recognised in the Early Cretaceous, with the ratio being higher at times of humid weathering on land. The variations in Th/K ratio through time are broadly similar to those known from Western European sections, notably with topmost Hauterivian and topmost Aptian humid events. Overall, this study provides an assessment of the use and pitfalls of spectral gamma logs in a deltaic succession.\nCrown Copyright © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "text": "Spectral gamma-ray logging is a rapidmethod of measuring K, U and Th abundance in petroleum basins. It may be useful in some sedimentary rocks as a quantitative method of defining lithofacies where conventional core is sparse (North and Boering, 1999; Ehrenberg and Svana, 2001). Humid terrestrial weathering preferentially leaches K and U relative to Th, and spectral gamma may thus provide information on climate or rate of tectonic uplift in the hinterland of a sedimentary basin (Ruffell and Worden, 2000; Ghasemi-Nejad et al., 2010). Spectral gamma may also allow chemostratigraphic correlation (Doveton and Merriam, 2004).\nThe Tithonian (latest Jurassic) to early Cenomanian succession in the Scotian Basin consists of deltaic rocks several kilometres\nan.gc.ca (D.J.W. Piper). Jubilee Avenue, Milton Park,\nevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nthick. The Early Cretaceous succession has been divided into the Missisauga (BerriasianeBarremian) and Logan Canyon (AptianeCenomanian) formations (Fig. 2). Studies of conventional core have resulted in the recognition of a wide range of fluvial, coastal and prodeltaic lithofacies (Cummings and Arnott, 2005; Gould et al., 2012). Spectral gamma data is available for some of this core and thus raises the question as to whether facies recognised in core might be interpreted from wireline logs, where no core is available, on the basis of variation in K, U and Th abundance. The elements K, U and Th, along with Rb and Sr, were shown to be the most useful in determining provenance of Scotian Basin sandstones andmudstones on the basis of principal component analysis of geochemical analyses of bulk sediment samples (Pe-Piper et al., 2008). Large numbers of whole-rock geochemical analyses are available for samples of sandstone and mudstone from conventional core from the Scotian Basin (Zhang et al., 2014).\nThe goal of this study was to evaluate the use of spectral gamma logs in providing information on changes in lithofacies and provenance of sediment in the Lower Cretaceous of the Scotian Basin (Figs. 1, 2). First, rock geochemistry is used to evaluate the extent to\nwhich covariation of K, U and Th can be used to identify (a) changes in facies and (b) changes in provenance that might then be identified from spectral gamma logs, and could not be more easily determined by other logging tools. Second, spectral gamma from conventional core is used to further evaluate whether lithofacies distinctions can be made using spectral gamma alone. Third, with\nthe understanding gained as to the factors that might influence K, U and Th variability in sedimentary rocks in the basin, we apply the technique of using Th/K ratios from spectral gamma in shales to determine variation in the type of sediment supplied to the Lower Cretaceous of the Scotian Basin."

    "text": "Four types of data were used in this study: visual description of the conventional core, 1 cm3 samples from conventional core that were analysed for bulk geochemical composition, core spectral gamma logs measured in the laboratory from selected conventional core, and wireline spectral gamma logs measured in the field from selected wells.\nVisual descriptions of conventional core and geochemical samples were taken from conventional core in four wells: from the Tithonian interval in Thebaud C-74 and the Hauterivian to Albian intervals in the Panuke P-90 and Cohasset A-52 wells, all in the central part of the basin; and selected intervals from the Tithonian to the Albian in the Peskowesk A-99 well in the eastern part of the basin (Figs. 1, 2). Stratigraphic sections of conventional core for Thebaud C-74 and Peskowesk A-99 are presented by Okwese et al. (2011) and for Panuke P-90 and Cohasset A-52 by Gould et al. (2012). Lithofacies were described using a standard scheme (Table 1) that is described in detail by Gould et al. (2012). The facies scheme is hierarchical, with facies defined on the basis of the general environmental interpretation, as defined by lithology and sedimentary structures and are further subdivided into subfacies in order to discriminate between different rocks within the same depositional environment. The basic lithofacies scheme is: open shelf (lithofacies 1; mudstone); shoreface (lithofacies 2; sandstone and mudstone); transgressive shelf (lithofacies 3; sandstone, mudstone, or limestone); fluvial to tidal estuarine channel (lithofacies 4; sandstone); lower tidal flat, intertidal to subtidal (lithofacies 5; sandstone > mudstone); upper tidal flat, intertidal (lithofacies 6; mudstone > sandstone); tidal marsh or deltaic swamp (lithofacies 7; lignite or carbon-rich mudstone); lagoon (lithofacies 8, mudstone); river mouth turbidites (lithofacies 9;\nTable 1 Facies nomenclature (simplified from Gould et al., 2012).\nFacies Normal lithology Variant lithologies\n1 - open shelf bioturbated mudstone, fully marine fossils\n1c - calcareous shales; 1d - interpreted MFS with common sandstone\nShelf distant from river input\n3 - transgressive shelf muddy sandstone above ravinement surface, common intraclasts and heavy bioclasts 3c - lithic conglomerate; 3i - intraclast conglomerate; 3x - sandy mudstone; 3y muddy sandstone.\nTransgressive lag, shallow to deeper marine water\n2 - shoreface fine sandstone, mudstone; variably bioturbated; storm beds 2b - moderate to common bioturbation; 2c - common to completely bioturbated - 60-90% sandstone.\nShoreface, sandier in shallower water\n4x - fluvial cross bedded medium to coarse grained sandstone; bioturbation absent\nFluvial channel\n4 - estuarine cross bedded sandstone with mud drapes; sparse bioturbation 4g - similar but bioturbation absent, base of sandstone maybe erosional; 4o - similar but Ophiomorpha abundant; 4s - lenticular sandstone and siltstone with mud drapes.\nEstuarine channel\n5 - sandy tidal flat lenticular sandstone beds, interbedded mudstone, sparse Skolithos facies bioturbation 5s - > 70% sandstone, some bioclasts Sandy lower tidal flat\n6 - muddy tidal flat mudstone with laminated and lenticular siltstone and sparse Skolithos facies bioturbation\nMuddy upper tidal flat\npmawsciatledrohsramladiTlaocyddumrolaoclaoc-7\nnoogaLenotsdumdetanimalnoogal-8\n0 - prodeltaic turbidite\nmudstones with graded siltstone and sandstone beds (<25 cm), absent to sparse bioturbation 0m - mud dominant; 0s - sand dominant.

Tithonian rocks are assigned to the Lower Member of the Missisauga Formation in the central part of the basin (Thebaud C-74) and to the uppermost part of the Mic Mac Formation farther east (Peskowesk A-99) (Fig. 2). The Middle Member of the Missisauga Formation (Valanginian) was sampled in Peskowesk A-99; the Upper Member of the Missisauga Formation (HauterivianeBarremian) in Peskowesk A-99 and Cohasset A-52; the Naskapi Member of the Logan Canyon Formation (Aptian) in Panuke B-90; and the lower part of the Cree Member of the Logan Canyon Formation (early Albian) in the Panuke B-90 well. Samples were analysed geochemically by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, using methods described in detail by Pe-Piper et al. (2008). Precision for K is 0.01 wt%, for U is 0.01 ppm and for Th is 0.05 ppm.\nSpectral gamma is measured over core samples in order to locate them correctly within the well by matching the core gamma to wireline gamma. Core spectral gamma is of higher resolution than wireline logs which are measured in the well. Paper copies of core spectral gamma records for K, U and Thwere available through the Geoscience Research Centre of the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board. The logs were scanned at a high resolution and curves were digitised individually at a 5 cm depth interval using Engauge digitising software (Engauge Digitizer, 2007). Each digitised depth point was assigned to a lithofacies (Table 1). Reproducibility was tested by replicate digitising. This showed that about 5% of digitised points were poorly replicated and would plot as outliers on scatter plots (Fig. 3). These poorly replicated values were\nalmost all where gamma values changed rapidly or where the poor quality of the paper records made it difficult to follow overlapping traces. Otherwise, reproducibility was better than 0.5 vol % for K, 1 ppm for U and 3 ppm for Th. Based on these results, in other scatter plots, 5% of the data points were identified as digitising outliers.\nWireline spectral gamma logs (plots only, not digital data) were analysed only from shale-prone intervals in deep-water wells Newburn H-23, Weymouth A-45, Annapolis G-24 and Crimson F81, together with outer shelf well Chebucto K-90 (Fig. 1). The average shale baseline value over 100 m intervals was visually\nestimated from paper records. Age control was based on Weston et al. (2012)."

    "text": "Samples were examined from four wells for which large numbers of sample geochemical analyses are available: the Barremian to Albian of the Panuke B-90 and Cohasset A-52 wells, only 7.5 kmapart, which are considered together; the Tithonian toAlbian of the Peskowesk A-99 well and the Tithonian of the Thebaud C-74\nwell (Figs. 1 and 2). Aspects of the geochemical data from the latter two wells have been presented by Okwese et al. (2011).\nThe first step was to examine the variation of the elements of interest, namely K, U and Thwith lithology and diagenetic cements. Plots against Si principally reflect variations in the sandstone to shale ratio, with all three elements of interest 2e3 times higher in shales than in sandstones (Fig. 4). Silicon contentmay in some cases be diluted by carbonate and other diagenetic cements. Plots of elements against Ca (not illustrated) identify samples with abundant carbonate cement (Pe-Piper et al., 2008), but clay mineral or silica cements cannot be readily distinguished in bulk rock geochemical data (Gould et al., 2010). No useful variations in K, U and Th relative to diagenetic features were identified.\nwesk A-99, Panuke B-90 and Cohasset A-52. Symbols indicate different facies (Table 1).\nBiplots of pairs of the elements K, U and Th by lithofacies show a tendency for marine facies to have lower Th/K and U/K ratios, in contrast to fluvial and tidal facies that have higher ratios (Fig. 5). The influence of the sandstone to shale ratio on elemental compositionmeans that the distinction between facies is not strong and could not be used to classify an unknown sample. Lithologically distinctive, low sedimentation rate, retrogradational facies 1 (fully marine shales) and 3 (reworked sands) tend to have a higher Th/U ratio. Similar plots in which samples are distinguished by stratigraphic level show that many samples in the Albian Cree Member have rather higher K than would be expected for the Th or U content (Th illustrated in Fig. 6). Figure 7 shows the variation of K, U and Th in Albian sedimentary rocks (grey field, excluding 5% outliers) compared to geochemical analyses of intermediate to felsic Cretaceous volcanic rocks from the Scotian Basin (symbols)."

    "heading": "3.2. Variation in K, U and Th by facies from core spectral gamma",
    "text": "The abundance of K, U and Thmeasured by core spectral gamma can be compared with abundances measured from 1 cm3 samples (Fig. 8). The relatively low spatial resolution of the core spectral gamma, estimated to be several decimetres, and minor uncertainties in sample position relative to core gamma, estimated to be generally less than 10 cm, make precise matching of the two datasets difficult. For example, in fine sandstone with <40% interbedded mudstone beds from Thebaud C-74, the whole-rock geochemical analyses were made from sandstone beds, whereas the core spectra gammameasures both the sandstone beds and the interbedded mudstones (Fig. 8). Overall, the core spectral gamma confirms that the principal control on variation in K, U and Th is grain size, withmud bioturbated into sandstone (e.g. Thebaud C-74, core 2) and thin silt beds in shale (e.g., Thebaud C-74, top of core 1) having a clear effect on elemental abundance.\nAll digitised core spectral gamma points were plotted by lithofacies and stratigraphic level: an example plot for river-mouth turbidites from the Panuke B-90 well is shown in Figure 9A. Fields encompassing the cluster of 95% of the data were drawn, based on the estimate that the outlying 5% of the digitised data had significant errors. The fields for this and other lithofacies are summarised in Figure 9B and C. They suggest that most lithofacies have 80e100% overlapping areas and that control of spectral gamma by grain size masks any other lithofacies effect.\nFrom trends seen in the scatter plots, histograms were used to explore the spread in spectral gamma ray U and Th values for different stratigraphic levels and between the sandy and muddy\nith geochemical analyses of intermediate to felsic Cretaceous volcanic rocks from the from Bowman et al., 2012).\nlithofacies. The spread of Th frequency is similar in all the stratigraphic members, with the Barremian (Upper Member of the Missisauga Formation) having a high frequency of low (0e1 ppm) Th values (Fig. 10). Among individual lithofacies or lithofacies groups, there are some stratigraphic differences: for example, in the Barremian, Th values are all low (<5 ppm) for river sandstones and river-mouth turbidites, whereas shoreface sandstones in the Aptian (Naskapi Member) lack low (<5 ppm) Th values. These differences are likely due to the observation made during core description that the Barremian has a higher proportion of clean sandstones, whereas Aptian shoreface sandstones have mudstone mixed in by bioturbation. Histograms of U (not illustrated) in muddy lithofacies (tidal flat, prodelta turbidites, and shelf muds) show a similar range of values for each facies, with the majority of data points from 0 to 7 ppm. Uranium, therefore, does not appear useful for differentiating between the different mud-dominated lithofacies."

    "heading": "3.3. Stratigraphic variation in K, U and Th from wireline spectral gamma logs",
    "text": "Given the strong grain size control on spectral gamma, measurements were made on wireline logs fromwells using a visuallyestimated shale baseline value averaged over 100 m intervals (Ruffell and Worden, 2000). Five wells with predominantly shale sections in the Lower Cretaceous were chosen: Chebucto K-90, Newburn H-23,Weymouth A-45, Annapolis G-24 and Crimson F-81 (Fig. 11). Intervals without data either lack wireline spectral gamma or had toomuch interbedded sandstone and siltstone to pick a clear shale baseline. Some general trends can be recognised in all wells (summarised in Fig. 12). The Th/K ratio shows no clear pattern in the early Hauterivian, rises to a peak above the mid-Hauterivian unconformity and then drops again through much of the Barremian. Through the Aptian, the Th/K ratio rises to a peak in the late\niver-mouth turbidite sands and (B) shoreface sands and sandy tidal flats (the latter only\n) mk(\nhtped derusae m\nAptian, drops again in the early Albian and rises steadily to the top of the Albian.

In particular, the lower Aptian is well controlled by the presence of ammonites of the Deshayesites ammonite zone (Weston et al., 2012).

It seems likely that the relatively lower K in fluvial and coastal facies is because these facies experience more diagenesis by meteoric water (Karim et al., 2010; Okwese et al., 2011), which tends to alter detrital K-feldspar to kaolinite and removes Kþ in solution.\nOther studies have shown that variation in U is a useful indicator of lithofacies, for example because U is concentrated in organic matter (Schnyder et al., 2006) and because humid terrestrial weathering depletes both K and U relative to Th (Parkinson, 1996). In this study, U and Th were found to correlate well (Fig. 5), and better than either element with K. The elements U and Th also correlate well with elemental indicators of heavy mineral concentration, including Zr, Ti, P and REE (Pe-Piper et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014) and are therefore probably mostly held in heavy minerals (Hurst, 1990). Most of the heavy minerals are of polycyclic origin and the heavy mineral assemblage is relatively homogeneous, particularly in any one part of the basin (Tsikouras et al., 2011). The heavy mineral effect (in sandstones and siltstones) may mask any influence due to changes in humid terrestrial weathering or organic matter."

    "heading": "4.2. Spectral gamma as an indicator of provenance",
    "text": "The most pronounced variation in K, U and Th with stratigraphy is that the early Albian (lower part of the Cree Member), particularly at Peskowesk A-99, has higher K than would be expected for the observed U and Th values in geochemical analysis of 1 cm3 rock samples (Fig. 6). This is despite the fact that coastal lithofacies predominate in this interval (Okwese et al., 2011) and would tend to have relatively lower K as discussed in the previous section. The early Albian in the Scotian Basin is distinctive in having particularly abundant volcanic detritus including reworked Cretaceous zircons (Fig. 10 of Bowman et al., 2012). This volcanic detritus is reworked from a line of active volcanoes extending from the Orpheus graben to the SW Grand Banks (Fig. 1; Bowman et al., 2012). Intermediate and felsic rocks from the source volcanoes aremost likely to survive weathering and transport. Analysed examples of such rocks (Fig. 7) show high abundance of K compared to sandstones and shales, however it is possible that volcanic detritus is not the only source of K and input from other, undetermined sources may have contributed to the elevated K values."

    "heading": "4.3. Climatic variation in the Early Cretaceous",
    "text": "Inwestern Europe, climatic variations betweenmore humid and more arid phases have been recognised in the Early Cretaceous (Ruffell and Batten, 1990; Ruffell andWorden, 2000). During humid periods, the proportion of kaolinite to illite delivered by rivers is higher, as a result of greater leaching during soil development. Kaolinite/illite ratio was determined by Pe-Piper et al. (2005) for the fluvial Chaswood Formation (Fig. 12), and can be tentatively correlated to the Scotian Basin succession based on correlative unconformities and volcanic ash (Pe-Piper and Piper, 2010). Potassium is a major component of illite but is absent from kaolinite, so that the Th/K ratio is higher during humid kaolin-rich periods. In the wells analysed (Fig. 11), the Th/K ratio was determined for thick successions of marine shales, unlikely to include significant coastal lithofacies. Figure 12 presents a synthesis of the Th/K spectral gamma data for all the deep-water shale-prone wells. Some relatively low Th/K values in the early Aptian might result from detrital dilution by K-rich volcanic detritus (e.g. the three lowest values in the Newburn H-23 well are in this stratigraphic interval, Fig. 11). It is also possible that more illite would be derived from the\nhinterland during times of tectonic uplift, which are inferred from regional tectonic relationships for the mid Hauterivian and during the Aptian in theMeguma block (Bowman et al., 2012) and from the Labrador rift shoulder in the Albian (Zhang et al., 2014). In the Newburn H-23 well, where both intervals of Meguma block uplift are well dated, there is no evidence for lower Th/K values in these intervals, but as noted above the early Albian does have low Th/K ratios, at time when there was greater supply of well-crystallised illite to the basin (Strathdee, 2012). Therefore we conclude that patterns in Th/K ratio that are consistent between wells are principally the result of paleoclimate variations. The most striking features are the peaks in Th/K ratio, indicating the most humid conditions, at three levels: towards the top of the Albian, in the late Hauterivian, and probably in the early Hauterivian (Figs. 11, 12). There is a Barremian arid phase apparent in Newburn H-23 and Chebucto K-90, but the late Aptian appears humid in Annapolis G24 and Newburn H-23. Whether the low Th/K in the early Aptian is the result of changes in detrital input (including volcanic detritus) or the result of an arid period is uncertain. By late Albian, conditions again appear humid in the Newburn H-23, Weymouth A-45 and Annapolis G-24 wells.\nThese paleoclimatic fluctuations are compared with those observed in western Europe (Fig. 12), which was at the same paleolatitude as the drainage basin supplying the Scotian Basin. Western Europe shows a BarremianeEarly Aptian arid phase (Ruffell et al., 2002) that is also seen in the Scotian Basin data. Less pronounced aridity is also seen in the early Albian in western Europe, suggesting that changes in detrital supply are not the sole reason for lower Th/K in the early Albian Cree Member.\nShorter term paleoclimatic fluctuations may also play an important role. In the Tethyan Ocean and adjacent basins in Europe, laminatedorganicmudstones (LOM)are associatedwithor followed byexcursions in d13C and d18O and are interpreted asmarking shortlived (~0.5e1 Ma) warm humid climatic events (Fig. 12; F€ollmi, 2012). For example, the observed late Hauterivianeearly Barremian peak in Th/K appears to correlate with the Faraoni LOM event of F€ollmi (2012). The basal Naskapi Member in Panuke B-90 corresponds to the early Aptian, with low Th/K corresponding to an arid period, rising up section tomorehumid conditions likely correlating with the Selli LOM event. In deep water, sedimentation rates are very low in the Aptian and basal Albian, because rapid supply of sediment to the Scotian Basin was tectonically blocked (Bowman et al., 2012). The very prominent Paquier LOM event, at the AptianeAlbian boundary, is reflected by high Th/K inNewburnH-23 and Annapolis G-24. Neither the Faraoni nor Paquier LOM events show significant changes in U in the slope wells."

    "heading": "5. Conclusions",
    "text": "1. In middle Mesozoic deltaic successions of the Scotian Basin, spectral gamma is no more effective than total gamma in determining lithofacies. Grain size (sand to shale ratio) is the principal control on K, U and Th. Low sedimentation rate facies tend to have higher Th/U ratio, but are not sufficiently distinctive to use spectral gamma to interpret intervals without conventional core. 2. In the early Albian, increased supply of volcanic detritus resulted in a higher K/Th ratio. 3. In distal shale-prone wells, where the grain size effect can be avoided, correlative variation in Th/K ratio can be used to infer changes from arid to humid weathering conditions on land. The possible effect of volcanic detritus makes climatic interpretation of the early Albian uncertain. Warm humid intervals recognised in European sections in the topmost Hauterivian, lower Aptian and topmost Aptian are also recognised in the Scotian Basin."

  "abstractText": "Spectral gamma logging has been useful in some settings for correlation of wells, for identification of sediment facies, and for interpretation of hinterland paleoclimate. We have taken advantage of the hundreds of geochemical analyses of sandstones and shales from conventional core that are available from the Scotian Basin to test the relationship of the elements K, U and Th measured by spectral gamma to sedimentary facies. These elements are also known to be useful in characterising provenance of sediment to different parts of the basin. The geochemical and spectral gamma data both show that there are subtle differences in K, U and Th in different lithofacies, such as higher Th/U in low sedimentation rate facies, but they are not sufficiently distinctive to identify the lithofacies of any unknown interval. The main control on abundance of these elements is the effect of grain size, that is the proportion of sand to mud in sediment. Volcanic sources have a high K/Th ratio, and early Albian sediments with relatively high volcanic component have unusually high K/Th. In distal shale-prone successions, the grain size effect is sufficiently small that climate controlled variations in Th/K ratio are recognised in the Early Cretaceous, with the ratio being higher at times of humid weathering on land. The variations in Th/K ratio through time are broadly similar to those known from Western European sections, notably with topmost Hauterivian and topmost Aptian humid events. Overall, this study provides an assessment of the use and pitfalls of spectral gamma logs in a deltaic succession. Crown Copyright © 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
