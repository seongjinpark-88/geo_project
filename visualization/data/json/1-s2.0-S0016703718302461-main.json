    "text": "Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene time represents a critical transitional period in Earth history. Global events include short-term instability in climate and ocean circulation, large igneous province emplacement, and catastrophic extinction of marine and terrestrial fauna due at least in part to a bolide impact event. The response of the ocean system to Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) global events has been the subject of much research, yet fundamental questions remain regarding carbon cycling, climate, ocean mixing, and redox conditions. To help elucidate paleoceanographic changes across the KPg transition, we revisit the classic Maastrichtian to Danian chalk-limestone succession at Stevns Klint, Denmark with a suite of new geochemical data, including insights from the redox-sensitive chromium isotope system. We use carbon and oxygen isotope trends to form a well-constrained framework for the succession, before presenting strontium isotope, chromium isotope, and rare-earth element data for the units deposited both before and after the K-Pg event. Carbon isotopes show only minor perturbation across the K-Pg boundary and oxygen isotopes record a prominent positive excursion, with both of these trends standing in contrast to many K-Pg boundary sections worldwide. Strontium isotopes record a spike towards more radiogenic values, which is consistent with a globally-observed, short-term weathering pulse. The chromium isotope profile of Maastrichtian chalk begins with strongly positive values followed by a sharp negative excursion associated with a facies shift and initiation of bottom currents in the Chalk Sea. d53Cr values then recover, before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary and into the Danian limestone. Chromium isotope trends do not correspond to changes in hydrothermal input or basin redox conditions—instead, we propose that mixing of water masses with distinct chromium isotope signatures controlled temporal chromium isotope variability. The local mixing event inferred from our Maastrichtian chromium isotope data could be related to a temporary inflow of Tethyan bottom waters, or the shift from end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming (associated with Deccan volcanism) to the worldwide cooling phase that immediately preceded the K-Pg boundary. No immediate change in chromium isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary, indicating that the bolide impactor did not substantially perturb the marine chromium cycle, at least at the scale resolvable by our data.

    "heading": "1. INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "The Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene transition was a time of dynamic changes in the Earth system. These include short-term climatic fluctuations against the backdrop of global greenhouse conditions (Bralower et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2003; Wilf et al., 2003), as well as global changes in ocean circulation (MacLeod and Huber, 1996; Cramer et al., 2009). These changes in ocean mixing are evidenced by temporal variations in interbasinal carbon (C) and oxygen (O) isotope gradients (MacLeod and Huber, 1996; Cramer et al., 2009), seawater neodymium (Nd) isotope signatures (Moiroud et al., 2016), and ocean general circulation model experiments (Poulsen et al., 2001). The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (ca. 66 Ma) is also marked by abrupt extinction of marine and terrestrial fauna worldwide, representing one of the three largest mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic Eon (Sepkoski, 1996; Schulte et al., 2010). This extinction event has confidently been linked to a large bolide impact event (Alvarez et al., 1980; 1982; Schulte et al., 2010), as well as global perturbations resulting from emplacement of the Deccan Traps large igneous province (Schoene et al., 2015; Font et al., 2016). Subsequent ecosystem recovery was protracted and spatially heterogeneous, occurring over a period of up to four million years (D’Hondt, 2005; Coxall et al., 2006; Aberhan et al., 2007).\nIn the Danish Basin of northern Europe, a relatively continuous record of Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene (Campanian, Maastrichtian, and Danian) time is preserved in carbonate-rich facies (chalk and limestone). These rocks hold significant potential for unraveling the response of the ocean system to Late Cretaceous and Early Paleogene global events. Published geochemical data are sparse and limited to the C- and O-isotope systems (e.g., Schmitz et al., 1992; Hart et al., 2004, 2005; Thibault et al., 2012, 2015, 2016; Boussaha et al., 2016, 2017; Harlou et al., 2016; Sial et al., 2016), however, thus limiting our ability to relate events in the Danish Basin to a global geochemical framework. Here we present an extensive new geochemical dataset spanning the Maastrichtian to Danian transition on the Stevns Peninsula, Denmark. This dataset includes d13C and d18O as a general framework for the entire succession, as well as strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr), trace elements (Sr, manganese [Mn], iron [Fe], and aluminum [Al]), and rareearth elements (REE), including the europium (Eu) and cerium (Ce) anomalies (Eu/Eu* and Ce/Ce*, respectively). Our focus, however, is on the chromium (Cr) isotope system before and after the K-Pg event, with Cr-isotopes representing a relatively new proxy related to redox changes in the environment (e.g., Frei et al., 2009; Planavsky et al., 2014; Gilleaudeau et al., 2016; D’Arcy et al., 2017). Together,\nour data help elucidate oceanographic conditions in the Danish Chalk Sea through a major Maastrichtian facies change and through the K-Pg transition. Chromium isotope data are also interpreted in concert with other proxy data to provide new insights into the systematics of this emerging geochemical tracer."

    "heading": "2. GEOLOGIC BACKGROUND",
    "text": "The Chalk Group is a lithostratigraphic unit with large areal extent in northwestern Europe that can reach a thickness of >2000 m in the Danish Basin (Liboriussen et al., 1987; Hansen and Surlyk, 2014). Lithologies are dominated by coccolith chalk and limestone deposited across a broad epeiric sea (the ‘Chalk Sea’) during relative sea level highstand. In the Danish Basin, Campanian to Maastrichtian strata consist of alternating pure chalk, marly chalk, and marl, with variable contribution of benthic fossils and decimeter-scale flint bands (Surlyk et al., 2013). Danian strata consist of limestone rich in benthic fossils (including large bryozoan mounds), as well as prominent flint horizons.\nIn this study, we investigated Maastrichtian to Danian strata in both outcrop and cores from Stevns Klint, Zealand, Denmark (Fig. 1). Our main set of outcrop samples are from a composite section recently collected at two localities on the Stevns Peninsula—Højerup, just north of the Højerup Old Church, and Kulstirenden, situated in the northernmost part of the peninsula (Fig. 1). Stevns Klint has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Center based on its importance in verifying the K-Pg bolide impact hypothesis (Alvarez et al., 1980; Schmitz et al., 1988; Zhao and Bada, 1989). Additionally, we sampled specific stratigraphic horizons at several other localities on the Stevns Peninsula in order to verify the local reproducibility of the Cr-isotope signal (see discussion below). These include outcrop samples from the coastal cliff at Mandehoved and from the Sigerslev Quarry, as well as core samples from two cores drilled near Boesdal (Fig. 1).\nThe units of interest to this study (shown in Fig. 2) begin with the Maastrichtian upper Sigerslev Member of the Tor Formation, which is informally known as the ‘White Chalk’. This unit consists of white coccolith chalk mudstone with abundant Zoophycos trace fossils, intercalated with sub-parallel flint bands. Approximately seven meters of the upper Sigerslev Member is exposed at Stevns Klint. The top of the Sigerslev Member contains two prominent incipient hardgrounds, the top of which marks the boundary with the overlying Højerup Member (informally known as the ‘Grey Chalk’). These hardgrounds are characterized by nodular hardening, small-scale erosional relief, and development of underlying Thalassinoides burrows, and\nG.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332 307\nultimately represent seafloor exposure and complete cessation of sedimentation (Surlyk et al., 2006). The SigerslevHøjerup transition marks a significant facies change, and the Højerup Member consists of grey wackestone containing benthic fossils (bryozoan, bivalves, and echinoderms) in a coccolith mud matrix intercalated with wavy, meterhigh, asymmetrical flint bands. The flint bands are thought to mimic sea-bed topography and their geometry suggests the development of pervasive bottom currents in the latest Maastrichtian Stage (Lykke-Andersen and Surlyk, 2004; Anderskouv et al., 2007). Evidence for soft-sediment deformation and Thalassinoides burrows are common in the Højerup Member, which is approximately three meters thick in our main outcrop composite section (Fig. 2).\nFor the late Maastrichtian Stage, average sedimentation rates of ca. 4 to 5 cm/kyr can be estimated according to the age model applied to the nearby Stevns-1 and Stevns-2 cores (Boussaha et al., 2016; Thibault et al., 2016). This points to the ten meters of Maastrichtian deposits presented in our compiled section representing ca. 200 to 250 kyr. However, some additional time may be missing in relation to the two incipient hardgrounds between the Sigerslev and Højerup members. The age model established by Thibault et al. (2016) suggests that the hiatus between these two members is substantially less than 150 kyr.\nOverlying the Højerup Member is the Fiskeler Member (the ‘Fish Clay’) of the Rødvig Formation, which marks the K-Pg boundary. This unit is approximately 5 cm thick at Højerup, but is expanded to a thickness of up to 30 cm thick at Kulstirenden. This member has a lower carbonate content than the rest of the succession, although carbonate content increases upsection towards the boundary with the overlying Cerithium Limestone Member. The Fiskeler\nMember is also enriched in iridium and other platinum group and siderophile elements—a direct consequence of the K-Pg bolide impact event (Alvarez et al., 1980; Schmitz et al., 1988; Frei and Frei, 2002). Above the Fiskeler Member lies the Danian Cerithium Limestone Member, which varies from 20 to 80 cm thick along Stevns Klint, and consists of micrite that is thoroughly burrowed by Thalassinoides. The top of the Cerithium Limestone Member is marked by a prominent erosional hardground (Heinberg, 1999; Surlyk et al., 2006). At our locality, north of the Højerup Old Church, the sampled Cerithium Limestone is 30 cm thick (Fig. 2).\nThe final unit considered in this study is the overlying Danian Korsnæb Member of the Stevns Klint Formation. This member is informally known as the ‘Bryozoan Limestone’ and consists of large, asymmetrical bryozoan mounds that had a seafloor relief of up to nine meters (Surlyk et al., 2006). Large flint bands with substantial vertical relief are prominent, as are localized hardgrounds and Thalassinoides burrows. The main lithologies present are fossiliferous packstone, bryozoan rudstone, and floatstone, and skeletal fragments are poorly sorted and angular. We sampled approximately ten meters of the Korsnæb Member at Stevns Klint, north of the Højerup Old Church.\nThe regular flint bands of the Korsnæb Member are thought to correspond to Milankovitch cycles (Surlyk, 1997). The regular cyclicity in the flint bands of the Danian Korsnæb Member may be compared to the shallow-water late Maastrichtian chalk of the Netherlands where such bands correspond to precession cycles (Ziljstra, 1994). The thickness between two flint bands varies from less than 50 cm to up to 1.5 m from the edges to the central axis of the bryozoan mounds, suggesting sedimentation rates in\n308 G.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332\nthe range of 2.5–7.5 cm/kyr. The studied Danian interval is further constrained by nannofossil biostratigraphy. The base of nannofossil zone NP2 at 7.5 m above the K-Pg boundary is defined at Stevns Klint by the coincident first occurrences of Cruciplacolithus intermedius and Coccolithus pelagicus (actually considered as Cruciplacolithus tenuis and Ericsonia cava by Perch-Nielsen (1979), prior to taxonomic revisions). These two events occur 150 kyr and 300 kyr, respectively, after the K-Pg event both in the tropical Atlantic and Pacific (Westerhold et al., 2008), suggesting sedimentation rates for the Danian deposits ranging from 2.5 to 5.0 cm/kyr. These rates match well with previous considerations based on precession control over the formation of flint bands. Thus, our sampled interval of the Danian Korsnæb Member represents no more than 500 kyr. In summary, our composite section consists of Maastrichtian deposits and the Danian Cerithium Limestone and Korsnæb members sampled north of the Højerup Old Church, along with the expanded, 30 cm-thick Fiskeler Member sampled at Kulstirenden.\nPrevious studies suggest that the units of interest have undergone a minimal degree of post-depositional geochemical alteration. Maastrichtian units are only weakly lithified, and there is no evidence for C- and O-isotope resetting in either Maastrichtian or Danian strata on the Stevns Peninsula (Schmitz et al., 1992; Thibault et al., 2012). This makes these units an excellent target for geochemical proxy studies because of their potential ability to retain primary seawater signatures. Detailed discussion of diagenesis based on our data can be found in Section 5.1. Outcrop photographs of all units of interest can be found in Fig. 3, and photomicrographs detailing differences in fossil content between the Sigerslev, Højerup, and Korsnæb members are shown in Fig. 4."

    "text": "The same solution used for ICP-OES analysis was used for Cr-isotope analysis. To recap, 1 g of sample powder was dissolved in 0.5 M HCl, with insoluble residue removed by centrifugation. Sample powder was spiked with 50Cr-54Cr double spike (Schoenberg et al., 2008) to a 4:1 sample to spike [Cr] ratio before dissolution. Cr elution procedures were modified based on Frei et al. (2011) and are summarized here.\nAfter centrifugation, the supernatant was pipetted into a glass flask that was pre-cleaned with aqua regia. Flasks were placed uncovered on a hot plate and the supernatant was dried down overnight at 120 C. Next, the sample was re-dissolved in aqua regia (made from doubledistilled HCl and HNO3) and, again, dried down overnight at 120 C to ensure sample/spike homogenization. Samples were then re-dissolved in 0.1 M HCl, and 1 mL of (NH4)4S2O8 was added to each flask as an oxidizing agent. Flasks were capped and heated in a sand bath to oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI). Oxidized samples were then passed over an anion exchange column charged with 2 mL of Dowex AG 1 8 anion exchange resin (100–200 mesh, preconditioned with 6M HCl), during which Cr(VI)-oxyanions\nare adsorbed to the resin surface by exchange with chloride ions. Cr was then released from the anion resin by reduction to Cr(III) using 2M double-distilled HNO3 and H2O2. The resulting liquid was collected in a Teflon beaker (pre-cleaned with aqua regia) and dried down overnight at 120 C. The sample was then re-dissolved in 1 mL of 6M double-distilled HCl, before being passed over a second anion exchange column designed specifically for removal of Fe. Fe removal is critical because of isobaric interference between 54Fe and 54Cr during isotopic analysis. Again, the resulting liquid was dried down overnight at 120 C and samples were re-dissolved in 200 lL of 6M double-distilled HCl. After dilution with 2.2 mL of ultrapure MQ water, samples were passed over a cation exchange column charged with 2 mL of Dowex AG50W-X8 cation exchange resin (200–400 mesh, preconditioned with 0.5M HCl). Cation exchange is used to separate Cr from major matrix elements such as Ca, Mg, Mn, Al, and residual Fe. The resulting liquid was dried down overnight at 120 C and the precipitate was then ready for Cr-isotopic analysis.\nAll Cr-isotope measurements were performed at the University of Copenhagen on an IsotopX Ltd. IsoProbeT TIMS or Phoenix TIMS equipped with eight Faraday collectors that allow simultaneous collection of all four chromium beams (50Cr+, 52Cr+, 53Cr+, 54Cr+) together with 49Ti+, 51V+, and 56Fe+ as interference monitors. Final precipitates after Cr separation were loaded onto outgassed Re filaments along with a mixture of 3 lL of silicic acid, 1 lL of 0.5 M H3BO3, and 1 lL of 0.5 M H3PO4. Samples were analyzed at temperatures ranging from 1000 to 1250 C with 52Cr beam intensities between 200 and 1000 mV. One run consisted of 120 cycles (grouped into 24 blocks of 5 cycles each with 10 s signal integration periods), and at least two runs were performed for each sample. Final isotopic compositions are reported as the average of these repeated analyses with standard errors reported as the standard deviation of isotopic values divided by the square root of n (the number of runs). Isotopic compositions are reported in per mil (‰) notation relative to the certified Cr-isotope standard NIST SRM 979:\nd53Cr ð‰Þ ¼ ðð53Cr=52CrsampleÞ=ð53Cr=52CrNIST SRM979Þ 1Þ 1000\nStandard errors for our samples were consistently < 0.05‰.

Blanks produced consistently < 5 ng of Cr, which is negligible compared to our samples.\nThe external reproducibility of our measurements was assessed by comparing long-term average d53Cr values for NIST SRM 979 and NIST 3112a measured on the IsoProbe-T and Phoenix to accepted values from other laboratories (e.g., Schoenberg et al., 2008). Our results over > 5 years of analyses indicate that standard values are measured 0.09‰ lower on the IsoProbe-T and 0.08‰ higher on the Phoenix compared to accepted values. As a result, 0.09‰ was added to raw d53Cr values produced on the IsoProbe-T and 0.08‰ was subtracted from raw d53Cr values produced on the Phoenix.\nDuring the course of the runs presented in this study, NIST SRM 979 and NIST 3112a values were reproduced with uncertainty (2 s.d.) <0.05‰. Additionally, we dissolved the certified carbonate standard JLs-1 and measured its Cr-isotopic composition along with samples from each run. Measured d53Cr values for JLs-1 in our lab (+1.87 ± 0.02‰, 2 s.d.; see also D’Arcy et al., 2017) are reproducible and in good agreement with published values (Bonnand et al., 2011)."

    "text": "The potential for diagenetic resetting of primary geochemical signatures was assessed using petrography, trace elements, and oxygen isotope trends. Petrography allows for visual assessment of grain size, recrystallization, and the degree of preservation of primary textural features, each of which can be indicative of fluid composition during diagenesis. In short, crystal coarsening and obliteration of primary textural details are indicative of recrystallization in the presence of non-marine (meteoric or burial) fluids. Trace elements (notably Sr, Mn, and Fe) can also be used as diagenetic indicators. The incorporation of these elements into calcite is governed by the distribution coefficient, and different types of diagenetic fluids have different trace element compositions. Well-oxygenated seawater is high in Sr relative to Mn and Fe such that primary precipitates and phases formed during early marine diagenesis are generally enriched in Sr relative to Mn and Fe (Banner and Hanson, 1990; Ullmann and Korte, 2015). Meteoric and burial fluids, by contrast, tend to be depleted in Sr relative to seawater, and recrystallization expels Sr from the calcite lattice because of its relatively large ionic radius (i.e., Rimdstidt et al., 1998). Burial fluids can also be enriched in Mn and Fe, particularly under reducing conditions (Veizer, 1983), such that burial diagenetic phases are often depleted in Sr and enriched in Mn and Fe relative to precursor marine phases. Carbon and oxygen isotopes can also be affected by carbonate diagenesis, although carbon isotopes are more difficult to reset because the system is commonly rock-buffered during diagenesis. Oxygen isotopes, by\ncontrast, are sensitive to diagenetic alteration at relatively low water/rock ratios (Banner and Hanson, 1990)."

    "heading": "3.2.2. Chromium isotope systematics",
    "text": "There are four stable isotopes of chromium (50Cr, 52Cr, 53Cr, and 54Cr), and the ratio of 53Cr to 52Cr is used in Crisotope systematics because these isotopes are the most abundant in nature. Cr exists in crustal rocks largely in its reduced form [Cr(III)] with a limited isotopic range of 0.12 ± 0.10‰ (Schoenberg et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2016a). Cr can then be liberated from crustal rocks during oxidative weathering, which produces soluble Cr(VI) that is enriched in 53Cr (Izbicki et al., 2008). Terrestrial Cr(III)oxidation occurs largely by reaction with Mn-oxides (Oze et al., 2007). Positively fractionated Cr(VI) is then delivered to the oceans via rivers (dominantly as chromate; CrO4\n), where its isotopic signature can further be modified in situ by marine processes. These include reduction of Cr(VI) back to particle-reactive Cr(III)—a process that preferentially utilizes light isotopes, leaving residual Cr(VI) further enriched in 53Cr (Døssing et al., 2011; Basu and Johnson, 2012; Han et al., 2012). Spatial and depth gradients in Cr-reduction thus impart a strongly heterogeneous d53Cr signal on modern seawater (values between +0.13 and +1.55‰), despite the long residence time of Cr (9,000– 40,000 years) compared to the ocean mixing time of approximately 1,000 years (Bonnand et al., 2013; Scheiderich et al., 2015; Paulukat et al., 2016).\nThe ability of carbonate sediments to record the Crisotopic composition of seawater has been studied both experimentally and in natural settings. Tang et al. (2007) showed that during inorganic precipitation experiments, chromate can be incorporated into the lattice of carbonate minerals with no change in valence state. Co-precipitation experiments involving chromate incorporation into calcite have also shown that abiogenic carbonate has the potential to record the Cr-isotopic signature of the ambient solution (Rodler et al., 2015). In these experiments, the degree of fractionation between solution and precipitate scaled with the Cr concentration of the solution, but in experiments with the lowest initial Cr concentration (8.6 ppm), precipitates were < 0.1‰ different than the ambient solution. This suggests that only minimal fractionation occurs during chromate incorporation into abiogenic calcite at low Cr concentrations typical of seawater (0.08–0.5 ppm; Scheiderich et al., 2015; Paulukat et al., 2016).\nStudies of modern invertebrate shells (coral, bivalves, and gastropods) reveal that Cr-isotope fractionation does occur during biomineralization, however, making skeletal carbonates an unreliable direct archive of seawater d53Cr values (Paulukat et al., 2015; Pereira et al., 2016). Coral skeletons are consistently 53Cr-depleted compared to ambient seawater (Pereira et al., 2016), and the offset between bivalves, gastropods, and seawater appears to be nonuniform and species-specific (Paulukat et al., 2015). Similarly, Wang et al. (2017) showed that modern planktonic foraminifera are highly variable in their d53Cr composition, making them a non-straightforward archive for seawater Cr-isotopes. Holmden et al. (2016) measured the Crisotopic composition of bulk carbonate sediment from the\n312 G.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332\nCaribbean Sea, and found an average difference of 0.46‰ between the sediments and ambient seawater. Contrary to the species-specific studies described above, the offset between bulk sediment and seawater appeared to be fairly uniform, suggesting that a correction could be applied to ancient carbonate sediments (Holmden et al., 2016). The bulk sediments studied by Holmden et al. (2016) were composed of green algae, corals, foraminifera, red algae, and echinoderms, as well as micritic and lithic grains. Despite these complications, we propose that relative stratigraphic trends in d53Cr can be interpreted in a paleoenvironmental context as long as bulk sediment composition remains relatively constant (e.g., D’Arcy et al., 2017). The validity of this assumption in the context of our data is discussed in Sections 5.4.2 and 5.4.3.\nThe Cr-isotope proxy has been increasingly applied to the ancient rock record in a number of capacities. These include determinations of Precambrian atmospheric oxygen levels (Frei et al., 2009, 2011, 2017; Planavsky et al., 2014; Cole et al., 2016; Gilleaudeau et al., 2016; Rodler et al., 2016a), Phanerozoic marine redox conditions (Reinhard et al., 2014; Gueguen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016b; D’Arcy et al., 2017), and potential hydrothermal influence on the global ocean (Holmden et al., 2016)."

This detrital Cr is expected to have an isotopic signature indistinguishable from crustal rocks ( 0.12 ± 0.10‰; Schoenberg et al., 2008), such that detrital influence would pull the isotopic composition of a sample towards ‘unfractionated’ crustal values. In extreme cases where detrital Cr dominates, a sample could erroneously appear ‘unfractionated’ even if its authigenic Cr component derived from seawater is positively fractionated.\nWe used the immobile element Al as a monitor for detrital influence, which allowed us to estimate the percentage of detrital Cr in each sample. We then performed a detrital correction to estimate authigenic d53Cr values. These procedures (modified from Gilleaudeau et al., 2016) are described in the following paragraphs.\nFirst, the concentration (in ppm) of detrital Cr leached during sample dissolution ([Cr]det) was estimated using: ½Cr det ¼ ½Cr avgsh ð½Al sample=½Al avgshÞ This is essentially a comparison between sample Cr/Al ratios and the Cr/Al ratio of average shale, with average shale serving as our best approximation for the composition of typical clay-rich detrital sediment. Here, we set [Cr]avgsh to 90 ppm and [Al]avgsh to 88,900 ppm based on the average shale compilation of Wedepohl (1991). Next, the concentration (in ppm) of authigenic Cr ([Cr]auth) was estimated using:\n½Cr auth ¼ ½Cr sample ½Cr det We then estimated the percentage of detrital Cr measured in each of our isotopic analyses using:\n%det Cr ¼ ð½Cr det=½Cr sampleÞ 100 Lastly, we estimated the isotopic composition of the authigenic Cr component (d53Crauth) using:\nd53Crauth ¼ ðd53Crraw ðd53Crdetn ð%det Cr=100ÞÞÞ =ð1 ð%det Cr=100ÞÞ\nHere, we set d53Crdet to 0.124 based on average crustal values reported by Schoenberg et al. (2008). Gilleaudeau et al. (2016) also performed detrital corrections using the composition of post-Archean Australian shale (PAAS) (Taylor and McLennan, 1985) instead of the average shale composite of Wedepohl (1991). They reported <2% differences in estimates of detrital Cr contribution and <0.02‰ differences in d53Crauth values, suggesting that either compilation is suitable for detrital Cr corrections."

    "text": "We used several REE-based proxies to assess environmental controls on the Cr-isotope composition of our samples. First, we used the europium anomaly (Eu/Eu*) to monitor potential hydrothermal input to the Danish Basin. To calculate Eu/Eu*, we first normalized samarium (Sm), Eu, and terbium (Tb) concentrations to post-Archean Australian shale using published values from Pourmand et al. (2012). Next, the Eu anomaly was calculated based on Lawrence et al. (2006): EuSN/Eu*SN = [Eu]SN/(⅔[Sm]SN + ⅓[Tb]SN), where the subscript SN denotes shalenormalized element concentrations. Modern seawater is characterized by little to no Eu anomaly, whereas hydrothermal fluids exhibit strongly positive Eu anomalies (Olivarez and Owen, 1991). This makes the Eu anomaly a powerful tool for recognizing the influence of hydrothermal fluids on the local environment.\nTo monitor regional redox variability, we used an independent proxy for basin redox conditions—the cerium anomaly (Ce/Ce*) (see German and Elderfield, 1990 for review). To calculate Ce/Ce*, we first normalized Ce, praseodymium (Pr), and Nd concentrations to post-Archean Australian shale using published values from Pourmand et al. (2012). Next, the Ce anomaly was calculated based on Lawrence et al. (2006): CeSN/Ce*SN = [Ce]SN/([Pr]SN\n2 / [Nd]SN), where the subscript SN denotes shale-normalized element concentrations. Pr and Nd were used to calculate the Ce anomaly instead of traditionally used lanthanum (La) because anomalous behavior of La can artificially exaggerate the Ce anomaly (Lawrence et al., 2006; Tostevin et al., 2016). Unlike most REEs, Ce is redoxsensitive and Ce(III) can be partially oxidized to Ce(IV) under oxic conditions. This causes a decrease in solubility, which results in Ce removal from seawater. As a result, modern well-oxygenated seawater is depleted in Ce relative to other trivalent REEs (i.e., it has a pronounced, negative Ce anomaly [Ce/Ce* <1]). By contrast, anoxic waters tend to have muted Ce anomalies, as evidenced Ce/Ce* values that approach 1 below the chemocline in many modern anoxic basins (German and Elderfield, 1990; German et al., 1991). Multiple studies have shown that marine carbonate sediments can preserve a reliable record of seawater REE patterns if diagenetic alternation and detrital\nG.J.

In the main Stevns Klint composite section, carbon isotopes are invariant through the Sigerslev and most of the Højerup Member, with a mean d13C value near +1.6‰ (Fig. 5). In the upper 80 cm of the Højerup Member, there is a trend towards slightly lower d13C values (+1.3‰), followed by a single data point down to 0.28‰ at the base of the Fiskeler Member. This sample has the lowest carbonate content recorded in the section (only 1% CaCO3), compared to the Sigerslev and Højerup members where carbonate content exceeds 90%. Above this, there is a short-lived positive d13C excursion up to +1.89‰ over the basal 4 cm of the Fiskeler Member, above which d13C values return to a baseline near +1.6‰. Finally, d13C values fall gradually through the Korsnæb Member to an uppermost value of +0.87‰ (Fig. 5). Carbonate content gradually increases upward through the Fiskeler Member (from 36% to a maximum of 88%), and carbonate content in the overlying Cerithium Limestone and Korsnæb members generally exceeds 80%.\nSimilar to carbon, oxygen isotopes remain relatively stable through the Sigerslev and Højerup members with a mean d18O value near 1.8‰. In the overlying Fiskeler and Cerithium Limestone members, there is a prominent positive oxygen isotope excursion up to 0.63‰, before a return to values near 1.9‰ in the Korsnæb Member (Fig. 5)."

Mn concentrations are tightly constrained between 133 and 167 ppm in the Sigerslev Member, followed by an increase to a mean value of 183 ppm in the overlying Højerup Member. As a result, Mn/Sr ratios increase upwards through the Tor Formation, but remain below 0.30 in both members. Fe concentrations are variable, but remain below 105 ppm in both the Sigerslev and Højerup members.\nThe highest Sr concentrations in the measured section are recorded in the overlying Fiskeler Member, with values up to 2284 ppm. Mn concentrations are low (mean of 153 ppm), and Mn/Sr ratios are below 0.18. Fe concentrations were not measured in the Fiskeler Member. In the Cerithium Limestone and Korsnæb members, Sr concentrations decrease to a mean of 627 ppm, whereas Mn concentrations increase to a mean of 257 ppm. Mn/Sr ratios are thus constrained between 0.23 and 0.56.

All samples examined in this study exhibit a consistent, slightly positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 1.16–1.25, except for the lowermost sample from the Sigerslev Member).

There is then an abrupt negative d53Cr excursion across the transition between the Sigerslev and Højerup members, marked by a decrease from +0.75‰ to +0.05‰ across 120 cm of section (Fig. 7). The bulk of this shift (from +0.50 to +0.05‰) occurs in the lowermost 60 cm of the Højerup Member, above the second incipient hardground (see Fig. 2). Raw d53Cr values then rise to a maximum of +0.38‰ in the overlying 120 cm, before falling again across the K-Pg boundary and into Korsnæb Member (Fig. 7). A coherent decreasing d53Cr trend is apparent from the uppermost Højerup through the Cerithium Limestone and into the lower Korsnæb members, suggesting that no abrupt isotopic shift occurred across the K-Pg boundary, although high detrital content (see below) precluded analysis of the Fiskeler Member that immediately marks the boundary. In the Korsnæb Member, raw d53Cr values are as low as 0.16‰, which is within the range of crustal rocks (i.e., ‘unfractionated’ beyond crustal values). Cr concentrations range from 0.13 to 2.12 ppm, which is within the range observed in other ancient carbonate successions (Frei et al., 2011; Gilleaudeau et al., 2016; D’Arcy et al., 2017). Stratigraphic trends in Cr concentration loosely mirror Cr-isotopic trends, such that there is a positive correlation between [Cr] and raw d53Cr values (r = 0.70) in the Stevns Klint outcrop composite section (Fig. 8). Interestingly, there is also a negative correlation between Mn concentrations and raw d53Cr values (r = 0.61).\nWe also measured a subset of Cr concentrations and isotopes in outcrop samples from Mandehoved and the Sigerslev Quarry, as well as two cores drilled near Boesdal (see Fig. 1 for locations).

    "text": "Chalk from the Sigerslev and Højerup members is exceptionally pure, with carbonate content exceeding 90% in almost all samples (Fig. 5). Carbonate content is substantially lower in the Fiskeler Member, however, suggesting that the Cr-isotope signature would likely be compromised by detrital contamination. Thus, we did not measure Crisotopes or [Al] in the Fiskeler Member. Carbonate content increases again in the overlying Cerithium Limestone and Korsnæb members, however, and most samples contain > 85% CaCO3, although carbonate content is generally more variable than in the Maastrichtian chalk units below (Fig. 5). Generally high carbonate content suggests that detrital contamination should be minimal in our samples. Nevertheless, we estimated the percentage of detrital Cr in each sample from the main Stevns Klint outcrop composite section using Al concentrations and performed a detrital correction as described in Section 3.2.3. Samples from the alternate sections (Mandehoved outcrop, Sigerslev Quarry, and Boesdal cores) were meant only as a first-order check of raw Cr-isotope reproducibility (see Section 5.4.1), and thus were not corrected for detrital Cr contribution.\nIn the Stevns Klint composite section, the mean Al concentration in the Sigerslev and Højerup members is 102 ppm, and increases slightly in the Cerithium Limestone and Korsnæb members to 115 ppm. Results of our detrital correction indicate that detrital Cr makes up < 10% of total analyzed Cr in the Sigerslev Member (Fig. 9). Detrital Cr contribution increases slightly in the Højerup Member, but remains below 20% (excepting one sample), such that the sharp Cr-isotope excursion observed across the Sigerslev-Højerup transition (+0.75‰ to +0.05‰) cannot be explained by differing degrees of detrital contribution. At low levels of detrital Cr such as this, the authigenic d53Cr correction produces values no more than 0.09‰ different than raw d53Cr values. The percentage of detrital Cr is similarly low in the Cerithium Limestone Member (<12%), and authigenic d53Cr corrections are minimal. Detrital contamination is an issue, however, in some samples from the overlying Korsnæb Member. In samples with more than 25% detrital Cr contribution, raw d53Cr values are indistinguishable from average crust (Fig. 9).

These sediments are only weakly lithified and do not contain typical nonmarine cements. Trace elements suggest retention of marine geochemical signatures with elevated Sr (>700 ppm) and relatively depleted Mn and Fe concentrations (<250 and <110 ppm, respectively) typical of marine calcite, although the Højerup Member is slightly depleted in Sr relative to the Sigerslev Member (Fig. 6B). There is no co-variation between d13C and d18O values (often observed if both systems have experienced some degree of isotopic resetting related to proportional mixing with an external fluid; e.g.,\nG .J.

There is also no co-variation between 87Sr/86Sr or d53Cr and d18O values, indicating that mixing with diagenetic fluids has not systematically altered these isotopic systems (Fig. 6C and D). This suggests a generally high degree of geochemical preservation.\nThe overlying Fiskeler Member contains the highest Sr concentrations measured in the section (1106–2284 ppm), although samples with the highest Sr content also have the lowest carbonate content, which may indicate that some Sr in the Fiskeler Member is sourced from the detrital fraction. Mn concentrations are below 200 ppm (Fig. 6B) and Mn/Sr ratios are below 0.2, consistent with a marine trace element signature. There is a higher degree of oxygen isotope scatter in the Fiskeler Member than in the other units examined in this study (>0.6‰ on the centimeter scale), which may indicate a degree of isotopic resetting, consistent with evidence for carbonate dissolution at this specific stratigraphic horizon (Hart et al., 2004, 2005). The positive d18O excursion observed in the Fiskeler Member (Fig. 5) has been observed in other sections across the K-Pg boundary (Zachos and Arthur, 1986), however, suggesting that it\nis of primary origin. Regardless, there is no co-variation between d18O and d13C values, suggesting that carbon isotopes are well-preserved.\nThe Cerithium Limestone and Korsnæb members are strongly lithified and have distinctly lower Sr contents and higher Mn contents than the Fiskeler Member and the underlying Maastrichtian units (Fig. 6B). In the Danian mound complexes, lithification was synsedimentary (e.g., Willumsen, 1995), however, and the Korsnæb Member contains no petrographic evidence for fabric-destructive recrystallization or pervasive non-marine cementation (Fig. 4C). Fe concentrations are relatively low (<250 ppm) and Sr concentrations > 500 ppm still indicate a marine origin for trace element signatures, despite their distinct nature compared to the weakly lithified chalk below. After the positive d18O excursion observed immediately above the K-Pg boundary (partially recorded in the Cerithium Limestone Member), oxygen isotopes return to values similar to the well-preserved Sigerslev and Højerup members (Fig. 5). There is no co-variation between carbon and oxygen isotopes (Fig. 6A), and there is also no co-variation between 87Sr/86Sr or d53Cr and d18O values (Fig. 6C and D), indicating a lack of systematic alteration.\nAlthough we prefer not to use absolute geochemical cutoff values for diagenetic screening that are often arbitrary,\n322 G.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332\nnearly all of the samples examined in this study pass the stringent criteria for whole rock Sr-isotope preservation proposed by Denison et al. (1994) ([Mn] < 300 ppm, [Fe] < 3000 ppm, Mn/Sr < 0.5). Throughout the measured section, Cr-isotope variation also does not correspond to differences in bulk lithology that may have influenced differential pathways of diagenesis. For example, a coherent stratigraphic trend in d53Cr is observed across the upper Højerup, Cerithium Limestone, and Korsnæb members, despite distinct lithological differences between these units\n(Fig. 10). Taken together, our data indicate that late Maastrichtian to early Danian strata of the Stevns Peninsula have the potential to record primary changes in oceanographic conditions across the K-Pg transition."

The magnitude of this excursion varies globally, but exceeds 1.5‰ in deep sea cores from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Southern oceans (e.g., Alegret et al., 2012). Sharply decreasing bulk d13C values have commonly been attributed to a drastic decrease in export productivity associated with the K-Pg extinction event (Zachos and Arthur, 1986; Arthur and Zachos, 1987; Zachos et al., 1989; D’Hondt et al., 1998). This hypothesis is bolstered by evidence for an apparent collapse of the surface to deep ocean d13C gradient as recorded by isotopic differences between planktonic and benthic foraminifera (D’Hondt et al., 1998; see Alegret et al., 2012 for an alterative explanation). In many basins, d13C values of planktonic foraminifera mirror bulk and fine fraction sediments, while the carbon isotope composition of benthic foraminifera increases until the values converge (Zachos et al., 1989).\nOn the Stevns Peninsula, detailed carbon isotope profiles were presented by Romein and Smit (1981), Kaminski and Malmgren (1989), Schmitz et al. (1992), Hart et al. (2004; 2005), and Sial et al. (2016). Contrary to global trends, early studies reported little to no carbon isotope perturbation in bulk sediments across the K-Pg boundary near the Højerup Old Church (Kaminski and Malmgren, 1989; Schmitz et al., 1992). Subsequent studies reported a brief negative d13C excursion in the Fiskeler Member through only a few data points at Højerup, as well as a brief interval of carbon isotope instability in the lower Fiskeler Member at Kulstirenden (Hart et al., 2004, 2005). In both cases, the magnitude of the excursion was 0.5‰.\nIn our section collected near the Højerup Old Church and at Kulstirenden, we present d13C data at much higher resolution through the Fiskeler Member. The only indication of a negative d13C excursion in our data is a subtle decreasing trend ( 0.3‰) in the uppermost Højerup Member before the K-Pg event, and a single data point at the base of the Fiskeler Member (base of the ‘red layer’) that records a d13C value down to 0.28‰ (Fig. 5). The significance of this data point is dubious, however, because of the extremely low carbonate content (1% CaCO3) of this sample, combined with the generally organic-rich nature of the Fiskeler Member at Kulstirenden (>1% total organic carbon; Sepulveda et al., 2009). In this situation, carbonate carbon isotopes are easily contaminated by small amounts of organic carbon during acidification. d13C values then increase abruptly to +1.89‰, before returning to values near +1.6‰ over less than 5 cm of section. In sum, our data confirm and expand on previously reported results from Stevns Klint—there is little carbon isotope perturbation in bulk sediments across the K-Pg boundary, excepting a five centimeter interval at the base of the Fiskeler Member.\nThe trends observed at Stevns Klint are in stark contrast to many K-Pg boundary sections worldwide, wherein a negative d13C excursion of > 1.5‰ persists in bulk sediments over > 100,000 years (e.g., Alegret et al., 2012). These differences are likely not due to condensation because the P0 and Pa foraminifer biozones are well recorded in the expanded Fiskeler Member at Stevns Klint (Rasmussen et al., 2005). One alternative possibility is that significant carbonate dissolution in the Fiskeler Member may have erased broad d13C trends recorded in bulk sediments. This scenario seems likely because, in contrast to bulk sediments, a more\n324 G.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332\nprominent negative d13C excursion is recorded in solutionresistant benthic foraminifera through the Fiskeler Member (Schmitz et al., 1992; Hart et al., 2005). The magnitude of the excursion is still lower than is recorded in other K-Pg boundary sections worldwide, however (e.g., Alegret et al., 2012). This potentially suggests—in addition to issues related to dissolution—that there was a degree of restriction between the Danish Basin and the open ocean, such that the d13C signature recorded at Stevns Klint may not be reflective of global trends in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC).\nThere has also been significant attention paid in the literature to oxygen isotope trends as a proxy for climate change across the K-Pg boundary. Despite discrete predictions for the response of the climate system to the bolide impact event, oxygen isotope records are largely equivocal and suggest a heterogeneous climate response across the globe. Under a bolide impact scenario, an immediate decades-long cooling trend would be expected (‘impact winter’) followed by a period of intense greenhouse warming (e.g., Pope et al., 1994). This ‘impact winter’ phase has been identified in multiple sections using TEX86 organic paleothermometry (Vellekoop et al., 2014, 2016). Short-term cooling followed by pronounced warming is also recorded in organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst assemblages across the K-Pg boundary (Brinkhuis et al., 1998). Compared to these records, the oxygen isotope record of carbonate sediments is less definitive. Smit (1990) identified a negative\nd18O shift of up to 2‰ across the K-Pg boundary in the Agost and Caravaca sections of Spain. This was interpreted as an 8 C rise in sea surface temperatures, likely following the ‘impact winter’ that was too short to be recorded in these sections. Keller and Lindinger (1989) reported a similar d18O trend in fine fraction sediments from the classic El Kef, Tunisia locality—again, potentially indicative of a warming trend, although diagenetic and compositional effects could not be ruled out. By contrast, Zachos and Arthur (1986) presented oxygen isotope data from numerous deep sea drilling sites that showed little to no climatic response to the K-Pg event. Some sections (such as several from the North and South Atlantic) even recorded a slight positive d18O excursion ( 0.5‰), potentially indicative of a 2–3 C cooling trend.\nIn our data from Stevns Klint, there is a prominent positive d18O excursion ( 1‰) recorded immediately above the K-Pg boundary in the Fiskeler and lower Cerithium Limestone members (Fig. 5). These data are in broad agreement with earlier oxygen isotope profiles published from Stevns Klint that show a similar positive d18O trend recorded in bulk and fine fraction sediments, as well as in benthic foraminifera (Schmitz et al., 1992; Hart et al., 2004, 2005). In our data, d18O values are also unstable through the Fiskeler Member, varying by up to 1‰ on the centimeter scale. At first glance, these data indicate pronounced cooling and climatic instability in the Danish Basin immediately following\nG.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332 325\nthe K-Pg event. There are several reasons, however, that the d18O record of bulk sediments may not be a pristine record of climatic fluctuations. For example, bulk sediment composition is markedly different between the Fiskeler Member and the underlying chalk units. Grey chalk of the Højerup Member is dominated by coccolith debris formed in planktonic settings, whereas benthically-formed carbonate (such as solution-resistant benthic foraminifera) becomes increasingly abundant in the Fiskeler Member. This shift from planktonic to benthic carbonate would be expected to produce a positive d18O shift in bulk sediments that may be unrelated to climate change (Schmitz et al., 1992). A positive oxygen isotope excursion is also observed, however, specifically in the record of benthic foraminifera, indicating that bottom-water temperatures did decrease (by up to 3 C) in the Danish Basin following the K-Pg event (Schmitz et al., 1992; Hart et al., 2005). Therefore, the prominent positive excursion in bulk carbonate d18O recorded mostly in the Fiskeler Member and the lower half of the Cerithium Limestone Member may record a primary cooling event linked to the ‘impact winter’ scenario. Its total amplitude, however, is potentially enhanced by the shift in carbonate bearers from predominantly planktonic to benthic forms.\nRegardless of variability in bulk sediment composition, it is important to note that there is no record in the Danish Basin of the greenhouse warming period predicted to follow the bolide impact and its initial ‘impact winter’ (Pope et al., 1994; Brinkhuis et al., 1998). This is supported by a return of bulk carbonate d18O values in the Korsnæb Member to a range that is similar to the Maastrichtian chalk below (Fig. 5). In this way, oxygen isotope trends from Stevns Klint are markedly different from the classic K-Pg boundary sections of Agost, Spain and El Kef, Tunisia (Keller and Lindinger, 1989; Smit, 1990). In summary, although Stevns Klint is considered a classic locality for cataloging environmental change across the K-Pg boundary, both carbon and oxygen isotope profiles reveal trends that are notably different from global norms."

There is then a sharp increase in 87Sr/86Sr values recorded worldwide coincident with the K-Pg boundary event (Macdougall, 1988; Martin and Macdougall, 1991; Vonhof and Smit, 1997; Frei and Frei, 2002). Deep sea drilling sites from both the Atlantic and Pacific record values as high as 0.70790 (Martin and Macdougall, 1991). Most studies link this global Srisotope spike to an intense period of continental weathering driven by globally distributed acid rain following the bolide impact event (Macdougall, 1988; Martin and Macdougall, 1991; Vonhof and Smit, 1997), although emplacement of the Deccan Traps and associated weathering of fresh\nvolcanic rocks has also been implicated (Dessert et al., 2001). Sr-isotopes then quickly return to values similar to the latest Maastrichtian Stage, although it is unclear what mechanism could drive such a sudden return to preexcursion values (as opposed to the gradual dilution of radiogenic Sr that would be expected). The return to preexcursion values is then followed by a gradual decrease through the Danian Stage to values near 0.70780 (Martin and Macdougall, 1991). Outside of the major perturbation to the global Sr-cycle recorded across the K-Pg boundary, long-term trends in 87Sr/86Sr values through the Mesozoic and early Cenozoic Eras have been attributed to changes in the hydrothermal Sr flux related to mid-ocean ridge crustal generation rates (Jones et al., 1994).\nContrary to the contrasting results from carbon and oxygen isotopes, our 87Sr/86Sr data from Stevns Klint matches well with global trends (Fig. 5). There is a gradual increase in 87Sr/86Sr through the Sigerslev and Højerup members up to values near 0.70790. No samples were measured from the Fiskeler Member, but the overlying Cerithium Limestone Member records the sharp spike in Srisotope values (up to 0.70812) associated with the K-Pg boundary. Frei and Frei (2002) measured 87Sr/86Sr values in the Fiskeler Member and similarly saw evidence for this positive Sr-isotope excursion. There is then a return to preexcursion values and a slight decreasing 87Sr/86Sr trend in the lowermost Korsnæb Member. This study is the first to present Sr-isotope data from Stevns Klint outside of the Fiskeler Member (see Frei and Frei, 2002), and our data indicate that global perturbation to the Sr-cycle associated with the K-Pg boundary event is well recorded in sediments of the Danish Basin."

    "text": "In our main Stevns Klint outcrop composite section, distinct stratigraphic Cr-isotope trends are apparent that are seemingly unrelated to diagenesis or detrital contamination. To summarize, d53Cr values are strongly positive in the Sigerslev Member (up to +0.78‰), followed by an abrupt negative excursion down to +0.05‰ across the lowermost 60 cm of the Højerup Member. Cr-isotope values then rise to a maximum of +0.38‰ in the overlying 120 cm, before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary and into the Korsnæb Member. d53Cr values are similar to crustal values in the lowermost Korsnæb Member, followed by a slight increase to +0.16‰ at the top of the section.\nBecause of the novelty of the Cr-isotope proxy—including our incomplete understanding of diagenesis and lateral reproducibility—we investigated whether these stratigraphic trends could be reproduced in other sections across the Stevns Peninsula. We focused on several specific stratigraphic horizons, including the Sigerslev-Højerup transition and K-Pg boundary. Outcrop samples were collected from the coastal cliff at Mandehoved and from the Sigerslev Quarry, and core samples were collected from two cores drilled near Boesdal (Fig. 1). In general, we observe a coherent, reproducible trend between the Højerup Old Church section and the four alternate sections along the\n326 G.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332\nStevns Peninsula, giving us confidence in the local reproducibility of the Cr-isotope signal (Fig. 7). In the alternate sections, d53Cr values are strongly positive in the upper Sigerslev Member and just above the Sigerslev-Højerup contact. These values are in good agreement with the Højerup Old Church section. Above this, there is a gap in data until just below the K-Pg boundary, such that agreement between sections cannot be assessed in the middle Højerup Member. d53Cr values then fall steadily across the K-Pg boundary and into the lowermost Korsnæb Member—a trend that closely mirrors the Højerup Old Church section (Fig. 7).\nIn addition to visual assessment, we computed two common quantitative measures to assess the agreement between the Højerup Old Church and alternate sections using data from the stratigraphic interval where the sections overlap (550 cm below to 85 cm above the K-Pg boundary). To best match the stratigraphic position of samples between sections, we excluded two data points from the Højerup Old Church section that did not overlap with any samples from the alternate sections (samples HM600 and HM780). The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.522 (p = 0.038) and the Spearman rank correlation was 0.547 (p = 0.028). Both of these measures indicate statistically significant agreement between sections with regard to stratigraphic Cr-isotope trends. These results give us confidence that the Crisotope signal can effectively be used as a regional paleoceanographic proxy."

    "heading": "5.4.2. Explaining the Cr-isotope trends: the Maastrichtian Stage",
    "text": "The most striking feature of the Maastrichtian Crisotope trend is the sharp negative excursion associated with the Sigerslev-Højerup facies transition. There is an increase in abundance of benthic fossils across this transition; however, the dominant carbonate fraction (>90%) remains fine-grained nannofossil debris. This suggests that a change in carbonate sediment type—and thus the fractionation factor associated with carbonate formation—cannot explain this excursion. Here, we assess several alternative hypotheses that could explain a sharp excursion towards ‘unfractionated’ Cr-isotope values.\nHolmden et al. (2016) observed a sharp shift towards ‘unfractionated’ Cr-isotope values in a pelagic carbonate succession deposited across Cretaceous Ocean Anoxic Event (OAE) 2 in the Western Interior Seaway, North America. This excursion was associated with increased Cr concentrations, a shift to mantle-like seawater 187Os/188Os values, and anomalous enrichment of trace metals with basaltic affinity (notably cobalt and copper). The authors attributed these shifts to Large Igneous Province (LIP) emplacement and associated submarine volcanism, which introduced a vast reservoir of ‘unfractionated’ hydrothermal Cr to the ocean system. It has previously been proposed that Cretaceous OAEs, as well as associated Os-isotope trends, were caused by massive LIP-related volcanism (e.g., Kuroda et al., 2007; Du Vivier et al., 2014). Under this scenario, a plume of ‘unfractionated’ hydrothermal Cr(III)—potentially later oxidized to Cr(VI)—encroached on shallow water environments,\nwhereby it overwhelmed the typical seawater Cr-isotope signal, thus imparting ‘unfractionated’ d53Cr values on shallow marine carbonates. Holmden et al. (2016) estimated that >90% of authigenic Cr in their samples was sourced hydrothermally during the OAE 2 interval. It is important to note that Wang et al. (2016b) offered a markedly different interpretation of Cr-isotope trends across OAE 2. In their scenario, the negative d53Cr excursion is explained by an increase in the ratio of euxinic to non-euxinic, reducing conditions (see further exploration of this hypothesis below). Regardless of which hypothesis is correct for OAE 2, we explore the potential for the hydrothermal scenario (Holmden et al., 2016) to explain Cr-isotope trends in the Maastrichtian Stage at Stevns Klint.\nIf the sharp negative d53Cr excursion observed across the Sigerslev-Højerup transition were caused by sudden input of ‘unfractionated’ hydrothermal Cr to the Danish Basin, we would expect to see a corresponding shift in other geochemical indicators sensitive to changes in hydrothermal input. In our dataset, we can first look to the Srisotope record to test this hypothesis. Specifically, we would expect a shift towards less radiogenic Sr-isotope values (lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios) if the hydrothermal hypothesis were correct. To the contrary, however, 87Sr/86Sr ratios increase gradually through the Sigerslev and Højerup members from a minimum of 0.70786 to a maximum of 0.70793 (Fig. 10) (see Section 5.3.). There is no sharp change associated with the Cr-isotope excursion, suggesting that Maastrichtian d53Cr trends were not controlled by changes in hydrothermal input. However, due to the relatively long residence time of Sr ( 3 million years in the modern oceans) compared to the amount of time represented by our succession (<1 million years), we also used the Eu anomaly as an additional check on shorter-term hydrothermal input to the basin. If the hydrothermal hypothesis were correct, we would expect a shift towards strongly positive Eu anomalies associated with the negative Cr-isotope excursion (e.g., Olivarez and Owen, 1991; Garcia et al., 2016). Instead, we find that Eu/Eu* values are remarkably consistent through the entire studied section (Fig. 10). These lines of geochemical evidence—combined with the position of the epeiric Chalk Sea away from active hydrothermal systems—allow us to reject the hydrothermal Cr hypothesis for explaining Cr-isotope trends in our data.\nA second hypothesis we will consider for explaining Maastrichtian Cr-isotope trends is a change in basin redox conditions. Cr-reduction in surface waters and the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) drives modern seawater towards heavier d53Cr values (Scheiderich et al., 2015; Paulukat et al., 2016). Similarly, expanded ocean anoxia would be expected to increase the degree of partial reduction of soluble Cr(VI) to particle-reactive Cr(III)—thus drawing down the Cr(VI) inventory of seawater and driving seawater Cr(VI) towards a heavier isotopic composition (Gueguen et al., 2016; D’Arcy et al., 2017; also what Holmden et al., 2016 expected to see across OAE 2). As an example, D’Arcy et al. (2017) observed a positive Crisotope excursion and a drop in Cr concentrations across an Early Ordovician carbonate succession in Argentina. They attributed this pattern to local expansion of anoxic\nG.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332 327\nwaters, resulting in increased reductive drawdown of dissolved Cr(VI). This interpretation is consistent with other proxy records that indicate fluctuating degrees of anoxia in the Early Ordovician oceans (e.g., Thompson and Kah, 2012).\nApplying this scenario to our Maastrichtian data would suggest that strongly positive d53Cr values in the Sigerslev interval would reflect expanded anoxia, whereas the sharp shift to lower d53Cr values in the lower Højerup interval would represent rapid contraction of anoxic water masses. In an alternate scenario, Wang et al. (2016b) proposed that a negative shift in seawater d53Cr values could be caused by expanded euxinia because Cr (VI) is expected to be quantitatively reduced in euxinic settings, compared to only partial reduction under noneuxinic, reducing conditions. Both of these scenarios implicate changing basin redox conditions as a driver of Cr-isotope variability.\nHere, we use the Ce anomaly to assess the potential for redox changes in the Maastrichtian Chalk Sea that may have influenced preserved Cr-isotope trends. Specifically, if the sharp d53Cr excursion observed across the SigerslevHøjerup transition were caused by a change in basin redox conditions, we would expect a corresponding change in the Ce/Ce* signature of these sediments. Instead, we see no change in Ce/Ce* values through the distinct Maastrichtian chalk units (Fig. 10). All samples have a pronounced, negative Ce anomaly similar to modern well-oxygenated seawater, with Ce/Ce* values tightly constrained between 0.43 and 0.47. These data are consistent with continuous bioturbation in the studied section. In summary, our data indicate no first-order redox changes across the SigerslevHøjerup transition that could have influenced Cr-cycling in the Danish Basin. We therefore reject the hypothesis of direct redox control on Cr-isotope trends in our Maastrichtian data.\nLastly, we consider a hypothesis whereby the mixing of water masses with distinct Cr-isotope signatures could have controlled Cr-isotope trends through the Maastrichtian Stage. Scheiderich et al. (2015) and Paulukat et al. (2016) showed that modern seawater is heterogeneous with respect to its Cr-isotope composition, despite the long residence time of Cr compared to the ocean mixing time. In the open ocean, surface waters are subjected to varying degrees of reductive Cr removal, which is the major driver of Crisotope trends. In some productive regions—such as Arctic regions influenced by Pacific summer water, and surface waters from the Oregon coast and English Channel— d53Cr values are > 1.4‰ (Bonnand et al., 2013; Scheiderich et al., 2015). By contrast, low productivity (high nutrient/low chlorophyll) regions are generally characterized by lower d53Cr values, with examples including the northeast Atlantic and the central gyre in the Argentine Basin. Deep waters were initially hypothesized to be more uniform (Bonnand et al., 2013), but Scheiderich et al. (2015) also showed a degree of heterogeneity, with a > 0.6‰ difference between deep waters of the North and South Atlantic. The Cr-isotopic composition of the deep oceans is driven at least in part by the degree of Cr(III) re-oxidation.\nIn the semi-isolated Beaufort Sea (Arctic North America), consistently limited biological productivity means that Cr-isotope heterogeneity is likely not driven by in situ Crreduction. Instead, a strong correlation between salinity and the concentration and isotopic composition of Cr suggests mixing of distinct water masses whose Cr-isotope compositions have been established by past fractionation processes (Scheiderich et al., 2015). Namely, Cr-isotope trends in the Beaufort Sea appear to be the result of mixing between more saline, Cr-rich Atlantic water and less saline, Cr-poor Pacific summer water.\nAnalogous to this situation, we propose that temporal Cr-isotope trends in the Danish Basin were controlled by the mixing of water masses with distinct Cr-isotope compositions. This hypothesis is supported by the association of the Sigerslev-Højerup Cr-isotope excursion with sedimentological evidence for a distinct facies transition, oceanographic change, and a shift in bottom current flow regimes in the Chalk Sea. As described earlier (Section 2), the upper Sigerslev Member consists of evenly-bedded, white coccolith chalk mudstone intercalated with faint sub-parallel flint bands. These features suggest that the seafloor was subject to very little current activity during deposition (Anderskouv et al., 2007). The Sigerslev-Højerup transition subsequently marks a significant facies change, above which the Højerup Member consists of grey wackestone lowamplitude mounds containing benthic fossils in a coccolith mud matrix intercalated with wavy, meter-high, asymmetrical flint bands (see Surlyk et al., 2006; Anderskouv et al., 2007). The mound structures (approximately 1 meter high and 25–30 m across) and flint bands are thought to mimic an uneven seafloor topography and their geometry suggests the development of pervasive bottom currents across the Sigerslev-Højerup transition (Lykke-Andersen and Surlyk, 2004; Anderskouv et al., 2007).\nWe suggest that this facies change marks an oceanographic mixing event, which is subsequently recorded in our Cr-isotope data. Support for this hypothesis comes from several characteristics of the Kjølby Gaard Marl, which is a prominent uppermost Maastrichtian marl layer observed in outcrops of Sweden and Northern Jutland— as well as in many boreholes of the Danish Basin and North Sea—which corresponds to the Sigerslev-Højerup transition according to Surlyk et al. (2013). This deposit has been associated with a transient warming event and, possibly, northern migration of Tethyan fauna and flora (Troelsen, 1955; Sheldon et al., 2010). A Tethyan current flow in the Danish Basin could thus be responsible for the Cr-isotope excursion observed across the Sigerslev-Højerup transition. Additionally, Wang et al. (2016b) explored the mixing hypothesis to explain their Cr-isotope data for Cretaceous OAE 2, but ultimately rejected it because Cr concentrations and isotopes did not shift in unison as would be expected for a water mass mixing model. By contrast, [Cr] and raw d53Cr values do co-vary in our main Stevns Klint outcrop section (r = 0.70; Fig. 8), potentially supporting the water mass mixing hypothesis to explain stratigraphic trends in our data. Some of this correlation is a detrital mixing effect—when excluding the five Korsnæb Member samples that are heavily detritally-influenced, the r value drops to\n328 G.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332\n0.62. However, [Cr] and d53Cr do correlate well during intervals of pronounced Cr-isotope change such as the Sigerslev-Højerup transition, thus supporting the water mass mixing model. Interestingly, Mn concentrations also loosely mirror Cr-isotope trends (Fig. 8), and this effect appears to be unrelated to post-depositional alteration (see Section 5.1). We speculate, then, that these water masses were also characterized by distinct trace element signatures imparted by past redox cycling that also influenced Cr-isotope fractionation.\nFurthermore, it is possible that this mixing event was related to the sea level and climate history of the latest Maastrichtian Stage. The Sigerslev-Højerup transition is marked by a pronounced drop in relative sea level and a hiatus in sedimentation. Additionally, the Sigerslev-Højerup transition likely marks an important climatic shift at the end of the Maastrichtian Stage. The latest Maastrichtian Stage is globally characterized by the end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming that took place between approximately 350 kyr and 150–100 kyr before the K-Pg event, and by a global cooling phase in the remaining 100–150 kyr of the Cretaceous Period (Thibault and Husson, 2016; Woelders et al., 2017). In the nearby Stevns-1 core, the last 17 meters of the Sigerslev Member are characterized by a significant decrease in d18O values, accompanied by an increase in the warm-water calcareous nannofossil Watznaueria barnesiae. This interval has thus been interpreted as the endMaastrichtian greenhouse warming (Thibault et al., 2016), likely induced by CO2 degassing from phase 2 of Deccan volcanism (Chenet et al., 2009) and culminating in deposition of the Kjølby Gaard Marl in the Danish Basin. By contrast, the Højerup Member in Stevns-1 is characterized by a significant drop in the relative abundance of Watznaueria barnesiae, suggesting that the Højerup Member is the lithological expression in the Danish Basin of the worldwide cooling event that preceded the K-Pg boundary. If this hypothesis is correct, it is unclear, however, why oxygen isotopes remain unchanged across the Sigerslev-Højerup transition at Stevns Klint.\nUltimately, this study suggests an additional factor that needs to be considered when interpreting Cr-isotope data. It also highlights the potential use of Cr-isotopes as oceanographic proxy when other factors—such as hydrothermal influence and redox conditions—can be independently assessed."

    "text": "In the upper Højerup Member, d53Crauth values rise to a maximum of +0.45‰, before falling steadily across the KPg boundary and into the Korsnæb Member (Fig. 10). First, it is important to note that direct comparison of Cr-isotope values between Danian limestone and the Maastrichtian chalk below is potentially problematic because of differences in carbonate sediment type that could influence the degree of Cr-isotope fractionation between carbonate and seawater. For example, bryozoans (the primary carbonate component of the Korsnæb Member) may fractionate Cr-isotopes differently than coccolithophores, whose skeletal fragments dominate the Maastrichtian chalk. Thus\nfar, no studies have investigated Cr-isotopes in either bryozoans or coccoliths.\nDespite this potential complication, it is clear that no sharp change in Cr-isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary in our profiles (Fig. 10). Cr concentrations and isotopes have previously been measured in the K-Pg boundary layer at several localities worldwide—including Stevns Klint—in order to determine the nature of the K-Pg impactor (Shukolyukov and Lugmair, 1998; Trinquier et al., 2006; Quitté et al., 2007). Results showed that Cr is substantially enriched in the immediate boundary layer, and 54Cr/52Cr and 53Cr/52Cr ratios revealed that the impactor was likely a carbonaceous chondrite. We focused on carbonates above and below the boundary, however, such that our data do not record these perturbations. Our first sample from above the boundary—the lowermost sample of the Cerithium Limestone Member—contains the highest Cr concentration recorded in the Stevns Klint composite section (2.12 ppm), but its isotopic composition (d53Crauth = +0.24‰) is not anomalous. It seems, then, that the bolide impactor (and any associated delivery of metals) did not substantially perturb the marine Cr-cycle beyond the immediate boundary layer. Instead, there is a coherent decreasing d53Cr trend from the uppermost Højerup through the lower Korsnæb members. This coherent trend is recorded despite the weathering-induced spike in 87Sr/86Sr values (see Section 5.3) that could have influenced the global Cr-cycle. d53Cr trends also do not correspond to basin redox conditions—in fact, Ce/Ce* values are remarkably consistent across the K-Pg boundary and into the Danian Stage (excepting one outlier), suggesting that oxic conditions generally dominated the Danish Basin through the entirety of the studied interval (Fig. 10). We therefore conclude that Cr-cycling in the Chalk Sea was not significantly perturbed by the K-Pg event at the scale resolvable by our data, and instead, continued to be controlled by local oceanographic processes."

    "text": "In this study, we present an extensive new geochemical dataset spanning the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition at Stevns Klint, Denmark. Carbon and oxygen isotopes provide a general framework for the succession, and we further report strontium isotope, trace element, and rare-earth element data. Our focus, however, is on the novel chromium isotope system before and after the K-Pg event. Together, these data help elucidate oceanographic changes in the Danish Chalk Sea across this critical transition in Earth history. Carbon isotopes show only minor perturbation in bulk sediments across the K-Pg boundary, whereas oxygen isotopes record a prominent positive excursion. These trends are in contrast to some classic K-Pg boundary sections worldwide, which could reflect a degree of restriction between the Danish Basin and the open ocean. Strontium isotopes record a spike towards more radiogenic values above the K-Pg boundary, which is consistent with global trends that suggest a short-lived episode of enhanced terrestrial weathering associated with the K-Pg event.\nMaastrichtian to Danian strata of the Danish Basin are also ideal for measuring chromium isotopes because of the\nG.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305–332 329\ngeneral lack of diagenetic alteration and detrital contamination. d53Cr values are strongly positive in the Maastrichtian Sigerslev Member (the ‘White Chalk’), followed by a prominent negative excursion across the SigerslevHøjerup transition. Chromium isotope values then rise through the middle Højerup Member (the ‘Grey Chalk’), before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary. This signal is generally reproducible at several other localities across the Stevns Peninsula. Comparison to stratigraphic trends in strontium isotopes, the europium anomaly, and the redox-sensitive cerium anomaly suggest that chromium isotope trends were not controlled by either hydrothermal input to the basin or prevailing redox conditions. Instead, we propose that temporal chromium isotope trends were controlled by the mixing of water masses with distinct chromium isotope signatures in an isotopically heterogeneous Chalk Sea. This hypothesis is supported by association of the most prominent Maastrichtian chromium isotope excursion with sedimentological evidence for a distinct facies shift, development of seafloor topography, and initiation of bottom currents in the Chalk Sea. The potential mixing event recorded by this excursion could be related to the shift from end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming (associated with Deccan volcanism) to the worldwide cooling phase that immediately preceded the K-Pg boundary. Contrary to expectation, no sharp change in chromium isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary, suggesting that chromium cycling in the Danish Basin was not significantly perturbed by the K-Pg impact event, at least at the scale resolvable by our data. Instead, local oceanographic processes continued to be the prevailing control on chromium isotope trends, providing an example whereby chromium isotopes can be used as an oceanographic proxy in ancient carbonate-dominated depositional systems."

  "abstractText": "Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene time represents a critical transitional period in Earth history. Global events include short-term instability in climate and ocean circulation, large igneous province emplacement, and catastrophic extinction of marine and terrestrial fauna due at least in part to a bolide impact event. The response of the ocean system to Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) global events has been the subject of much research, yet fundamental questions remain regarding carbon cycling, climate, ocean mixing, and redox conditions. To help elucidate paleoceanographic changes across the KPg transition, we revisit the classic Maastrichtian to Danian chalk-limestone succession at Stevns Klint, Denmark with a suite of new geochemical data, including insights from the redox-sensitive chromium isotope system. We use carbon and oxygen isotope trends to form a well-constrained framework for the succession, before presenting strontium isotope, chromium isotope, and rare-earth element data for the units deposited both before and after the K-Pg event. Carbon isotopes show only minor perturbation across the K-Pg boundary and oxygen isotopes record a prominent positive excursion, with both of these trends standing in contrast to many K-Pg boundary sections worldwide. Strontium isotopes record a spike towards more radiogenic values, which is consistent with a globally-observed, short-term weathering pulse. The chromium isotope profile of Maastrichtian chalk begins with strongly positive values followed by a sharp negative excursion associated with a facies shift and initiation of bottom currents in the Chalk Sea. dCr values then recover, before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary and into the Danian limestone. Chromium isotope trends do not correspond to changes in hydrothermal input or basin redox conditions—instead, we propose that mixing of water masses with distinct chromium isotope signatures controlled temporal chromium isotope variability. The local mixing event inferred from our Maastrichtian chromium isotope data could be related to a temporary inflow of Tethyan bottom waters, or the shift from end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming (associated with Deccan volcanism) to the worldwide cooling phase that immediately preceded the K-Pg boundary. No immediate change in chromium isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary, indicating that the bolide impactor did not substantially perturb the marine chromium cycle, at least at the scale resolvable by our data. Instead, chromium isotope trends https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2018.04.028 0016-7037/ 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
