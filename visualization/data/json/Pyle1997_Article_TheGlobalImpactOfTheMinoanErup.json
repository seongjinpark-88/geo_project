Pyle Department of Earth Sciences, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge CB2 3EQ, UK\nKey words Explosive volcanic eruptions 7 Volcano-climate interaction 7 Thera, Greece\nIntroduction\nIn his recent commentary on the global environmental impact of the Minoan eruption of Santorini (or Thera), LaMoreaux (1995) painted a colorful picture of a cataclysmic natural catastrophe. This brief note is intended to correct some of the interpretative excesses and factual inaccuracies in the commentary, and to provide a brief resumé of current scientific understanding of the scale and impact of the Minoan eruption based on the accessible primary, rather than secondary, literature.\nExplosive volcanism on Santorini and the Minoan eruption\nSantorini volcano has experienced at least 12 large-magnitude explosive eruptions during the past 250,000 years (Druitt and others 1989). Of these, the Minoan eruption of ca. 3500 BP is the best known, due in part to the accessibility of the blanket of tephra which still covers the island group of Santorini, and in part to the wider issues raised in the popular literature regarding the relationship between this eruption and biblical, cultural and mythological events. Reconstructions of the physiography of the islands, based on field evidence, indicate that prior to the Minoan eruption Santorini did not take the form of a simple large volcanic cone (Heiken and McCoy 1984; Druitt and Francaviglia 1992). The earlier volcanic history of the island ensured that several times over the preceding 250,000 years the islands were partially dissected by collapse. Immediately prior to the Minoan eruption, the southern part of the present-day caldera took the form of a shallow flooded bay, in the middle of which was a volcanic island group – probably not greatly dissimilar to the present-day Kameni islands – and which connected in the north to the flooded caldera left by the 21 ka eruption (Druitt and Francaviglia 1992). The climactic Minoan eruption was preceded by a short sequence of phreatic ash fall eruptions, lasting no more than a few weeks (Heiken and McCoy 1990). The major phase of the eruption then evolved through four stages, beginning with the eruption of F1 km3 of pumice as fallout from a Plinian eruption column and followed by three stages of pumiceous surge and flow emplacement (Sparks and Wilson 1990). This eruption sequence was essentially continuous, and geologically instantaneous, lasting perhaps a few days at the most (Sparks 1985; Sparks and Wilson 1990). LaMoreaux (1995) confuses the revisions of the date of this single eruption (which was originally placed ca. 1390–1450 BC, but is now placed in the 17th century BC based on 14C dating; e.g. Manning 1988, 1990), with the existence of several distinct eruptions.\n60 Environmental Geology 30 (1/2) March 1997 7 Q Springer-Verlag\nTable 1 Comparative volcanology.

The direct sulphur release from the Minoan eruption was not remarkable, being a factor of two smaller than the sulphur release during the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines (Table 1). Since it is sulphur, rather than tephra, injection to the stratosphere which provides the major mechanism for influencing surface temperatures (e.g. Pollack and others 1976; Rampino and Self 1982), this suggests that the global climatic effects of the Minoan eruption would not have been any more significant than those of the Pinatubo eruption, although the precise hemispheric effects might well have been different. Analysis of the observed cooling patterns following major eruptions of the past 140 years (Robock and Mao 1995) suggests that the first two winters following the Minoan eruption would have been marked by a slight warming in high-latitude parts of North America and Eurasia, and an enhanced cooling of high-latitude continental areas for two or three summers. These conclusions would not be greatly changed even if the sulphur injection from the Minoan eruption were an order of magnitude larger than currently estimated. While empirical observations indicate that as the amount of sulphur release increases, so also does the mean global cooling surface cooling effect (e.g. Palais and Sigurdsson 1989; Sigurdsson 1990), theoretical modelling indicates that chemical and physical feedbacks within the stratosphere ensure that the effects of huge sulphur injections (102–103 Mt SO2 equivalent) would in fact not be significantly more long-lived than the effects due to the Tambora eruption of 1815 – the largest eruption of historical times (e.g. Pinto and others 1989; Bekki and others, 1996).\nComparative volcanology\nIn terms of gross eruptive size, the Minoan eruption of Santorini ranks as a large-magnitude event. The Tambora eruption, on Sumbawa, Indonesia in 1815 was, however, significantly larger (Table 1). Analysis of eruption rates over the past 2000 years (Pyle 1995) indicates that magnitude-6 eruptions, which account for the ejection of 4– 40 km3 of dense magma at a time, typically recur at a rate of F8 per thousand years. Thus, in terms of size alone the Minoan eruption might be out of the ordinary, but was certainly not unique. However, the climatic impact depends not on tephra output, but on sulphur output. In this respect, the Minoan eruption is even less out of the ordinary: high-resolution studies of the sulphuric acid loading of the GISP2 ice core, for example, report 230 significant volcanic sulphate events from the last 9000 years (Zielinski and others 1994). Each of these spikes represents the equivalent of a mid-latitude injection of at least 4–12 Mt of sulphur (as SO2), i.e. of Minoan scale (Zielinski 1995; Pyle and others 1996). Even accounting for the possibility that 30% of these injections might be from minor, high-latitude eruptions, the GISP2 data suggest that Minoan-scale sulphur injections to the stratosphere occur at a rate of F18 per thousand years.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nWhile the scientific community has a duty to disseminate results to the wider world, popularists of science have an even greater responsibility to ensure that their message is not only clear, but based on fact or justifiable inference. The Minoan eruption of Santorini did not constitute a natural catastrophe “unparalleled in all of history”. While it may have caused loss of life, no single body has been found in the only population centre yet known to have been destroyed by the eruption (Akrotiri, Santorini; Doumas 1990). Global impacts of the magnitude reported by LaMoreaux (1995), including damage to trees across the northern hemisphere cannot be unequivocally linked to the Minoan eruption (c.f. Pyle 1989; 1992). Inferences of massive “social, religious, economic, agricultural and po-\nEnvironmental Geology 30 (1/2) March 1997 7 Q Springer-Verlag 61\nlitical impacts” might be permissible, but none of these suggestions has yet stood up to scrutiny: the Minoan civilisation did not collapse, and Crete was not laid waste, as a result of the eruption of Thera (e.g. Renfrew, 1990).\nReferences\nBaillie MGL and Munro MAR (1988) Irish tree rings, Santorini and volcanic dust veils.

However, in terms of scale it ranks smaller in erupted volume and eruptive intensity than the historical eruption of Tambora in 1815 AD, and smaller in sulphur emission and, by inference, climatic effects than both the Tambora and Mt. Pinatubo, 1991, eruptions. Eruption statistics for the past 2000 years indicate that Minoan-size eruptions typically occur at a rate of several per thousand years. Eruptions resulting in a Minoan-scale injection of sulphur to the stratosphere occur far more frequently – at a rate of one or two per century.
