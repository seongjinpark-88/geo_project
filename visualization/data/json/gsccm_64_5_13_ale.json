    "text": "In response to the growing demand for conceptual bundling of land-surface studies (Lin, 2010; Giardino and Houser, 2015), the Earth’s Critical Zone has been defined as a range of terrestrial environments extending from vegetation crown down to deep subsoil aquifers. Although the Earth’s terrestrial vegetation first appeared in the early middle Ordovician, those plants were small, non-vascular, and thalloid. The abundance of vascular plants was extended during the late Silurian early Devonian. These plants were small, non-rooted, or shallow rooted, however, with limited distribution restricted to moist lowland territories which had little effect on their habitats. Plant-substrate interactions intensified significantly with the appearance of deep-\nrooted arborescent vegetation in the middle late Devonian (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998). The expansion of rooted soils that were able to stabilize land surfaces has been recorded through the Devonian (Hillier et al., 2008; Davies and Gibling, 2010). In the Carboniferous, thick-rooted paleosols expanded to fairly dry landscapes (Kabanov et al., 2010; Tabor and Myers, 2015). Most of the major soil types first appeared during the Devonian Carboniferous (Retallack, 2001). Studies of preQuaternary (especially Paleozoic) palaeosols in the context of CZ science are in their infancy (Nordt et al., 2012; Nordt and Driese, 2014). Case studies of Devonian CZs are important, therefore, as they record transformation from Precambrian Lower Paleozoic ‘proto-CZs’ with insufficient protosoil cover to those\n* E-mail address of corresponding author: alekseeva@issp.serpukhov.su DOI: 10.1346/CCMN.2016.064044\nThis paper is published as part of a special section on the subject of ‘Clays in the Critical Zone,’ arising out of presentations made during the 2015 Clay Minerals Society-Euroclay Conference held in Edinburgh, UK.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ccm/article-pdf/64/5/677/3269794/gsccm_64_5_13_ale.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nwith a true-rooted pedosphere. The true-rooted pedosphere stabilized the ground, allowing more time for substrate disintegration and weathering (including chemical weathering by means of the production of root exudates and generation of excess soil pCO2 via oxidation of organic matter) (Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; Amundson et al., 2007; Chorover et al., 2007; Zavarzin, 2008; Davies and Gibling, 2010; Giardino and Houser, 2015).\nRecords of Devonian paleosols from Russia are rare (e.g. Shumilov and Mingalev, 2009; Shumilov, 2010, 2013). The present study describes middle late Devonian pedocomplexes from the eastern flank of the Voronezh crystalline massif by adding more detailed information to existing preliminary notes on sedimentary disconformities, fossil plant, and spore associations from this thin sedimentary succession of Givetian Frasnian age (Rodionova et al., 1995; Raskatova, 1990, 2004)."

    "text": "The late Givetian Lower Frasnian paleosols are found in the Shkurlat granite quarry near the town of Pavlovsk (50º23’N, 40º13’E) (WGS84) (Figure 1a,b). Geologically, the area occurs on the eastern slope of the Voronezh Massif, one of major highs in the Precambrian crystalline basement of the East European Craton separating the Moscow and Donets basins (Nikishin et al., 1996). Throughout most of the Phanerozoic, the Voronezh Massif remained uplifted as indicated by siliciclastics in surrounding basins (e.g. Kabanov et al., 2014; Alekseev et al., 2015). Paleozoic lithostratigraphic units in the central part of the Massif tend to pinch out and bear shallow-water and weathering features indicating protracted periods of subaerial exposure. Based on paleobiogeographic reconstructions, the Voronezh Massif, including its flanks, remained largely uplifted during the Devonian and was connected to the Old Red Sandstone paleo-continent to the west (Lebedev et al., 2010).\nThe Devonian strata are 7 20 m thick in the Shkurlat Quarry, filling lows in the deeply weathered (lateritized) top of the Proterozoic granite. The base of the Devonian section is composed of marine shales, siltstones, and very fine-grained sandstones bearing horizons of carbonate nodules. This basal unit, correlated to the Starooskolian Regional Substage of the Givetian Stage, contains sporadic marine fauna of brachiopods, rugose corals, gorefish fragments, small bioherms, and a horizon of large (5 7 cm) oncoids. The Starooskolian marine deposits contain 40 16% of clay, mostly kaolinite. Siderite is present in the rock matrix in amounts of 4 5%. Carbonate concretions and stromatolitic nodules are also dominated by siderite. The upper part of the marine shales has been eroded intensively.\nThe upper 3.0 6.0 m of the Devonian section is nonmarine and is correlated with the Starooskolian\n(Give t ian) and Yas t rebovka (ear ly Frasn ian) Formations (Raskatova, 1990, 2004); it consists of the claystone unit (1.5 2.5 m) and the upper volcaniclastic sandstone unit (Figure 2). The Devonian is overlapped by the Cretaceous, Pleistocene, and Holocene sediments with a total thickness of 35 m.\nThe paleosols studied belong to the Starooskolian/ Yastrebovka Formations. Samples were collected during the summer field seasons in the period 2010 2015 from different locations above a channel-like lenticular body. The paleo-channel is 500 m across from its center to the left margin and reached a thickness of 15 m in the center. It is filled with several stacked units of Yastrebovka Formation volcaniclastic sediments containing abundant plant debris including stem fragments and stumps. Plant fragments are coalified and pyritized, but retain significant tissue structure. The cross sections of the channel and sampling-site locations are depicted in Figure 2.\nMETHODS\nThe granulometric composition of carbonate-free samples, organic carbon (OC), and carbonate contents were measured by standard soil-science procedures (van Reeuwijk, 2002). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a ThermoFisher Nicolet 6700 spectrometer and employing the KBr pellet technique (1 mg of sample and 199 mg of KBr). Magnetic susceptibility (MS) was measured using a KLY-2 Kappabridge device (Advanced Geoscience Instruments Co., Brno, Czech Republic). Three measurements were taken for each sample. Each was weighed with a precision of 0.01 g, using normalized data on mass-specific MS (w) expressed as 610 8 m3 kg 1."

The measurements were performed using an autosampler and heated sample tray for reaction vials connected to the IRMS using continuous-flow mode. Isotopic compositions were measured against internal standards and are reported in the standard d notation as per mil (%) deviation from V-PDB (Vienna-Pee Dee Belemnite). The values obtained after different contact time with phosphoric acid show some difference in terms of d13C depletion with time. For the discussion below, the mean values obtained after the 4th and 10th days of contact were used. The standard deviation of replicate measurements of standards was 0.1%."

The tuffaceous facies contains pebble- to cobble-sized, nodule-like features decomposed largely into soft limonitic mass and interpreted as lapilli (2 60 mm) and bombs (up to 25 cm). The presence of these features indicates a proximal eruption source\nprobably of kimberlite type (Shevyrev et al., 2004; Zolotareva, 2009). Nine samples of tuffaceous rocks were collected from this formation across the quarry. The most abundant minerals in the samples studied are quartz, kaolinite, and feldspars. The amounts present of the main chemical elements studied varied significantly: 4 1 . 0 9 72 . 46% S iO2 ; 10 . 43 26 . 87% Al 2O3 ; 3.14 27.59% Fe2O3; 1.49 14.86% TiO2; 0.41 4.44% MgO; 0.10 2.42% K2O; 0.14 1.28% CaO; 0.45 2.88% Na2O; 0.08 0.39 P2O5; 0.07 0.29% S; 0.01 0.09% MnO; 0.01 0.12% V; 0.01 0.13% Cr, and the sum of the above elements ranged from 96 to 99%.\nThe non-marine Starooskolian and Yastrebovka deposits contain up to four stacked paleosols. Depending on their location in the paleo-relief, they are attributed to three pedocomplexes abbreviated as P-I (channel-bank slope), P-II (bank top), and P-III (channel bottom) (Figure 2).\nPedocomplex I\nDescription. Pedocomplex I (P-I in Figure 2), developed on the slope of the paleo-channel, consists of four paleosols. The pedocomplex is 6 m thick in total. The lowermost paleosol (PS1) in the formation base developed on Starooskolian shales; other paleosols developed from Yastrebovka volcanigenic-sedimentary deposits. The paleosol profiles have different thicknesses (Figure 3a). The composite profile of PS1 and PS2 is 1.5 m. The thinnest paleosol, PS3, is 60 cm thick and is covered with a layer of coalified plant litter and stands out because of the presence of spectacular pipe-like limonitic-sideritic rhizocretions which are 1 cm in diameter and up to 15 cm in t raced length (Figure 3b,c). In better preserved rhizocretions, root parenchyma and bark have been replaced by siderite, and the central canal remains either empty or is filled with a siderite, goethite, or pyrite. PS3 is overlain by thick (up to 2 m), hard argillite (bed 8 in Figure 3a). This layer has no pedogenic features and contains Planolites bioturbation features and rare marine fauna associated with the estuarian sediments deposited during the short catastrophic flooding of the territory. The PS4 located above the argillite layer (beds 9 11 in Figure 2) is automorphic (formed in situ) and oxidized intensively.\nPaleosols of P-I exhibit accumulations of organic matter and carbonate and redistribution of clay and chemical elements (Figure 4). The lowest pedogenic horizons of each individual paleosol profile are red stained to various degrees (Figure 3a). Organic matter is present as the coalified organic macro/micro particles, spores, in situ roots, and root canals. PS1 is clayey; the others are sandy (Figure 4)."

Aside from the siderite they contain varying amounts of goethite, quartz, and kaolinite. Many of the nodules have petrographic features which reflect preservation of roots (Figure 3e). In some cases the density and interlacing of roots resulted in their intergrowth with development of larger-scale pedofeatures, which are frequently surrounded by better preserved root casts from later stages. The outer surfaces of nodules tend to be covered by argillans (clayey cutans) formed by clay illuviation processes (Figure 3d). A similar mode of root preservation within calcitic carbonate nodules has been described (Cox et al., 2001) for the middle late Devonian paleosols of the Catskill Formation, New York.\nThe d13C of siderite nodules from PS1, PS2, and PS3 ranges between 6.1 and 13.7% with an average of 9.8%, typical of a pedogenic origin and a C3 plant source of CO2, and is within the range of biogenic carbonate (Zamanian et al., 2016). In the latter case CO2/HCO3 were apparently produced by anaerobic microbial oxidation of organic matter with subsequent siderite formation under occasionally (or seasonally) water-logged environments (Wilkinson et al., 2000; Weibel et al., 2016). The data presented here, which demonstrate depletion of d13C with depth, may indicate an increase in the microbial pull of CO2 in the lower part of P-I. This may also reflect a microbial (bacteria and\nfermenters) variety, which produced CO2/HCO3 for siderite precipitation (Weibel et al., 2016).\nThese values are in the range reported by Driese and Mora (1993) for pedogenic Mg/Mn/Fe carbonates in the Catskill Formation, by Cox et al. (2001) for pedogenic calcite at the same location, by Quast et al. (2006) for Lower Devonian Lower Carboniferous pedogenic Ca-Mg carbonates from the UK and western Europe, and by Brasier et al. (2014) for pedogenic calcite from Old Red Stone of south Wales (UK)."

The largest degree of kaolinite ordering occurs in Starooskolian PS1: its XRD patterns have the narrowest peaks at 4.36 Å (11̄0) and 4.18 Å (111̄). The FTIR spectra of PS1 exhibit three vibration bands of OH-stretching groups of the octahedral sheet: two well developed at 3620 and 3700 cm 1, and a small peak at 3655 cm 1 (Figure 5c).

The peak at ~3400 cm 1, present in all spectra, belongs to OH-stretching of water in kaolinite, hydrogoethite, or other amorphous hydrated oxides; it has different intensities with a maximum for PS3 bed 2 where the supplementary peak at 1630 cm 1, belonging to OH-deformation of water, appeared. The intense band at 1427 cm 1 in this spectrum reflects CO3stretching of siderite. The degree of kaolinite ordering was shown by Levikh (1988) and Kornilovich (1994) to depend on the precursor mineral(s) and weathering (such as leaching) conditions. Kaolinites derived from the preDevonian granite weathering crust appear to have more ordered structures than those developed from volcanigenic material of the Yastrebovka Formation.\nAll paleosols of P-I have similar clay mineralogy: some horizons are monomineralic, i.e. consisting of kaolinite, the others also contain goethite (Figure 6a,b). The present SEM study of the undisturbed sample from the top layer of PS3 (bed 7) shows mm-sized goethite crystals closely associated with organic particles (Figure 3f). The mineral association of paleosols indicates strong soil leaching in humid tropical climates, a long duration of the pedogenesis as well as good drainage (Tabor and Myers, 2015). The in situ origin of kaolinite in PS2, PS3, and PS4 is supported by the SEM study of\nquartz-grain surfaces (not shown). The predominance of angular grains (up to 90% from 25 grains analyzed for each sample) and their low roundness (~34% from 25 grains analyzed for each sample) indicates that grains have not been altered intensively either by water or by air transportation (Alekseeva, 2005)."

Pedocomplex II consists of four morphologically and analytically distinct paleosols (PS1 PS4) with a total thickness of ~3 m. PS1 was developed from shale; the other three from volcanigenic material (Figure 7a). At least three inputs of volcanigenic material of intermediate composition took place; these are marked by the enhanced values of TiO2/Al2O3 (Figure 8). The best preserved units of P-II are PS1 and PS3 which are 100 and 80 cm thick, respectively (Figure 7b,c). PS2 and PS4 have been eroded and reworked\nintensively and PS4 has been oxidized extensively (Figure 7d). Paleosols 1 and 3 show the clay-rich nature of the upper 50 cm where the clay concentration reaches almost 40% (Figure 8).

The topographically lowest pedocomplex at the swampy bottom (Figure 2) is composed of at least four hydromorphic organic-rich paleosols (histosols) of ~180 cm total thickness (Figure 10). Paleosols are developed from the laminar, probably alluvial sediments rich in fine sand. All of them are gray partly due to the\nabundant inclusions of fine coal particles (Figure 10a,b). The uppermost 10 cm of each paleosol contains fine coalified and pyritized organic detritus, often arranged into large-scale pedofeatures (see below).\nPedocomplex III (P-III) is overlapped by a 30 cm sand layer and then by a 3.5 m tuff of the Yastrebovka Formation with inclusions of volcanic bombs and abundant plant debris, including stem fragments and stumps. Some of the plant debris is coalified and pyritized; other debris retains elements of the original plant structure. Their irregular positions suggest minimal transportation and quick burial. The presence of charcoal specimens can be explained by fires accompanying volcanic explosions. The best preserved paleosol in P-III is the lowest, PS1, ~110 cm thick. In addition to an organic-rich A-horizon, a 10 25 cm thick greenishyellowish gray, mottled B0 horizon is developed at 40 cm depth where the Fe2O3 concentrations reached 44 48%, i.e. ~2 times larger than the mean value for this pedocomplex.

The smectite is a low-charged montmorillonite of Wyoming type, morphologically similar to that described by Chipera and Bish (2001). Traces of mica occur in PS1 only (Figure 12).\nThe grayish-blue hues, abundant pyrite of different generations, and plant coalification suggest that this pedocomplex was developed under concurrent and/or early diagenetic anoxic environments, as also indicated by the decrease in MS values toward the top of each profile (Figure 11). On the other hand, the enhanced values of Ba/Sr ratio suggest a freshwater sedimentary environment (Makhlina et al., 1993)."

    "text": "The terrestrial middle late Devonian deposits contain huge varieties of fossil plants including some unique species such as: Orestovia voronejiensis, Tanaitis furcihasta, and Istchenkophyton filiciforme (Istchenko and Istchenko, 1981; Krassilov et al., 1987; Broushkin and Gordenko, 2009). Field observations revealed well preserved fragments of arborescent plants including branches, stems, and stumps, numerous small forms, and numerous imprints (Figures 7f h, 10c). Forest vegetation represented mainly by progymnospermous plants was polyspecific with predominantly large arche-\nopterid trees (Figure 7f,h). Other terrestrial vegetation such as woody progymnospermous shrubs (Tanaitis and Svalbardia), cladoxylalean ferns (Pseudosporochnales), different licopsids, and small-sized plants (such as rhyniophytes) were also distributed widely.\nEarth’s Devonian history is referred to as the ‘Devonian explosion’ with the greening of land by vascular plants, the appearance of arborescent plants and the first forests, the extreme biodiversity with a broad distribution of lycopsids, propteridophyta, progymnospermous, and the first calamites. At the same time different transitional forms between the algae-like Protosalvinia and the sporangiate vascular plants existed that are preserved locally in deposits as phytoleims. In the Devonian deposits of Pavlovsk, two types of these plans were discovered and described in detail (Istchenko and Istchenko, 1981): Orestovia and Bitelaria, belonging\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ccm/article-pdf/64/5/677/3269794/gsccm_64_5_13_ale.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nto red and brown algae. Later, these species were attributed to remnants of Schuguria ornata at Tschirkova-Zalesskaya (Broushkin and Gordenko, 2016). In the deposits studied here, such remnants have developed large accumulations without admixture of other species, probably creating the dense monocultures occupying the shallow-water basins and coastal environments. The thick cuticle of these remnants indicates that the locations they occupied dried periodically which might be related to increasing aridity. The broad distribution of these plants in the Devonian deposits studied may indicate the seasonality of climate with distinct wet-and-dry seasons. Recently, a new, thickcuticled plant was discovered (Istchenkophyton filiciforme gen. et sp. nov) in Devonian deposits of the Pavlovsk quarry (Broushkin and Gordenko, 2009). Those authors explained its unique anatomy as being due to the adaptation to unfavorable conditions, i.e. temporary (seasonal?) water deficit, such as relatively raised spots in a floodplain, banks of ephemeral streams, etc."

    "heading": "Root systems",
    "text": "To date, few findings have been made of in situ, well preserved roots or other below-ground plant structures of Paleozoic age (e.g. Driese and Mora, 1993; Algeo and Scheckler, 1998; Cox et al., 2001; Raven and Edwards, 2001; Stein et al., 2007, 2012; Morris et al., 2015; Retallack, 2015; Tabor and Myers, 2015). Well preserved Paleozoic rooting systems were found (Morris et al., 2015) along with other in situ vegetation in parts of North American territory. Two types of fine (up to 6 mm in diameter), coalified roots with non-preserved tissues in late Devonian paleosols of Timan (Russia) were found by Shumilov (2010, 2013).\nThe paleosols studied from P-I and P-II contain abundant individual roots and root systems of different morphology and size. The diameter of individual roots varies between several mm and >10 cm and the length between 1 and 60 cm with a median of 15 cm. The roots were preserved in various states, depending on their location. The PS3 profile from P-I, which was overlain catastrophically by estuarial argillite, is uniquely preserved, including the litter layer. The rooting systems of rapidly buried living plants preserved the pipe-like shape and often some tissues: parenchyma, secondary crust, and inner and external exoderm (Figure 3b,c). These root systems are suggested here to belong to primitive progymnosperms similar to Tanaites. Numerous spores of such plants were found in the litter layer of PS3 (Figure 3g). The tissues of the rhizocreations studied were substituted with siderite and (hydro)goethite, probably being a diagenetic product of siderite oxidation.\nBecause of the warm Devonian subtropical climate, high temperatures, low atmospheric O2 concentration, and high concentrations of Fe2O3 in host rocks, much soluble Fe2+ was available and taken by roots. High concentrations of CO2/HCO3 in soil solutions and\ndeficits in terms of Ca2+ favored the precipitation of siderite (Tabor and Myers, 2015).\nOn the other hand, the root systems of a partly eroded profile of PS1 from P-II have been degraded completely and are present as wedges up to 30 cm long and up to 15 cm wide (Figure 7b). Up to six such wedges occur per meter. The inner parts of the wedges consist of a loose soft yellow material, containing about twice as much clay as the host rock (37 and 20% clay, respectively) and 68% of Fe2O3 as the siderite/goethite mixture. Their outer red edges contain hematite. Frequent fragments of Callixylon may indicate that these large-scale rooting systems probably belong to Archaeopteris. The upland location of P-II suggests that these plants were common not only in wet floodplain habitats but also created the upland forests.\nThe rooted plants played a crucial biochemical role in formation of the Devonian CZ by crushing rocks, increasing the rate of weathering and pedogenesis, mobilization of plant nutrients, and enhancing the geochemical cycles of elements, thus increasing the flux of elements into the ocean and mitigating the atmospheric CO2 (Mora et al., 1996; Cox et al., 2001; Berner, 2004; Mintz et al., 2010). In addition, the development of rooting systems provided the substrate disintegration, influenced water and air exchange, and reduced surface runoff and erosion rates."

The MAP values were calculated here using XRF results and equations (standard error of 180 mm), following the method of Sheldon et al.

The distribution of Oresvovia voronejiensis, Schuguria ornate, and Istchenkophyton filiciforme all having thick cuticles suggests the seasonal aridity of the climate. North American occurrences at ~40ºS paleolatitude also suggest a warm climate with distinct wet-and-dry seasons during the late Devonian period (Driese and Mora, 1993; Cox et al., 2001; Cressler, 2006).\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ccm/article-pdf/64/5/677/3269794/gsccm_64_5_13_ale.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019"

    "heading": "DISCUSSION",
    "text": "During the middle late Devonian period the territory studied had a pronounced relief with automorphic (watershed), semi-hydromorphous (slope), and at least seasonally waterlogged (wetland) conditions of pedogenesis. These landscapes and corresponding paleosols differ from the dominant middle late Devonian pedosphere described as marine-influenced, coastal fluvial wetlands, waterlogged and poorly oxygenated (Griffing et al., 2000; Cressler, 2006; Stein et al., 2012). Some paleosols from this unique site were oxidized intensely. Semi-hydromorphous and seasonally waterlogged paleosols from the slope and channel bottom had probably also undergone stages when oxidizing conditions prevailed. Enhancements of (Fe2O3+MnO)/Al2O3 values in paleosol profiles (Figures 4, 8, 11), which reflect the degree of material oxidation, show enhancements for\npedogenically reworked materials (Kalinin and Alekseev, 2011).\nThe pronounced relief caused the differentiation of water regimes but in both cases the drainage conditions were favorable, partly due to the sandy texture and inclusions of volcaniclastic and tuffaceous porous rocks. As a consequence, the soil cover consisted of different soil types and was not restricted to vertic, nondifferentiated, smectitic lithogenic soils as was found in other studies (Driese and Mora, 1993; Cressler, 2006; Brasier et al., 2014). Paleosols from P-I and P-II had well pronounced texturally and chemically differentiated profiles with production and translocation of kaolinitic clay, pedogenic carbonate nodules, organic matter, and in situ roots. The prevalence of kaolinite in a felsic parent rock reflects the favorable conditions for chemical weathering (warm/humid climate, good drainage)\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ccm/article-pdf/64/5/677/3269794/gsccm_64_5_13_ale.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nand long duration of exposure. The only bed which can be regarded as having been water saturated permanently is the argillite layer at the top of PS3 from P-I (Figure 2). The other catastrophic factor, volcanic activity, permitted denudation of the soil cover and supplied a parent material for the subsequent pedogenesis. As a consequence, all the paleosols studied were stacked and arranged into pedocomplexes of up to four individual paleosol profiles. Two types of profiles proposed by Mariott and Wright (1993) can be applied to describe the environments studied here: (1) a composite one developed under rapid, intermittent, and medium sedimentary accumulation; and (2) a compound type developed under rapid, intermittent, and large sedimentary accumulation. In the case of type 1, partly eroded overlapped profiles with overprinting were detected; in the case of type 2, a complete, well preserved profile without overprinting was observed. Most of the paleosols studied having partly eroded overlapped profiles with overprinting belong to type 1 and only one, PS3 from P-I, having a complete, well preserved profile without overprinting, belongs to type 2. The main type of deposit in the Yastrebovka Formation is of volcanigenic-sedimentary origin. Lava supplied the system with Fe which is the most distinct typomorphic element in this paleo-CZ. A wet and warm climate along with dense vegetation accelerated the Fe mobilization which replaced Ca in pedogenic carbonate nodules, rhizocretions, stromatolites, and marine carbonates. Based on the iron mineralogy, the multistage development of the landscape can be described as follows: (1) formation of well drained, aerated profiles having red hematitic layers at the base; (2) periodic flooding with intermittent sedimentary accumulation, frequently containing plant debris, provided anoxic conditions and siderite/pyrite substitution of roots and other plant fragments from the overlapped soils occurred as a result; and (3) surface exposure causing partial or complete transformation of siderite to goethite and subsequent formation of a new red hematitic layer. The sedimentary accumulation events changed, among other things, the vegetation communities."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "The unique paleogeographic conditions and tropical climate during the middle late Devonian in what is now southeastern Russia created a complex paleo-CZ consisting of several paleo sub-CZs representing the chronological sequences in each of three sites studied. In addition, linked to the paleorelief, the sites studied could be considered as a paleo-toposequence. The soils in these sites were developed under various kinds of vegetation and probably differed in terms of time taken to develop. The climate, determined by the equatorial location of the territory, was more or less stable (Figure 13). Over time, single sub-CZs were combined\nstep-by-step via atmospheric water circulation, rooting systems, and elemental cycles which overprinted the previous stages of pedogenesis.\nThe site studied in Russia differs fundamentally from the well described Givetian Frasnian forest at Gilboa (New York, USA) discovered in the 1870s and studied extensively since the 1920s (Stein et al., 2007, 2012). The Gilboa complex forest community belonged to a tropical muddy swamp near the palaeo-shoreline. The paleosols of Pavlovsk (at least some of them) are automorphic, deeply weathered, extensively oxidized, ferruginized, and deeply reworked by rooting systems of diverse plants, including arborescent vegetation. In the waterlogged part of the paleo-relief, hydromorphous paleosols under Orestovia / Schuguria were developed.\nIn spite of significant differences between environments and most components of modern and Devonian CZs, their key components, rooted (tropical in the present case) soils, demonstrate a number of similarities and were developed at least partly under similar processes. Both environments demonstrate the deep chemical weathering of sediments, typomorphism of iron, clay production and redistribubution, and kaolinite/ goethite mineral assemblage, amongst other features.\nPaleo-CZ studies are very worthwhile. Paleosols are unique and the most reliable natural archive of Earth’s terrestrial life. The virgin states of the parent sediments and single authigenesis of Devonian soils, compared with the multiply recycled material of most modern soils, allow them to be used as simple natural systems for the modeling of soil processes in modern CZs. On the other hand, similar modern soils and CZs provide an invaluable source of data which allows the reconstruction of the early Earth’s environments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe present research was supported by the Program of the Russian Academy of Sciences ‘Geobiology and evolution of biosphere’ and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Grants 12-04-00387 and 15-04-06494).

  "abstractText": "Land colonization with vascular plants during the late Silurian early Devonian and then arborescence during the Pragian Givetian caused the development of new soil types. These true-rooted soils increased the rate of pedogenesis on a global scale. Since that time, soil has become a key component of the biosphere and has given rise to profound development of the Earth’s Critical Zone (CZ). Case studies of Devonian CZs have helped to record the transformation from Precambrian Lower Paleozoic ‘protoCZs,’ which had insufficient proto-soil cover, to modern soils with true-rooted pedosphere. Devonian (Givetian Frasnian) paleosols from the Voronezh region of Russia are combined into pedocomplexes which occupied the top, slope, and bottom positions of a pronounced paleo-relief. Paleosols were developed from terrigenous argillites and volcanigenic-sedimentary deposits. Each pedocomplex consisted of four or more paleosols with different degrees of development and profile preservation. Paleosols exhibited several common characteristics including production and translocation of clay, ferruginization and the presence of siderite nodules, enhanced MnO/Al2O3 and (Fe2O3+MnO)/Al2O3 values, and in situ roots and root-system traces. The latter are siderite/goethite substituted. Stable isotope analysis of siderite shows dC values of between 6.1 and 13.7% indicating that CO2 had originated from C3 plants. The main mineral component of clay fractions in automorphic paleosols (top and slope of the paleorelief) is kaolinite. The important feature of these paleosols is the red-stained hematite-rich layer in their bases. These horizons developed at different depths and with different thicknesses, and marked the paleogroundwater tables of each sub-CZ. Evidence of the imprints of vegetation is seen in the abundant in situ roots, plant fragments, and spores of rhyniophytes, lycopsids, progymnosperms, cladoxylalean ferns, and phytoleims of algae-like vascular plants. The near-equatorial location and the overall characteristics of paleosols studied suggest that the aforementioned horizons were formed in a tropically warm and humid climate. The paleo-ecological environments which accompanied pedogenesis were probably controlled by tectonic activity and volcanism.
