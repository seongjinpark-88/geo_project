    "text": "Mineral springs in the Victorian Central Highlands, Australia, have high CO2 contents and naturally effervesce. d 13C values of CO2 gas and dissolved inorganic carbon are 10.6% to 7.0% and 5.9% to 0.1%, respectively, with a net d13C of 8% to 3%. The carbon in these waters was derived from a mantle source associated with local Pliocene to Recent basaltic Newer Volcanic Province rocks. Previously reported 3He/4He (1.2–3.1 relative to air) and high He/Ne ratios are also consistent with the presence of magmatic volatiles. Silica contents imply that the waters were never heated above 130 C and that the system is not hydrothermal. The occurrence of carbonated mineral springs in a relatively small region of the Newer Volcanics Province where volcanic activity ceased several thousands of years ago may be due to the presence of late intrusions combined with deep circulation of water through deeply weathered and fractured Ordovician basement. A region of low seismic velocity under the Daylesford area potentially images those intrusions. Most spring waters have d18O and d2H values of 8% to 6% and 45% to 35%, respectively, and lie to the left of the local and global meteoric water lines. The anomalously low d18O values results from CO2 exsolution at low temperatures which strongly partitions 18O into the gas. The lack of waters lying to the right of the local meteoric water line also implies that water–rock interaction at elevated temperatures did not occur. The d2H values are lower than contemporary meteoric water, suggesting that the waters may have recharged under colder climate conditions several thousand years ago. The local Ordovician rocks are gold bearing. The present spring system is cold and would not efficiently transport Au. However, volcanic is waning and the spring systems at the time of volcanism may have been hotter and able to redistribute Au. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Mineral springs are commonly used as a source of bottled water or as a recreational resource (tourism, spa facilities, etc.) and a sound knowledge of their hydrogeology is required for sustainable usage.\nMineral springs may be hot (e.g. Sheppard, 1986; Parry and Bowman, 1990; Krupp and Seward, 1990; Larsen et al., 2001), defined byMazor (1991) as having a temperature of >6 C above that of mean annual surface temperature, or cold (e.g. Harris et al., 1997; Céron et al., 1998; Larsen et al., 2001). Understanding the distribution of temperatures in mineral springs is also important as hot springs are characteristic of active hydrothermal areas with elevated geotherms while cold springs imply less or no hydrothermal activity. There will be a transition from cold to hot spring systems as volcanic activity increases, and a transition back to cold spring systems as volcanic activitywanes.Thus, springs may also constrain the stage of the volcanic cycle in a particular region.\nGas (typically CO2, N2, CH4 and/or H2S, together with important minor components such as He and Ar) commonly accompanies water discharge in spring areas. CO2 in mineral springs may be derived from a variety of sources, including metamorphic devolatilisation, magmatic degassing, oxidation of organic matter and interaction of water with sedimentary carbonates (e.g. Schoell, 1983; Chivas et al., 1983, 1987; Griesshaber et al., 1992; Giggenbach, 1992; Giggenbach and Corrales-Soto, 1992; Harris et al., 1997; Céron et al., 1998). Determining the origin(s) of these volatiles is critical. The presence of mantlederived or magmatic carbon attests to the presence of current or very recent volcanic activity that may not be apparent from the surface geology. Variations in the proportions of mantle- to crustally derived volatiles allows the spatial extent of volcanism to be delineated.\nFinally, manymineral springs systems contain water with relatively high total dissolved solids. Such high solute loads require either high-temperature water– rock interaction or a protracted period of low-temperature water–rock interaction. Thus, mineral springs (especially in nonhydrothermal systems) are likely to\ncontain palaeowaters that may preserve evidence of former climatic conditions.\nHere, we examine the stable isotope geochemistry of mineral springs from the central Victorian Highlands, Australia. We show that the waters are palaeowaters and that the spring system is not hydrothermal. Further, we show that the CO2 is derived from a mantle source and that there consequently is current, albeit waning, igneous activity at depth that is not immediately apparent from the surface geology."

    "text": "The Daylesford region in the Central Highlands of Victoria (Fig. 1) lies some 600–700 m above sea level contains more than 100 mineral springs (Fig. 2). The springs lie between 2 and 45 km from the crest of the Great Dividing Range (a range of hills some 50–60 m above general elevation levels that forms a major watershed in southeast Australia), mainly in the valleys of the Loddon andCampaspe rivers and their tributaries (e.g. Wishart and Wishart, 1990; Shugg and Knight, 1994; Shugg, 1996). The region mainly comprises a deeply dissected plateau of Quaternary basalts (the Newer Volcanics) overlying Ordovician slates, shales and sandstones of the Lachlan Fold Belt. The Newer Volcanics are largely extrusive intraplate igneous rocks that cover over 15000 km2 of Victoria and South Australia (Fig. 1) with over 400 known eruption points (Fig. 2). The comprise mainly basalts with lesser volumes of trachytes and phonolites (Coulson, 1954; Price et al., 1988). Fig. 2 shows the location of eruptive centres in the Newer Volcanics Province. Eruptions in the Newer Volcanics Province commenced at 4.6 Ma and peaked at 2.6 Ma, with activity in the southwest of the province continuing to as late as 5 ka (Gill and Gibbons, 1969; Price et al., 1988). In the Daylesford area, a hawaiitic basalt from the Mount Franklin scoria cone was dated using K/Ar at 470 ka (Nicholls et al., 1993). The Ordovician rocks belong to the Lancefeldian and Bendigonian units, which are part of a 4500-m thick sequence of turbidites (Cas and VandenBerg, 1988). The Ordovician rocks were folded and deformed under greeschist-facies conditions during a series of tectonic episodes in the Late Ordovician to Middle Devonian (Gray, 1997), and economically significant vein-hosted gold deposits were also formed at that time (Gray and Foster, 1998). Kilometre-scale\ngranitic batholiths were emplaced into the region in the Devonian (White et al., 1988; Gray, 1997), and there are several outcrops of the Harcourt Granite in the Daylesford region (Fig. 2). Minor rock units cropping out in the Daylesford Region include thin ( < 30 m) Permian gravels and clays and Pliocene to Recent alluvial sediments."

    "heading": "1.2. Aquifer systems",
    "text": "Except for a few sandstone units that contain an intergranular porosity, the Ordovician rocks form a fractured aquifer (the Ordovician Bedrock Aquifer) through which mineral water flows in fissures and joints (Lawrence, 1969; Laing, 1977; Shugg, 1996). The area is transected by a dominant set of west-\ndipping thrust faults with less common conjugate eastdipping structures (Gray and Willman, 1991) that form major conduits for large-scale groundwater flow (Shugg and Knight, 1994). Mining records show that active mineral water flows were often encountered in gold mines at depths of up to 450 m, indicating that fracture-hosted fluid flow occurs to considerable depth (Shugg and Knight, 1994). Recharge of the mineral waters was assumed by Shugg and Knight (1994) and Shugg (1996) to mainly occur on the crest of the Great Dividing Range. Near-surface ( < 50 m) fluid flow also occurs though the weathered zone of the Ordovician bedrock. Water in this shallow Ordovician aquifer is typically brackish to saline due to evapotranspiration and dissolution of cyclic salts in the weathered Ordovician rocks."

    "heading": "1.3. Description of the springs",
    "text": "The mineral springs typically occur in stream beds or banks where the water table intersects the ground surface. In their natural state, spring discharges are marked by seeps of brown water and gas discharges through stream water. However, most mineral springs in the Daylesford Region have been developed by installing hand pumps over the spring eyes, driving metal pipes into the stream bank, or digging culverts into weathered rock and inserting metal pipes (Wishart and Wishart, 1990). In most cases, development also involved stopping flow from surrounding spring eyes to increase flow from one or two points. Here we describe the stable isotope geochemistry of spring waters and gases from 19 localities in the Daylesford\nregion (Fig. 2). Descriptions of the springs are provided by Wishart and Wishart (1990), and are summarised in Table 1. At all sites, CO2 and minor mineral water discharges were observed in the adjacent creeks and rivers for up to several metres from the springs, especially at times of low flow rates. The springs cover a wide area both south and north of the Great Dividing Range and include sources in basalt and the basement Ordovician turbidites.\nSpring water in the Daylesford region of Victoria, southeast Australia, has significantly different chemistry compared with much Australian groundwater. Notably, the spring waters have high bicarbonate, Ca and Mg contents (Wishart and Wishart, 1990; Weaver et al., submitted for publication) rather than being Naand Cl-dominated (Table 2; Fig. 3). The waters\nnaturally effervesce (Laing, 1977), and gas discharge is commonly observed in rivers adjacent to the springs. Although the springs have been exploited as a source of drinking water and for spa facilities for over a century, their hydrogeology is still relatively poorly understood. This paper presents the first comprehensive stable isotope study of the mineral springs in the Daylesford region and discusses their origins, location and gas–water–rock interaction. A companion paper (Weaver et al., submitted for publication) discusses the hydrogeology and chemistry of the springs."

    "heading": "1.4. Previously proposed origins of CO2",
    "text": "Several models for the origin of the CO2 in the minerals springs have been suggested.McLaughlin and Macumber (1968) suggested that the carbon was derived from oxidation of local carbonaceous shales by groundwater. Due to the occurrence of the springs in the area of Newer Volcanics, Lawrence (1969) proposed that the CO2 had an igneous source. Similar conclusions were reached by Chivas et al. (1983) on the basis of limited C and He isotope data of gasses from unnamed springs in the Daylesford region. A magnetic\nsource for liquid CO2 from a deep well near Mount Gambier in the far west of the Newer Volcanics province (Fig. 1) was proposed by Chivas et al. (1987) again from C and He isotopes. By contrast, Shugg and Knight (1994) proposed that the CO2 in the Daylesford region was derived from carbonate via reactions that breakdown kaolinite to form Na-Beidelite. These reactions liberate H + that may cause dissolution of carbonates that are locally present in joints. This model is similar to those of Blake (1989) and Herczeg et al. (1991) for the formation of bicarbonaterich groundwater in the Otway and Great Artesian Basins. However, while the origin of the CO2 has been a source of contention, there has been relatively little stable isotope work carried out on the mineral waters and their associated gases. Additionally, the limited carbon isotope data are for gas, with no data for the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) that represents a substantial reservoir of the carbon in the system."

    "heading": "2. Sampling and analytical techniques",
    "text": "Several parameters (pH, Eh, EC, alkalinity, temperature, and CO2) were measured in the field. Major\ncations were analysed on filtered and acidified samples by ICP-OES and anions were analysed on unfiltered and unacidified samples by ion chromatography. Representative chemical analyses and field parameters are shown in Table 2, a full discussion of water chemistry is presented in Weaver et al. (submitted for publication). Water and gas samples for stable isotopes were collected in 50-ml glass bottles that have lids with rubber seals. Gas samples were collected in inverted bottles filled with mineral spring water from discharges in streams or from pipes fitted to spring outlets. The gas was allowed to displace all but 1 cm of the water in the bottle, which was kept inverted to prevent exchange with the atmosphere. Gas collected in evacuated stopcock vessels had identical d13C values within error to that collected from the same source in inverted bottles and gas d13C values did not vary with gas/water ratios in the bottles. Replicate samples of CO2 stored for several months retained their d13C values. Stable isotope measurements were made at Monash University using a Finnigan MAT 252 mass spectrometer, and the results are presented in Table 3. d18O values of water were measured via equilibration with CO2 at 25 C for 24–48 h. d2H values of water were measured via reaction with Cr at 850 C using an automated Finnigan MAT H/Device. d18O and d2H values were measured relative to internal standards that were calibrated using IAEA SMOW, GISP and SLAP standards. Data were normalised following Coplen (1988) and are expressed relative to V-SMOW where d18O and d2H values of SLAP are 55.5% and 428%, respectively. CO2 gas was cryogenically purified in a vacuum line prior to analysis of d13C values. CO2 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was liberated by acidification of water under vacuum in sealed sidearm vessels. d13C values are expressed relative to V-PDB. All samples were analysed at least twice and the precision (1r) is: d18O of waters = ± 0.15%; d2H of water = ± 1%; d13C of gases = ± 0.1%; and d13C of DIC = ± 0.2%."

The difference in d13C values between DIC and the gases, D13C(DIC CO2) is 3– 8%, with most springs having D13C(DIC CO2) values between 5% and 7%. The equilibrium 13C fractionation between CO2 and DIC varies with temperature and the proportion of the various carbon species in the water. Fig. 6a shows the relative concentration of H2CO3, HCO3 and CO3 2 in water, expressed as a proportion of total carbon, as a function of pH at 10 C (calculated using data in Drever, 1997). The speciation does not vary appreciably between 0 and 50 C. The predicted D13C(DIC CO2) values at 10–50 C, calculated using the fractionation data of Vogel et al. (1970), Mook et al.

Summary of d13C values of DIC and CO2 from Daylesford mineral springs (data from Table 3). D is the difference between d13C values of DIC and CO2.\ncating that the CO2 is in approximate isotopic equilibrium with the DIC and thus part of a single mineral water–gas system.\nThe net d13C values of the mineral waters are a function of the relative amount of CO2 and DIC and the d13C values of each of these components. It was not possible to either sample the mineral water prior to the gas exsolving or to measure the proportion of the two components emanating from the springs as the gas escapes from several points around the spring. Hence, it is difficult to measure the proportions of these two components. Speciation calculations (Weaver et al., submitted for publication) suggest that the exsolved CO2 represents 25–75% of the total carbon originally contained in the mineral water, implying that net d13C values are 8% to 3%. As discussed below, the displacement of waters from the LMWL is due to exsolution of CO2 near to the surface. If the initial d18O of the water and the 18O fractionation between H2O and CO2 is known, such displacements may be used to estimate the volume of gas exsolved. However, as discussed below, much of the carbon must have been derived from a noncarbonate source, most probably magmatic CO2. If this is the case, the d 18O\nvalue of the water prior to exsolution will vary with initial volume of CO2 that was dissolved in the water. Since it is not possible to estimate the initial volumes of carbon dissolved in the waters, calculations based on displacements from the LMWL do not yield unique answers. For example, consider a water that initially had a d18O of 6.5%. Addition of 20% (expressed on a moles of O basis) CO2 with a d\n18O of + 6% would raise the d18O of the water to 3.6%. At 10–25 C, D18O(CO2 H2O) values are 44.4–41.2% (Bottinga, 1968). Thus, subsequent exsolution of ~13–14 mol/ 100 mol H2O of CO2 close to the surface would produce water with a d18O of 7.5%. Addition of 2% CO2 with a similar d 18O value raises the initial d18O to only 6.3% and exsolution of only ~1.4 mol/ 100 mol H2O of CO2 near surface would produce a water with a d18O of 7.5%."

In particular, there is little difference between the d18O and d2H values of the samples\ncollected in May or April after prolonged dry periods and those collected in the wetter winter months (July– September). The exception to this are the Taradale, Turpins Falls and Kyneton springs in the north of the area. For Kyneton and Taradale, water samples collected in August lay on the LMWL while for Turpins Falls, the June sample lay on the LMWL suggesting that local rainfall mixes with the mineral water in the wetter months in these springs. Overall, however, the data suggest that the residence times of the spring waters is relatively long, and that the input of shallow surface waters to the springs that were sampled in this study is relatively minor. Additionally, the d13C values of the gas discharges are similar between the sampling rounds, implying that the source(s) of carbon is constant over time.\nFig. 7 shows the spatial variation of d13C values of CO2 and d 2H values of the spring water. With the exception of Glenluce, CO2 d 13C values become more negative toward the south of the region (Fig. 7a), while d2H values show a similar, although less welldefined trend (Fig. 7b). The springs with the higher d2H values in the northeast of the region are those that either consistently or intermittently lie on the LMWL. We interpret these northern springs as showing mixing of spring water with local meteoric water, which has higher d2H values, near their discharge points. It is not known at what depth this mixing occurs. However, the consistency in isotopic ratios suggests that it is below that required to attenuate any seasonal isotopic variation. In fractured rocks, this may be several tens of metres (e.g. Yonge et al., 1985). These springs lie on the northern proximity of the area of abundant eruptive centres (Fig. 2) and mark the transition from the mineral springs to less carbonated springwaters that are more typical of south-central Victoria."

    "heading": "5.1. Origin of carbon",
    "text": "Mantle-derived carbon has a d13C 8% to 5% (Deines, 1970; Kyser, 1986; Sheppard, 1986). At igneous temperatures, the 13C fractionation between carbon contained in a magma and CO2 is\n2% (Sheppard, 1986). Hence, CO2 derived from a magmatic source is predicted to have a d13C value of\n6% to 3%. This d13C value is close to the net d13C value of the spring waters. However, the d13C value of mantle CO2 overlaps with that of bulk crustal carbon ( 7.0% to 5.5%: Ohmoto and Rye, 1979), and unambiguous discrimination of carbon sources cannot be made using carbon isotopes with no corroborating data. There is a good local correlation in the Daylesford area between the abundance of springs and eruption points of the Newer Volcanics (Fig. 2). In the north of the area, the concentration of both springs and eruption points diminish. As discussed earlier, water from the northern springs is commonly on or close to the meteoric water line and has higher d2H values that suggest mixing of mineral and local meteoric water. On a regional scale, the Daylesford area contains a far higher concentration of eruptive centres than most of the Newer Volcanics Province.\nThe areas around the mineral springs are vegetated with dominantly C3 plants, and carbon derived from such plants has d13C values of 24% to 30% with an average of 27% (Vogel, 1993). Aerobic decay and dissolution of carbon with a d13C value of 27% into soil waters at 25 C produces water with DIC d13C values of 14% at moderate to high pH falling to 24% at low pH (Clarke and Fritz, 1997). The shales in the Lachlan Fold Belt contain graphite with d13C values of 12% to 16% (Gao and Kwak, 1995; Cartwright, unpublished data). Thus, neither of these potential sources of carbon can explain the d13C values of the mineral waters (Fig. 8). The turbidities in the\nDaylesford region locally contain ankerite associated with numerous small vein gold that has d13C values of 13% to 2% (Gao and Kwak, 1995). Dissolution of such carbonate may produce carbon with d13C values similar to those of the spring waters. However, the carbonate represents a very minor ( < 1%) component of these rocks and is unlikely to provide the large volumes of CO2 that emanate from the springs. Similarly, carbonate contained in joints that Shugg and Knight (1994) proposed was the source of the carbon in the spring waters is not abundant in the area. Additionally, the Na-beidelite that they proposed was formed as part of the dissolution reaction cycle has not been identified in the area.\nThe carbon isotopes could be reflecting carbon from multiple sources. CO2 derived from marine limestones (d13C values typically ~0%) will have high d13C values. For example, CO2 in spring waters derived from dissolution of limestones in Natal has d13C values of 0.6–0.9% (Harris et al., 1997). Hence, carbon derived from a combination of modern vegetation or oxidation of graphite and dissolution of marine limestone could have d13C values similar to that of the mineral springs. However, the nearest outcrops of voluminous limestone are in the Otway Basin, over 100 km to the south of the mineral springs (Fig. 1) and it is unlikely that waters from that area are incorporated in the springs. The crust underlying the mineral springs is composed of a thick monotonous section of turbidities (Gray, 1997) in which the dominant carbon source is graphite, and there is little scope for multiple sources of carbon in the sedimentary rocks underlying the springs. Further, even assuming that all Ca, Mg and Sr were derived from carbonate dissolution, the carbon content of the mineral waters (Table 2) is far too high to be accounted for by that process (Weaver et al., submitted for publication). Similar excess carbon relative to cations contents is also apparent from carbonated waters from the Rhine Graben that have high He4/H3 ratios and mantle d13C values (Greisshaber et al., 1992). Additionally, none of the above models explain the concentration of the CO2-bearing mineral springs in the Central Highlands of Victoria. For example, gold deposits are found throughout the Lachlan Fold Belt and are not elsewhere associated with mineral springs. Neither are CO2-bearing springs present in the areas where limestone and graphitic shale are in closer\nproximity. The restriction of the mineral springs to within the Newer Volcanic Province suggests a relationship with igneous activity. The observation that each mineral water has a distinct cation and anion chemistry (Table 2; Fig. 3), while containing carbon with a restricted range of d13C values (Fig. 5) is also consistent with this proposal. The chemistry of the waters is controlled by water–rock interaction and the water from individual springs follows different flow paths through fractures and interacts with different lithologies (Weaver et al., submitted for publication). If the carbon in the mineral waters was also derived from the local rocks, a greater variation in d13C values would be expected.\nThe bicarbonate-to-chloride ratio of the mineral waters and the concentrations of CO2 in the waters generally declines away from the Bullarto region (Laing, 1977; Schaefer and Kecskemeti, 1981; Weaver et al., submitted for publication), and the source of the CO2 is potentially in that region. However, there are no active volcanoes in that area. Indeed, the most recent eruptions occurred in the southwest of the Newer Volcanic Province (around Mount Gambier, Fig. 1) and not in the Central Highlands. It is most likely that the CO2 is derived from a very recent mantle-derived source at depth that has no surface expression and which is still degassing. Seismic tomography data shows a region of low P-wave velocities at 45–60 km below the Daylesford area that may be a region of higher heatflow associated with igneous activity at depth (Graeber et al., 2000). That zone may contain igneous rocks that are degassing. Alternatively, igneous intrusions derived from that region may be located within the crust at higher levels. The latter is more plausible given that the CO2 reaches the surface; however, any igneous rocks must be sufficiently deep not to produce significantly elevated geothermal gradients in the region (c.f. Purss and Cull, 2001).\nThe large-scale trend in d13C values (Fig. 7) may reflect variations in the proportion of CO2 to DIC within the springs. From mass balance constraints, with decreasing CO2/DIC ratios, the d 13C value of DIC will approach the net d13C value of the spring water and the d13C value of the CO2 will consequently become more negative. Such a change in CO2:DIC ratios would be expected if the total C content of the waters decreased as lower volumes of CO2 are ex-\nsolved. Alternatively, the trend may reflect an increasing input of low d13C carbon (perhaps from the graphitic shales) relative to the mantle-derived CO2. In either case, the decrease in d13C values probably marks the change in spring water geochemistry away from the source of igneous activity."

    "text": "The spring waters generally lie to the left of the LMWL (positive O’ values). As discussed above, the CO2 probably contains a significant mantle-derived component. At igneous temperatures (600–1000 C) 18O fractionations between mafic magmas and CO2 are small (Sheppard, 1986). If the mafic magmas had typical mantle d13C values ( 5.6%: Hoefs, 1997), exsolved CO2 would have had an initial d 13C value of 5.5–6.0%. As discussed above, dissolution of this CO2 into the mineral waters would initially raise their d18O values to lie to the right of the LMWL. However, close to the surface, the CO2 exsolves at low temperatures and exsolution of moderate amounts of the CO2 will lower the d 18O values of the water driving it to the left of the LMWL. Higher volumes of mantle-derived CO2 dissolved in the spring water will produce greater increases in initial d18O values driving them far to the right of the LMWL; however, more highly carbonated waters will undergo greater degrees of exsolution that will lower the d18O values. Isotopic exchange between CO2 and water is rapid (it forms the basis of the technique to analyse d13C values of water and is achieved within a few hours at 25 C in the laboratory), and so this process is not kinetically limited."

    "heading": "5.3. Water–rock interaction and depth of circulation",
    "text": "The lack of mineral waters lying to the right of the meteoric water line suggests that there has been limited water–rock interaction at elevated temperatures (>100–150 C). Even given that CO2 exsolution at low temperatures will reduce d18O values of the waters, significant high temperature water–rock interaction would be expected to produce at least some waters lying to the right of the meteoric water line (as is the case in geothermal springs such as those in Yellowstone, USA: Sheppard, 1986; Parry and Bowman, 1990; and Tecopa, USA: Larsen et al.,\n2001). This is also in keeping with the cold water temperatures recorded at the Daylesford springs.\nThe silica contents of waters (Table 2) are in equilibrium with quartz-bearing rocks at temperatures of less than 130 C (Weaver et al., submitted for publication), also implying that water–rock interaction did not occur at elevated temperatures. While present day near-surface ( < 20–50 m) geothermal gradients in the Daylesford region are high ( 50– 70 C/km; Laing, 1977) heat flow in the Central Highlands is not atypical and crustal geothermal gradients are estimated to be 23–24 C/km (Purss and Cull, 2001). The temperatures imply circulation of the mineral waters to depth of up to 4–5 km. These relatively deep levels of circulation may result from deep weathering in the Daylesford region that has caused fractures to open up to depth, and accord with reports that active mineral water flow was observed in many of the mines. The Si content of the spring waters decreases markedly southward and to a lesser extent northward (Table 2), which again reflects the transition between mineral water flow systems and typical shallow groundwater flow systems (Weaver et al., submitted for publication). There is no correlation of isotope geochemistry of the springs and proximity to the Great Dividing Range that Shugg and Knight (1994) and Shugg (1996) proposed was the recharge area. This may be due to the processes controlling the C and H isotope geochemistry (varying proportions of mantle-derived CO2 and mixing with shallow groundwater at the source of the springs) being superimposed on the mineral water flow system. The restricted occurrence of the mineral springs and the locally deep circulation in the centre of the Daylesford region makes it most likely that there was little lateral transport of CO2-bearing fluids."

    "heading": "5.4. Hydrogen isotopes: constraints on the timing of recharge",
    "text": "Typical d2H values of water from the mineral springs are 40% to 35%, which are lower than typical modern meteoric water in south-central Victoria, including the majority of surface water samples from the Daylesford area. The springs may have been recharged preferentially from heavier late autumn to early spring rains when evapotranspiration is less. The IAEA data for meteoric water at Melbourne shows a\nseasonal variation of d2H values. In May to July, the average d2H of meteoric water is 38% to 35% (which could plausibly explain the spring d2H values). However, rainfall in the remainder of the winter and spring months (August–November) has average d2H values of 31% to 15%, and the weighted average for the entire period from May to November is 29%. Unless the spring waters recharge during only a very limited period (2–3 months), seasonalselective recharge cannot explain the low d2H values. Additionally, the northern springs that show mixing with shallow groundwater have higher d2H values than the majority of the springs (Figs. 4 and 17), indicating that shallow groundwater does not have anomalously low d2H values. The shallow groundwater has recently been recharged and the data imply that the recharged waters have d2H values close to that of average precipitation. From this we conclude that seasonal-selective recharge is not a significant process. The springs may be mixing with deeper groundwater with lower d2H waters from an area outside south-central Victoria. However, the closest likely source of such low d2H waters would be in the Victorian and New South Wales alpine areas some 100–200 km to the east of Daylesford, and there are no evident flow paths from the area to the central Victorian Highlands. If our general interpretations of the stable isotope geochemistry is correct, the d2H values have been little affected by any processes subsequent to recharge. Using the relationship between mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and d2H values (Dansgaard, 1964) suggests temperatures of 9.6–11.6 C for d2H values of 45% to 35%. This is significantly below the present day MAAT for the Daylesford–Castlemaine region calculated from Victorian Bureau of Meteorology data as 13.0–14.0\nC. We interpret the data to indicate that the springs were recharged under colder climatic conditions. Palynological studies and evidence for periglacial activity in the southeast Victorian highlands summarised by Kershaw (1998) indicate that there was a cool period in SE Australia around 3.5–3.0 ka BP, which may have been the time that the waters were recharged. On the basis of their solute contents, Weaver et al. (submitted for publication) suggest that residence times of the waters were on the order of a few thousand years, which accords with these broad age estimates."

These authors also reported high He/Ne ratios and suggested that some of the He was derived from a mantle source. Helium contained in liquid CO2 from the Caroline Well at Mount Gambier (Fig. 1) has similar 3He/4He ratios (3.0) and He/Ne ratios of >1370 those of air, clearly indicating a magmatic origin (Chivas et al., 1987). Since both Mount Gambier and Daylesford are within the Newer Volcanics Province, the volatiles at each location are most likely to have a similar source.\nMany of the springs in the Daylesford area have high 226Ra contents (up to 0.6 Bq/l) and 222Rn contents (up to 6660 Bq/l: Wishart and Wishart, 1990), which may have been derived from deeply weathered granites that are common through out the Lachlan Fold Belt (White et al., 1988). Chivas et al. (1983) reported 87Sr/86Sr ratios of water from unnamed springs at Daylesfords of 0.715–0.0718. These ratios are consistent with the Sr being derived from a mixture of the local Ordovician turbidites which, elsewhere in the Lachlan Fold Belt, have present day 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7626–0.7760 and high Sr contents (Gray, 1990) and the younger volcanic rocks that have lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7040–0.7058 (Irving and Green, 1976; Chivas et al., 1993). The majority of the other solutes in the spring water were also derived by water– rock interaction, primarily with the Ordovician rocks that dominate the region. The variation in chemistry (Fig. 4) is due to the waters that feed individual springs being confined to fractures and thus interacting with a different set of rocks along their flow paths. The elevated content of solutes in the spring waters is probably due to their high CO2 contents promoting vigorous reactions with the wallrocks at low temperatures (Weaver et al., submitted for publication)."

    "text": "Similar stable isotope systematics to those discussed here should be evident in cold CO2-bearing springs where the carbon has a significant mantle-derived component. Many thermal springs in volcanics areas are CO2-bearing. However, water–rock interaction at elevated temperature causes displacement of the waters\nto the right of the meteoric water line (Sheppard, 1986; Parry and Bowman, 1990). The situation at Daylesford where the vast majority waters lie to the left of the meteoric water line is a strong indication that elevated water–rock interaction has not occurred and that the spring system is confined to upper, cooler crustal levels. CO2 from springs in southeastern Spain have a similar range of d13C values to CO2 at Daylesford ( 8.1% to 3.8%; Cerón et al., 1998). Waters from most of those springs also lie to the left of the global meteoric water line and have a relatively wide range of d18O values ( 8.8% to 6.5%) with a relatively small range of d2H values of 40% to 45% (Cerón et al., 1998). Cerón et al. (1998) suggested that fluid flow in this region was at relatively low temperatures (up to 100–130 C), and this may be another example where the effects of low-temperature CO2 exsolution produces water with elevated d18O values. A single sample of water collected from CO2-bearing springs in Natal also lies to the left of the local meteoric water line for that region (Harris et al., 1997). Cold carbonated mineral springs in the Eifel region of Germany also contain mantle carbon and helium (Griesshaber et al., 1992).\nThere are several other occurrences of high-bicarbonate (up to 1400 mg/l HCO3 ) groundwater in southeastern Australia (e.g. in the Otway Basin, the Great Artesian Basin and the Bellarine Peninsula: Johns, 1968; Blake, 1989; Herczeg et al., 1991; Shugg, 1996). The carbon in these other high-bicarbonate waters probably has multiple origins (e.g. cation exchange and carbonate dissolution: Blake, 1989; Herczeg et al., 1991), and these occurrences may not represent similar fluid flow systems to the mineral springs system at Daylesford. However, as discussed above, CO2 in the Caroline well near Mount Gambier (Fig. 1) is probably mantle-derived (Chivas et al., 1987), and there are a few isolated, unstudied, carbonated mineral springs in the east of the Newer Volcanic Province (Fig. 1) that may also contain mantle-derived CO2. Clearly determining the sources of carbon in the currently unstudied carbonate waters would provide important information on the distribution of waning volcanic activity in the Newer Volcanics Province. If mantle carbon is present in these other spring waters, it may be derived from different centres of remnant igneous activity or be transported laterally from the region of igneous activity below Daylesford."

    "text": "The identification of mantle-derived CO2 in the Daylesford springs has significant implications for our understanding of regional geology in southeastern Australia. It has previously been assumed that volcanic activity in the Newer Volcanics Province decreased in age westwards and that the region around Daylesford had been inactive for several thousand years (e.g. Price et al., 1988; Nicholls et al., 1993). However, the data presented above suggest that there is still significant igneous activity at depth in the eastern part of this province and that the model of a westward migrating hot spot may be overly simplistic. The two main areas where mantle-derived CO2 has been located are at Daylesford and Mount Gambier (Fig. 1) suggesting that remnant igneous activity persist at these two locations. There are no documented occurrences of carbonated springs in the Newer Volcanics Province in between these two localities suggesting that the intervening region is volcanically inactive. The lack of young volcanic rocks at the surface in Daylesford suggests that volcanic activity in that area is restricted to deeper crustal levels.\nThe identification of the spring waters as palaeowaters is also significant for management of the resource. There is much local concern with identification and protection of recharge areas; however, the results of this study point to a long-lived deep flow system. Hence, any modern contamination of the springs is likely to occur due to mixing with shallow contaminated groundwater near their discharge sites. Several of the northern springs show evidence for mixing with shallow groundwater near their discharges (Fig. 7) and these are ones in which possible contamination might occur."

    "text": "The Lachlan Foldbelt rocks are Au-bearing, with Au mineralisation largely occurring during the Late Ordovician to Middle Devonian (e.g. Gray, 1997; Gray and Foster, 1998). It has largely been assumed that the distribution of Au relates entirely to geological processes in the Palaeozoic, and was not affected by later events. The present spring system is cold and would not efficiently transport metals such as Au. However, volcanic activity in the Newer\nVolcanic Province is waning and it is possible that previous spring systems that were active at Daylesford or elsewhere in the Newer Volcanic Province were hotter and redistributed Au in the crust. The mineral waters flow through deep fractures that have had the potential to host fluid flow over several million years. Hot springs in the North Island of New Zealand and the Northern Coast Ranges of California (USA) caused near-surface gold mineralisation due to boiling of Au-bearing fluids and mixing with shallow groundwater (e.g. Goldie, 1985; Peters, 1991). Historically, Au has been extracted from a range of vein and disseminated deposits throughout the Daylesford region whose origin is not well understood. Equally, the fossil fluid flow systems associated with the Newer Volcanics are not well documented. Identification of fossil fluid flow zones and the study of geochemical changes of rocks in those zones may determine whether recent remobilisation of metals has occurred."

    "text": "Mineral water from the Daylesford region is comprised of components from different sources. The water itself is predominantly locally recharged meteoric water that is several thousand years old. Other components (principally C and He) are mantlederived and associated with recent basaltic volcanic activity. These components were initially transported as a gas that mixed with deeply circulating meteoric water in a fractured aquifer system. Many of the other solutes originated from the surrounding rocks, with dissolution promoted by high CO2 contents of the circulating waters. The scale of variation reflects these multiple sources. Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen isotopes vary on a regional (tens to hundreds of kilometres) scale reflecting the uniform sources of the waters and gasses, whereas major ion chemistry varies on smaller (metres to hectometres) scales reflecting the local nature of water–rock interaction."

  "abstractText": "Mineral springs in the Victorian Central Highlands, Australia, have high CO2 contents and naturally effervesce. d C values of CO2 gas and dissolved inorganic carbon are 10.6% to 7.0% and 5.9% to 0.1%, respectively, with a net dC of 8% to 3%. The carbon in these waters was derived from a mantle source associated with local Pliocene to Recent basaltic Newer Volcanic Province rocks. Previously reported He/He (1.2–3.1 relative to air) and high He/Ne ratios are also consistent with the presence of magmatic volatiles. Silica contents imply that the waters were never heated above 130 C and that the system is not hydrothermal. The occurrence of carbonated mineral springs in a relatively small region of the Newer Volcanics Province where volcanic activity ceased several thousands of years ago may be due to the presence of late intrusions combined with deep circulation of water through deeply weathered and fractured Ordovician basement. A region of low seismic velocity under the Daylesford area potentially images those intrusions. Most spring waters have dO and dH values of 8% to 6% and 45% to 35%, respectively, and lie to the left of the local and global meteoric water lines. The anomalously low dO values results from CO2 exsolution at low temperatures which strongly partitions O into the gas. The lack of waters lying to the right of the local meteoric water line also implies that water–rock interaction at elevated temperatures did not occur. The dH values are lower than contemporary meteoric water, suggesting that the waters may have recharged under colder climate conditions several thousand years ago. The local Ordovician rocks are gold bearing. The present spring system is cold and would not efficiently transport Au. However, volcanic is waning and the spring systems at the time of volcanism may have been hotter and able to redistribute Au. D 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
