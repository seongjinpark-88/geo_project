    "text": "1326\nLacustrine strata of the Wudaoliang Group demonstrate that two vast lake complexes covered the central Tibetan Plateau during early Miocene time. The Wudaoliang Group, which is characterized by dolostone, limestone, and marl as thick as 310–350 m, lies horizontally or with a slight dip above Oligocene reddish-brown sandstone, and is covered by upper Miocene and Pliocene mudstone and sandstone. The extensive distribution of this group outlines interconnected lake basins of 5000–15,000 km2 or larger in the north-central Tibetan Plateau, such as the Wudaoliang, Beiluhe, Tuotuohe, Tongtianhe, and East Wenquan Basins, and lake basins 2000 km2 or larger in the southcentral plateau, such as the Ando, Naqu, Bangoin, Lunpola, and Shuanghu Basins. These lake basins, separated by mountain ranges and islands, were linked by water passages in early Miocene time, when they apparently formed a huge lake complex that covered as much as 100,000 km2 in the north-central Tibetan Plateau and another one >50,000 km2 in the south-central part of the plateau. Such immense lakes existed for several million years between ca. 23.5 and ca. 13.5 Ma after the Tibetan Plateau rose, and their interconnected basins defi ne the topography during early Miocene time. The fossils contained in these basins indicate a change from the warm, dry climate of the Oligocene\nto moderately cool and wet conditions at the beginning of the early Miocene, followed by progressive cooling and drying, which suggests continuous uplift during deposition of the Wudaoliang Group.\nKeywords: Wudaoliang Group, lacustrine strata, vast lakes, Miocene spores and pollen, paleoclimate, early Miocene, central Tibetan Plateau, Miocene topography."

    "text": "The striking features for the fi rst-time traveler across the north-central Tibetan Plateau are not majestic peaks but broad areas of gently rolling to almost fl at country with the high ranges mere wrinkles on the horizon. This is especially so for the high plateau between the Tangula and Kunlun Mountains. The headwaters of the great Yangtze River that cross the region are not cascading streams in canyons but shallow rivers held in by low banks in a gentle landscape, a landscape formed predominantly of a slightly dissected, nearly fl at depositional surface of lower Miocene lacustrine strata. These strata reveal a history of vast lakes in the region and provide control in unraveling its tectonic history.\nComplicated tectonic processes occurred in the Tibetan region after the collision of the Indian and Eurasian continents 50–45 Ma, resulting in northward subduction of the Indian continental plate beneath the Himalaya Mountains (Brown et al., 1996; Chen et al., 1996; Nelson et al., 1996) (Fig. 1 inset). Crustal shortening was dominant in the central Tibetan Plateau during\nthe Paleocene to Oligocene, when the Gangdese (Yin et al., 1994; Yin and Harrison, 2000) and North Lhasa thrust systems (Wu et al., 2004a) formed. Crustal extension then began in late Miocene time and caused faulting of the central Shuanghu and Yangbajain-Damxung grabens that began at ca. 13.5 Ma (Blisniuk et al., 2001) and 8 Ma (Pan and Kidd, 1992; Harrison et al., 1995), respectively. Much large-scale, strike-slip faulting also occurred in the Miocene; dextral strike-slip movement along the Jiali fault after 18 Ma (Lee et al., 2003; Armijo et al., 1989) and ductile shearing along the Red River fault started in the early Miocene (Tapponnier et al., 1986). Thus the Miocene was a time of transition from crustal shortening to extension and uplift of the Tibetan Plateau (Quade et al., 1989; Harrison et al., 1992; Blisniuk et al., 2001; Tapponnier et al., 2001; Spicer et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2007). This was accompanied by basalt eruptions in the Hohxil region (Deng, 1991; Turner et al., 1996; Ding et al., 2003) and granite emplacement in the Nyainqentanglha region (Liu et al., 2004). However, aspects of the Miocene history of the central Tibetan Plateau still remain poorly understood. The recent investigation of extensive Miocene lacustrine deposits makes an important contribution to revealing this history.\nA regional geological survey, together with detailed fi eld studies of quarries, trenches and boreholes, made for engineering studies along the Golmud-Lhasa Railway since 2001, not only have provided evidence for active faults and geological hazards along the rail line (Wu et al., 2004b, 2005) but also yielded new detailed data on Cenozoic stratigraphy, including the\nFor permission to copy, contact editing@geosociety.org © 2008 Geological Society of America\n†E-mail: pjbarosh@gis.net\nGSA Bulletin; September/October 2008; v. 120; no. 9/10; p. 1326–1337; doi: 10.1130/B26043.1; 8 fi gures; 3 tables; Data Repository item 2008080.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-pdf/120/9-10/1326/3400074/i0016-7606-120-9-1326.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nGeological Society of America Bulletin, September/October 2008 1327\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-pdf/120/9-10/1326/3400074/i0016-7606-120-9-1326.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\n1328 Geological Society of America Bulletin, September/October 2008\nEocene Fenghuoshan Group, the Oligocene Yaxicuo Group, and especially the lower Miocene Wudaoliang Group. The Wudaoliang Group was fi rst defi ned during reconnaissance mapping of the Wudaoliang and Tuotuohe areas in 1986–1989 (Geological Survey of the Qinghai Province, 1991a, 1991b) and then refi ned by stratigraphic studies in the Hohxil Basin (Wang et al., 2002). Prior to the railway work the presence of the Wudaoliang Group was usually missed in the region, as it is covered by up to several meters of late Pleistocene–Holocene sand and gravel, and in outcrops it appears similar to late Quaternary lake deposits after permafrost freezing and Quaternary erosion. An extensive survey on both sides of the Golmud-Lhasa Railway and the adjacent highway since 2004 has shown the lacustrine strata of the Wudaoliang Group to be widely distributed and to represent widespread early Miocene lake complexes (Fig. 1). The discovery that vast lakes covered much of the central Tibetan Plateau during early Miocene time clarifi es the late Cenozoic environment and uplift history of the Tibetan Plateau during the critical change from tectonic compression to extension. This paper describes the stratigraphy of the Wudaoliang Group, its age, adjacent topography, paleoclimate, and the great lake complexes this group represents."

    "text": "The lacustrine Wudaoliang Group (N 1wd or N 1 ) (see GSA Data Repository)1 is composed chiefl y of carbonate and sandy strata (Wang et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2003) (Fig. 2). However, the deposits change from predominantly carbonate in the north-central part of the plateau to carbonate, with progressively greater proportions of fi ne to coarse clastic material toward the southeast and northwest (Figs. 1 and 2). The southern basins contain a high proportion of clastic material as well. The Wudaoliang Group consists mainly of dolostone, limestone, and marl in the Wudaoliang and Beiluhe Basins (Fig. 3); sandy limestone, marl, mudstone, and sandstone in the Tuotuohe, Tongtianhe, and East Wenquan Basins (Liu et al., 2003); and marl, silty mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, and conglomerate in the Qumalai, Ando, Naqu, Lunpola, and Bangoin Basins (Figs. 1, 2, 4). The thickness of the group is ~310 m in the Wudaoliang and Tuotuohe Basins, ~350 m in the Beiluhe and Tongtianhe Basins, and <100 m in the East Wenquan, Naqu, Ando, Lunpola, and Bangoin Basins. The Wudaoliang Group is overlain unconformably by Pliocene mudstone and sandstone of the Bulong Formation (N 2b ), upper Miocene–lower Pliocene conglomerate and sandstone (N 1 3–N 2 1), or Quaternary sand and gravel (Q) (Figs. 2–4). These younger strata comprise fl uvial and alluvial deposits that were laid down near the edge of the basins, or deposits formed in shallow lakes constrained by normal faults (Geological Survey of Qinghai Province, 1991b; Tibet Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, 1993; Pan et al., 2004). Strata that generally occur unconformably below the Wudaoliang Group in the northern plateau are the reddish-brown sandstone, mudstone, marl, 1GSA Data Repository Item 2008080, data on Sporopollen assemblages of the upper Cenozoic strata, sample locations, location and position of lower Miocene strata, and ostracode assemblages of lower Miocene, is available at www.geosociety.org/pubs/ ft2008.htm.

In the Naqu, Lunpola, and Bangoin Basins the Wudaoliang Group is underlain by the Paleocene Niubao (E\n1n ) and\nEocene Dingqinhu (E 2d ) Formations (Fig. 2). Age-equivalent strata are present to the north in the Qaidam Basin, where deposition was more continuous (Fig. 2). The variation and breaks observed in Cenozoic deposition over time demonstrate periods of deformation, changing levels of tectonism, and distance from source, as well as climatic shifts, which are refl ected in their sporopollen assemblages discussed below.\nAge of the Wudaoliang Group\nAge constraints for the Fenghuoshan and Yaxicuo Groups, which underlie the Wudaoliang Group, come from fi eld relations, magnetostratigraphy, and radiometric age data. Magnetostratigraphic data from the Fenghuoshan and Yaxicuo Groups give 51–31 Ma and 31–30 Ma,\nrespectively (Liu et al., 2003). However, fi eld relations show that the Yaxicuo Group lies unconformably over the Fenghuoshan Group in the Fenghuoshan Mountains and adjacent areas (Geological Survey of Qinghai Province, 1991b; An et al., 2004), indicating a break in deposition between the two groups. In addition, a porphyritic granite that intrudes the Fenghuoshan Group, but lies below the surface beneath the Yaxicuo and Wudaoliang Groups, west of the highway in the southern Beiluhe Basin, gives K-Ar isotopic ages of 33–38 Ma (Geological Survey of Qinghai Province, 1991a; An et al., 2004). It is thus inferred that the Fenghuoshan Group formed at ca. 51–38 Ma in the Eocene, and deposition of the Yaxicuo Group began by ca. 31 Ma and ended at ca. 30 Ma in middle Oligocene time (Fig. 2).\nThe long period of crustal shortening and regional peneplanation that produced a relatively fl at erosional surface prior to deposition of the Wudaoliang Group (Fig. 2) requires that its base be several million years younger than the upper Yaxicuo Group (Wang et al., 2002). Magnetostratigraphic data from the Wudaoliang Group in the southern Tuotuohe Basin further indicate\nthat the basal section of the Wudaoliang Group formed at 23.5–21.8 Ma (Liu et al., 2005a). The marl and mudstone of the Group in the Shuanghu basin in the central plateau are cut by the normal fault bounding the basin (Pan et al., 2004). The initiation of this extensional faulting occurred at ca. 13.5 Ma, according to Ar-Ar dating of muscovite (Blisniuk et al., 2001), which suggests that the age of the Wudaoliang Group is older, at least in the Shuanghu Basin. The Wudaoliang Group contains the pollen Compositoipollenites, Chenopodipollis, Labitricolpites, Fupingpollenites, Ranunculacidites, and Caryophyllidites, which commonly occur in Miocene sediments, plus rare representative components of Eocene–Oligocene pollen, such as Operculumpollenites, Trilobapollis, and Sequoiapollenites (see Footnote 1).\nThe age of the strata overlying the Wudaoliang Group can be inferred from limited sporopollen assemblages. Gray sandy marl above this group in the Tongtianhe Basin contains Tubulifl oridites grandis Nagy, Persicarioipollis lusaticus Krutzsch, and Pterisispoites sp. (Appendix 1; see footnote 1), which are characteristic spores of the late Miocene–Pliocene (Song et al., 1999). Also, the three-toed horse Hipparion has been found in the Bulong Formation in the Naqu Basin. Hipparion is regarded as an index fossil for the late Miocene–Pliocene (Tibet Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, 1993). These fossils further constrain the Wudaoliang Group as being early Miocene in age.\nIn summary, fi eld relations, fossils, magnetostratigraphy, and isotopic ages all indicate that the lacustrine strata of the Wudaoliang Group formed in the early Miocene and extended possibly into the middle Miocene, with deposition most likely having begun at ca. 23.5 Ma and ending before 13.5 Ma.\nDEFORMATION AND ELEVATION\nThe Wudaoliang Group is much less deformed and of more uniform elevation than is apparent at fi rst. Permafrost distorts the bedding of the group near the surface at many places, confusing the attitude of the lacustrine strata, but detailed studies reveal that the beds are characterized by nearhorizontal or gentle primary dips (Figs. 4A–4G) (Appendix 3; see footnote 1). Dip angles of Wudaoliang strata are <20°, with 10°–15° being the most common (Fig. 5A) and describing broad, open synclines and anticlines in some outcrops (Figs. 4A, 4C, and 4E). The lacustrine strata appear horizontal on a regional scale, with broad folds (Fig. 4G) away from later faults and permafrost deformation. The upper surface of the group apparently constituted the major surface over broad areas of the central Tibetan Plateau\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-pdf/120/9-10/1326/3400074/i0016-7606-120-9-1326.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\n1330 Geological Society of America Bulletin, September/October 2008\nA B\nC D\nE F\nG\nN\nN N\nN N\nN N N\nN\nN1\nN\nN1 N1\nN N11\nN\nN\nJ\nQ 4\nQ 4\n1 1\n1 11\n1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1 1\n1\n1 1\n1 1\n1\n1 1\n1\n1\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n2-3\n3-\n3-\nFigure 4.

Thus, no evident crustal shortening has occurred since the formation of the Wudaoliang Group in the central Tibetan Plateau, although movement in adjacent highlands shed coarse debris over the margins of the group. By comparison, dips of the underlying Yaxicuo Group (E\n3yx ) are as much as\n30° in outcrops distant from later faults (Fig. 5B), and those of the Fenghuoshan Group are invariably >30° and commonly >40° in outcrops (Fig. 5C), which indicates that strong deformation and crustal shortening occurred after its formation and prior to Wudaoliang deposition.\nMiocene to present-day crustal shortening took place around the edges of the central plateau. Thrusting and folding occurred in the Himalaya, Nyainqentanglha, Altyn Tagh, Qilian, and the Gangdese Mountains, which surround the central Tibetan Plateau, in early Miocene time (Yin and Harrison, 2000). The Fenghuoshan Group was thrust over the Wudaoliang Group in the middle to late Miocene in the southern Kunlun Mountains, where dips of the Wudaoliang strata are invariably >30°–50° in thrust faults in the East Wenquan Basin. Also, crustal shortening of 15–20 mm/yr has continued in the Himalaya Mountains from the early Miocene (Yin and Harrison, 2000) to the present (Zhang et al., 2004). This deformation contrasts with the relatively undisturbed strata in the central plateau, with the exception of some thrust faults in the Fenghuoshan Mountains.\nOutcrops of lacustrine strata of the Wudaoliang Group in different basins of the central plateau near the Golmud-Lhasa Railway and Highway show a variation in elevation range (Fig. 6). However, if a broader, 200-kmwide corridor is considered, the elevations are found to be remarkably similar (Table 1). The amount of variation corresponds to the degree of erosion along Quaternary river systems that have cut into the uplifted Tibetan Plateau rather than deformation. This is particularly evident for the Yangtze River, whose headwaters form\nthe Tuotuohe-Tongtianhe system, which drains much of the central plateau (Fig. 7). The general outcrop elevations of the strata decrease from upstream in the west to downstream in the east along the present river systems.\nThe elevation ranges within a broad, 200-kmwide corridor along the Golmud-Lhasa Railway include many outcrops that were little affected by Quaternary erosion (Table 1). These outcrops more closely refl ect the pre-incision surface relief of the top of the Wudaoliang strata and limit the subsequent change owing to possible deformation. They also better refl ect the stratigraphic thickness of the Wudaoliang Group in each basin. The maximum, minimum, and average elevations of the lacustrine strata are similar among different basins north of the Tangula Mountains. At present the highest known elevation of the top of the group among these basins is 4800 m or slightly higher, with a difference of only 34 m (Table 1). This suggests that these major basins were covered by a single, vast interconnected lake complex over the north-central plateau during formation of the Wudaoliang strata. The tops of the strata in basins south of the Tangula Mountains are similar in elevation along the railway and appear to refl ect another immense lake complex as well. The original lake elevations of both complexes may have been fairly similar, on the basis of the present elevations of the top of the Wudaoliang Group.\nLAKE COMPLEXES OF THE CENTRAL TIBETAN PLATEAU\nThe stratigraphy and contained ostracode fauna (Appendices 2 and 4; see footnote 1) of the Wudaoliang Group demonstrate that this group formed in a lacustrine environment. The group in the Tuotuohe and Tongtianhe Basins contains Leucocythere sp. and Microlimnocythere sp., which indicate a typical lake environment, and Ilyocypris sp., which indicates an environment with gentle water fl ow. Ostracodes in the\nWudaoliang Group in the Wudaoliang and East Wenquan Basins include Eucypris sp., which lives in a variety of lake, swamp, and pond environments, and Candona sp., which is found in quiet-water environments. Most ostracode species found in the lower Miocene lacustrine deposits, such as Leucocythere sp., Candona sp., Cypricercus sp., Ilyocypris sp., Microlimnocythere sp., and Eucypris sp., lived in freshwater and brackish lakes (Li and Yu, 2002). Youshashania sp. lived in brackish to salty lakes in the Qaidam Basin (Liu et al., 2005b). Also, the species Candona mirabilis Schneider is demonstrated to have lived in cool lakes with a water temperature <10 °C (Li and Yu, 2002). The very large areas covered by these ostracodebearing lacustrine deposits indicate that vast lakes existed during the early Miocene.\nThe extent of the Miocene lake basins, as indicated by the distribution of the Wudaoliang Group, includes the Wudaoliang, Beiluhe, Tuotuohe, Tongtianhe, and East Wenquan Basins in the north-central plateau, and the Ando, Naqu, Bangoin, Lunpola, and Shuanghu Basins in the south-central plateau (Fig. 1). Lacustrine deposition of the Wudaoliang Group apparently was continuous in each lake basin without any evident interruption, indicating that the lakes had existed for a long period. The general depositional conditions were the same over broad areas, because the same or similar stratigraphic content and sequences are present in adjacent lake basins (Figs. 1–3).\nMost of these lake basins extend long distances in a northwest-southeast direction. The northern basins extend 200–300 km or more in length and are ~40–60 km in width, which gives total areas covered by the Wudaoliang Group in each lake basin between 8000 and 15,000 km2 (Fig. 1; Table 2). The smaller southern basins are 100–120 km long or longer, and 16–34 km wide, with the area covered by lacustrine deposits in each lake basin ranging between ~2000 and 4000 km2.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-pdf/120/9-10/1326/3400074/i0016-7606-120-9-1326.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\n1332 Geological Society of America Bulletin, September/October 2008\nThe original lakes would have extended over a larger area than that of the clearly preserved remnants of the Wudaoliang Group. The many areas covered by thin lacustrine strata of the Wudaoliang Group and the areas that underwent serious erosion are inferred from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) satellite images, geological maps, and fi eld studies (Fig. 1). ETM images are especially helpful in identifying areas of the Wudaoliang Group distant from the Golmud-Lhasa Railway. The image characteristics of the known lacustrine strata in the center of the basins can be used to identify strata at their margins (Fig. 1). These strata are characterized by horizontal to gentle dips, and, where removed by Quaternary erosion, their underlying surface shows as brownish yellow and fl at with a leaf-vein type of drainage pattern. Regional geological maps, at a scale of 1:200,000, also provide useful information for lacustrine strata of the Wudaoliang Group and the fl at surface below it (Geological Survey of Qinghai Province, 1991a and b).\nWater connections linking adjacent lake basins also were discovered. Channels west of Wudaoliang and Xijinwulan Lakes linked the\nWudaoliang and Beiluhe lake basins through the Hohxil Mountains. Passages west and southeast of Tuotuohe linked the Tuotuohe and Tongtianhe lake basins around the Kaixinling Range. The major basins, such as Wudaoliang, Beiluhe, Tuotuohe, Tongtianhe, and East Wenquan in the north-central plateau were united to create a huge lake, >100,000 km2 (Fig. 1). The major basins of Naqu, Ando, Lunpola, Bangoin, and Shuanghu to the south were also linked by channels to form another vast lake larger than 50,000 km2 (Fig. 1). Huge lakes also existed in the Qaidam Basin in the Miocene, as indicated by the distribution of lacustrine strata in the lower Youshashan and upper Gancaigou Formations (Figs. 1 and 2). However, no water connections were discovered between these three great lake complexes, which are separated by the Tangula and Kunlun Mountains. This is refl ected in differences in the lacustrine strata of the southcentral Tibetan Plateau, north-central Tibetan Plateau, and Qaidam Basin areas (Fig. 2).\nFacies changes exist as well within the Wudaoliang Group in the north-central plateau lake complex and refl ect local differences in environmental conditions around the lake and the varying amounts and types of sediment entering the lake. The Wudaoliang and Beiluhe Basins are characterized by dolostone, dolomitic limestone, limestone, and marl intercalated with clay-dominated mudstone, siltstone, and sandstone in the middle north-central plateau. These fresh- to brackish-water carbonate deposits seem to mark quiet deposition in the center of the huge lake, distant from clastic sources. More sand and clay evidently entered the Tuotuohe, Tongtianhe, and East Wenquan Basins, where the lacustrine strata are dominated by limestone, marl, and sandstone. The strata in the Qumalai, Zado, Zida, and other lake basins farther east and southeast, as well as some to the northwest, are dominated by marl, sandstone, and conglomerate and seem to have been more toward the margin of the lake complex where more and perhaps swifter rivers entered and commonly formed deltas. Most of these lakes were separated by much wider expanses of uplands that could more easily have contributed clastic debris that overwhelmed the carbonate content. The lake complexes on both sides of the Tangula Mountains extended farther west beyond the present study area (Fig. 1), where other facies\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-pdf/120/9-10/1326/3400074/i0016-7606-120-9-1326.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nGeological Society of America Bulletin, September/October 2008 1333\nchanges occur. The lake complex south of the Tangula Mountains does not have the concentration of carbonate sediments; the lacustrine strata are characterized by marl, clay-dominated mudstone, sandstone, and conglomerate. Many of these basins also abut an elevated hinterland.\nEARLY MIOCENE TOPOGRAPHY\nThe numerous widespread lake basins outline the contemporaneous intervening highlands and show much about the topography of the central Tibetan Plateau in the early Miocene and the degree that the present topography has been inherited. The marine conditions of the early Mesozoic across the central plateau were long gone when the Wudaoliang sediments were deposited in the basins between the developing Miocene topographic highs. The region, which had undergone deformation that tilted Oligocene strata and locally generated granite, was smoothed by erosion near the beginning of the Miocene and just prior to lake formation. Relatively stable conditions apparently prevailed over much of the region during the lakes’ existence, as the principal lake basins lack signifi cant amounts of coarse clastic material shed from the bordering uplands and ranges. These high areas trended northwest-southeast to eastwest between the basins and parallel to many of the present uplands. The extensive Pleistocene lakes of the western United States provide an analogy in both size and shape. The interconnected basins of both Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahontan that covered much of Utah and Nevada, respectively, outline the intervening ranges well (Russell, 1889; Gilbert, 1890). But the local relief may have been lower and similar to a larger scale, but much wetter, version of the Mojave Desert region of California, where small, worn-down ragged mountains are fl anked by very broad alluvial slopes that lead down to large playa lakes. At least the beginnings of the Tangula and Kunlun Mountains were present to form sig-\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-pdf/120/9-10/1326/3400074/i0016-7606-120-9-1326.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\n1334 Geological Society of America Bulletin, September/October 2008\nnifi cant drainage divides and to serve as sites for some volcanic activity (Fig. 1). The Nyainqentanglha Mountains were not present but rose later in the Miocene to reveal a middle Miocene granite core (Wu et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). The mountains were an area of underthrusting in the middle Miocene (Wu et al., 2007), but precursor movement here and along strike to the northeast in the early Miocene might account for the coarse debris contributed to the southern lake basins and the northeasterly trending eastern parts of the Naqu and Ando Basins. The later rise of the Nyainqentanglha Mountains and possible uplift to the northeast also may in part account for the basins of the southern lake complex being absent to the southeast and in some of the northeasterly trends. The fewer lakes and more clastic lacustrine strata found across the eastern part of the central plateau north of the Tangula Mountains suggest that a broad arch had extended northeastward through this region. The region of carbonate-rich strata to the northwest may have been a corresponding broad cross-swale.\nThe later deformation around the edges of the central plateau may have greatly modifi ed Miocene topography, but the faulting and rifting within the plateau has not changed the general pattern of basins and highlands. The immense lake in the relatively low Qaidam Basin has a longer history than those on the plateau (Fig. 2), and its southern edge, despite major faults, still provides an approximation of the edge of the Kunlun Mountains in the early Miocene. The greatest change in pattern has been due to Quaternary erosion that resulted from uplift of the plateau. The Tongtianhe-Tuotuohe river system is in the process of cutting into and destroying the old topography across the eastern part of the plateau, and other rivers have cut deep valleys southward from the Qaidam Basin (Fig. 7) and are beginning to tap the intermontane basins. The Miocene basins followed the structural framework of the plateau, whereas the new valleys commonly cut across it. In the region of interior\ndrainage to the west, however, more of the Miocene features are preserved. Many of the lake basins in the western interior plateau presently contain lakes in their lower elevations, although they are probably not remnants of the earlier lakes (Fig. 1). The lake complexes thus demonstrate that the pattern of uplands and basins was established by the early Miocene in the central Tibetan Plateau and only recently have started to change because of Quaternary erosion.\nAt present the Quaternary rivers are incising into the plateau from three sides. The Tongtianhe River, along with its tributary, the Tuotuohe River, form the headwaters of the Yangtze River, the greatest in China (Figs. 7 and 8). The Nujiang River and its upper tributary, the Naqu River, form another major river system fl owing out to the east. The Lhasa River originates in the Nyainqentanglha and Gangdese Mountains and forms a major tributary of the Yalu Zangbu River, which drains east and south into India as the Brahmaputra River. The Kunlun River is the headwaters of the Golmud River and one of the main rivers fl owing northward into the Qaidam Basin. The rivers west of 91°–92° E longitude on the plateau, such as the Zajia Zangbu River, are part of an interior drainage system, as are those fl owing into the Namco, Wulanwula, and Kusaihu Lakes. These stream systems have disturbed the early Miocene topography the least."

    "text": "The sporopollen assemblages found in the Wudaoliang strata provide a sampling of the vegetation that grew around the lakes and adjacent highlands, thus yielding information about the climate (Table 3; Appendices 1 and 2; see footnote 1). The types of fossil vegetation and the reconstructed plant communities can be matched with climates in which similar plants grow today. Furthermore, these data, combined with those from bounding strata, show how paleoenvironmental conditions evolved in the middle Tertiary and fi ll a critical gap in the climatic history of the Tibetan Plateau as it rose.\nFossils from the sandy marl and mudstone of the lower section of the lower Miocene Wudaoliang Group in the Tuotuohe and Beiluhe Basins in the north indicate vegetation dominated by needle-leaved, coniferous forest, where dark, needle-leaved trees form a high percentage of the taxa identifi ed, e.g., Picea (spruce) (~32%) and Abies (fi r) (~5%) in the northern Beiluhe Basin (Table 3), corresponding to a cool climate at a high elevation (Wu, 1980). By comparison, sandy marl from the upper section of the Oligo-\ncene Yaxicuo Group in the Tuotuohe Basin indicates a mixed vegetation consisting of deciduous broad-leaved trees (~33%) dominated by Betula (birch) and Quercus (oak) with herbs (~21%) dominated by Chenopodipollis (6.2%), Sparganiaceaepollenites (3.7%), Artemisiaepollenites (1.8%), and Graminiditew, including xerophilous herbs (14%); needle-leaved, coniferous trees form a lower percentage (~9%). These fossils correspond to a warm and dry climate and are in accord with the gypsum layers in the Wudaoliang Group. Spores of tropical-subtropical trees, such as Euphorbiacites, Rhoipites, Liquidambarpollenites, Cyrillaceaepollenites, Meliaceoidites, Sequoiapollenites, and Taxodiaceaepollenites, occur commonly in Oligocene strata but occur rarely in the early Miocene Wudaoliang Group (Table 3). Spores of hydrophytes (aquatic plants), such as Polypodiaceaesporites, occur commonly in both the Wudaoliang and Yaxicuo Groups, indicating lake vegetation.\nFossils in marl from the lower section of lower Miocene lacustrine strata in the southern Naqu Basin in the south also indicate a vegetation dominated by coniferous trees (~70%) with dark needle-leaved trees, Picea (spruce) (~18%) and Abies (fi r) (~3%) (Table 3), accompanied by hydrophytes (10%) dominated by Polypodiaceoisporites, and deciduous broad-leaved trees (~8%) dominated by Quercus (oak) and Juglans (walnut family). Mudstone overlying the marl at the same outcrop in the southern Naqu Basin contains a sporopollen assemblage that indicates a vegetation of deciduous broad-leaved trees (~24%) dominated by Quercus (oak) and Celtis (hackberry) (Table 3), coniferous trees (~28%) dominated by Pinus (pine) (~19%), Picea (spruce) (~3%), and Keteleeria (similar to fi r) (~3%), and herbs (~20%), dominated by Chenopodiaceae and Tricolpites, accompanied by spores of hydrophytes (~6%). Spores of subtropical plants such as Euphorbiacites and Meliaceoidites rarely occur in either the lower marl or the overlying mudstone. Such vegetation indicates a cooler, temperate climate at a higher elevation (Wu, 1980). By comparison, the earlier, Oligocene sporopollen assemblages from the Lunpola Basin to the west of Naqu are characterized by a variety of tropical-subtropical trees (15%–18%) such as Euphorbiacites, Rhoipites, Liquidambarpollenites, Cyrillaceaepollenites, Magnolipollenites, Meliaceoidites, Caryapollenites, Palmaepollenites, Rutaceoipollis, Myrtaceidites, Pterocaryapollenites, Platycaryapollenites, Ilexpollenites, and others, which are mixed with deciduous broad-leaved trees (15%–20%), coniferous trees (13%–30%), and herbs (Sun et al., 1984; Song et al., 1999), indicating a very warm and somewhat dry climate. Xerophilous herbs are abundant (31%) in\nTABLE 2.

The inferred climatic changes in the Tibetan Plateau lake deposits contrast with the global climate, which remained in a relatively stable, warm condition from the late Oligocene to the early to middle Miocene, as suggested by marine oxygen isotopes (Shackleton, 1984; Zachos et al., 2001).\nMiddle Miocene marl in the Wuyu Basin of the Gangdese Mountains, west of the Nyainqentanglha Mountains (Fig. 1), overlying volcanic rock of the Wuyu Group which is dated at 14–15 Ma (Spicer et al., 2003), show further change. These beds contain sporopollen assemblages that indicate vegetation dominated by coniferous trees (~47%), whereas deciduous broad-leaved trees have decreased (~17%), and xerophilous herbs have almost disappeared (Table 3). Coniferous trees consisted mainly of Picea (spruce) (~15%), Pinus (pine) (~10%), Abies (fi r) (9%), and Keteleeria (similar to fi r) (~5%); deciduous broad-leaved trees were dominated by Quercus (oak) (~15%). Herbs are characterized by Ranunculacidites (5.2%), Labitricolpites (4.5%), and Tricolpites (7.1%). Aquatic plants decreased by ~3%. Upper Miocene–lower Pliocene sandy marl overlying the Wudaoliang Group in the Tongtianhe Basin to the north contains a similar sporopollen assemblage (Appendix 3; see footnote 1). Such vegetation indicates a cool climate of a high elevation.\nLacustrine deposits formed in the late Pleistocene after glaciation in the Namco, Coer, and Basico Lakes and other lakes between the Gangdese and Tangula Mountains. These deposits contain abundant spores and pollen that indicate a mixed vegetation consisting of Artemisia (sage) (17%–48%), Pinus (pine) (25%–33%), and Betula (birch) (6%–15%), consistent with the data of Jiang and Robbins (2000) at the north edge of the plateau. Such vegetation demonstrates a cool, somewhat dry climate in the late Pleistocene. This climate was warmer, with an annual temperature ~5 °C higher than that of the late Quaternary (Wu et al., 2004c) and the present, in which vegetation is dominated by Artemisia and without broad-leaved trees owing to the fact that most of this region of the central plateau is now above the treeline.\nBased on the paleofl oral data presented herein, the climate of the central Tibetan Plateau has evolved signifi cantly from Oligocene to Pleistocene time. The climate changed from a very warm, relatively dry climate in the Oligocene with a mixed tropical-subtropical and a deciduous broadleaf-coniferous forest to cool, higher elevation conditions in early Miocene time with a forest dominated by coniferous trees. The climate continued to cool and the land to rise to form a coniferous and subordinate deciduous broadleaf forest in the late Miocene to early Pliocene. The climate was cooler still and drier in the late Pleistocene, with open woodlands of pine and oak and a sage understory. This eventually changed to the arid, very cold, treeless sage steppe region of today, with large areas underlain by permafrost. The climate change is marked fi rst by the decrease of tropical-subtropical plants, then by the decrease of broadleaf trees; the coniferous trees initially increased, then decreased, and fi nally disappeared as the sage increased. Spores of tropical-subtropical trees constitute 10%–13%, 3%–5%, and 0.5%, respectively, of fossil taxa from lower–middle Oligocene, upper Oligocene–lower Miocene, and middle Miocene strata in the Xining-Minhe Basin at the northeastern edge of the plateau (Sun et al., 1984), similar to observations in the central Tibetan Plateau (Table 3). By comparison, tropical-subtropical trees formed 23%, 10%–12%, and 15%, respectively, in middle– upper Oligocene, upper Miocene, and Pliocene strata in the Weihe Basin (Sun et al., 1980), which lie along a similar latitude as the Tuotuohe Basin east of the Tibetan Plateau. Spores of tropical-subtropical trees make up 15% of the assemblages in Pliocene strata near Beijing (Song et al., 1999), although this location is at a higher latitude. Tropical-subtropical plants almost disappeared in the central Tibetan Plateau after early Miocene time at localities now ~4500–4800 m in elevation. The present treeline is nearly 1,000 m lower than the elevation of the central Tibetan Plateau, and the upper elevation for these warm-weather plant assemblages is lower still (Wu, 1980). The sharp decrease of tropical-subtropical plants from Oligocene to early Miocene time indicates signifi cant uplift of the Tibetan Plateau during this time. The occurrence of abundant dark needle-leaved trees, such as Picea (spruce) and Abies (fi r), which presently live at elevations of ~2500 to ~4500 m in southern Tibet (Wu, 1980; Xu, 1981; Lu et al., 2004), indicates further uplift of the central Tibetan Plateau in early Miocene time before formation of the vast lakes. The rainfall apparently increased in early Miocene time to feed the lakes and then has decreased since. A lower evaporation rate also may have contributed to the establishment of the lakes. Climate changes since early Miocene time are due to some combination of global climate change, establishment or shift of the monsoon, and growth of the plateau and Himalaya Mountains, with the lakes perhaps drying when the mountains were high enough to provide a rain shadow. The global climate, as indicated by the marine oxygen isotope record, deteriorated in general during the Tertiary, but it improved during the early Miocene to a middle Miocene climatic optimum (Zachos et al., 2001). This suggests that the cooling trend indicated in the central Tibetan Plateau was due to uplift that countered the global warming."

    "heading": "CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION",
    "text": "Vast lake complexes represented by strata of the Wudaoliang Group covered much of the central Tibetan Plateau during early Miocene time. Deposition was characterized by fresh- to brackish-water carbonate deposits composed of dolostone, limestone, and marl over much of the extent of the Wudaoliang Group. The lake complex between the Kunlun and Tangula Mountains linked the Wudaoliang, Beiluhe, Tuotuohe, Tongtianhe, and East Wenquan Basins and is estimated to have been as large as 100,000 km2. The lakes formed at ca. 23.5 Ma, lasted several million years, and disappeared before 13.5 Ma. Another huge lake complex south of the Tangula Mountains linked the Ando, Naqu, Lunpola, Bangoin, and Shuanghu Basins and is estimated to have covered >50,000 km2. Strata deposited in these early Miocene lakes overlie the tilted Oligocene Yaxicuo Group but are largely undeformed. The top of the Wudaoliang Group constituted the major geomorphic surface of the central plateau before Quaternary erosion and extensional faulting. The horizontal bedding to gentle dips of the Wudaoliang Group preclude the possibility of signifi cant crustal shortening across the central plateau since early Miocene time, and the present relief of these lacustrine outcrops indicates the degree of Quaternary erosion and lowering of the ground surface, especially along river systems formed after the rise of the plateau. It is reasonable to infer that the central plateau underwent uplift before the formation of the early Miocene lake complexes, as the amount of tropical and subtropical plant fossils decreased and the percentage of dark needle-leaved trees increased drastically in the lake strata since early Miocene time in comparison with that indicated during deposition of the underlying Oligocene strata and lower Miocene strata to the east, at the northeast edge of the plateau. The plateau apparently continued to rise as the lacustrine strata were deposited and afterward lifted to ~1000 m above the treeline by the Pleistocene to form a region with extensive permafrost."

  "abstractText": "Lacustrine strata of the Wudaoliang Group demonstrate that two vast lake complexes covered the central Tibetan Plateau during early Miocene time. The Wudaoliang Group, which is characterized by dolostone, limestone, and marl as thick as 310–350 m, lies horizontally or with a slight dip above Oligocene reddish-brown sandstone, and is covered by upper Miocene and Pliocene mudstone and sandstone. The extensive distribution of this group outlines interconnected lake basins of 5000–15,000 km2 or larger in the north-central Tibetan Plateau, such as the Wudaoliang, Beiluhe, Tuotuohe, Tongtianhe, and East Wenquan Basins, and lake basins 2000 km2 or larger in the southcentral plateau, such as the Ando, Naqu, Bangoin, Lunpola, and Shuanghu Basins. These lake basins, separated by mountain ranges and islands, were linked by water passages in early Miocene time, when they apparently formed a huge lake complex that covered as much as 100,000 km2 in the north-central Tibetan Plateau and another one >50,000 km2 in the south-central part of the plateau. Such immense lakes existed for several million years between ca. 23.5 and ca. 13.5 Ma after the Tibetan Plateau rose, and their interconnected basins defi ne the topography during early Miocene time. The fossils contained in these basins indicate a change from the warm, dry climate of the Oligocene to moderately cool and wet conditions at the beginning of the early Miocene, followed by progressive cooling and drying, which suggests continuous uplift during deposition of the Wudaoliang Group."
