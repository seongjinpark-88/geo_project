Currently, there is uncertainty in the size, nature, and timing of the Deccan eruptions, all of which lead to uncertainty in the likely climatic effects. Modeling the impact of Deccan Traps eruption on climate is complicated by the discrepancy between the lifetimes of emitted gasses and the length of the total eruptive sequence. Though SO2 emissions can have important climatic effects, the short atmospheric lifetimes of SO2 and resulting aerosols mean these effects are unlikely to be recognized in the proxy record. Here we focus on the CO2 emissions, and attempt to match paleotemperature proxy records with plausible emissions scenarios. We also test the relevance for climate of the number, length, and arrangement (e.g., increasing or decreasing size) of individual eruptions aswell as the total duration and size of the overall eruptive sequence. We find that the number and length of individual eruptions are largely unimportant to CO2-based based climate effects, but that the pattern and duration of eruption have measureable effects. Unsurprisingly, the total emitted CO2 from the Deccan Traps exerts a strong control on climatic effects, and better constraints on the volume of emitted gas are necessary. At the high end of the uncertainty range, the Deccan Traps eruptions are capable of generating warming events recorded in the proxy record, but rates of silicate weathering above modern rates are necessary to draw down CO2 in accordance with those records.\n© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The end-Cretaceous mass extinction is generally thought to have been the consequence of a large bolide impact (Schulte et al., 2010) that effectively defines the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary (Molina et al., 2006). However, climatic impacts from Deccan Traps flood volcanism have also been implicated as a primary or aggravating contributor to the mass extinction (Tobin et al., 2012; Keller, 2014; Tobin et al., 2014;Wilson, 2014). The possible temporal correspondence between theDeccan Traps and extinction has been the primary driver of this hypothesis, and similar correlations between large igneous provinces andmass extinctions have been noted throughout the Phanerozoic (Courtillot and Renne, 2003; Bond and Wignall, 2014). The largest mass extinctions are global events, and to have global biotic effects, flood volcanism must alter atmospheric chemistry and/or climate in ways that spread globally as well. The primary means through which volcanism alters atmospheric chemistry is the release of carbon dioxide\nological Sciences, 201 7th Ave,\n.edu (C.M. Bitz),\n(CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), though the release of halogensmay also generate acid rain, potentially globally (Font et al., 2014).\nCarbon dioxide and SO2 are generally thought to have competing climatic effects — CO2 warms the planet through increased absorption of Earth's radiated heat (increased greenhouse effect), while SO2 forms aerosols that block incoming solar radiation, cooling the planet (Bond andWignall, 2014). Because the atmospheric lifetimes of these constituents are very different: the cooling effects from volcanism essentially end a few years after the eruption, and may be reduced in flood basalt eruptions when compared with more explosive eruptions (Schmidt et al., 2016), while the warming effects of CO2 can persist well beyond (thousands of years) the initial release of the gas. In many studies of the potential atmospheric impact of flood volcanic volatile release, it is assumed that cooling from SO2-derived volcanic aerosols is the more likely candidate to have biological consequences, as even an individual flow is capable of generating substantial global cooling (Self et al., 2014; Self et al., 2015).While these cooling events could be the primary means through which flood basalts affect global biota, the duration of these cooling events makes it highly unlikely that they would ever have been detectable and confirmed in the stratigraphic record. It is also possible that SO2 leads to substantial acidification and related biotic effects, but Schmidt et al. (2016) suggest this is unlikely.\nThe longer duration of CO2-related warming is likely detectable in the fossil record. Paleotemperature data from periods of flood basalt eruption are mixed, but it appears that most large continental flood basalts are associated with global warming (Bond andWignall, 2014). For the end Cretaceous mass extinction, a warming event during the last ~350 kyr (though see discussion of timeframe below) of the Cretaceous has often been linked with the Deccan Traps volcanism (Li and Keller, 1998; MacLeod et al., 2005; Tobin et al., 2012). The CO2 release from an individual eruption is almost certainly too small to have a significant impact on atmospheric CO2 levels, and this observation, combined with the spacing between eruptions, has been used to argue that volcanic CO2 from flood basalts cannot generate substantial warming (Self et al., 2006). Modeling of modern emission scenarios suggest that 20– 25% of a suddenly emitted CO2 perturbation will persist for over 10 kyr (Archer et al., 2009), a long enough period that CO2 could potentially accumulate in the atmosphere between eruptions in a flood basalt eruptive period where average spacing is likely on the order of 1 kyr (Self et al., 2014)."

    "heading": "2. Deccan Traps and warming",
    "text": "Below we investigate whether the size and episodic nature of Deccan CO2 emissions is sufficient to generate warming that has been observed using paleotemperature proxies. Many authors have attributed warming near the K–Pg boundary to Deccan Traps CO2 emissions based on plausible contemporaneity (e.g. Li and Keller, 1998; Barrera and Savin, 1999; Wilf et al., 2003; Tobin et al., 2012), but there are few ways to prove a causal connection. Most of the Deccan Traps emissions are emitted duringmagnetochron C29R, an interval lasting roughly 700 kyr spanning the K–Pg boundary (Ogg, 2012 and references therein). Recent and ongoing research into the timing of Deccan emissions could potentially rule out a causal connection (Renne et al., 2015; Richards et al., 2015), but temporal correspondence will always be insufficient in proving causality. At present, it is unlikely that definitive proof of causality can be obtained from the geologic record, but climate modeling based on constraints of eruptive size and duration can provide an additional test of a Deccan — warming link.\nPrevious attempts at modeling warming from Deccan Traps flood volcanism have produced mixed results. Caldeira and Rampino (1990a) found little to nomeasurable impact from possible Deccan volcanism, though they also found potential warming below 2 °C for what they considered unreasonably high levels of CO2 emissions (Caldeira and Rampino, 1990b). Dessert et al. (2001) modeled a more substantial warming, up to 4 °C, but they used CO2 emissions that are likely too high (see discussion below). Recent attempts to model the combined contributions of SO2 and CO2 emissions suggest that reduced warming from individual eruptionswould have suppressedweathering and CO2 drawdown, increasing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and consequentwarming (Mussard et al., 2014). Unlike the previousmodels, their model simulated individual eruptions, rather thanmodeling a single increased rate of emissions for the entire period of Deccan eruptions. However, due to the complexity of their hybrid model, they did not test how varying eruptive duration, length and pattern affected their results. We employ a simpler model that allows a more complete testing of these parameters, but focused exclusively on CO2 emissions."

    "text": "We use a modified version of the GEOCYC model (Archer et al., 2009), which originally was based on previous GEOCARBmodels developed by Berner (Berner, 1994; Berner and Kothavala, 2001). This model iterates over a user-defined time step and tracks carbon through globally-averaged atmospheric and oceanic reservoirs, with the oceanic reservoir partitioned into dissolved inorganic carbon species (CO2 (aq), HCO3−, and CO32−). Carbon is removed from the atmosphere through silicate and carbonate weathering and added through volcanic emissions.\nCarbon is removed from the ocean through carbonate burial and added through weathering, with gas exchange moving carbon between the ocean and atmospheric reservoirs. Atmospheric CO2 concentration (or level) is converted to atmospheric temperature using a climate sensitivity set to 3 °C per doubling of CO2, likely on the low end of Cretaceous climate sensitivity estimates (Breecker et al., 2010; Royer, 2010). The atmosphere temperature equilibrates instantly with CO2 level, while the ocean temperature has a 1 kyr relaxation rate with respect to the atmosphere. The ocean temperature primarily affects gas solubility and exchange. As this model is functionally similar to its predecessors, we refrain from a detailed description here, but provide a commented MATLAB script in the Supplemental material for others to use. Archer et al. (2009) demonstrated that this model compares favorably in terms of CO2 drawdown with other more complex models in modern simulations, particularly over geologically relevant time scales. GEOCYC was designed to test modern day climate scenarios, and used pre-industrial conditions as a baseline, as did the model of Mussard et al. (2014).\n3.1. Model modifications\nSeveral modifications to GEOCYC were made to match more closely with Cretaceous climatic conditions prior to the eruption of the Deccan Traps and are detailed in the MATLAB climate code (see Supplemental material). We altered the percentage of exposed land area, mean continental latitude, and a parameter relating global river runoff to changes in global mean temperature. The sensitivity of the model to these parameters is outlined below (Section 4.1). The solar constant was reduced by a small fraction (~0.4% — Feulner, 2012) to replicate the slightly weaker sun at 66 Ma, but the effect was negligible. In each model run, we prescribe a CO2 emission scenario representative of the Deccan trap eruptions, added to a background CO2 level. Because CO2 drawdown and temperature scale non-linearly with CO2 level, the climate response depends on both the background CO2 level and the Decan trap CO2 emissions scenario. It is important to initiate our Deccan emission tests at background CO2 levels (and hence temperatures) similar to those present at the end of the Cretaceous.We tuned background CO2 levels to 450 ppm (Beerling et al., 2002) by altering background CO2 emission rates to a higher value, a plausible change given the faster seafloor spreading rates in the Cretaceous (Seton et al., 2009). The model was allowed to stabilize at these new conditions during a “spin-up” period, resulting in a global air temperature of 17 °C prior to the simulated eruption of Deccan Traps. The time step in the original model was 50 years, and here we reduced it to 10 years, a necessary change to test shorter duration eruptions. Nonetheless, using MATLAB, the model completes a run of over one million simulation years in under a minute on a modern desktop computer. Tests were completed for shorter time steps, 1 year or less, with no discernible difference in results."

    "heading": "3.2. Eruption scenarios",
    "text": "Previous studies, with the exception of Mussard et al. (2014), have generally assumed continuous eruption of Deccan basalts over the entire eruptive period. In our case we simulate eruptions by increasing the rates of CO2 emission above background for discrete time periods that can vary in their size, pattern, duration, and spacing (see Section 4.2 below), allowing us to test whether the episodic nature of these eruptions is important to their climatic effects. We can alter these eruptive parameters independently of each other and the total CO2 emissions. The major areas of uncertainty in determining the total CO2 emitted are the volatile content percentage of the lavas and the original total volume of eruptive material (see Section 4.2 below). We input total CO2 emission into the model that are calculated from lava quantity and volatile percentage, or use previously calculated estimates of emitted CO2 (see below)."

    "heading": "4. Modeling results",
    "text": "We tested several variables that alter the pattern of CO2 emissions (Fig. 1), which we define here for greater clarity. The eruptive sequence is the total period over which CO2 is emitted from Deccan eruptions, including hiatuses. An eruption is a single, mostly continuous, eruptive event leading to a single lava flow. We can alter the length (in years) of single eruption, and/or the duration (in years) of the eruptive sequence. Additionally the number, spacing, and pattern (see Section 4.2 below) of eruptions can also be altered, as can the total CO2 emitted over the whole eruptive sequence. Given current understanding of the Deccan Traps, we believe the best estimates for the various parameters tested above are: a total amount of emitted CO2 of 4.14 × 1017 mol, based on lava volume estimates from Jay and Widdowson (2008) and volatile release from Self et al. (2006); total eruptive sequence of 400 kyr based on constraint of Deccan emissions to C29R and early C29N (Schoene et al., 2015) and a conservative (long) estimate C29R duration of 710 kyr (Ogg, 2012); number of eruptions — 250; length of individual eruptions — 20 years (Self et al., 2015); and a pattern of equal sized eruptions throughout the eruptive sequence, given little other knowledge of eruption patterns at present. For most results displayed below, we chose to use a much reduced number of eruptions (20) and increased length of eruption (5 kyr), as they facilitate visual interpretation of output data, andwe later demonstrate (Section 4.2) that an increased eruption length and decreased number of eruptions are inconsequential to our final results. We continued to use the likely values for total emitted CO2, eruptive sequence duration and flow pattern for all the model tests in Section 4, unless the variable in question was being tested.\n4.1. Significant Cretaceous adjustments\nHere we examine the model sensitivity to modifications that mimic Cretaceous geographic and environmental conditions (i.e., those not associated with specific Deccan volcanism related changes outlined in Section 4.2). Note that in some of these scenarios wemodified the background CO2 emission rate to generate similar initial conditions prior to a simulated eruption."

    "heading": "4.1.1. Mean latitude of continents",
    "text": "The location of subaerially exposed continental landmasses will affect weathering rates, as weathering rates at tropical latitudes are higher thannear the poles. A greater area of continents near the equator will result in globally higher weathering rates and faster drawdown of CO2. The modern mean latitude used for the standard GEOCYC model is 30°N due to the current bias of landmass in the northern hemisphere, though the model does not differentiate between a northern or\nsouthern hemisphere bias. The land was more evenly distributed hemispherically in the Late Cretaceous, based on image analysis of equal area projections from Blakey (2012), so we test the sensitivity to the mean-latitude. For our sensitivity tests we use a scenario of CO2 emissions from a series of 250 individual Deccan-like eruptions of equal magnitude. Because the response to such an eruption scenario is sensitive to the initial CO2 atmospheric concentration, the background CO2 emission rate was varied (respectively, mean latitude = 30°, 20°, 10°, 0°; moles of CO2/year = 7.43 × 1012, 8.03 × 1012, 8.41 × 1012, 8.55 × 1012) so that each model run equilibrated to the same atmospheric concentration prior to the initiation of the eruptive sequence. However, with modification of the background emissions, the response to the eruption scenario had little dependence onmean latitude (Fig. 2), though the effect acts in the expected direction."

    "heading": "4.1.2. Total land area",
    "text": "A portion of the CO2 exiting the atmosphere comes from chemical weathering of exposed land area, and a greater extent of exposed land area will result in an increased rate of CO2 draw down. Due to higher sea levels during the Cretaceous, less land area was exposed than modern conditions. Using the same image analysis described above we found that Late Cretaceous land area was 95% of today. The total land area exposed above sea level in this model is expressed as multiplier on the modern land area. Like continental mean latitude, the model is sensitive to this value in the spin-up stage (respectively, land fraction= 0.95, 1.00, 1.05; moles of CO2/year = 8.41 × 1012, 8.87 × 1012, 9.33 × 1012), but not significantly so in the simulation of Deccan-like eruption. Less exposed land area slowsweathering rates, so this modification leads to increased CO2 buildup and higher temperatures when lowered, but again by minor amounts (Fig. 3). This change acts in the opposite direction to themean latitude adjustment (above) with a similar (though not identical) magnitude."

    "heading": "4.1.3. River runoff",
    "text": "The volume of river runoff affects the strength of chemical weathering and effectiveness of transport of weathering products to the ocean. The response of river runoff to changes in temperature is non-linear, and is modeled by Berner and Kothavala (2001) as a bimodal process. When there are substantial continental ice sheets present, river runoff changes more quickly with changes in temperature due to formation andmelting of glacial ice, while in periodswithoutmajor glaciation, the change is more subdued. A coefficient describing this relationship was modified from a modern icehouse value (0.045) to a hothouse condition (0.025). This change leads to increased atmosphere pCO2 values relative to icehouse conditions, all else being equal.\nHowever, from the same initial pCO2 level, the magnitude of the impact on volcanic emission simulations is fairly minor (Fig. 4)."

    "heading": "4.1.4. Background CO2 levels",
    "text": "As described above, we tuned the background CO2 level prior to the eruptions to 450 ppm to correspond with proxy records. Various authors have proposed a range of values for CO2 from as low as 375 (Royer, 2003) to 540 ppm (Beerling et al., 2009) with possible error bounds extending from 340 to 785 ppm. Though partially based on the previous work, other recent time series of CO2 proxies have accepted similar values for the K–Pg timeperiod,with values between 400 and 500 ppm and uncertainties ranging from 350 to 800 ppm (Breecker et al., 2010; Beerling and Royer, 2011). The non-linearity of the temperature — CO2 relationship results in larger increases in temperature for\nthe same Deccan simulation at lower starting CO2 values, though the affect is moderated by the long duration of emission combined with the increased ability of a less saturated ocean to absorb CO2 when initial pCO2 is lower (Fig. 5)."

    "heading": "4.2. CO2 emission scenario sensitivity",
    "text": "CO2 emission from flood basalt volcanism is commonly disregarded as inconsequential due to the relatively small size of each individual eruptions and their episodic nature, which could allow CO2 levels to return to background before the subsequent eruption (Self et al., 2006). We tested the importance of total emitted CO2 (related directly to total lava volume emitted), duration of total eruption sequence, number of individual eruptions, the length of individual eruptions, and the pattern of eruption size. We find the primary controls on climate response are ultimately the total CO2 emissions and duration of the entire eruptive sequence, but we explore each variable independently below. Starting conditions are as described above, except when testing the specific variable."

We tested a range of possibilities, from very low (20) to the upper high end of possibilities (1000). Fig. 6 shows the model results for these variations, with every other value held constant. The results show clearly that number of eruptions is not important on a long time scale, at the end of the eruptive sequence every scenario results in effectively identical CO2 levels and air temperatures. Limiting the number of eruptions generates short term spikes in CO2 as a result of compressing the total CO2 emissions to a shorter total emissions period."

    "heading": "4.2.2. Length of eruptions",
    "text": "The length of individual eruptions in the Deccan Traps, and other flood basalt provinces, is poorly understood. Self et al. (2014) suggest that individual eruptions are likely extruded on the order of decades, but whether or not substantial outgassing occurs throughout this whole eruption is unclear. Given these uncertainties we tested a wide range of flow length possibilities, from one year to 100 years. For testing flow lengths less than ten years themodel time step (set to 10 years for most tests), must be reduced to the shortest flow length desired (in this case 1 year). The length of each flowwas varied, assuming all eruptions were of equal size with continuous outgassing throughout each eruption. Individual flow length has a negligible effect on CO2 levels or temperatures in the long (100s of kyr) or short (100s or years) term (Fig. 7). For given eruptions of identical size but differing lengths, there is only a fairly small difference between the peak CO2 level and air temperature, and the differences are quickly erased between eruptions."

    "heading": "4.2.3. Pattern of eruption size",
    "text": "At present it is unclear how continuous the eruptive sequence of the Deccan Trapswas. Richards et al. (2015) suggest that themajority of the eruptive volume was erupted towards the end of the Deccan Traps sequence (most similar to EP3 below), but they acknowledge that further age dating is necessary. Renne et al. (2015) further suggest that most of the Deccan sequencewas erupted in the Danian as a consequence of the Chixculub impact. Their geochronology suggests that much of the Deccan Traps was erupted post-K–Pg, but their estimates rely on interpolation to estimate age of many of the large volume flows, and the results should probably be treated as tentative pending further testing of the Ambenali and Poladpur flows. With a lack of constraining information, we tested four different emissions patterns (Fig. 1): (EP1) periodic but equal sized eruptions; (EP2) periodic eruptions that ramp down from an initial peak; (EP3) periodic eruptions that ramp up to a final peak; (EP4) periodic eruptions that ramp up and back down. The results of\nthis test (Fig. 8) may initially be counterintuitive; the highest CO2 level and temperature occur with more of the gas emitted later in the eruptive sequence, rather than near the beginning. EP3, has the highest peaks, while EP2, has the lowest, with EP1 and EP4 being fairly similar. While notable, these differences are likely too small to have substantial climatic or biological effects."

Recent work (Renne et al., 2015; Richards et al., 2015; Schoene et al., 2015) suggest that a vastmajority of the eruptive sequence is constrained within C29R, limiting the eruption to approximately 730 kyr, though some of the upper Mahabelshwar flows are C29N. Further constraint using the K–Pg boundary is possible, but the placement of this boundary within the Deccan sequence is contested (Renne et al., 2015; Schoene et al., 2015). Additionally, the durationof C29Rhas recently been proposed as substantially shorter, approximately 345 kyr (Sprain et al., 2015), which would compress the time available for Deccan Traps eruptions. Given the uncertainty, we tested a range of possibilities for eruptive sequence duration, from 250 kyr to 850 kyr (Fig. 9). Eruptive sequence duration does affect peak CO2 level and air temperature, though the effect is non-linear.We tested the climate effects of eruptive sequence durationwhile holding total CO2 emission constant by reducing the spacing between equal size and length eruptions. Amore than threefold (250 to 850 kyr) increase in duration results in only a 40% reduction in temperature change (+1.6 ° C to +0.95 °C)."

    "heading": "4.2.5. Total CO2",
    "text": "Estimates for total CO2 released from the Deccan Traps eruptive sequence are primarily determined by estimations of the original total volume of lava. The volatile content of the lava is also important, but most studies have adopted the estimates from Self et al. (2006) of 0.5% byweight volatile release, or 14 Tg of CO2 released per 1 km3 of basalt, allowing for estimation of total CO2 release based on basalt volume. Total eruptive volumes are commonly reconstructed as between 0.7 × 106 km3 and 2.5 × 106 km3 (Self et al., 2006; Chenet et al., 2009; Bond and Wignall, 2014) though values as high as 4 × 106 km3 have been reported (Courtillot and Renne, 2003). We tested a variety of total emitted CO2 amounts over almost a full order of magnitude ranging from 2.4 × 1017 to 1.8 × 1018 mol of CO2. We tested each value under the following parameters: total eruptive sequence — 400 kyr; number of eruptions — 20; length of individual eruptions — 5 kyr;\nperiodic, equal-sized eruptions (EP1 — above). The length and number of individual eruptions are unrealistic, but were chosen for visual clarity, since testing of these parameters reveals that they are largely unimportant. Table 1 summarizes the various CO2 emission estimates, sources, and peak temperatures and pCO2 (measured immediately after final eruption). Unsurprisingly, the amount of CO2 emitted is the primary control on peak temperature and CO2 levels (Fig. 10), and thus the most important to understand for potential biological implications, though eruptive duration and pattern provide additional important constraints. The published range of volume estimates (Table 1) could be compatible with temperature increases from less than 1 °C up to 6 °C."

    "heading": "5. Plausibility of Deccan Traps — warming link",
    "text": "It is clear that the primary variables controlling the magnitude of any Deccan associated warming are the total CO2 emitted and the duration and pattern of the eruptive sequence. Fig. 11 shows the model result using 4.14 × 1017 mol of CO2 and an eruptive duration of 400 kyr, which are likely the best available estimates from the literature (see Section 4.2). In this scenario peak temperatures rise 1.5 °C above background after 400 kyr and remain at least 0.5 °C above initial conditions for more than 800 kyr after the eruptive sequence ceases. For the upper range of plausible total CO2 emission estimates, it appears that measurable global warming is possible due to Deccan Traps volcanism. The magnitude of this response does vary if we modify the climate sensitivity used in this model (3 °C per CO2 doubling), but the changes in peak temperature at different climate sensitivities are very close (though not exact) to the values expected by the proportional differences in climate sensitivity (Fig. 12), which allows other model results above and below to be approximated for other climate sensitivities."

    "text": "A global 1.5 °C increase in temperatures is sufficiently large to leave an identifiable signal in most locations with most paleotemperature proxies, and polar amplification (Holland and Bitz, 2003) would lead to high-latitude temperature change of roughly double the magnitude of the global average change. Awarming of (3–6 °C) has been identified in the Cretaceous portion of C29R, though in most reconstructions temperatures return to background levels before the K–Pg boundary (Li and Keller, 1998; Barrera and Savin, 1999; Wilf et al., 2003). Many records have gaps at the K–Pg boundary because they are derived from ocean cores with insufficient foraminifera abundance in the earliest Paleogene for δ18O analysis. A high-latitude continuous molluscan δ18O temperature record across the K–Pg boundary (Tobin et al., 2012) showed a single warming event crossing the K–Pg boundary, though the data could plausibly be interpreted as separate pre- andpost- boundary pulses. Another record from the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes, found cooling over the Cretaceous C29R interval (Tobin et al., 2014).\nWe attempted to match some of the paleoclimate estimates by adjusting the CO2 emission parameters within the bounds discussed above. The warming event recorded by Tobin et al. (2012) had a peak magnitude of +7 °C at a paleolatitude of 62°S (roughly equivalent to +3.5 °C global average) and duration of 800 kyr before return to near background temperatures (within 0.5 °C), though this period would be revised to ~400 kyr if new C29R durations of Sprain et al. (2015) are used. This magnitude of global warming can be achieved with total CO2 emissions towards the high end of published estimates, between 7.5 and 8.0 × 1017 mol, for eruptive sequence durations between about 100–600 kyr. However, the warming duration of Tobin et al. (2012) is shorter than the persistence of elevated temperature (N0.5 °C above background) in all model runswith the standard parameters used to control CO2 draw down."

    "heading": "5.2. Enhanced silicate weathering",
    "text": "In order for the model to match any of the proxy records of near K– Pg warming, it is necessary for CO2 to be drawn down at a faster rate during and/or after the eruptive sequence than previous studies using the GEOCARB based model. Given the creation of large areas of basalt in subtropical latitudes, it is likely that silicate weathering rates increased during and after the Deccan Traps eruptive sequence, increasing CO2 drawdown rates over this period. Dessert et al. (2001) find that weathering of the Deccan Traps basalt province is responsible for 5% ofmodern day global silicateweathering, and it is reasonable to propose that this contribution was higher shortly after the eruptive sequence.\nWe modified the model to allow increased rates of silicate weathering during and after the eruption to see if these conditions resulted in temperature changes that more closely match proxy records. This modification was the simple inclusion of a multiplying factor to the equation governing the rate of CO2 drawdown from silicate weathering. A full discussion of the factors controlling the CO2– weathering relationship in this model is found in Berner and Kothavala (2001) and references therein. We found a good fit to the magnitude of paleotemperature change from Tobin et al. (2012) with a total emission of 10 x 1017 mol of CO2 over 350 kyr and the EP3 eruption pattern. We increased the strength of silicateweathering by 5% for 1050 kyr from the start of the eruption to replicate the increasedweathering of the Deccan Traps, and were able to achieve a 3.3 °C warming at peak that was reduced to 0.5 °C over an 800 kyr period starting 100 kyr after the\ninitiation of the eruptions (Fig. 13 — purple line), a reasonable correspondence with Tobin et al. (2012) given polar amplification. For the potentially constrained timeline implied by the C29R durations from Sprain et al. (2015), wewould need to induce a global 3–3.5 °Cwarming at peak that is reduced to 0.5 °C over a ~400 kyr period. This response was achieved under the same eruption scenarios as above, but with the eruptive sequence duration restricted to 200 kyr, and silicate weathering intensity increased by13% (Fig. 13— green line). This period is also comparable to the warming duration found by Li and Keller (1998), data which are also plotted in Fig. 12.\nBoth of the enhanced weathering scenarios assume that weathering rates could not increase from syn-eruptive conditions into the post eruptive sequence, and if we remove this restriction it becomes easier to match paleotemperature records. Fig. 13 (yellow line) shows results when eruptive sequence duration is expanded to 400 kyr, and total CO2 emissions of 8.0 × 1017 mol, but silicate weathering is increased (20%) only during the 300 kyr following the eruption. A warming event of 2.5–3 °C can be generated that lasts about 500 kyr. This artificial modification allows CO2 to accumulate during the eruption and then be drawn down quickly post eruption, which appears necessary to fully match proxy records. This scenario is somewhat unrealistic, both in terms of the magnitude of warming and the timing of onset for increased weathering.\nThese comparisons indicate that the Deccan Traps volcanism is a potential candidate for causingwarming around the K–Pg boundary, given\nthe published estimates of total CO2 emissions. The main discrepancy between proxies and themodel may not be the magnitude of warming, but in the rate of return to a pre-eruption climate, which appears to occur faster than the model can simulate without artificial alteration of weathering rates. There may be complexity in this process that is not well simulated with this simple model. Better constraints on the total amount, duration, and patterns of CO2 release will allow us to better test this hypothesis, as there are many proposed Deccan emission scenarios that are incapable of generating the paleotemperature patterns observed. If the Deccan eruptions did not create the warming pulse at K–Pg boundary though, another candidate must be identified."

    "text": "The results presented above add to the literature exploring possible links between flood basalt volcanism andmass extinction, thoughmuch work remains to be completed. Previous modeling attempts have\ntreated Deccan volcanism as a single ongoing eruption (Caldeira and Rampino, 1990a; Caldeira and Rampino, 1990b), and while our results suggest that this is a reasonable approach, there are additional complexities in the timing and pattern of eruptions that contribute to the overall climate response. Additionally, we model more recent estimates of emitted CO2, which are larger than many of the volumes considered by Caldeira and Rampino. Our attempts to match proxy data indicating a roughly 3 °C global temperature increase during this period show a plausible correspondence in terms of volume and timing, but require CO2 emissions near the larger end of published estimates in combination with increased weathering rates. A 3 °C warming over several 100 kyr may be sufficient to contribute to the K–Pg mass extinction, though probably not as a direct kill mechanism. Rather, if warming does contribute to the mass extinction in most locations it is likely to do so through some form of “press-pulse” mechanism, in which warming stresses ecosystems,which then respondmore catastrophically to the Chicxulub impactor (Arens and West, 2008; Mitchell et al.,\nta from Tobin et al. (2012) has been shifted to match baselines with the modeled global s of polar amplification (see text). Temperature data from Li and Keller (1998) has also re recent estimates of the length of the Cretaceous portion of magnetochron C29R. Gray in et al. (2012) data: total emitted CO2 — 1 × 1018 mol, emitted using the EP3 pattern, nd for another 700 kyr post eruption. Green line — fit to short duration of Tobin et al. mol, emitted using the EP3 pattern, eruptive duration - 200 kyr. Silicate weathering was fit to Tobin et al. (2012) temperature data with enhanced silicate weathering (+20%) 3 pattern, eruptive duration — 400 kyr.\n2012; Arens et al., 2014). It is also possible that sudden short-term cooling from SO2 emissions is the primary contribution of Deccan eruptions to the biological catastrophe (Bond and Wignall, 2014; Mussard et al., 2014) though we do not address these effects in our model. A variety of studies (Tobin et al., 2012; Archibald, 2014; Keller, 2014; Tobin et al., 2014; Wilson, 2014; Wilson et al., 2014) suggest that there is destabilization of biotic communities over the Cretaceous portion of C29R, but at present a clear causal linkwith either short-term cooling or longtermwarming has not been established. It is possible that the warming pulse near the K–Pg boundary could be Deccan-related, but entirely coincidental to the extinction.\nDespite assertions of a consensus (Schulte et al., 2010), there is still vigorous debate over the potential contribution of Deccan Traps volcanism to the end Cretaceous mass extinction (Archibald et al., 2010; Courtillot and Fluteau, 2010; Keller et al., 2010). Recent geochronological work (Renne et al., 2015; Richards et al., 2015) suggests that themajority of the Deccan sequence was erupted after the K–Pg boundary, which would render the traps an unlikely candidate to contribute to the extinction; however further age constraints in the middle of the sequence are necessary. For the Deccan Traps to have contributed to the extinction they most likely did so through a combination of SO2 driven cooling or CO2 driven warming, but better understanding of the volcanic province is necessary to determinewhether either or both of these factors are capable of biologically problematic climate change. Both Schmidt et al. (2016) and Mussard et al. (2014) demonstrate that significant cooling events driven by the Deccan Traps are possible. Here we demonstrate that CO2 release is sufficient to drive substantial warming, and that the total amount, pattern, and duration of CO2 emissions are the most important controls on the rate and magnitude of warming. Given published estimates of these values, the Deccan Traps are plausibly large enough to drive the warming observed in paleoclimate proxies, though the match with paleoclimate proxies required increased rates of weathering. We hope to revisit this model in the future as new estimates of size, timing, and pattern of the Deccan Traps eruptive sequence are generated."

  "abstractText": "Article history: Received 26 January 2016 Received in revised form 12 May 2016 Accepted 25 May 2016 Available online 27 May 2016 Warming events observed in paleotemperature proxy records within 500 kyr of the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary have often been attributed to atmospheric CO2 increases due to Deccan Traps flood volcanism. Currently, there is uncertainty in the size, nature, and timing of the Deccan eruptions, all of which lead to uncertainty in the likely climatic effects. Modeling the impact of Deccan Traps eruption on climate is complicated by the discrepancy between the lifetimes of emitted gasses and the length of the total eruptive sequence. Though SO2 emissions can have important climatic effects, the short atmospheric lifetimes of SO2 and resulting aerosols mean these effects are unlikely to be recognized in the proxy record. Here we focus on the CO2 emissions, and attempt to match paleotemperature proxy records with plausible emissions scenarios. We also test the relevance for climate of the number, length, and arrangement (e.g., increasing or decreasing size) of individual eruptions aswell as the total duration and size of the overall eruptive sequence. We find that the number and length of individual eruptions are largely unimportant to CO2-based based climate effects, but that the pattern and duration of eruption have measureable effects. Unsurprisingly, the total emitted CO2 from the Deccan Traps exerts a strong control on climatic effects, and better constraints on the volume of emitted gas are necessary. At the high end of the uncertainty range, the Deccan Traps eruptions are capable of generating warming events recorded in the proxy record, but rates of silicate weathering above modern rates are necessary to draw down CO2 in accordance with those records. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
