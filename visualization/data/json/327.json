    "text": "The Early Ordovician was characterized by a warm climate, whereas a cooler climate is inferred for much of the Late Ordovician, when high-latitude ice caps developed on Gondwana (Brenchley et al., 1994). The shift to icehouse conditions represents one of the most dramatic climatic changes in the early Paleozoic and is refl ected in a major faunal extinction event near the end of the Ordovician (cf. Trotter et al., 2008). Some have suggested that continental ice sheets might have formed already in the early Late Ordovician (Pope and Read, 1998; Saltzmann and Young, 2005), although the onset and magnitude of this polar glaciation have remained uncertain.\nIn late Sandbian–early Katian time, the North American Midcontinent was covered by a shallow tropical sea, which was bordered by the Transcontinental arch toward the northwest and separated from the Iapetus Ocean by the emerging Taconic Mountains to the southeast. The northwestern Decorah-Galena shelf was separated from the Lexington platform in the southeast by the Sebree trough (Kolata et al., 2001). The paleolatitude of this tropical sea was between 10° and 30° S (Witzke, 1990). In the early Late Ordovician a succession of carbonates and shales was deposited in Minnesota that is interpreted to refl ect an overall transgression and submergence of the Transcontinental arch. In Kentucky, the Lexington Limestone unconformably overlies the Tyrone Formation and is overlain by the limestones and shales of the Point Pleasant and Kope Formations. Wide-\nspread K-bentonites, two of which (the Deicke and the Millbrig) record some of the largest volcanic ash eruptions during the Phanerozoic, provide excellent marker horizons in the late Sandbian stratigraphic interval (Kolata et al., 1996).\nWe studied the oxygen isotope composition of conodonts from Minnesota (Webers, 1966) and Kentucky in order to reconstruct the paleoclimatic history of this critical time interval, and to explore the relationship between volcanic eruptions, enhanced organic carbon burial as indicated by the GICE (Guttenberg δ13C excursion) carbon isotope excursion, and climate evolution."

    "text": "The stratigraphic variation in δ18O of conodont apatite is signifi cant, with values fl uctuating between 18.0‰ and 20.6‰ VSMOW (Vienna standard mean ocean water; see the GSA Data Repository1 for methods, location, and biostratigraphic correlation of studied sections and oxygen isotope data). δ18O values of conodonts from Minnesota and Missouri immediately below the Deicke K-bentonite are between 18.1‰ and 19.1‰ VSMOW (Herrmann et al., 2005). Above the Deicke, mean δ18O values of conodonts from Minnesota rise rapidly to 20.1‰ VSMOW (7-point running mean). Conodonts from the overlying Carimona Member show values of ~20‰ VSMOW, followed by a decrease to mean values of ~19‰\nVSMOW in the Decorah Shale. The lowest mean values in the upper Dunleith Formation are ~18.7‰ VSMOW. In the overlying Dubuque Formation, δ18O values increase again to 19.8‰ VSMOW. In Kentucky, δ18O values in the upper Tyrone Formation, the lower Lexington Limestone, and the upper Kope Formation are comparable to those of coeval strata in Minnesota (Fig. 1). However, δ18O values from the Point Pleasant and lower Kope Formations are ~0.5‰ lower than those from the broadly coeval upper Cummingsville Member of the Dunleith Formation in Minnesota. The Kope δ18O values are consistent with those reported by MacLeod and Sweet (2007).\nOXYGEN ISOTOPES OF CONODONTS AS PROXY FOR SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE\nThe oxygen isotope composition of biogenic apatite is dependent on temperature during the precipitation of apatite and δ18O of ambient seawater. Late Ordovician conodont associations have been interpreted to characterize different depth-related biofacies, which represented nearshore, shallow-water, offshore, and deeper water environments (Sweet and Bergström, 1984). To test the dependence of δ18O on the life habitat of individual conodont taxa, we analyzed several taxa separately (Table 1). No systematic differences in δ18O were found for species interpreted to have lived in deeper or shallower waters, suggesting that all analyzed taxa lived in waters with comparable temperatures. Most important, since several taxa (e.g., Belodina compressa, Phragmodus cognitus) are interpreted to have been typical shallowwater dwellers, the good correspondence of the δ18O values suggests that all studied taxa lived in the upper water column and recorded sea-surface water temperatures (SST).\nFreshwater runoff as well as evaporation in surface waters may have infl uenced the oxygen isotope composition of biogenic apatite. For example, Holmden et al. (1998) and Panchuk et al. (2005) suggested that the eastern Laurentian sea was composed of at least three water masses (aquafacies), potentially characterized by different temperature and/or salinity. Kolata et al. (2001) proposed that, beginning in the latest Katian, cool and phosphatic-rich waters upwelled onto on the Galena and Lexington platforms, resulting in the deposition of temperate-water carbonates, especially in the vicinity\neology, April 2010; v. 38; no. 4; p. 327–330; doi: 10.1130/G30577.1; 2 fi gures; 1 table; Data Repository item 2010087. © 2010 Geological Society of America.

This time interval was characterized by intense volcanism, as shown by the prominent Deicke, Millbrig, and other K-bentonite beds. A prominent carbon isotope excursion (Guttenberg δ13C excursion, GICE) postdates the Millbrig volcanic eruptions, and has been interpreted to refl ect a drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climatic cooling. The oxygen isotope record in conodont apatite contradicts this earlier interpretation. An increase in δ18O of 1.5‰ (Vienna standard mean ocean water) just above the Deicke K-bentonite suggests an abrupt and short-lived cooling that possibly initiated a fi rst short-term glacial episode well before the major Hirnantian glaciation. The decrease in δ18O immediately after the mega-eruptions indicates warming before the GICE, and no cooling is shown in the GICE interval. The coincidence of the Deicke mega-eruption with a cooling event suggests that this major volcanic event had a profound effect on Late Ordovician (late Mohawkian) climate.\n1GSA Data Repository item 2010087, methods, location, and biostratigraphic correlation of studied sections and oxygen isotope data, is available online at www.geosociety.org/pubs/ft2010.htm, or on request from editing@geosociety.org or Documents Secretary, GSA, P.O.

However, mean δ18O values of post-Millbrig conodonts from Kentucky are on average 0.5‰ lower than time-equivalent conodonts from Minnesota, indicating slightly warmer SSTs (2 °C) and/or lower salinities in Kentucky. The overall comparable δ18O values suggest that salinities and SSTs on the Galena and Lexington platforms were not signifi cantly different.\nThe very diverse shelly faunas (Sloan, 1987) as well as conodonts of the Carimona Member indicate normal marine salinities. Assuming constant and normal marine salinity and a seawater δ18O value of −1‰ VSMOW for the icefree Middle Ordovician greenhouse interval, the average difference of ~1.5‰ between samples below and above the Deicke K-bentonite translates into cooling of at least 6 °C, with average temperatures decreasing from 28 to 21 °C (Fig. 2). The rapid decline to values around 19‰ VSMOW at the very top of the Carimona Member represents warming of SSTs to 26 °C. During deposition of the Galena Group, mean SSTs fl uctuated around 26 °C, but decreased to 22 °C during the time of deposition of the Dubuque Formation (Fig. 2).\nThe calculated cooling of ~6 °C during the latest Sandbian seems relatively large for lowlatitude surface waters, and mean SSTs of 21 °C are relatively cold for tropical epicontinental seas distant from the shelf edge. As a consequence, global climatic cooling in combination with build-up of high-latitude ice caps may be considered a more plausible explanation for the 1.5‰ shift in conodont apatite δ18O. The waxing and waning of ice masses is expected to coincide with glacioeustatic changes in sea level. The Carimona Member is interpreted to have been deposited during a minor sea-level rise, contradicting the formation of continental ice caps (Kolata et al., 1998; Witzke and Bunker, 1996). However, it is not clear whether this relative sea-level rise was eustatic in origin or was due to enhanced tectonic subsidence as a consequence of the Taconic orogeny (Holland and Patzkowsky, 1996). A major sea-level rise is documented at the Turinian-Chatfi eldian boundary (Kolata et al., 1998) parallel to the rapid decrease in the oxygen isotope ratios and the inferred melting of the ice masses.\nVOLCANISM AND LATE ORDOVICIAN CLIMATIC COOLING\nA change in the oceanic circulation pattern caused by the Taconic foreland basin development (Holland and Patzkowsky, 1996), invasion of cooler waters at the southern margin of Laurentia (Kolata et al., 2001; Railsback et al., 1990), or enhanced upwelling (Pope and Steffen, 2003; Patzkowsky et al., 1997), have been proposed to be linked with cooling in the Late Ordovician.

However, the prominent GICE δ13C excursion clearly postdates the cooling event between the Deicke and Millbrig K-bentonites, and hence the latter cooling event is likely unrelated to the GICE.\nIt is interesting that the onset of the cooling immediately followed the eruption of the Deicke K-bentonite (Fig. 2). The early Late Ordovician was a time of intensifi ed volcanic activity (Huff et al., 1992), as shown by the many K-bentonites present in northern Europe and eastern North America. The most important and widespread ash beds are the late Turinian Deicke and the early Chatfi eldian Millbrig K-bentonites in Laurentia, and the Kinnekulle K-bentonite in Baltoscandia (Huff, 2008). Both the Kinnekulle and Millbrig ash beds represent multiple events, whereas the Deicke K-bentonite appears to be the product of a single major eruption, the ashes of which cover an area of >1.5 × 106 km2 (Kolata et al., 1996). It was one of the largest single volcanic ash eruptions in the Phanerozoic.\nThe most consistent isotopic ages are 454.5 ± 5 Ma for the Deicke and 453.1 ± 1.3 Ma for the Millbrig K-bentonite (Tucker and McKerrow, 1995), indicating a duration of 1.4 Ma of the Carimona Member. However, given the standard deviations, the ages of the two volcanic events overlap. The net sedimentation rate of the Galena Group has been estimated at ~21 m/ Ma (Chetel et al., 2005), suggesting a duration of ~86 ka for the deposition of the 1.8-m-thick Carimona Member. Based on this approxima-\ntion, we assume a time span of ~100 ka for the cold, and potentially fi rst glacial, interval in the early Late Ordovician.\nA climatic impact by volcanism has been observed for several historic and prehistoric eruptions (Sigurdsson, 1990). The Plinian eruptions of Krakatau (1883), Tambora (1815), and Pinatubo (1991) apparently caused climate cooling during a few years; a maximum 1.6 °C cooling after the Tambora eruption was calculated (Jolley and Widdowson, 2005, their table 2). The magnitude of cooling strongly depends on the latitude of the volcano, mass of erupted materials, height of the eruption column, magma composition, and its sulfur content (Sigurdsson, 1990). The climate is affected by the volcanic greenhouse gas CO2, but the volume added to the atmosphere during an eruption is small compared with the huge size of the atmospheric reservoir of this gas (Sigurdsson, 1990). Silicate dust particles darken the Earth and may have a strong local effect, but this is short lived due to the rapid fallout of the solid components. Sulfur, which is ejected as SO2 or H2S and oxidized to SO4\n2–, is the most effective temperature-changing agent. In the troposphere, SO4\n2– is rapidly removed by precipitation, but in the stratosphere, the half-life of the aerosols may be >1 yr. The aerosols absorb solar radiation and thus increase albedo, resulting in warming of the stratosphere and cooling of the Earth surface.\nUsually silica-poor melts contain higher sulfur contents (to >1000 ppm) than silica-rich melts (to <10 ppm). Estimates of the sulfur contents in the Deicke, Millbrig, and Kinnekulle K-bentonites show averages of 380 ppm SO2 (Kolata et al., 1996), twice the concentration reported for ashes of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Even the largest recorded historical eruptions are almost two orders of magnitude\nsmaller with respect to sulfur emissions than the prehistoric Toba mega-eruptions (Zielinski, 2000), which occurred 71–73 ka ago in Sumatra and may have produced 1 × 1015 to 1 × 1016 g H2SO4 (Rampino and Self, 1982). Sulfur analyses of the GISP2 (Greenland Ice Sheet Project Two) ice core indicate that high concentrations of H2SO4 existed in the stratosphere for >7 yr with a maximum load of 2–4 × 1015 g (Zielinski, 2000). The Toba eruption may have caused an annual global cooling of 3–5 °C with a possible summer cooling of >10 °C (Rampino and Self, 1982). A volcanic event as large as the Toba eruption is interpreted to be able to trigger a longer lasting cooling episode if supported by positive feedback mechanisms.\nThe Late Ordovician Deicke eruption was one of the greatest single volcanic ash fall events in the Phanerozoic, and the estimated SO2 emission was probably high enough to result in signifi cantly enhanced albedo and global climatic cooling. Multiple positive feedbacks, such as the formation of sea ice, could have further intensifi ed albedo. Weathering of freshly deposited volcanic glasses might have acted as another positive feedback in lowering atmospheric pCO2. Intensifi ed weathering is supported by the strontium isotope record (Shields et al., 2003), with a major change in 87Sr/86Sr documented from the Middle to Late Ordovician transition. 87Sr/86Sr values average 0.7088 during time slices 3a to 4c (Webby et al., 2004) and decrease to 0.7079 in time slice 5bc (Fig. 2). One-third of this 87Sr/86Sr shift occurs in the P. undatus conodont biozone (Fig. 2), which is broadly equivalent to the positive excursion in δ18O of conodont apatite. This rapid decrease is interpreted among other factors to have been the result of high rates of volcanic weathering (Shields et al., 2003; Young et al., 2009).\n5d\n5c\n5b\n5a\nMaysvillian\nEdenian\nChatfieldian\nTurinianM oh\naw ki\nan nait anni cni\nC W hi te ro ck .

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "The onset of the positive oxygen isotope excursion coincides with the Deicke volcanic eruption. Maximum δ18O values refl ecting coldest SSTs in the late Sandbian are recorded between the Deicke and Millbrig eruptions. This observation contradicts earlier studies of these rocks suggesting that the deposition of the shallow-water carbonates occurred during warm climatic conditions, which were followed by climatic cooling and upwelling during the GICE event. The correlation of the positive oxygen isotope excursion and the Deicke volcanic eruption may be interpreted as indicating that climate cooling was initiated by the emission of large amounts of SO2. Enhanced albedo and positive-feedback mechanisms could have resulted in global climate cooling and potentially in the formation of high-latitude ice sheets well before the Hirnantian glaciation in the latest Ordovician. Such a short-lived glacial episode might have been the fi rst glacial interval of a longerterm Late Ordovician–Early Silurian icehouse."

  "abstractText": "Oxygen isotopes measured on Late Ordovician conodonts from Minnesota and Kentucky (United States) were studied to reconstruct the paleotemperature history during late Sandbian to Katian (Mohawkian–Cincinnatian) time. This time interval was characterized by intense volcanism, as shown by the prominent Deicke, Millbrig, and other K-bentonite beds. A prominent carbon isotope excursion (Guttenberg δ13C excursion, GICE) postdates the Millbrig volcanic eruptions, and has been interpreted to refl ect a drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide and climatic cooling. The oxygen isotope record in conodont apatite contradicts this earlier interpretation. An increase in δ18O of 1.5‰ (Vienna standard mean ocean water) just above the Deicke K-bentonite suggests an abrupt and short-lived cooling that possibly initiated a fi rst short-term glacial episode well before the major Hirnantian glaciation. The decrease in δ18O immediately after the mega-eruptions indicates warming before the GICE, and no cooling is shown in the GICE interval. The coincidence of the Deicke mega-eruption with a cooling event suggests that this major volcanic event had a profound effect on Late Ordovician (late Mohawkian) climate. 1GSA Data Repository item 2010087, methods, location, and biostratigraphic correlation of studied sections and oxygen isotope data, is available online at www.geosociety.org/pubs/ft2010.htm, or on request from editing@geosociety.org or Documents Secretary, GSA, P.O.

However, mean δ18O values of post-Millbrig conodonts from Kentucky are on average 0.5‰ lower than time-equivalent conodonts from Minnesota, indicating slightly warmer SSTs (2 °C) and/or lower salinities in Kentucky. The overall comparable δ18O values suggest that salinities and SSTs on the Galena and Lexington platforms were not signifi cantly different. The very diverse shelly faunas (Sloan, 1987) as well as conodonts of the Carimona Member indicate normal marine salinities. Assuming constant and normal marine salinity and a seawater δ18O value of −1‰ VSMOW for the icefree Middle Ordovician greenhouse interval, the average difference of ~1.5‰ between samples below and above the Deicke K-bentonite translates into cooling of at least 6 °C, with average temperatures decreasing from 28 to 21 °C (Fig. 2). The rapid decline to values around 19‰ VSMOW at the very top of the Carimona Member represents warming of SSTs to 26 °C. During deposition of the Galena Group, mean SSTs fl uctuated around 26 °C, but decreased to 22 °C during the time of deposition of the Dubuque Formation (Fig. 2). The calculated cooling of ~6 °C during the latest Sandbian seems relatively large for lowlatitude surface waters, and mean SSTs of 21 °C are relatively cold for tropical epicontinental seas distant from the shelf edge. As a consequence, global climatic cooling in combination with build-up of high-latitude ice caps may be considered a more plausible explanation for the 1.5‰ shift in conodont apatite δ18O. The waxing and waning of ice masses is expected to coincide with glacioeustatic changes in sea level. The Carimona Member is interpreted to have been deposited during a minor sea-level rise, contradicting the formation of continental ice caps (Kolata et al., 1998; Witzke and Bunker, 1996). However, it is not clear whether this relative sea-level rise was eustatic in origin or was due to enhanced tectonic subsidence as a consequence of the Taconic orogeny (Holland and Patzkowsky, 1996). A major sea-level rise is documented at the Turinian-Chatfi eldian boundary (Kolata et al., 1998) parallel to the rapid decrease in the oxygen isotope ratios and the inferred melting of the ice masses. VOLCANISM AND LATE ORDOVICIAN CLIMATIC COOLING A change in the oceanic circulation pattern caused by the Taconic foreland basin development (Holland and Patzkowsky, 1996), invasion of cooler waters at the southern margin of Laurentia (Kolata et al., 2001; Railsback et al., 1990), or enhanced upwelling (Pope and Steffen, 2003; Patzkowsky et al., 1997), have been proposed to be linked with cooling in the Late Ordovician.
