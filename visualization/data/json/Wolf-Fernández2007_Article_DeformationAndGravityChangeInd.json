Introduction\nDETLEF WOLF1,2 and JOSÉ FERNÁNDEZ3\nThe workshop on Deformation and Gravity Change: Indicators of Isostasy, Tectonics, Volcanism and Climate Change took place at the Casa de los Volcanes on Lanzarote, Spain, during March 1–4, 2005 (see Fig. 1). It was jointly organized and supported by the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, the Spanish Council for Scientific Research and the Cabildo Insular de Lanzarote. From an organizational point of view, the workshop also served as the first meeting of the members the IAG Working Group ICCT2 on Dynamic Theories of Deformation and Gravity Fields existing since late 2003, but was open to all ‘‘external’’ colleagues interested in its topic.\nFurthermore, it continued a tradition established by a series of preceding workshops organized under the auspices of the IAG and devoted to the themes ‘‘Models of Temporal Variations of the Gravity Field’’ (Walferdange, Luxembourg, March 17–19, 1997 and Potsdam, Germany, November 23–25, 1998) and ‘‘Dynamic Theories of Deformation and Gravity Fields’’ (Sopron, Hungary, February 19–23, 2001 and Lanzarote, Spain, February 18–21, 2003).\nThe common subject of these workshops reflects the major developments in geodynamics during the last decade, when temporal variations of the deformation and gravity fields recorded by the geodetic measuring techniques and reflecting isostatic, tectonic or volcanic processes in the Earth’s interior as well as hydrologic or oceanographic processes on its surface have gained ever increasing importance. On the one hand, this development is the consequence of the introduction of novel and highly precise measuring techniques as a prerequisite for monitoring these variations.\n1 GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam, Department 1, Geodesy and Remote Sensing, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.

The workshop held on Lanzarote during March 1–4 and the resulting articles collected in this special issue reflect this duality of the recent evolution: Whereas the preceding workshops had focussed on theoretical developments, equal weight has been given this time to the two aspects of our current understanding of geodynamics.\nWe would like to thank the Consejeria de Ciencia y Tecnologı́a of the Cabildo Insular de Lanzarote, the Lanzarote Laboratory for Geodynamics (CSIC-UCM), the staff of the Casa de los Volcanes—in particular, its director Joaquin Naverán as well as Orlando Hernández and Jaime Arranz—and Cristina Bernal of the Timanfaya National Park administration for their support during the workshop.\nUseful suggestions by Renata Dmowska during the preparation of this topical issue are appreciated.
