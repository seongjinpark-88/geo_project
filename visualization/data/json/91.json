  "abstractText": "AmTlWCT: The modal composition of ondesitlc sand and sandstone is not only a function of source-area dimate and transport processes typically considered for nonvoleanic sediment but is also strongly controlled by volcanic fragmentation and pyroclastic-tronsport processes. Most volcanidnstic sediment deposited penecantemporoneonsly with active volcanism is not epicinstic, and therefore its composition is not dependent on climate. Crystal-rich andesite sand cannot simply be regarded as the product of weathering in a humid climate. In fact, there is no relationship between precipitation and the ratio of crystals to rock fragments. Fluvial-transport abrasion demonstrably generates cerystal-fieh sand only in the case of porphyritic glassy roek fragments that are not durable during transport; holocrystalline pyroclnstie fragments apparently do not disintegrate during transport to yield crystal-rich sand. Many sond-size primary volcanic deposits are crystal-rich as a result of eruptive processes that physically fractionate particles of different sizes and densities. Reworldng of these deposits results in crystal-rich sand that is not a product of weathering or Wansport abrasion. The abundance of unaltered green hornblende is one measure of the importance of pyroclastic material in a volcanic sand because this mineral is not found in lava flows. Interpretation of volcuniclnstic sandstone requires consideration of volcanic processes not typically considered by sedimentolngists.",
