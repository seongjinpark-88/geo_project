    "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are remnants of signifi cant geodynamic events in Earth history. LIPs are characterized by their vast size (typically millions of square kilometers) and relatively rapid emplacement (~1–3 m.y. for the main magma volume; Bryan and Ernst 2008). A precise temporal control by high-precision geochronological data is essential to understanding the origin, timing, and environmental consequences of LIP eruptions. With advances in radioisotopic dating of both LIPs and mass extinction events, a causal link between the two has been proposed (e.g., Courtillot and Renne, 2003). The best illustrations of this link are for four, and perhaps fi ve, of the mid-Phanerozoic mass extinction events (Wignall, 2005): midCapitanian (Emeishan fl ood basalts; Wignall et al., 2009); end Permian (Siberian Traps; Mundil et al., 2004); end Triassic (Central Atlantic magmatic province [CAMP]; Marzoli et al., 1999); and Cretaceous-Paleogene (Deccan Traps; Keller et al., 2008). More recently, the Frasnian-Famennian extinction has been tentatively linked to the Viluy Traps (Courtillot et al., 2010), but additional work is required before establishing synchrony between the two. Proposed causes for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction are controversial, as the timing of this extinction is also temporally related to a major asteroid impact (Chicxulub; e.g., Renne et al., 2013). However, no other large impact–mass extinction pair has been fi rmly identifi ed in the geological record (Jourdan et al., 2012). Altogether, this suggests that voluminous volcanic activity might play a dominant role in biotic turnovers and climate shifts. Such an hypothesis can be tested by going much further back in time and studying the precise timing of the oldest LIP of the Phanerozoic, the Cambrian Kalkarindji fl ood basalts (Glass and Phillips, 2006), to assess if this province is synchronous with any signifi cant biotic extinction and climate perturbation."

    "heading": "THE KALKARINDJI LARGE IGNEOUS PROVINCE",
    "text": "Recent geochemical and geochronological data for the Antrim Volcanics and stratigraphically coeval suites in northern and central Aus-\ntralia (Glass and Phillips, 2006) and central Western Australia (Evins et al., 2009) have demonstrated the existence of a large mafi c igneous event, the Kalkarindji LIP (Fig. 1). This LIP is comparable in size to other large igneous provinces, and remnants of lava fl ows, sills, and dikes can be found across an area of ≥2.1 × 106 km2 (Evins et al., 2009). Individual fl ows reach up to 200 m in thickness, but are more commonly between 20 m and 60 m thick. Locally, the Antrim Plateau lava pile reaches a maximum preserved cumulative thickness of ~1500 m (Glass and Phillips, 2006; Evins et al., 2009). Stratigraphic constraints, together with very few accurate high-precision (i.e., internal precision better than ±1%) geochronological results, suggest that the emplacement of the Kalkarindji LIP occurred during the Cambrian Period (e.g., Evins et al., 2009). Isotopic ages include one sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb zircon age of 508 ± 5 Ma (Macdonald et al., 2005) and three 40Ar/39Ar plagioclase ages ranging from 509.0 ± 2.6 Ma to 511.9 ± 1.9 Ma (recalculated from Glass and Phillips [2006] and Evins et al. [2009]). Further details about the tectonic setting of the Kalkarindji LIP are given by Evins et al. (2009)."

    "heading": "THE EARLY–MIDDLE CAMBRIAN EXTINCTION AND MARINE ANOXIA",
    "text": "Although not yet demonstrated as a full-scale mass extinction because it is only known from limited geographic areas and restricted to specifi c groups, the Early–Middle Cambrian (Stage 4–5; EMC) extinction is nevertheless the fi rst signifi cant biotic turnover identifi able in the fossil record with ~45% of genera extinct (cf. compilation by Sepkoski, [1996], Keller [2005], and recent data from Gozalo et al.

New U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar age data from intrusive rocks and lava fl ows yielded statistically indistinguishable ages at ca. 511 Ma, suggesting a relatively brief emplacement for this province. A zircon age of 510.7 ± 0.6 Ma shows that this province is temporally indistinguishable at the few-hundred-thousand-year level from the Early–Middle Cambrian (Stage 4–5) boundary age of 510 ± 1 Ma, which marks the fi rst severe extinction of the Phanerozoic and an extended marine anoxia period. Sulfur concentration measurements ranging from <50 to 1900 μg/g, and fractal analysis of extensive explosive volcanic breccias, suggest that blasts and phreatomagmatic explosions have contributed to injection of large amounts of sulfur into the stratosphere. In addition, magma intrusions in oil, gas, and sulfate deposits may have generated signifi cant emission of CH4 and SO2 which, along with volcanic gases, would have combined to cause an oscillation of the climate and led to the Cambrian extinction.\nGEOLOGY, June 2014; v. 42; no. 6; p. 543–546; Data Repository item 2014190 | doi:10.1130/G35434.1 | Published online 24 April 2014 © 2014 eological Society of America.

The more important extinction event occurred during the Toyonian, and has been used to delineate the Early–Middle Cambrian (now Series 2–3, Stage 4–5) boundary. Furthermore, the Stage 4–5 transition is associated with a global sea-level rise and negative δ13C and positive δ34S excursions recorded in stratigraphic sections worldwide (e.g., Montañez et al., 2000; Hough et al., 2006).\nThe age of the EMC (Stage 4–5) boundary is relatively well constrained by isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry (IDTIMS) U-Pb zircon dating, making it suitable for direct comparison with the Kalkarindji LIP. A minimum age has been obtained on an ash bed located immediately above the EMC boundary in southern Britain yielding an age of 509.10 ± 0.77 Ma (Harvey et al., 2011), and a maximum age of 511 ± 1 Ma (Landing et al., 1998) obtained for an ash bed located right below the EMC boundary, in the upper (but not uppermost) Early Cambrian (Series 2, Stage 4). As such, the two ash beds tightly bracket the EMC boundary between ca. 509 Ma and 511 Ma, and we calculate a conservative age of 510 ± 1 Ma as the best estimate of the age of the EMC boundary, in accordance with the most recent stratigraphic time scale (ca. 509 Ma; Cohen et al., 2013)."

    "heading": "RESULTS",
    "text": "We acquired relatively well-preserved samples from both the Antrim Volcanics and the Table Hill Volcanics at the opposite extremities of the province (Fig. 1). Descriptions and petrography of the four samples used for isotopic analyses, details of analytical methods, and results are presented in detail in the GSA Data Repository1.\nWe analyzed seven zircons from a fresh surface exposure of the coarse-grained Milliwindi dolerite dike in the northern Kalkarindji province (Fig. 1). These dates were produced using chemical abrasion ID-TIMS (CA-ID-TIMS) on single zircons at the University of Geneva, and are relative to the new EARTHTIME tracer solution (www.earth-time.org/u-pb.html; see the Data Repository, and Table DR1 therein). We calculated a weighted mean 238U/206Pb age of 510.67 ± 0.62 Ma (mean square of weighted deviates, MSWD = 2.0; P = 0.09). (All uncertainties herein are quoted at 2σ and include all sources of errors.) Twenty-eight (28) baddeleyite crystals, from 25 to 200 μm long, were extracted from a basement intrusive rock from the Munro well containing mafi c enclaves (Fig. 1;\nsee the Data Repository). Six aliquots, each comprising between 2 and 11 crystals, were analyzed using TIMS at the Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. Apparent 238U/206Pb ages range from 460 Ma to 528 Ma (Table DR2). Analyses defi ne a statistically concordant upper intercept age of 511 ± 5 Ma (MSWD = 1.6; P = 0.20), taken to represent the crystallization age of the sample. A plagioclase sample (sample 002) separated from dolerite sills intersected by an Offi cer Basin drill hole (07THD-002) was analyzed by the laser step-heating 40Ar/39Ar technique at Curtin University, Australia (see the Data Repository). The sample produced a statistically concordant (MSWD = 0.74; P = 0.69) plateau age of 510 ± 4 Ma, with 74% of total 39Ar released (Table DR3), indicating the emplacement age of the sill. Finally, we present S and MgO concentrations of fl uid inclusions hosted in plagioclase minerals (5 analyses) and from whole-rock samples (372 analyses) from the Table Hill Volcanics (Table DR4; see the Data Repository). Fluid inclusions show S concentrations ranging from 0 μg/g to 1254 μg/g. The majority of the S whole-rock data range between 15 μg/g and 1900 μg/g, with an average value of 884 ± 432 μg/g. In both cases, S shows no co-variation with MgO (0.52–6.95 wt%). Six additional whole-rock samples show S enrichment up to ~6963 μg/g."

    "text": "The seven available age results range from 508 ± 5 Ma to 511.9 ± 1.9 Ma (Fig. 2). Independently of the technique used, these ages all agree within uncertainty (MSWD = 1.03; P = 0.40; Fig. 2) and suggest an age of ca. 510 Ma for the province. It is unlikely that these rocks were emplaced at the exact same time at the hundreds-of-thousands-of-years time scale, but their relative timing is beyond the time resolution achieved by the data. Therefore, only a strict maximum duration of ~3 m.y. (the standard deviation of the population is 1.7 m.y.) can be tentatively estimated from the current data."

This age has suffi cient precision that it can be compared with the age of the EMC (Stage 4–5) boundary of 510 ± 1 Ma (Landing et al., 1998; Harvey et al., 2011).

It is also worth noting that plagioclase 40Ar/39Ar and baddeleyite U-Pb ages alone corroborate this interpretation with a weighted mean age of 510.0 ± 1.4 Ma, which is equally indistinguishable from the age of the EMC boundary."

    "heading": "Signifi cance of the Synchrony Between Kalkarindji and the EMC Boundary",
    "text": "The agreement between ages for the Kalkarindji LIP and the EMC (Stage 4–5) boundary far extends the record of consistent synchrony between volcanism, climate perturbation, and severe extinction to the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. Although the EMC boundary extinction is not (yet?) defi ned as a true mass extinction, the extinction of 45% of the genera at the time (e.g., Sepkoski, 1996; Keller, 2005), and a global isotope excursion (Gozalo et al., 2013), make it a convincing case for testing the effect of massive volcanism on the climate and biosphere.\nAs a result, the coincidence of large-scale continental volcanism and severe extinction events is signifi cantly more frequent than is expected from pure randomness, with a negligible 6 × 10–9% probability (see the Data Repository) that such correlation is due to chance alone. This estimate strongly supports a causal relationship between the LIPs and severe extinctions during the Phanerozoic. Two notable exceptions are the Karoo and Paranà-Etendeka LIPs. Whereas the lack of effect of the Karoo LIP on the biosphere is likely due to the unusually low eruption rate of this province (Jourdan et al., 2008), the reason for the absence of correlation between the Paranà-Etendeka fl ood basalts and any biotic turnover (Fig. 3) is still unknown."

    "heading": "Possible Causes of the Marine Anoxia and Extinction at the EMC Boundary",
    "text": "Although rapid climate changes and climate oscillations are likely to be the ultimate cause\nof mass extinctions, the exact trigger mechanisms arising from LIP emplacements that are responsible for these climatic shifts are less clear. Favored mechanisms include rapid emission of gases (dominantly CO2 and SO2, but also CH4 [methane] halogen and NOx) either initially dissolved in the magma (Sobolev et al., 2011) or degassed from carbon-rich and/or sulfatebearing sediments intruded by dikes and sills (e.g., Svensen et al., 2009). The Kalkarindji LIP is unique in its eruption age and geological setting, and careful observations can bring further constraints to the conditions required to cause large extinction events.\nWith no extant fauna on land during the Early Cambrian, the extinction mechanism(s) involved must have acted on Cambrian oceans, suggesting that ozone depletion and increase of ultraviolet ray exposure had no role in the extinction. Sulfur content measured in whole-rock samples and plagioclase melt inclusions from the Table Hill Volcanics displays a similar range of values, ranging mostly from <50 μg/g to a\nmaximum of 1900 μg/g (see the Data Repository; Table DR4). Assuming that either 1900 μg/g or 884 μg/g S represents the possible average value of the rocks before degassing, maximum and minimum values of 53% and 15% of S degassing can be calculated. Nevertheless, the total volume of S release is less relevant to any attempt to understand extinction and climate shift mechanisms because of its ultra-transient presence in the atmosphere (Self et al., 2005). More relevant is the expected maximum atmospheric loading following the largest fl ow eruptions. In this regard, we report the presence of a ~15,000 km2 and 70-m-thick volcanic breccia (the Blackfella Rockhole Member) near the top of the Antrim Plateau Volcanics sequence (Fig. 1). We use fractal analysis to classify the breccia particles (see the Data Repository; cf. Maria and Carey, 2007), which shows that these breccias are of explosive (blast/surge or phreatomagmatic) origin, which drastically increases the potential of gas delivery directly to the stratosphere (Self et al., 2005).\nIn addition, SO2 and CH4 gas emissions could have been caused by contact metamorphism with and/or assimilation of country rocks during the magma ascent (Svensen et al., 2009, Black et al., 2012), in agreement with the occurrence of (1) two major sequences of a few hundred meters and up to 2 km thick (average of ~800 m) of early Neoproterozoic C-rich evaporite layers (including gypsum anhydrite, and dolostone; Lindsay, 1987), and (2) large quantities of untapped Proterozoic oil and gas source rocks and reservoirs distributed within the ~1 × 106 km2 central Australian basins (Bradshaw et al., 1994) (Fig. 1; Table DR6; Ganino and Arndt, 2009). The latter is supported by the occurrence of asphalt in vesicles within the Kalkarindji basalts (Bradshaw et al., 1994) and a negative δ13C recorded at the EMC boundary. Altogether, rapid climate oscillations triggered by successive cooling and warming pulses would have caused\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/42/6/543/3546542/543.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\n546 www.gsapubs.org | June 2014 | GEOLOGY\nrapid fl uctuations of the climate and associated ocean temperatures.\nIt is important to note that no coal deposits had been formed at this time on Earth, precluding large amounts of metamorphic CO2 release and suggesting that coal-derived metamorphic CO2 might not play a dominant role in mass extinctions in general. This is also supported by observations from provinces associated with coal, like the Karoo or Paranà traps, and not associated with any mass extinction."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "In this study, we showed that the Kalkarindji LIP was emplaced at ca. 510–511 Ma using high-precision 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb mineral dating. These data can be compared with zircon U-Pb ages from layers tightly bracketing the Early–Middle Cambrian boundary and showing the latter to be 510 ± 1 Ma.\nThe temporal synchrony between the eruption of the Kalkarindji volcanics and the Early–Middle Cambrian boundary at ca. 510 Ma is another example of a well-defi ned temporal correlation between volcanism, climate shifts, and extinction which extends these relationships to the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. The likely factors responsible for the EMC extinction are climate shifts due to emission of mantle gases (SO2 and possibly CO2) dissolved in the magma, and/or gases (in particular CH4 and SO2) generated by the interaction between magma and evaporite layers and/or oil-rich rocks. CO2 degassing due to magma-coal interaction likely plays a secondary role in biotic turnovers."

  "abstractText": "The voluminous Kalkarindji fl ood basalts erupted in Australia during the Cambrian and covered >2 × 106 km2. New U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar age data from intrusive rocks and lava fl ows yielded statistically indistinguishable ages at ca. 511 Ma, suggesting a relatively brief emplacement for this province. A zircon age of 510.7 ± 0.6 Ma shows that this province is temporally indistinguishable at the few-hundred-thousand-year level from the Early–Middle Cambrian (Stage 4–5) boundary age of 510 ± 1 Ma, which marks the fi rst severe extinction of the Phanerozoic and an extended marine anoxia period. Sulfur concentration measurements ranging from <50 to 1900 μg/g, and fractal analysis of extensive explosive volcanic breccias, suggest that blasts and phreatomagmatic explosions have contributed to injection of large amounts of sulfur into the stratosphere. In addition, magma intrusions in oil, gas, and sulfate deposits may have generated signifi cant emission of CH4 and SO2 which, along with volcanic gases, would have combined to cause an oscillation of the climate and led to the Cambrian extinction.

The more important extinction event occurred during the Toyonian, and has been used to delineate the Early–Middle Cambrian (now Series 2–3, Stage 4–5) boundary. Furthermore, the Stage 4–5 transition is associated with a global sea-level rise and negative δ13C and positive δ34S excursions recorded in stratigraphic sections worldwide (e.g., Montañez et al., 2000; Hough et al., 2006). The age of the EMC (Stage 4–5) boundary is relatively well constrained by isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry (IDTIMS) U-Pb zircon dating, making it suitable for direct comparison with the Kalkarindji LIP. A minimum age has been obtained on an ash bed located immediately above the EMC boundary in southern Britain yielding an age of 509.10 ± 0.77 Ma (Harvey et al., 2011), and a maximum age of 511 ± 1 Ma (Landing et al., 1998) obtained for an ash bed located right below the EMC boundary, in the upper (but not uppermost) Early Cambrian (Series 2, Stage 4). As such, the two ash beds tightly bracket the EMC boundary between ca. 509 Ma and 511 Ma, and we calculate a conservative age of 510 ± 1 Ma as the best estimate of the age of the EMC boundary, in accordance with the most recent stratigraphic time scale (ca. 509 Ma; Cohen et al., 2013). RESULTS We acquired relatively well-preserved samples from both the Antrim Volcanics and the Table Hill Volcanics at the opposite extremities of the province (Fig. 1). Descriptions and petrography of the four samples used for isotopic analyses, details of analytical methods, and results are presented in detail in the GSA Data Repository1. We analyzed seven zircons from a fresh surface exposure of the coarse-grained Milliwindi dolerite dike in the northern Kalkarindji province (Fig. 1). These dates were produced using chemical abrasion ID-TIMS (CA-ID-TIMS) on single zircons at the University of Geneva, and are relative to the new EARTHTIME tracer solution (www.earth-time.org/u-pb.html; see the Data Repository, and Table DR1 therein). We calculated a weighted mean 238U/206Pb age of 510.67 ± 0.62 Ma (mean square of weighted deviates, MSWD = 2.0; P = 0.09). (All uncertainties herein are quoted at 2σ and include all sources of errors.) Twenty-eight (28) baddeleyite crystals, from 25 to 200 μm long, were extracted from a basement intrusive rock from the Munro well containing mafi c enclaves (Fig. 1; see the Data Repository). Six aliquots, each comprising between 2 and 11 crystals, were analyzed using TIMS at the Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. Apparent 238U/206Pb ages range from 460 Ma to 528 Ma (Table DR2). Analyses defi ne a statistically concordant upper intercept age of 511 ± 5 Ma (MSWD = 1.6; P = 0.20), taken to represent the crystallization age of the sample. A plagioclase sample (sample 002) separated from dolerite sills intersected by an Offi cer Basin drill hole (07THD-002) was analyzed by the laser step-heating 40Ar/39Ar technique at Curtin University, Australia (see the Data Repository). The sample produced a statistically concordant (MSWD = 0.74; P = 0.69) plateau age of 510 ± 4 Ma, with 74% of total 39Ar released (Table DR3), indicating the emplacement age of the sill. Finally, we present S and MgO concentrations of fl uid inclusions hosted in plagioclase minerals (5 analyses) and from whole-rock samples (372 analyses) from the Table Hill Volcanics (Table DR4; see the Data Repository). Fluid inclusions show S concentrations ranging from 0 μg/g to 1254 μg/g. The majority of the S whole-rock data range between 15 μg/g and 1900 μg/g, with an average value of 884 ± 432 μg/g. In both cases, S shows no co-variation with MgO (0.52–6.95 wt%). Six additional whole-rock samples show S enrichment up to ~6963 μg/g."
