Troy Rasbury,6 Mohammed Et-Touhami7\nThe end-Triassic extinction is characterized by major losses in both terrestrial and marine diversity, setting the stage for dinosaurs to dominate Earth for the next 136 million years. Despite the approximate coincidence between this extinction and flood basalt volcanism, existing geochronologic dates have insufficient resolution to confirm eruptive rates required to induce major climate perturbations. Here, we present new zircon uranium-lead (U-Pb) geochronologic constraints on the age and duration of flood basalt volcanism within the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. This chronology demonstrates synchroneity between the earliest volcanism and extinction, tests and corroborates the existing astrochronologic time scale, and shows that the release of magma and associated atmospheric flux occurred in four pulses over about 600,000 years, indicating expansive volcanism even as the biologic recovery was under way.\nThe approximate temporal coincidence be-tween the five major extinction eventsover the past 542 million years and the eruption of large igneous provinces (LIPs) has led to speculation that environmental perturbations generated by the emplacement of large volumes of magma and associated outgassing over short periods of time triggered each global biologic crisis (1). Establishing an exact link between extinctions and LIP eruptions has proved difficult because of the geographic separation between LIP volcanic deposits and stratigraphic sequences preserving evidence of the extinction. In most cases, uncertainties on radioisotopic dates used to correlate between geographically separated study areas exceed the duration of both the extinction interval and LIP volcanism by an order of magnitude. This hinders evaluation of any relationship between magmatism and extinction and precludes accurate estimates of volcanic effusion rates, associated volatile release, and extinction mechanisms.\nThe end-Triassic extinction (ETE)—marked within early Mesozoic basins of eastern North America by a dramatic turnover in fossil pollen, spores (sporomorphs), and vertebrates (2)—is one of the largest Phanerozoic mass extinctions,\noccurring just before the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (3, 4), and has long been thought to be associated with the eruptions of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) (5, 6). CAMP is the most aerially extensive LIP on Earth, and with volume estimates between 2–3 × 106 km3, it ranks as one of the most voluminous (7) (Fig. 1). Remnants of CAMP are found on four continents and consist primarily of continental thoeliitic basalts emplaced as subaerial flows and intrusive bodies during rifting of the Pangean supercontinent and incipient formation of the Atlantic Ocean basin (Fig. 1). Estimates of the timing and duration of CAMP provided by astrochronology (8, 9) and 40Ar/39Ar geochronology (10, 11) differ by an order of magnitude, preventing high-precision tests of the relationship between LIP volcanism and mass extinction. Use of the astrochronologic\ntime-scale, though potentially precise, relies on (i) recognition of the influence of orbital cycles in the rock record and (ii) the ability to predict orbital durations in the deep geologic past, both of which have engendered doubts about the reliability of the technique. The lower precision of 40Ar/39Ar dates (fig. S1) prevents estimation of the volume of magma erupted over unit time, a critical factor for evaluating extinctionmechanisms such as CO2induced global warming (12, 13) ocean acidification (14, 15), or sulfur aerosol–induced “volcanic winters” (16)."

    "text": "Here, we present zircon (ZrSiO4) U-Pb geochronologic data for CAMP magmatism from seven sites in eastern North America and one in Morocco (Fig. 1), integrated with paleobiological, geochemical, and paleomagnetic data derived from sedimentary sequences interbedded with and intruded by the magmatic rocks. These data provide (i) a precise determination of the onset and duration of CAMP magmatism and (ii) a test of the reliability of the astronomical time scale in order to provide a high-precision age model for the CAMP-ETE interval (8, 9). Though U-Pb dating of zircon permits an order of magnitude improvement over previous 40Ar/39Ar studies (fig. S1), this preferred mineral for U-Pb dating is uncommon in basaltic rocks. This forced our sample collection to focus on finding isolated coarsegrained segregations within gabbroic intrusions and thick subaerial flows where incompatible elementenriched residual melts resulted in the crystallization of zircon (17) (fig. S2). The reported zircon U-Pb dates are 238U-206Pb weighted mean dates with T2s analytical uncertainties corrected for initial 230Th disequilibrium (figs.

However, coarse-grained zircon-bearing flows in the CAMP are relatively rare. Therefore, we also have dated sills that are either physically connected to flows as feeders or can be geochemically linked with stratigraphically constrained flows (18, 19). In both North American and Moroccan basins, stratigraphic superposition of basalt flows combined with trace element geochemistry provides a relative time scale for the geochemical evolution of CAMP basalts (11, 20–25) (Fig. 3A). This same geochemical trend is also observed in the dated stratigraphically unconstrained units (Fig. 3A). The shared geochemical evolution in CAMP magmas permits correlation between units that share a common trace element signature, allowing the U-Pb date for a stratigraphically unconstrained intrusion to effectively date the horizon of a geochemically similar and stratigraphically constrained basalt flow. This composite geochronologically dated stratigraphic section is used to test the astrochronologic time scale for the Newark basin."

    "text": "The quasiperiodic variations in Earth’s orbit, axial direction, and tilt known as Milankovitch cycles result in corresponding variations in the amount and distribution of sunlight reaching Earth. The resulting forcing on climate and/or ocean circulation can influence the characteristics of sediments deposited within a basin, which may ultimately be preserved within the rock record as cyclical variations in rock lithology, chemistry, or isotopic composition (26). CAMP lava flows within the Newark basin of eastern North America (Fig. 2) are interbedded with strikingly cyclical lacustrine strata that have long been hypothesized to be paced by orbital forcing (27). Astrochronologic models for these sequences have been used to estimate the time represented by the sedimentary rocks between CAMP flows, placing high-precision [T20 thousand years (ky)] estimates on the total duration of the CAMP at between 580 and 610 ky (9, 28). This proposed “floating” astronomical time scale (ATS) has been met with scrutiny because of the possibility that Earth experienced a different orbital forcing deep in geologic time due to differences in the state of the Earth-Moon system and solar systems dynamics. Further skepticism has focused on whether orbitally forced climatic effects are both accurately recorded and recognized in the geological record. The most straightforward test of the reliability of the ATS is to compare the time durations between basalt flows estimated by orbitally tuning the sedimentary rocks with differences between the zircon U-Pb dates of the flows.\nThe Orange Mountain Basalt flows are the oldest CAMP lavas in the Newark basin. Although authigenic zircons were not recovered from the Orange Mountain Basalt samples, the flow sequence is partly intruded and fed by an extension of the geochemically identical Palisade sill [201.520 T 0.034 million years ago (Ma)] (19).\nBased on the ATS for the Newark basin, the overlying flows of the Preakness Basalt should be 250 T 20 ky younger than the Orange Mountain Basalt (and Palisade sill) (9). The U-Pb date of the Preakness Basalt (201.274 T 0.032 Ma) results in a difference of 246 T 47 ky, consistent with the astrochronological estimate. A second interval within the Newark ATS, that again uses the Preakness basalt, can be tested by correlating the Butner diabase from the Deep River Basin (200.916 T 0.064Ma) to the stratigraphically highest and geochemically similar Hook Mountain Basalt (Fig. 3A). The ATS estimate for the time interval between the base of the Preakness and the base of the Hook mountain basalts is 350 T 20 ky, a duration consistent with the difference between U-Pb dates for the Preakness Basalt and the Butner sheet of 358 T 72 ky. A more complete test of the ATS is provided by comparing the astronomical time scale to each of the CAMP flows and intrusions dated here. Using the relative stratigraphy of preserved CAMP flows and the geochemical correlations (Fig. 3A), each stratigraphically unconstrained CAMP intrusive can be correlated to the astronomically tuned Newark Basin. By correlating to the\n24 MAY 2013 VOL 340 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org942\nNewark section, each horizon dated by U-Pb can be placed within the astrochronologic time scale and assigned an estimated time since the ETE (i.e., the extinction horizon that cannot be directly dated by geochronology) (Fig. 3B). Comparing the U-Pb geochronology and the durations between the ETE and the dated flows implied by the astronomical tuning reveals that the two chronologies agree well given the analytical uncertainties in the U-Pb dates and the T 20 ky uncertainties assigned to the astrochronology. Combining the two data sets (Fig. 3B), the U-Pb dates anchor the higher-precision astrochronology in absolute time, and a least-squares optimization can be used to simultaneously solve for the absolute date of the ETE as well as those of the dated samples that best fit the relative and absolute timing constraints (table S2) (18). This approach yields an estimate of the ETE of 201.564 T 0.015/0.22 Ma, with a c2red (mean square weighted deviation) of 1.3, where the first uncertainty reflects analytical uncertainty only and the second includes uncertainty in the 238U, 232Th, and 230Th decay constants. U-Pb geochronologic data are therefore consistent with our geochemical model and assumed correlations and validates the use of the ATS for highresolution astrochronology for the CAMP and ETE time interval. This further indicates that orbital signals were faithfully recorded in these lacustrine strata and that solar system dynamics along with the duration of precession cycles 200 Ma can be reliably modeled (29)."

    "text": "Integration of geochronologic, geochemical (11, 21–23, 25, 30), paleontological (9, 11, 31), and magnetostratigraphic (25, 32, 33) data for the Newark, Fundy, and Argana basins provide the basis for a high-resolution chronology of the earliest known CAMP eruptions and the extinction event (Fig. 4). In each of these sections, the magnetic polarity chron E23r is observed below the sporomorph turnover that marks the terrestrial ETE. The assumed global synchroneity of both magnetic reversals and mass extinctions at the thousandyear level suggests that a common time duration is shared between the horizons marking the base of the E23r and the ETE. If we assume to first order that the thickness of lacustrine strata between these horizons is a proxy for time, the thickness of sedimentary rocks defines the relative duration between the ETE and the lowermost basalts in each basin (Fig. 4). This relative chronology implies that the base of the North Mountain Basalt of the Fundy basin is older than the base of the Orange Mountain Basalt of the Newark basin, whereas the lowermost basalt within the Argana basin (Tasguint Basalt) is older still than the North Mountain Basalt, placing the Tasguint basalt as the oldest CAMP unit. Time estimates on the sedimentary interval fromE23r to the lowermost basalt are provided through integration with the astrochronologic time scale for theNewark basin.Within the Newark basin, the base of E23r to the ETE coincides with one climatic precession cycle (2), thus permitting the precession cycle duration to be correlated to the E23r to ETE interval in both the Fundy andArgana basins (Fig. 4). For a 5-millionyear duration of the precession parameter, the average climatic precession cycle is 21.1 T 6.1 ky (2s), with a range of 10 to 31 ky. For the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic (200 Ma), that would be ~19.8 T 5.7 ky due to the recession of the Moon (29). Using this model, the ETE is about 13.2 T 3.8 ky older than the Orange Mountain Basalt (range of 12.9 to 13.5 ky, depending on the section). The base of the North Mountain Basalt of the Fundy basin is about 10.0 T 2.9 ky older than the base of the Orange Mountain Basalt, which is 3.2 T 0.9 ky younger than the ETE, and the base of the Tasguint Basalt is 13.2 T 3.8 ky older than the Orange Mountain and 3.2 T 0.9 ky older than the North Mountain Basalt. Both the turnover in sporomorph taxa marking the terrestrial ETE and an interval of postETE strata is observed below the lowermost basalts in both the Newark and Fundy basins, implying that within these basins CAMP basalts postdate the extinction. The palynological turnover is, however, not observed within the Argana basin, where Triassic sporomorphs are continually observed within sedimentary rocks up to the base of the Tasguint basalt (11). The combined evidence of (i) the older age of the Tasguint basalt relative to basalts in the Newark and Fundy basins, (ii) the astrochronologic time constraints on sediment deposition for the E23rbasalt interval, and (iii) the presence of Triassic sporomorphs beneath the Tasguint basalt, all place the extinction horizon at the base of or within the Tasguint basalt, consistent with the model by Deenen and others (25) but conflicting with chronology of Marzoli and others (11). This chronologic framework permits a causal relationship between CAMP and the ETE to be made at a high level of precision. Although this temporal link between the eruption of CAMP and ETE strongly imply a causal relationship, how the eruption of CAMP induced a global extinction remains unclear. An emerging model requires the near-instantaneous eruption of large volumes of magma (~8×105 km3) in order to explain (i) the apparent increase of atmospheric pCO2 values (12, 13, 34); (ii) the near collapse of coral reefs and absence of carbonate deposition, both thought to be triggered by the decrease in the pH of ocean seawater (14, 15); and (iii) the approximately 5–8.5 per mil negative excursion in organic d13C values observed in both marine and terrestrial records, suggesting a large input of isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere (35–37). The subsequent biologic recovery from this extinction is marked within marine sections at the Triassic-Jurassic Boundary (TJB) (38), which is defined at its Global Boundary Stratotype\nFig. 3.

At the GSSP and throughout northern Europe (35), correlation to the Newark Basin and the ATS (36) places the TJB at ~100 T 40 ky after the ETE (where the large uncertainty derives from problems correlating the marine and terrestrial astrochronologic cycles) and after the eruption of the older, upper high-titanium quartz normative (HTQ-U) basalts. This timeline implies that the biologic recovery associated with the TJB was under way even as subsequent CAMP eruptions and associated pulsed increases in atmospheric CO2 (13) were occurring ~60 ky (HTQ-U), ~270 ky [high-iron quartz normative (HFQ/low-titanium quartz normative (LTQ)], and ~620 ky [high– iron-titanium quartz normative (HFTQ-R) after the extinction event (Fig. 3). Because our geochronologic data resolve four discrete CAMP pulses, we propose that it is the first pulse of the “lower” and “intermediate” HTQ chemical groups (Fig. 4) that erupted coincident with and immediately after the ETE that caused the global extinction.\nReferences and Notes 1.

Lin1\nIce cores from low latitudes can provide a wealth of unique information about past climate in the tropics, but they are difficult to recover and few exist. Here, we report annually resolved ice core records from the Quelccaya ice cap (5670 meters above sea level) in Peru that extend back ~1800 years and provide a high-resolution record of climate variability there. Oxygen isotopic ratios (d18O) are linked to sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific, whereas concentrations of ammonium and nitrate document the dominant role played by the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the region of the tropical Andes. Quelccaya continues to retreat and thin. Radiocarbon dates on wetland plants exposed along its retreating margins indicate that it has not been smaller for at least six millennia.\nIce cores from high-altitude tropical glaciersoffer long-term perspectives on the variabilityof precipitation, temperature, aridity, and atmospheric and sea surface conditions at low latitudes.Mostmeteorological and climatic disturbances affecting Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere originate in or are amplified by ocean-atmosphere interactions in tropical latitudes. As Earth’s “heat engine,” the warmest atmospheric and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) occur there. This energy drives intense convective precipitation and is crucial for the evolution of phenomena such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the monsoonal systems of Asia andAfrica, and, on intraannual time scales, hurricanes and other tropical disturbances that distribute equatorial heat energy poleward. ENSO dominates tropical climate variability. It is linked to the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and its associated teleconnections affect the strength and direction of air masses and storm tracks, variations in convective activity that control flooding and drought, andmodulation of tropical storm intensities. There are few high mountain glaciers in these regions and even fewer that preserve detailed histories of this variability. Unfortunately, most are now rapidly shrinking, and unique records are being lost. The potential impacts on water resources have social and economic consequences that underpin\nthe imperative to understand the drivers and responses of past and present tropical climate variability.\nThe first ice cores drilled from the Quelccaya ice cap (QIC) [13°56′S, 70°50′W, 5670 m above sea level (masl)], in 1983 (1–3), could not be returned frozen to the laboratory and insteadwere cut into samples that were melted and bottled in the field. In 2003, two additional cores were drilled to bedrock on the QIC (Fig. 1). The Summit Dome (5670 masl) core (QSD, 168.68 m) and the North Dome (5600 masl) core (QND, 128.57 m) were returned frozen and are stored at –30°C at Ohio State University’s Byrd Polar Research Center. Minimal postdepositional reworking of the snow surface, even during the wet season, results in the distinct annual layers (fig. S1A) used to reconstruct an ~1800-year climate history. Details about the construction of the time scale, extracting annually resolved information, and reconstructing the net annual accumulation are provided in the supplementary text. The oxygen isotopic ratio (d18O) records for the 2003 QSD and QND cores, separated by 1.92 km, are highly correlated (r = 0.898, P < 0.0001 for decadal averages; table S1). In light of their similarity,\n1Byrd Polar Research Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. 2School of Earth Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. 3Department of Geography, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. 4Institute of Geography, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.\n*Corresponding author.

  "abstractText": "The end-Triassic extinction is characterized by major losses in both terrestrial and marine diversity, setting the stage for dinosaurs to dominate Earth for the next 136 million years. Despite the approximate coincidence between this extinction and flood basalt volcanism, existing geochronologic dates have insufficient resolution to confirm eruptive rates required to induce major climate perturbations. Here, we present new zircon uranium-lead (U-Pb) geochronologic constraints on the age and duration of flood basalt volcanism within the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. This chronology demonstrates synchroneity between the earliest volcanism and extinction, tests and corroborates the existing astrochronologic time scale, and shows that the release of magma and associated atmospheric flux occurred in four pulses over about 600,000 years, indicating expansive volcanism even as the biologic recovery was under way.",
