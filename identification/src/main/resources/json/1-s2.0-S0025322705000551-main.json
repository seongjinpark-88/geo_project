Bralower).\nrich black shales, dark gray to black laminated carbona-\nceous mudrocks, took place during oceanic anoxic\nevents (OAEs) (e.g., Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976;\nJenkyns, 1980; Arthur et al., 1990; Bralower et al., 1993;\nErbacher et al., 1996; Erba et al., 2004). These rocks\nwere deposited in epicontinental seaways, on continental\nmargins, and in the deep ocean (e.g., Ryan and Cita,\n1977; Arthur and Schlanger, 1979). Possible factors\nresponsible for deposition of black shales include a\ncombination of high sea-level, warm climate, sluggish\nocean circulation, and high organic productivity (e.g.,\nArthur et al., 1984; Arthur et al., 1987).\nThe Cenomanian–Turonian boundary (CTB) event\n(OAE2) at 93.5 Ma spanned ~600,000 years and led to\ndeposition of Corg-rich sediments on a global basis (e.g., Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976; Jenkyns, 1980;\nHilbrecht, 1986; Schlanger et al., 1987; Arthur et al.,\n1988; Pratt et al., 1993; Hasegawa, 1995). This\nwidespread distribution of Corg-rich sediments is evidenced by a prominent, positive C-isotope excur-\nsion near the CTB in a number of sections measured on the calcium carbonate (y13Ccarb; Scholle and Arthur, 1980; Schlanger et al., 1987; Jarvis et al., 1988; Gale et\nal., 1993; Paul et al., 1999; Tsikos et al., 2004) and the organic matter fraction (y13Corg; Pratt and Threlkeld, 1984; Pratt, 1985; Arthur et al., 1988; Hasegawa,\n1997; Hasegawa, 2003; Hasegawa et al., 2003). This\nexcursion, which is used as a relative dating technique, is thought to reflect the widespread removal of 12C-\nenriched organic matter in marine sediments.\nUsing examples of modern environments where\nCorg-rich sediments are found, several theories have been proposed for the origin of OAEs (e.g., Arthur et\nal., 1984; Bralower and Thierstein, 1987; Schlanger et\nal., 1987; Weissert, 1989). In areas of high phytoplank-\nton productivity, fluxes of marine Corg are high and dissolved oxygen in the deepest portions of the water\ncolumn is depleted (e.g., Reimers, 1982; Pedersen and\nCalvert, 1990). Alternatively, ocean anoxia and Corgrich sediments are found in areas of the ocean where\nstratification is increased by reduced mixing and/or\nhigh-density contrasts between different water masses\n(e.g., Berry and Wilde, 1978; Brass et al., 1982).\nRecently, however, research has focused on two\nmore dynamic triggers for OAEs. Active volcanism\nmay have directly or indirectly initiated OAEs (e.g.,\nVogt, 1989; Larson, 1991; Arthur et al., 1991; Bralower\net al., 1994; Erba, 1994; Sinton and Duncan, 1997;\nLarson and Erba, 1999; Leckie et al., 2002; Erba et al.,\n2004). Submarine volcanism releases reduced com-\npounds (sulfides and metals) that have the potential to\nconsume dissolved oxygen in seawater (Sinton and\nDuncan, 1997). Hydrothermal Fe may act as a micro-\nnutrient in surface waters, stimulating primary produc-\ntivity and reducing deep-water oxygenation (Vogt,\n1989; Sinton and Duncan, 1997; Leckie et al., 2002). In\nthe case of OAE2, contemporaneous ocean plateau\nformation in the Caribbean may have led to widespread\nocean anoxia or dysoxia (Sinton and Duncan, 1997;\nKerr, 1998; Snow et al., in press).\nThere is growing evidence that dissociation of\nbiogenic methane hydrate in bottom waters along\ncontinental margins may have initiated certain OAEs\n(see summary in Jenkyns, 2003). Although the physical\nand chemical effects of this dissociation are not well\nunderstood, the oxidation of the dissociated methane to\nCO2 could rapidly consume oxygen in deepwaters. Input of methane and CO2 to the atmosphere would also cause warming (e.g., Dickens et al., 1995); if this warming\nsignal were transferred via downwelling to deep waters\n(i.e., warm saline deep water), it would have acted as a\npositive feedback, amplifying anoxic conditions.\nThe purported causes of OAEs can be identified by\nchanges in the carbon isotopic ratios of CaCO3 and Corg. In the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) and early Aptian OAEs, an abrupt and large negative carbon isotopic\nshift lies immediately below or at the base of the\npositive carbon isotope excursion (Hesselbo et al.,\n2000; Jahren et al., 2001; Beerling et al., 2002). Mantle-derived CO2 is a source of light carbon (y 13C about 6x). As CO2 enters the ocean–atmosphere system through volcanism, negative shifts are recorded in y13C. Negative shifts can also theoretically result from introduction of hydrate methane (y13C value about 60x) into the system from dissociation. Distinguishing between the various sources of light\ncarbon requires accurate records of the isotopic signals\nas well as precise time control to establish the rates of\nresponse (e.g., Dickens et al., 1997; Kump and Arthur,\n1999; Norris and Röhl, 1999). The magnitude and rate\nof introduction of light carbon has been used as\nevidence for a hydrate trigger for the Toarcian OAE\n(Hesselbo et al., 2000) and early Aptian OAE1a\n(Jahren et al., 2001; Beerling et al., 2002). A logical\nquestion is whether all OAEs had such a trigger.\nUntil recently few CTB sections had been studied in\nsufficient resolution to address whether a transient\nnegative carbon isotope shift exists. Most published\nrecords (Scholle and Arthur, 1980; Pratt, 1985; Arthur\net al., 1988; Jarvis et al., 1988) showed gradually\nincreasing carbon isotope values at the base of the\npositive excursion without a negative shift. The y13Ccarb record of Scott et al. (1998) from the Bounds Core in Kansas contains a ~6x negative shift slightly above the base of the positive isotope excursion. This shift is not observed in y13Corg although the resolution of the y13Corg curve is lower than that of y 13Ccarb. Recently, Tsikos et al. (2004) carried out high-\nresolution sampling of CTB sections from England,\nItaly, andMorocco, illustrating a detailed series of steps\nduring the onset and recovery of the OAE2 positive\ncarbon isotope excursion. None of the records show a\nnegative isotope event at the onset of the positive\nexcursion that would be compatible with a volcanic\n(i.e., Caribbean) or methane hydrate trigger. Although\nthese sections appear to be complete, and those from\nEngland and Morocco are relatively expanded, it is\npossible that condensed intervals or unconformities\nhave removed the key part of the isotope excursion.\nThus, additional isotope stratigraphies are required to\nresolve whether a negative excursion is present at the\nbase of OAE2.\nIn this study, isotopic investigations of classic CTB\nsections from the Western Interior Seaway (WIS),\nincluding the stratotype section in the Rock Canyon\nAnticline near Pueblo (Pratt and Threlkeld, 1984; Pratt,\n1985) and a section near Cuba, Kansas, were done at\nsufficient stratigraphic resolution to observe transient\nevents such as a potential negative isotope excursion.\nIn addition, an expanded CTB section in a borehole\nfrom New Jersey was investigated at high resolution to\ndetermine the detailed structure of the onset of the carbon isotopic excursion. In all sequences, y13Corg and y13Ccarb were analyzed to fully constrain the response of carbon reservoirs at the onset of OAE2."

    "text": "The global transgression of the Late Cretaceous led\nto the formation of extensive epicontinental seaways\n(e.g., Hancock and Kauffman, 1979). The CTB lies\nwithin the transgressive part of a third-order eustatic\ncycle that culminated in an early Turonian highstand,\nthe highest sea level of the Mesozoic era (Williams\nand Stelck, 1975; Haq et al., 1987).\nThe Western Interior Seaway (WIS) of North\nAmerica extended some 6000 km from the Gulf of\nMexico to the Arctic close to the CTB (Leckie et al.,\n1998) (Fig. 1). At this time, the seaway was about\n2000 km wide and about 500 m deep (Hay et al.,\n1993). The WIS was bounded by the Sevier High-\nlands to the west and the low relief, stable craton to\nthe east (Leckie et al., 1998). The complex inter-\nactions between less dense, warm surface waters\noriginating in the Gulf of Mexico and dense, cold\nand brackish waters from the Arctic exerted a strong\ncontrol of depositional patterns (Leckie et al., 1998).\nFor example, Kauffman (1988) postulated that strat-\nification and anoxia occurred when southern waters\nwere superposed on northern waters.\nThe CTB in the WIS lies within the Bridge Creek\nLimestone Member of the Greenhorn Formation just\nabove the Hartland Shale Member of the same\nformation (e.g., Kauffman and Pratt, 1985). The Bridge\nCreek Limestone at Rock Canyon consists of cyclically\nalternating pelagic carbonates (chalk and limestone)\nand more Corg-rich beds (marlstone and calcareous shale) (Kauffman, 1977; Barron et al., 1985; Hattin,\n1985; Kauffman, 1985; Elder et al., 1994). The\nHartland Shale is a homogeneous, generally more\nTOC-rich unit (Sageman, 1985; Pratt, 1985).\nThe Cuba section in northern-central Kansas is\nabout 600 km east of the Rock Canyon section. This\nincludes the Jetmore Chalk and Pfeifer Shale Mem-\nbers of the Greenhorn Formation (Hattin, 1975) that\nare dominated by marlstone and calcareous shale. The\nlithologic cyclicity observed at Rock Canyon is\nvirtually absent (Figs. 2 and 3)."

Above 212 cm, variation decreases and y13Ccarb values generally increase from about 1.5x to 3.29x at 273 cm, then generally decrease gradually above that point (Fig. 3; Table 2). The y13Corg curve shows clearer stratigraphic trends with generally smaller fluctuations. Between 30 cm and 50 cm, y13Corg values increase sharply (from 26.26x to 22.27x), marking the onset of the positive excursion (Fig. 3). One highly negative shift of ~4.9x occurs between 50 cm and 164 cm. y13Corg values of samples are generally level near 23x between 164 cm and 470 cm, then decrease to\n25.86x at 670 cm. The high-resolution y13Corg curve shows the same general trends as the y13Corg curve generated by Pratt (1985) that was supplemented with additional\ndata by Arthur et al. (1988). Although biostratig-\nraphy is exclusive to the outcrop section (Leckie,\n1985; Watkins, 1985; Bralower, 1988), diagnostic\nmarker beds combined with prominent features in the y13Corg record allow correlation between sections.

    "text": "The long-term positive excursion in y13C at the CTB is thought to result from large-scale burial of 12C-enriched organic matter during OAE2 (e.g.,\nScholle and Arthur, 1980; Schlanger et al., 1987;\nArthur et al., 1988). Buried organic matter is both\nmarine and terrestrial in origin (e.g., Hasegawa et al.,\n2003). However, the relationship between the timing\nof the positive isotope excursion and the deposition of\norganic matter is complex. For example, in the WIS\nsections organic matter contents and accumulation\nrates actually decrease at the onset, then increase in the\nmiddle of the positive isotope excursion (Figs. 2 and\n3) (Pratt, 1984, 1985; Schlanger et al., 1987). Tsikos et\nal. (2004) presented detailed carbon isotope and TOC\ndata from Tarfaya, Morocco that showed consistently\nhigh TOC values several meters above and below the\nbase of the positive isotope excursion. A much clearer relationship between TOC and y13C is observed in the Bottaccione section of Umbria, Italy, where the base\nof the carbonaceous Bonarelli horizon lies at the onset\nof the positive carbon isotope excursion (Tsikos et al.,\n2004). The ultimate cause of the positive carbon\nisotope excursion may involve an increase in the\nproportion of carbon buried as organic matter rather\nthan biogenic carbonate (e.g., Kump and Arthur,\n1999) as a result of increased burial rates of organic\nmatter in pelagic locations, while negligible changes\nin Corg burial rates occurred in epicontinental regions.\nThere has been considerable discussion in the\nliterature about the interpretation of small features in\ncarbon isotope stratigraphies. Pratt (1985) and Pratt\nand Threlkeld (1984) were the first to attempt detailed correlation of changes on the order of 0.5–1x in sections from WIS. Menegatti et al. (1998) used\nsimilar terminology for Aptian carbon isotope varia-\ntions in sections from Tethys and their results were\napplied by Bralower et al. (1999) in Mexican sections\nand Herrle et al. (2003) in sections from southern\nFrance. The investigation of Tsikos et al. (2004)\nadvanced our understanding of the biostratigraphy\nand chemostratigraphy of the CTB interval. The highresolution y13Corg records from Eastbourne and Tarfaya show remarkable similarity to those from\nCuba and Rock Canyon (Fig. 6). We have adapted the\nterminology of Pratt (1985) to correlate features in all\nof the sections. An intriguing question that cannot be\naddressed at this time given the lack of more detailed\nchemical data concerns the significance of these small\nchanges. Nonetheless, the small features in carbon\nisotope stratigraphy have the potential to allow high-\nresolution correlation between CTB sections that\ncannot be achieved using other techniques. The Bass River y13Corg curve does not show the same features (Fig. 4) possibly because sedimentation rates are much\nhigher in this section (Sugarman et al., 1999) and the\ninvestigated interval lies close to the CTB.\nPrevious investigations have noted that the magnitude of the excursion in y13Corg (Dy 13Corg) is nearly double (~4x) that of the excursion in y13Ccarb (Dy13Ccarb) (~2x) (Arthur et al., 1988; Hayes et al., 1989; Freeman and Hayes, 1992). Such differences\nhave been explained by increased pCO2 (Arthur et al., 1988; Kump and Arthur, 1999), and changes in the\nspecies composition of primary producers and the\nnature of food chains (Hayes et al., 1989). Data\ncollected here support the general conclusion that Dy13Corg exceeds Dy 13Ccarb. However, differences in Dy13Corg and Dy 13Ccarb at Cuba and Bass River appear less than in previous investigations. At Cuba Dy13Corg and Dy 13Ccarb values are ~4.5x and ~3.2x, respectively (Fig. 2), while at Bass River, Dy13Corg is only ~1.5x (Fig. 4). Although the change in y13Ccarb at Bass River cannot be determined due to diagenetic\nalteration, the low Dy13Corg is consistent with conclusions from Cuba. Studies of Eastbourne and\nTarfaya sections by Tsikos et al. (2004) also showed smaller differences between Dy13Corg and Dy 13Ccarb values than in previous investigations (Arthur et al.,\n1988; Hayes et al., 1989).\nThe ultimate causes of OAE2 remain elusive.\nIncreases in primary production, water column strat-\nification, and submarine volcanism have been pro-\nposed as triggers (Arthur et al., 1987; Leckie et al.,\n1998; Sinton and Duncan, 1997; Sinton et al., 1998). In\naddition, for other OAEs, dissociation of methane\nhydrate has been invoked as a casual mechanism (e.g.,\nHesselbo et al., 2000; Jahren et al., 2001; Beerling et\nal., 2002), and this alternative must be considered for\nOAE2. Volcanism and hydrate dissociation are attrac-\ntive hypotheses because these processes should,\ntheoretically at least, perturb climate as well as ocean\nchemistry. For example, dissociation of large quantities\nof methane hydrates in oceanic bottomwaters would be\nfollowed by oxidation of the gas to CO2 in the ocean and/or atmosphere. Oxidation of sufficient methane in\nthe ocean could result in widespread anoxia (e.g.,\nHesselbo et al., 2000). Extensive submarine hydro-\nthermal activity might release large quantities of\nmicronutrients such as iron into the ocean stimulating\nproductivity (e.g., Sinton and Duncan, 1997).\nBoth volcanic and hydrate triggers have draw-\nbacks, however. For example, there is some doubt that\nhydrate would have been stable in bottom waters in the late Cenomanian, at close to peak bgreenhouseQ temperatures (i.e., Huber et al., 1995, 2002). There is\nalso some disagreement of the age of the Caribbean\nLIP and its correlation with OAE2. Decreasing\nstrontium isotope values that might correspond to\nthe Caribbean LIP lie somewhat above OAE2\n(Bralower et al., 1997; Jones and Jenkyns, 2001;\nMcArthur et al., 2001). However, ages of basalt from\ndrillsites and obducted terranes extend back to 93.5\nMa (Sinton et al., 1998; Snow et al., in press) and thus\noverlap with OAE2. Moreover, metal anomalies,\npossible signals of hydrothermal anomalies are found\nin strata corresponding to the carbon isotope excur-\nsion at Rock Canyon (Snow et al., in press) and other\nsections from the WIS (Orth et al., 1993). Thus a\nvolcanic signal could realistically lie within the\nresulting carbon isotopic records.\nAny changes in the flux of mantle CO2 or dissociation of hydrate methane would change the\nisotopic ratios of inorganic (i.e., biogenic calcite) and\norganic carbon in oceanic reservoirs. Likewise, any\nmechanism that alters the proportion of carbon buried\nas organic matter and carbonate would change the\nisotopic ratios of reactive oceanic and atmospheric\ncarbon. Diagenesis, on the other hand, is more likely\nto alter the isotopic signal of sedimentary carbonates\nand organic matter in a different fashion. Typically, y13Ccarb are more susceptible to alteration during burial (e.g., Anderson and Arthur, 1983; Pratt, 1985); however, y13Corg values could be altered significantly by outcrop weathering. The focus of the high-\nresolution studies of outcrop and core sections is to\ndetermine whether negative isotope anomalies from\nvolcanic sources (i.e., Caribbean LIP) or methane\nhydrate dissociation occur at the CTB.\nLarge, abrupt negative shifts in y13Ccarb observed in the Bass River, Cuba, and Rock Canyon sections\nare generally not found in y13Corg: (1) benthic foraminifera Gavelinella and Epistomina from Bass River show abrupt 8x and 5x negative excursions, respectively, in the 1939–1941-ft interval (Fig. 4). The y13Corg curve does not show any significant changes in the equivalent interval. Moreover, SEM\nimages show sparry calcite infilling foraminiferal\nchambers in the intervals with highly negative y13Ccarb values (Fig. 5). Specimens observed in samples from above and below the y13Ccarb excursion interval, while poorly preserved, show less evidence\nof recrystallization and little chamber infilling. (2) A\n5x shift in the y13Ccarb at the 270-cm level in the Cuba section does not correspond to changes in y13Corg values (Fig. 2). (3) The y 13Ccarb curve at Rock Canyon shows large fluctuations in the lower 220 cm\nof section (Fig. 3). This fluctuation becomes significant in the OAE interval. The y13Corg data show one significant excursion in the lower 220 cm of section.\nChanges in the type of organic matter preserved within the rock can affect the y13Corg signature. RockEval analysis of samples from the lower 220 cm\nof the Rock Canyon section indicate that organicmatter\nis both marine and terrestrial in origin, but no\nsignificant variations that could result in changes in y13Corg values are found (Michael Arthur, personal communication, 2002). The y13Ccarb fluctuations in the lower 220 cm of section correspond to lithologic cycles\nin the Rock Canyon outcrop. The relationship between y13Ccarb and%CaCO3 clearly shows lithologic control. For example, limestone samples (higher CaCO3 content) generally have lower y13Ccarb values than marl and shale samples (lower CaCO3 content). However, a relationship between lithology and y13Corg is not apparent. Our y13Corg and y 13Ccarb curves generally replicate data from the Pueblo core in Pratt (1985) and\nArthur et al. (1988), but at higher resolution. The one\nmajor difference, the significant negative shift in y13Corg between 50 cm and 164 cm, could result from oxidation of organic matter in the outcrop samples.\nWe conclude that oxidation of organic matter (y13C~ 25x) and incorporation of light carbon into recrystallized calcium carbonate accounts for abrupt, negative shifts in the y13Ccarb record at Rock Canyon and Cuba, and the benthic foraminiferal y13Ccarb record in the Bass River borehole. A similar mechanism is probable for the negative shift in y13Ccarb observed by Scott et al. (1998) in the Bounds core.\nThe absence of correlative shifts in y13Corg and y13Ccarb in the three sections investigated as well as those studied by Hasegawa et al. (2003) and Tsikos et\nal. (2004) does not support hydrate dissociation or\nvolcanism as a trigger for OAE2. However, Snow et\nal. (in press) found enrichments of trace elements near\nthe base of OAE2 in several sections including Rock\nCanyon, interpret them as a signature of Caribbean\nvolcanism, and suggest that volcanism played a direct\nrole in initiating OAE2. It is possible that input of\nmantle CO2 at the onset of the Caribbean eruptions was insufficient to cause a signal in marine carbon\nreservoirs or that such a signal was obscured by burial\nof large quantities of organic matter in the deep ocean\nat the onset of OAE2."

    "text": "High-resolution carbon isotope stratigraphy of\nthree sections across the base of OAE2 near the\nCenomanian–Turonian boundary shows the well-\ndocumented positive excursion. Comparison with\nTOC data suggests that the carbon isotopic signal\nis driven by changes in the burial rates of organic\nmatter in the deep ocean rather than in shallow marine locations. Small (0.5–1.0x) changes in y13Corg can be correlated between sections allowing for higher resolution correlation than available using traditional biostratigraphy. Coupled y13Corg and y13Ccarb records do not support input of mantle CO2 or dissociation of methane hydrate at the onset of the event. Thus, our data do not support a\nvolcanic or hydrate trigger for OAE2. It is possible\nthat the mantle carbon signal corresponding to the\nCaribbean LIP was masked by the burial of organic\nmatter at the onset of OAE2."

  "abstractText": "Carbon isotope measurements have been made on bulk carbonate and organic matter in three sections across the Cenomanian– Turonian boundary. The stratigraphy records the positive carbon isotopic excursion that is associated with the major oceanic anoxic event (OAE2). Comparison of TOC and isotopic data in sections from a range of different environments suggests that the positive excursion is a response to increased burial of organic matter in the deep ocean. The lack of coupled negative shifts in yCorg and y Ccarb records at the onset of OAE2 does not support a causal role for volcanism or methane hydrate dissociation. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.
