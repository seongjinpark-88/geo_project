The reconstruction of the large palaeoclimatic modification is based on the synthesis of multiple sedimentological, palaeobotanical, pedological, and geochemical proxies. The Triassic climate fluctuations were generally fast in nature and were probably associated with a latitudinal shift of the monsoon belts. During the Triassic, the Dolomites were placed at an intertropical northern latitude of about 16–18° and were generally dominated by dry climate and elevated temperature. At least five pulses toward moister climate are however documented, dated to Early Olenekian, Middle Anisian, Late Ladinian, “Middle” Carnian, and Late Norian times. Within this variable climatic scenario, the carbonate systems record a global evolutionary trend from Late Permian–Early Triassic regional shelves, rich in loose micrites and bio-calcarenites, to Anisian–Ladinian, synsedimentary cemented, steep sided (35–40°), high-relief platforms, and back to Carnian low angle ramps. Moist transgressive episodes were surprisingly prone to the spreading of corals and other colonial reef organisms, probably because of the reduced space competition by syndepositional cementation structures. The PermoTriassic boundary extinction dramatically impacted on the calcified organism communities, but the carbonate depositional architecture nevertheless stayed almost unaffected through the boundary. The Early Triassic and earliest Anisian were commonly associated with hyperhaline, sometimes evaporitic conditions. Intervals of moister climate and efficient river discharge are however documented by earliest Induan and early Olenekian sediments. The latter terrigenous deposits matched a crisis in the carbonate production. After a return to arid conditions, during the Anisian, a fluctuation toward moister climate developed, associated to a massive continental vegetation cover. The Anisian tectonic activation of the region fragmented the previous carbonate shelf, triggering the development of three generations of fast prograding, but globally backstepping, isolated platforms, recording an increasing role of the synsedimentary cementation. A dry climate dominated the Late Anisian and Early Ladinian interval. At the time, a fast subsidence pulse was associated with platform drowning and basinal anoxia. Only a few aggrading pinnacles were able to survive, providing the nuclei for larger prograding platforms. During a dry climate interval, massive syndepositional cementation generated a major source of carbonate. Carbonate production stayed active through the Ladinian magmatic phase, but the onset of volcanism was associated with a large modification in the platform carbonate facies, which became dominated by automicrites. Moist climate phases are well documented again during the Late Ladinian, followed by a return to dry conditions. The Late Ladinian–Early Carnian platforms prograded toward the eastern Dolomites depocentre, eventually infilling almost the whole of the accommodation space. The middle portion of the Carnian recorded renewed, sharply moist phases, associated with the demise of the rimmed platforms and with the return to loose sediment ramps. At least four separated humid fluctuations can be identified in this Carnian interval alone. Climate then returned to persistent aridity, until the Late Norian moist phase.\neotema.it (S.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "The geological landscape of the Southern Alpine Dolomites (Figs. 1 and 2) is dominated by thick Triassic platforms, often well preserving both their depositional geometry and sedimentary facies. Since the Nineteenth Century seminal realisation (von Richthofen, 1860; von Mojsisovics, 1879) of the biogenic, “reefal” nature of the succeeding\ngenerations of buildups (Fig. 3), the region has become a classic research area for the understanding of the carbonate platforms (e.g. Bosellini, 1984; Hardie et al., 1986; Rudolph et al., 1989; Kenter, 1990; Schlager and Keim, 2009; and references therein). Bio-evolutionary trends and ecological change played a major role in the shaping of these bio-controlled edifices. The ecological equilibria affecting the carbonate production were particularly sensitive to climate fluctuations. The Permian and Triassic Periods were traditionally considered as dominated by a long-lasting aridity, throughout large portions of the Pangaea; growing evidence is however gathering that this generally dry framework was punctuated by episodes of moister climate (Simms and Ruffell, 1989; Mutti and Weissert, 1995; Twitchett and Wignall, 1996; Balog et al., 1999; Rigo et al., 2007). Humid phases are well witnessed also by the Dolomites successions (Kustatscher and van Konijnenburg-van Cittert, 2005; Keim et al., 2006; Roghi et al., 2006; Farabegoli et al., 2007; Hornung et al., 2007a,b; Posenato, 2008a,b). During the Triassic, the Dolomites area was located at the western termination of the Palaeo-Neo-Tethys seas (Fig. 2), at a northern intertropical latitude of about 15–18° (Muttoni et al., 2004). The area was therefore sensitive to the latitudinal shift of climate belts. The region is particularly well suited to provide an integrated climate record, through the interdisciplinary synthesis of multiple proxies (Figs. 3 and 11). Deep-water units can be often well correlated with shallow marine and continental successions, supporting the reconstructionof lateral environmental gradients. The evidence deriving from silicate and carbonate palaeosols can be integrated with the sedimentological and ecological records provided by platform and basinal carbonate facies and fossil biota. Pollens and plant remains are well preserved, both within continental and marine strata, and are particularly valuable for their providing accurate climatic information\n(Figs. 4 and 7). High sedimentation rates, detailed biostratigraphy and geochronology enable high temporal resolution, documenting the fast geological pace of the climate change. The Dolomites therefore offer a valuable opportunity to unravel the role played by climate in the changing carbonate platform dynamics. Many other factors however interacted with climate in the shaping of these buildups, particularly the violent tectono-magmatic evolution of the area, which largely influenced the terrigenous input and the creation of accommodation space. This contribution is therefore aimed at distilling the role played by climate in the depositional dynamics of these platforms. The research is grounded on the plentiful published information, integrated with our own research, mainly focused on facies analysis and 3D reconstruction of the carbonate bodies. In order to frame the available palaeoclimate information, the first part of the contribution provides an overview of the Triassic stratigraphy of the region; the palaeoclimate information is then synthesised in the second portion of the paper."

Loose micritic and bioclastic calcarenites dominate the carbonate fraction and no buildups or early cemented carbonates were reported. The sedimentation rates almost matched the creation of accommodation space, globally keeping the area by sea level for several millions of years."

    "heading": "2.1.1. Lower Triassic terrigenous–carbonate sediments (Werfen Formation)",
    "text": "The Lower Triassic consists of terrigenous–carbonate successions, originally probably ranging from 250 to 600 m in thickness. The formation accumulated into storm-dominated shelf-ramp systems, (width N500 km). The unit records low bathymetric gradients, dipping toward the east (Bosellini, 1968; Farabegoli and Viel, 1982; Broglio Loriga et al., 1983, 1990; Twitchett and Wignall, 1996). The carbonate fraction generally prevails over the terrigenous one, but within a peculiar siliciclastic member (Campil Mb). The carbonate fraction consists of micritic and calcarenitic lithologies; syndepositional cements are of very limited importance and no bio-constructed facies are known. The carbonate grains are dominated by peloids, mollusc skeletals, and intraclasts. Ooids are often ferruginous in nature and are abundant only at discrete intervals (Tesero Horizon, Oolite a Gasteropodi Mb, CencenigheMb). Hyperhaline tidal flat facies are dominated by fine-grained dolostones and dolomitic marls, often associated with sulphate minerals (Andraz Horizon; upper portions of the Siusi and San Lucano Mbs). Similar hyperhaline sediments are however lacking in the central terrigenous portion of the formation\n(Campil Mb). The unit records important bio-evolutionary, ecological, and climatic change (Farabegoli and Viel, 1982; Broglio Loriga et al., 1990; De Zanche et al., 1993; Neri and Stefani, 1998; Neri et al., 2007). The lowermost oolitic beds (Tesero Horizon) witness the Permian– Triassic boundary extinction (Benton and Twitchett, 2003; Erwin, 2006; Farabegoli et al., 2007; and references therein). These beds grade into subtidal micrites, preserving strongly oligotypic survivor faunae (Mazzìn Mb; Broglio Loriga et al., 1983, 1990). Ichnological structures are also poorly diversified and largely spaced, even at middle–upper levels of the formation (e.g. Campil Mb; Twitchett and Wignall, 1996). Faunae become comparatively more diversified moving up section (e.g. Siusi Mb; Broglio Loriga et al., 1983, 1990)."

    "heading": "2.1.2. Lower Middle Triassic carbonates (Lower Serla Dolomite)",
    "text": "The Lower Anisian mainly consists of dolomites (Fig. 1) accumulated into hyperhaline waters (Lower Serla (Unter Sarl) Dolomite; De Zanche and Farabegoli, 1982; De Zanche et al., 1992; SenowbariDaryan et al., 1993). The formation is likely to have been deposited throughout the Dolomites, but during the following Anisian it was\neroded out, in wide western portion of the region. The unit grades westward into sulphate–dolomite alternations, with some argillaceous intercalations (Carniola di Bovegno; Assereto and Casati, 1965). The sedimentary facies analysis suggests a low gradient ramp (0.1– 0.4 m/km; width N500 km), still recording an eastward bathymetric\ndeepening, associated with a stratigraphic thickness increase, from 50 to 200 m (De Zanche and Farabegoli, 1982; Gianolla et al., 1998a). The unit is formed by subtidal micrites, intraclastic shoal calcarenites, and peritidal stromatolitic dolostones. The bioclastic fraction is less abundant than in the Lower Triassic; oolitic calcarenites are locally\nabundant; syndepositional cements are poorly developed. Dasycladacean algae are common, and fossil assemblages record a reduced diversity, witnessing ecologically stressed environments (Pisa et al., 1978)."

    "heading": "2.2. Three Anisian generations of independent carbonate platform and terrigenous–carbonate basinal units",
    "text": "The top surface of the Lower Anisian regional platform is matched with a sharp differentiation of the eastern and western Dolomites stratigraphy, associated with the appearance of high relief, isolated carbonate buildups and deep-water basins (Figs. 1 and 11). This evolution was induced by the starting of an active transtensional tectonics (Doglioni, 1987; De Zanche et al., 1992). The Anisian of the eastern area records three depositional sequences (Fig. 3), each framing an individual platform generation (Bechstädt and Brandner, 1970; De Zanche et al., 1992, 1993; Rüffer and Zühlke, 1995; Gianolla et al., 1998a; Neri and Stefani, 1998; Bosellini et al., 2003). Each sequence shows a similar architecture, with fluvial conglomerates, followed by transgressive argillaceous–calcareous sediments, and then by basinal deposits and progradational platform carbonates. The western region on the contrary preserves only the very last generation of platforms.\n2.2.1. The first isolated platforms (Monte Rite Formation) In the eastern Dolomites, the oldest discordance surface is covered by continental conglomerates (Piz da Peres Conglomerate; De Zanche et al., 1992) and by transgressive terrigenous–carbonate sediments, sometimes associated with gypsum deposits (Gracilis Formation; Calcari Scuri del Coll'Alto; Pisa et al., 1978; De Zanche and Farabegoli, 1982). The transgressive unit records the last oolitic calcarenites known from Triassic pre-volcanic successions. This formation is rich in green algae and crinoidal debris and often encompasses lenticular biostromes. In several areas, the transgressive beds grade into open shelf marls (upper portion of the Calcari Scuri del Coll'Alto), and then into deeper water mudstones (lower part of the Dont Fm), recording the onset of the long-lived Eastern Dolomites Basin (Gianolla et al., 1998a). At other places, the transgressive biostromes expand upward into thick (200–350 m) isolated platforms (Monte Rite Fm), providing the oldest high-relief buildups known from the western Tethys. Platform-top and margin facies are rich in micritic and automicritic\nfacies and in marine phreatic cements; slope deposits largely consist of calcarenites and breccias. The rich platform biota show abundant dasycladacean algae, crinoids, molluscs, brachiopods, bryozoans, calcareous sponges, foraminifers, calcimicrobial structures and encrusting problematica, such as Tubiphytes. Platform bodies can be capped by a well developed karstic surface (Assereto et al., 1977; Farabegoli and Guasti, 1980; Neri et al., 2007).\n2.2.2. Well-cemented platform carbonates with diversified biota (Upper Serla Dolomite)\nThe boundary surface is covered by fluvial conglomerates (Voltago Conglomerate), followed by transgressive siltstones, marls, and encrinitic micrites (Recoaro Limestone; De Zanche et al., 1992). This latter unit preserves the oldest volcanic ashes known in the region. The new platforms (Upper Serla (Sarl) Dolomite; Blendinger et al., 1984; Senowbari-Daryan et al., 1993; Zühlke, 2000; Fig. 4) show a thickness of about 50–100 m and a diameter of often just a few kilometres. These carbonates are volumetrically dominated by progradational slope deposits, generally showing a top-lap geometry and a clinostratification dip of about 15–25°. Platform-top beds are rich in dasycladacean algae fragments, oncoids and well-cemented intraclasts; large tepee structures are also found. Margin facies include automicrites and pervasive phreatic cements. Slope units are formed by breccias and crinoidal calcarenites, incorporating resedimented platform margin olistoliths (Blendinger et al., 1984). Platform fossil associations are diversified in composition, encompassing encrusting foraminifera, Tubiphytes, chaetetid porifera, bryozoans, palecypods, serpulids, brachiopods and crinoids. Corals are rare but noteworthy, being the oldest in the Southern Alps Mesozoic (Bechstädt and Brandner, 1970; SenowbariDaryan et al., 1993). In other areas, the transgressive successions grade into basinal deposits (Dont Fm), for the first time rich in pelagic organisms (ammonoids and thin-shelled pelecypods). In the depocentre area, this basinal unit directly overlies the former deep-water sediments. The sequence top is marked by a karstified surface in platform successions, which correlates basinward with turbiditic sandstones and debris flow conglomerates, enriched in continental plants remains and coal fragments (Dont Fm; Kustatscher and Roghi, 2006; Kustatscher et al., 2006, 2010-this issue)."

    "heading": "2.2.3. Algal rich platform carbonates (Contrìn Formation)",
    "text": "The following sequence is the only one preserved in both the eastern and western Dolomites. In the eastern portion of the region, the transgressive successions consists of nodular limestones and marls, with minor tephra intercalation (Monte Bivera Fm), grading into basinal claystones and micrites (Ambata Fm). In units recording shallower environments, fluvial conglomerates (Richthofen Conglomerate; Fig. 4) pass into transgressive terrigenous–carbonate deposits (Morbiac Limestone), in turn followed by platform (Contrìn Fm) or basinal (Moena Fm) carbonates. The platform thickness normally ranges between 50 and 120 m; but it can locally reach 500 m. Platform-top bodies are 1–20 km in width and are flanked by massive looking or clinostratified slope deposits. Clinostratifications are planar in shape, with inclination of about 15–20°, and often show top-lap geometry. Late diagenetic dolomitisation and recrystallisation often destroy the primary features. Where depositional facies can be detected, biota are impoverished, boundstones are rarer, and syndepositional cements less pervasive than in the previous platforms; dasycladacean algae are generally abundant. Margin shoal facies appear to be dominated by algal rich calcarenites. In many sections, both the transgressive unit (Calcari Scuri di Morbiac) and the upper, retrogradational portion of the platforms (Contrin Fm) pass into dys-anoxic basinal carbonates, enriched in organic carbon (Moena Fm), consisting of micrites, calcarenites, breccias, and platform derived olistoliths."

    "heading": "2.3. Anisian–Ladinian, deepening basin and pervasively cemented, highrelief platform units",
    "text": "The uppermost Anisian and the Lower Ladinian are dominated by thick isolated carbonate platforms (Sciliar Fm; Bosellini, 1984). Detailed facies analysis of many of these bodies is prevented by the late diagenetic dolomitisation, but several other edifices preserve their calcareous facies (e.g. Marmolada and Latemar platforms; Leonardi, 1967; Bosellini and Rossi, 1974; Gaetani et al., 1981; Russo et al., 2000). The early portion of the formation records a period of very fast subsidence and creation of empty accommodation space, associated with the development of many aggradational or retrogradational pinnacles, with a maximum thickness of about 5–600 m and a diameter of just 2–4 km (Blendinger et al., 2004; Brack et al., 2007). These pinnacles can be terminated by a drowning surface or be surrounded by a younger progradational unit. These bodies consist of poorly stratified subtidal micrites. Early slope units are rich in debris flow sediments and slumped micritic beds and show concave clinostratifications, recording a dip angle increase through time, from less than 10° to 25° (Bosellini and Stefani, 1991; Maurer and Schlager, 2003). The lower portion of the coeval basinal deposits consists of anoxic laminated shales and micrites, enriched in organic carbon (Plattenkalke Mb of the Buchenstein (Livinallongo) Fm). The following platform-top units are formed bywell stratified successions, punctuated by high frequency emersion surfaces (e.g. Latemar; Goldhammer et al., 1987; Egenhoff et al., 1999; Zühlke et al., 2003; Fig. 5). The subtidal units mainly consist of calcarenites, rich in dasycladacean algae and diversified mollusc faunae. Automicrites, peloidal thrombolites, pervasive phreatic cements, subtidal tepees and stromatactis structures are common (Russo et al., 2000; Maurer et al., 2003). Supratidal facies show vadose cements, synsedimentary dolomite crusts and carbonate palaeosols (Assereto and Kendall, 1977; Bosellini and Stefani, 1991; Egenhoff et al., 1999). The slope deposits dominate the late pre-volcanic platform volume, recording a fast progradation phase of even more than 5 km, during a phase of reduced subsidence. These bodies are characterised by very steep (30–40°) planar clinostratifications, formed by coarse breccias (Gaetani et al., 1981; Bosellini, 1984; Bosellini and Stefani, 1991; Maurer, 2000). The margin and upper slope facies recording the late aggradational and the progradational phases witness a sharp increase in the syndepositional cementation importance (Harris, 1993; Egenhoff et al., 1999; Russo et al., 2000). Large spheroidal concretions of fibrous crystals (evinospongiae Auct.; Gaetani et al., 1981; Blendinger, 2001; Russo et al., 2000, 2006) are associated with inter-clast phreatic\nfibrous cements. Syndepositional cement can formmore than the 50% of the rock volume. These facies are rich in microbialitic crusts, stromatolites, skeletal cyanobacteria, Tubiphytes, encrusting foraminifera, sponges, sphinctozoans, molluscs, and crinoids; corals are rarely found. (Harris, 1994a,b). Coeval basinal sediments consist of nodular cherty limestones, rich in thin-shelled pelecypods and radiolarians, with subordinated acidic tephra intercalations (Knollenkalke Mb of the Buchenstein Fm, less than 35 m thick). Terrestrial plant remains and terrigenous materials are scanty; platform derived granular sediment almost absent, but at base of slope settings (Bosellini and Stefani, 1991; Brack et al., 2000; Maurer and Schlager, 2003; Maurer et al., 2003). Stratification patterns are laterally persistent, over distances in the order of hundreds of kilometres (Brack and Muttoni, 2000; Maurer et al., 2003) recording a sedimentary decoupling between basin and platform systems."

    "heading": "2.4.1. Syn-volcanic automicrite-rich platforms",
    "text": "The onset of the Ladinian magmatism was matched with major environmental modification and sharp changes in the platform carbonate facies. The large cement structures, dominating the previous units, almost disappeared from the Dolomites, whereas loose bio-intra-clastic calcarenites, rich in coated grains and automicritic clasts, became common. Ooids, absent since the Early Anisian, reappeared at this level. Resedimented calcarenites, micrites, and terrestrial plant debris are common in the basinal successions (Acquatona Fm). The sedimentary units generally witness an ongoing carbonate production, coeval to, or immediately following, the magmatic activity (De Zanche et al., 1993; Gianolla et al., 1998a), even in close proximity of volcanic centres (e.g. Catinaccio–Rosengarten Platform; Stefani and Caputo, 2002). In the western Dolomites, the Lower Ladinian platforms are nevertheless capped by a discordance surface, associated with the volcanism climax (e.g. Schlern; Fig. 6). Platforms are truncated by scalloped surfaces, cross cut by extension fractures or magmatic dykes (Bosellini et al., 1982; Riva and Stefani, 2002), and onlapped by pillow lavas and volcaniclastics (Bosellini, 1984; Brandner et al., 1991). Although volcanic activity did not directly affect the eastern Dolomites, the carbonate platforms of this region recorded important facies change, similar to those observed in the western Dolomites, with a sharp reduction in abundance of the large sinsedimentary cement structures (De Zanche and Gianolla, 1995; Jadoul et al., 2002). In this area, the uninterrupted carbonate production supported a continuous progradation over deep-water hemipelagites and early volcaniclastics (Acquatona Fm, Fernazza Fm)."

    "heading": "2.4.2. Post-volcanic platforms and terrigenous–carbonate basinal successions",
    "text": "The post volcanic platforms (Cassian Dolomite) are dominated by prograding slope deposits, associated with shallowing basinal successions, recording the eventual infilling of almost the whole of the accommodation space. The progradation was punctuated by repeated interruptions of the carbonate growth, associated with the onlapping of basinal sediment onto deactivated slopes. Widespread late diagenetic dolomitisation often prevents any accurate facies analysis. Calcareous platform blocks (“Cipit boulders”), resedimented into low permeability basinal units, are therefore valuable for their preserving primary microfacies (Brandner et al., 1991; Russo et al., 1997, 2000). Several primary features are however still visible even within some dolomitised platforms (e.g. Sella Platform; Keim and Schlager, 1999, 2001). The buildup facies are comparatively similar to the synvolcanic ones. Where the primary platform-top facies can be recognised, they consist of bio-intraclastic calcarenites, punctuated by inter-supratidal levels, showing fenestral porosity, vadose cements,\ntepees, and stromatolites (Bonaga et al., 1989; Bosellini et al., 1996). In margin and upper slope facies, large oncoids (Sphaerocodium Auct.), columnar stromatolites, calcareous sponges, branching corals, and crinoids are often visible. Slope units show concave clinostratifications and consist of breccias and calcarenites with some micrites (Kenter, 1990). Base of slope deposits are enriched in resedimented bio-intraclastic calcarenites. The coeval basinal successions (Wengen Fm, S. Cassian Fm) record a fining and shallowing upward trend, associated to a progressive decrease in the volcaniclastite abundance and to an increase in the carbonate fraction.\nThe early post-volcanic units encompass carbonate megabreccias, interbedded within basinal volcaniclastics (e.g. Passo Gardena Megabreccia; Stefani et al., 2004). In several areas, the Cassian buildups are subdivided into two generations (Cassian 1 and Cassian 2 Platforms; De Zanche et al., 1993) by a discordance surface, onlapped by basinal terrigenous beds, enriched in continental plant remains. The younger, Lower Carnian platforms (Cassian Dolomite) are dominated by large volumes of progradational slope breccias, recording a decrease through time in the clinostratification dip angle, from 30–35° to less than 10° (Bosellini, 1984; Schlager et al., 1991). The late platforms shows low angle slopes, rich in micrites and bio-intraclastic calcarenites (e.g. Lastoi di Formìn). The Cassian platforms are capped by a subaerial discordance surface, often showing karstic features and mature palaeosols, associated with a time gap, the duration of which decreases eastward (Preto and Hinnov, 2003; Stefani et al., 2004; Neri et al., 2007)."

The deposits are grouped into the Heiligkreuz Formation (Keim and Brandner, 2001; Keim et al., 2001; Neri et al., 2007; cf. Dürrenstein Fm in Bosellini, 1984; De Zanche et al., 1993), which covers both platform carbonates (Cassian Dolomite) and former basinal successions (upper portion of the S. Cassiano Fm (Figs. 8 and 9)). The formation thickness varies from 0 to 250 m. The basal portion of the unit encompasses biostromes with diversified colonial corals, stromatoporoids, and spongiae, sometimes preserving their aragonite mineralogy at a\nsurprisingly pristine state (Alpe di Specie area; Scherer, 1977; Russo et al., 1991; Dibona area; Senowbari-Daryan et al., 2001). Colonial coral associations start to show “modern Mesozoic” features (Stanley, 2003). The biostromes never coalesce to form continuous platform bodies. The lower regressive portion of the formation (Borca Mb;\nStefani et al., 2004; Neri et al., 2007) grades from terrigenous– calcareous to purely carbonate facies. Synsedimentary cements are scanty and facies are dominated by loose micritic and calcarenitic sediments. Plant debris is abundant and diversified. The upper portion of the member often consists of oolites and stromatolitic peritidal\nassian Dolomite) is visible, showing peritidal levels and recording an aridity dominated ith some argillaceous content, evolving into mixed terrigenous carbonate successions t the west of the Falzarego Pass.\ndolostones, capped by well developed moist climate polycyclic soils (Preto and Hinnov, 2003; Breda et al., 2009). The following transgressive unit is rich in terrigenous sediments, grading into biointraclastic and oolitic calcarenites (DibonaMb; Bosellini et al., 1982b; Preto and Hinnov, 2003; Neri et al., 2007) and nodular hemipelagic limestones. Some of the oldest known ambers come from palaeosols in the lower portion of this unit (Gianolla et al., 1998b; Roghi et al., 2006), revealing a great variety of previously unknown continental micro-organisms (Schmidt et al., 2006). Plant debris is abundant at many levels, to the point to form coal beds. The upper member of the formation records shallow-water bioclastic carbonates, laterally grading into terrigenous sediments (Lagazuoi Mb, Falzarego Mb; Neri et al., 2007). The formation is capped by a subaerial discordance surface, associated with dolomite breccias (Keim and Brandner, 2001)."

The remaining portions of the formation is dominated by red claystones, with caliche palaeosols, grading into sabkha and marginal marine facies, rich in sulphate evaporites and subordinated dolostones, with strongly impoverished mollusc faunae (Fig. 10).\nThe uppermost Carnian, the Norian and the Rhaetian stages consist of thick marginal marine dolostones (Dolomia Principale/Hauptdolomit), largely dominated by peritidal cycles (Bosellini, 1967; Bosellini\nand Hardie, 1988), sometimes showing tetrapod footprints (Mietto, 1988; Avanzini et al., 2001). The apparent lateral uniformity of facies is matched with major thickness variations, recording great changes in subsidence, from 220 m in the western Dolomites (Bosellini, 1967), to almost 2000 m, at their eastern border."

    "text": "The Upper Permian and Lower Triassic of the Dolomites (Section 2.1.1.) generally provide clear evidence of aridity. Marine sulphate evaporites are widespread in the Upper Permian of the centraleastern portion of the region (Bellerophon Fm; Bosellini and Hardie, 1973; Noé, 1987; Sremac, 2005), whereas the correlative western Dolomites coastal plain terrigenous sediments (upper portion of the Arenarie di Val Gardena) show caliche soils and evaporitic pseudomorphs. Lower Triassic inter-supratidal levels also often witness hyperhaline and evaporitic conditions, with sulphate concentrations (e.g. Andraz Horizon of the Werfen Fm; Broglio Loriga et al., 1983). Root and plant remains are lacking from the whole of the Lower Triassic. This lack could be related to climate preventing vegetation from colonizing the mainland areas, but it has to be pointed out that wood remains are extremely scanty throughout the world, during this time interval associated with the “global coal gap” (Retallack et al., 1996). The Upper Olenekian and the lowermost Anisian also record hyperhaline and evaporitic conditions (San Lucano Mb of the Werfen Fm; Lower Serla Dolomite; 2.1.2). In this interval, dolostones, bearing gypsum and halite pseudomorphs, laterally grade into sulphate– dolomite–terrigenous deposits, recording marginal marine, evaporitic environments (e.g. Carniola di Bovegno).\nAt discrete levels, the Lower Triassic however also provides evidence of moister conditions and efficient fluvial drainage, associated with high rainfall levels. The Permian–Triassic boundary is often considered as matched with a temporary shift towardmoister climate conditions (Farabegoli et al., 2007). The Palaeozoic–Mesozoic extinction event was associated with a severe perturbation in the carbon biogeochemical cycle, very likely to have affected the global climate framework, through an increased green house effect, induced by a reduction in the global biomass dimension (Payne et al., 2004). At the erathem boundary, a sharp negative shift in both the δ13C and the δ18O curves of carbonates is documented also in the Italian Southern Alps (Horacek et al., 2007; Kearsey et al., 2009). The diagenetic modification suggests some caution in the interpretation of these isotopic data from Italy, but measures on large brachiopod shells would suggest a latest Permian sea-water temperature of about 26– 29 °C (Kearsey et al., 2009). The existence of brackish environments in the earliest Triassic of the Dolomites was suggested by the interpretation of the peculiar bivalve and brachiopod associations of the Mazzin Member of the Werfen Formation. The ecological interpretation of the survivor faunae strongly depleted by the Permo-Triassic mass extinction however needs some caution. (Broglio Loriga et al., 1983; Twitchett, 1999; Posenato, 2008a). Kaolinite clays in the Lower Triassic may record penecontemporaneous intense pedogenesis, triggered by a moist climate, but they could also derive from older Palaeozoic units.\nLarge climatic fluctuations are recorded during the late Early Triassic at the over-regional scale, with a shift form a Smithian humid and hot climate to Spathian dryer conditions (Galfetti et al., 2007). The late Early Triassic transgression was associated with a massive input of micaceous siliciclastics and a crisis in the marine carbonate production, possibly induced by an increased influx of continental nutrients (Campil Mb of the Werfen Fm; Posenato, 2008b). These sediments witness a phase of efficient fluvial transport, recorded over wide areas, from the western Southern Alps to Hungary (Broglio\nLoriga et al., 1990). An efficient fluvial drainage system is recorded also by the coeval Bundsenstein units, accumulated into German basins (Aigner and Bachmann, 1992; Peron et al., 2005; Bourquin et al., 2006). In the Dolomites, the upper supratidal portion of the terrigenous Campil Member (Broglio Loriga et al., 1983) lacks evidence of evaporitic processes and arid pedogenesis. Continental tetrapod footprints were reported from this interval (Mietto, 1986), whereas they are unknown from the other emersion horizons of the sameWerfen Formation. The occurrence of this ichnofauna suggests a temporary improvement of the continental ecological framework, also probably associated with moister conditions. The following members of the Werfen Formation record a return to much dryer environments, well witnessed by the hyperhaline inter-supratidal horizons."

    "heading": "3.2. Anisian moist climate phases",
    "text": "The Anisian records a large excursion from an arid to a moist intertropical climate and vice versa. The sedimentary units (Section 2.2.1.) associated with the first isolated carbonate platforms still provide evidence of aridity. The early generation of fluvial conglomerates and sandstones (Piz da Peres Conglomerate) records wadidrywash conditions and is associated with well developed caliche soils and evaporitic minerals. The shallow marine transgressive deposits (Gracilis Fm) are poor in plant remains and contain gypsum crystals. In areas adjacent to the Dolomites (Val d'Adige, Valsugana, Recoaro areas), this interval encompasses a sulphate member (De Zanche and Farabegoli, 1988; Avanzini et al., 2007), recording frankly evaporitic conditions, developed in lagoon and marginal marine environments.\nThe following sequence (Section 2.2.2.) witnesses a sharp excursion toward moister conditions. The emersion surface capping the previous platforms (Monte Rite Fm) is associated with mature karstic features (Assereto et al., 1977; Farabegoli and Guasti, 1980). The coeval eastern Dolomites basinal siliciclastics (part of the Dont Formation) yield abundant plant remains. In these basinal units, the rich hygrophytic palaeobotanical and palynological associations document a widespread forest cover, associated with warm and moist climate conditions (Kustatscher et al., 2006; Kustatscher and Roghi, 2006; Kustatscher et al., 2010-this issue). Floral associations attributed to coastal, lowland, riverine, and upland environments witness a common humid nature and an efficient river flotation. Xerophytic taxa are absent (Kustatscher et al., 2010-this issue). The transgressive fluvial unit (Voltago Conglomerate) is enriched in clay and records root traces and spodic palaeosols, particularly in its lower part (Avanzini et al., 2007). The upper portion of the transgressive unit locally shows porous dolostones, with evaporitic mineral pseudomorphs, likely to record a temporary return to hyperhaline conditions. Plant remains return common in the following Recoaro Limestone, again enriched in moist climate florae and palinomorphs (Kustatscher et al., 2010-this issue, and references therein).\nThe basal portion of the following sequence (Section 2.2.3.) still recordsmoist climate signals, which however progressively fade away upsection. The basal boundary is locally associated with breccias and palaeo-caves, developed through karstic dissolution processes (Fig. 4). The following oxidized continental red conglomerate (Richthofen Conglomerate) is deprived of the mature, humid soils, visible in the previous unit, but also lacks evidence of pronounced aridity. In the following transgressive formation (Morbiac Fm), coal fragments and continental plant remains are still common, but they rarefy in the following intraplatform and open marine basinal units (Moena Fm, Monte Bivera Fm, Ambata Fm). This decrease in the plant remains abundance was also influenced by the increased distance from continental areas. In some supratidal levels of the coeval platforms (Contrìn Fm), pseudomorphs of evaporitic minerals were found, also suggesting drier conditions."

    "heading": "3.3. Late Anisian and Early Ladinian aridity dominated climate",
    "text": "The marine carbonates of the interval (Section 2.3.) are less prone to provide direct climate proxies than the previous continental and terrigenous influenced units. All the available clues however converge at suggesting a dry climate. In the basinal successions, the lower organic rich level (Plattenkalke) is dominated by marine organic matter (Type 1); plant remains and wood fragments are rare. The following cherty calcareous member (Knollenkalke) is poorer in organic fraction, and almost deprived of terrestrial vegetation remains. At the deposition time of these units, the widespread transgression had confined the emerging siliciclastic mainland at regions comparatively remote from the Dolomites. The increased distance of the source areas was able by itself to reduce the plant and terrigenous material abundance, but this scantiness is likely also to reflect a reduced continental vegetation cover, caused by aridity. In the platform-top successions, large tepee structures are well developed (Fig. 5), recording early diagenetic fast carbonate precipitation, probably associated to evaporative pumping mechanisms (Assereto and Kendall, 1977). Moulds of evaporitic minerals are associated with early diagenetic, inter-supratidal dolomite crusts. The thin calcisols, at high frequency emersion surfaces, are also compatible with an arid climate (Egenhoff et al., 1999). Supratidal levels are associated with reddish dolomitic marls, interpreted as intertropical arid soils (Gaetani et al., 1981). They derived from the subaerial alteration of acidic volcanic ashes (Pietra Verde Auct.), during period of non deposition (Hardie et al., 1986). Dissolved carbonates grains are also visible, suggesting the (seasonal?) alternation of arid and somewhat moister phases."

    "heading": "3.4. Late Ladinian and Early Carnian moist to arid fluctuations",
    "text": "The palaeoclimate record provided by the thick basaltic and immature volcaniclastic successions of the Upper Ladinian is confused by the strong tectono-magmatic influence. It is therefore difficult to separate the climate signal from the effects of the massive palaeogeographic and palaeoceanographic modification triggered by the tectono-magmatic event. Evidence is however available suggesting the occurrence of renewed moister climate episodes. Basinal units coeval to the onset of the basaltic volcanism (Acquatona Fm, Fernazza Fm) start to again show terrestrial plant remains. The Sciliar Formation top surface (Fig. 6) is locally karstified, recording fresh water availability (Assereto et al., 1977; Casati et al., 1982; Brandner et al., 1991; Jadoul et al., 2002). Synvolcanic terrigenous and volcaniclastic beds accumulated on top of previous carbonate platforms (e.g. Sciliar) show mature palaeosols, plant remains, coal fragments, and root structures. Early postvolcanic basinal volcaniclastics (Wengen Fm) encompass several levels largely enriched in plant fragments, particularly conifers. Both the plant remains and the hygrophytic sporomorphs suggests a widespread forest cover, supported by significant rainfall levels (Van der Eem, 1983; Kustatscher and van Konijnenburg-van Cittert, 2005).\nThe following, Early Carnian units record a return to dryer conditions, with the rarefying of continental vegetation remains in the basinal successions (upper portion of the Wengen Fm, San Cassiano Fm). The almost purely terrigenous basinal beds separating the two generations of Cassian platforms (Section 2.4.2.) are on the contrary sharply enriched in terrestrial plain remains, which return to be rarer in the following successions (upper portion of the S. Cassiano Fm). The coeval platform-top units lack any coal or plant content and are characterised by arid carbonate palaeosols and well developed pisoids and tepees (e.g. Cassian Dolomite platform-top succession near Falzarego Pass; Stefani et al., 2004; Fig. 9). Vadose cements are there well developed and evaporitic pseudomorphs visible. In southern areas (e.g. Passo Duran), coeval shallow-water and marginal\nmarine, terrigenous influenced units lack terrestrial vegetation remains and are associated with sulphate evaporites. Arid conditions are recorded also by western successions (Mutti andWeissert, 1995)."

    "heading": "3.5. “Middle Carnian” moist events",
    "text": "The Carnian ramp deposits (Heiligkreuz Fm; 2.5) well record the occurrence of major moist phases, which impacted on the whole of the sedimentological and palaeontological features of the interval (Gianolla et al., 1998b; Roghi et al., 2006; Rigo et al., 2007; Breda et al., 2009). The former carbonate platforms (Cassian Dolomite) are capped (Fig. 8) by mature palaeokarst features, such as caves and dolines, filled by argillaceous deposits and breccias (e.g. Lagazuoi Massif; Stefani et al., 2004; Neri et al., 2007). The coeval marine areas were subject to an increased coarse terrigenous influx. Claystones, siltstones, sandstones and conglomerates contain plant debris and coal beds (Fig. 7), testifying for a well developed vegetation cover. The related palynological assemblages are characterised by diversified hygrophytic elements, sometimes associated with a few xerophytic taxa. In the same stratigraphic interval, similar hygrophytic vegetation is documented in other areas from the Southern Alps and even at a supra-continental scale (Roghi, 2004). At a slightly later interval, dark claystones accumulated into remaining inter-platform depressions, preserving oligotypic faunae, with pelecypods (Unionites sp.) and brackish water ostracods (Keim et al., 2006). This argillaceous unit records an influx of continental fresh waters so strong to be able to dilute themarine waters influence in semi-enclosed depressions. In several intervals of the Heiligkreuz Formation, amber is abundant, in millimetre-sized droplets and grains (Roghi et al., 2006). The amber occurrence witnesses continental conifer woods. Good evidence for moist climate episodes is also provided by coeval palaeosols, showing well developed histic and spodic horizons (Preto and Hinnov, 2003; Breda et al., 2009). These pedogenetic features require a positive water budget to exist throughout the year. Phases of increased rainfall are suggested by similar palaeosol and geochemical features in both Southern Alpine and U.S.A. Interior sections (Breda et al., 2009). The humid palaeoclimate evidence collected from Southern and AustroAlpine units, Germanic basins, and other areas suggested the occurrence of a well developed “Carnian Pluvial Event” (Simms and Ruffell, 1989). The gathering of information from extra-Alpine areas demonstrated the supra-regional importance of this moist phase (Gianolla et al., 1998a; Roghi, 2004; Furin et al., 2006; Keim et al., 2006; Hornung et al., 2007a,b; Rigo et al., 2007). A more detailed analysis of the Heiligkreuz Formation suggests that this “event” has to be subdivided into several moist intervals, alternated to dryer phases. This interpretation is supported by the discontinuous, punctuated presence of humid palaeosols and palynological associations (Preto and Hinnov, 2003; Breda et al., 2009). At least three separated humid episodes were identified. Another moist interval is witnessed by the basal portion of the Upper Carnian terrigenous unit (Travenanzes Fm), where roots traces, plant remains, and humid palaeosols are again visible. In southern areas, this stratigraphic interval shows fluvial sandstones and conglomerates, recording an efficient drainage system."

The following dolomitic successions (Dolomia Principale) appear to record an arid climate, through a significant portion of the Norian. Evaporitic intervals are lacking in the Dolomites, but they are well known in the Apennine subsurface, were thick sulphate evaporites are known, sometime associated with halite accumulation (Burano Formation; Martinis and Pieri, 1964)."

    "heading": "4. Conclusions",
    "text": "The complex stratigraphic units of the Dolomites, framed within a high resolution chronological framework, offer to the researchers a valuable opportunity to unravel the complex linkage of climate fluctuations and carbonate sedimentary dynamics. The interdisciplinary synthesis of the different palaeoclimate proxies provided by the Dolomites enabled the general evolutionary trends of the Triassic regional climate to be reconstructed (Fig. 11). The aridity dominated framework was punctuated by several sharply moister phases. The variable depositional styles of the carbonate platforms can be therefore correlated with their changing climatic framework. Climate certainly influenced the carbonate production by controlling the temperature, salinity, oxygen and carbon dioxide content of seawaters and the influx of terrigenous sediments and nutrients. In this tectono-magmatically active region, the complex interaction of control factors makes the clear separation of the climate influence on carbonate sedimentation difficult. Some conclusions can be however confidently distilled (Fig. 11).\nIn this intertropical region, temperature was very likely to be normally elevated. At least five moister phases interrupted the dry climate framework generally dominating the Permo-Triassic of the region. The phases are Early Olenekian (Campil Mb of the Werfen Fm), Middle Anisian (Dont Fm), Late Ladinian (Wengen Fm), “Middle” Carnian (Heiligkreuz Fm), and LateNorian in age. The Carnian eventwas certainly subdivided into several higher frequency climatic fluctuations. The high chronological resolution, generally available for the Triassic of theDolomites, suggests that the transition from arid tomoist conditions and vice versa was fast, at least at the geological time scale. The rapidity of these fluctuations rules out continental drift as a cause for climate change. Variation in the meteorological circulation pattern, inducing a latitudinal shift in themonsoon belt, could be hypothesised as a genetic factor. Any detailed discussion on the palaeo-atmospheric mechanisms inducing the climate change is however beyond the scope of this geological contribution.\nThe carbonate systems record a general evolutionary trend from Late Permian–Early Triassic regional shelves, rich in loose micritic and bio-calcarenitic sediments, to Anisian–Ladinian, synsedimentary cemented, steep sided (35–40°), high-relief platforms, and back to “Middle” Carnian biomicritic low angle ramps. This morphological evolution was associated with changing of orders of magnitude in the surface extension of the carbonate producing environments.\nWithin this general evolutionary scheme, the carbonate system evolution records the complex interplayof climate andbio-evolutionary trends. Despite the mass extinction dramatically impacting on the calcified organisms, the carbonate depositional architecture stayed almost unaffected through the Permo-Triassic boundary. The carbonate production style was influenced by the delayed recover of the bioconstructing communities, which was to be accomplished only in the Anisian. The late Early Triassic moist phase was associated with a sharp increase in the terrigenous influx and with a reduced carbonate production. Also the Anisian moist phase was accompanied by an increased argillaceous influx into the basin. The first generation of Anisian isolated high-relief platforms (Monte Rite Fm) witnesses the earliest appearing, within thewestern Tethys, of diversified “reef” biota. The following platform generations record an increased role of the synsedimentary cementation, which climaxed during the Ladinian dry interval (Sciliar Fm). Cementation dominated the platforms right into the onset of the volcanic activity, which was matched with major modification in the ecological framework and in the carbonate facies composition. The syn- and post-volcanic platforms are dominated by automicritic facies. The late Early Carnian systems record the reappearing of loose bioclastic and oolitic shoals and of low relief bioherms, associated with a moist climate phase.\nThe changing carbonate production largelymodified the platform– basin interaction. The Anisian and the post-volcanic Ladinian–Carnian\nbasins were subject to significant off-platform calcarenitic and micritic sedimentation. The very strong cementation of the latest Anisian–Early Ladinian, syndepositionally hardened platforms made the calcareous mud output scanty and any significant granular exportation impossible, thus inducing a sedimentary decoupling of shallow-water and basin systems, during a dry climate phase. The\nsynvolcanic carbonate factory reorganisation made the platform– basin systems to re-interact.\nThe periods of pervasive platform syndepositional cementation and fast growth correspond to dry phases, with a reduced influx of both continental sediments and nutrients. Moist periods are associated with higher terrigenous influx, less pervasive syndepositional\ncementation, automicritic facies growth, loose calcareous mud, and abundant bioclasts production. Corals generally played a sharply subordinated role in these platforms, but they became surprisingly more common during periods of strong terrigenous–volcanogenic influx (early post-volcanic platforms, Heiligkreuz Fm). Colonial organisms (e.g. sponges, corals) apparently spread out during the moister and terrigenous influenced phases, probably also because of the reduced space competition against the syndepositional cementation structures (e.g. evinospongiae). The Carnian supra-regional crisis of the high-relief rimmed platforms and the development of terrigenous–carbonate ramps was associated with the most pronounced shift toward pluvial conditions, detrimental to the former wholly carbonate systems."
