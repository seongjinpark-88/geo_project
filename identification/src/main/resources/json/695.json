The formation of each group is associated with weathering processes, which enrich aluminium (Al) by removing other cations, such as silicon (Si), alkali metals and REE. Lateritic bauxites are generally formed as a result of strong chemical weathering of aluminosilicate rocks. Sedimentary bauxites are formed mainly by superficial mechanical transportation and redeposition of lateritic bauxite deposits. Karst bauxites are confined in the karst zones of carbonate rocks. The chemical process involved in their formation is almost the same as that for lateritic bauxites except that karst bauxites may gain Al from a variety of sources, including insoluble residue of limestone and other aluminosilicate materials (such as volcanic dust and clayey interlayers in limestone).\nLate Palaeozoic karst-type bauxite deposits are widely distributed within the North China Craton. They are commonly located above a palaeo-karst surface, which is defined by the regional unconformity between the Middle Ordovician limestones and the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian clastic sediments in the North China Craton. This layer of bauxite deposits is termed the ‘G’ layer bauxite deposit, and makes up more than a half of the total reserves in China (Meng et al. 1987).\nDespite this well-defined stratigraphic framework for the bauxites in the North China Craton, their origin remains controversial. Two contrasting views exist in previous work. The first is that the bauxites might have been formed from long-term weathering of the underlying Middle Ordovician limestones (e.g. Meng et al. 1987; Wu 1997; Cheng et al. 2001; Meng et al. 2011). The other, however, is against this limestone source and is in favour of exotic, magmatic sources providing aluminosilicates for the formation of\nthe bauxites (e.g. Lu et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2011). Although the exact location of such magmatic sources has not been clearly constrained, we examine the following questions. (1) Have the underlying Middle Ordovician limestones provided the major source materials for the bauxites? (2) If the source materials were from an exotic magmatic source, rather than the underlying limestone source, then when and where did such magmatism occur?\nOwing to its robustness, zircon can retain its primary age and other isotopic information through sedimentary and metamorphic processes (e.g. Scherer et al. 2007). Recent studies have proved that detrital zircon U–Pb dating and in situ Hf isotopes can generate reliable information on the provenance of various sedimentary rocks (e.g. Bodet & Schärer 2000; Königer et al. 2002; Kosler et al. 2002; Lizuka et al. 2005; Veevers et al. 2005; Li et al. 2009, 2010; Ma et al. 2011; Boni et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2013). In this paper, we present U–Pb age data and in situ Hf isotopic results of detrital zircons from the ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits within the North China Craton.\nGeological setting of the northern North China Craton\nThe northern margin of the North China Craton, located SE of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, is divided into two east–west-trending tectonic units by the Pingquan–Gubeikou–Shangyi Fault (HBGMR 1989): (1) the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift (HBGMR 1989) to the north and (2) the Yanshan Fold-and-Thrust Belt (YFTB) to the south (HBGMR 1989; Davis et al. 2001; Fig. 1).\nThe Archaean Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift basement rocks consist predominantly of c. 2.5 Ga syntectonic granites and a\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/171/5/695/2796959/695.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\nvariety of supracrustal rocks (Jahn et al. 1984; Kröner et al. 1998). The main deformation and metamorphism of the Palaeoproterozoic basement occurred at c. 1.85 Ga, and is considered to indicate cratonization of the North China Craton (Zhao et al. 2002). Abundant Late Palaeozoic granites occurred within the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton (Fig. 1). Recent results show that this palaeouplift was strongly influenced by the Palaeo-Asian tectonic system during the Carboniferous to Permian and that the palaeo-Asian oceanic plate was subducted southward beneath the North China Craton (Davis et al. 2001; Xiao et al. 2003; Li 2006; Zhang et al. 2007a). The Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift was an Andean-type continental margin during Late Carboniferous to Early Permian time (Xiao et al. 2003; Zhang et al. 2007a). Some arc volcanoes existed in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift during that period, but most of them were eroded owing to strong exhumation and erosion during the Late Carboniferous to Early Jurassic (Zhang et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2012).\nThe Yanshan Fold-and-Thrust Belt consists mainly of Archaean–Palaeoproterozoic basement, unmetamorphosed Mesoto Neoproterozoic sediments (Changcheng, Jixian and Qingbaikou Systems), Cambrian–Ordovician marine clastic and carbonate platformal sediments, Middle Carboniferous to Triassic fluvial and deltaic sediments, Jurassic–Cretaceous and younger sediments and volcanic rocks. Silurian and Devonian strata were lost and resulted in a long gap in sedimentation. Although there are several disconformities from the Mesoproterozoic to Triassic owing to the sedimentary gap and erosion, no regional angular unconformities exist between these strata, indicating that most parts of the North China Craton remained almost stable during\nthese periods. The disconformity between the Middle Ordovician limestones and Late Carboniferous clastic sedimentary rocks hosts a large number of bauxite deposits in the North China Craton. From the Qingshuihe region in the west to the Jinzhou region in the east, volcanic tuff is widely distributed in the northern North China Craton (Figs 1 and 2). Geochemical and sedimentary analyses indicate that the tuffs are calc-alkaline and probably derived from the northern margin of the North China Craton (Zhang et al. 2007b).\nGeological characteristics of the ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits and sampling\nThe ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits are usually located near the disconformity between the Middle Ordovician limestones (Majiagou Formation) and the Late Carboniferous coal-bearing sedimentary rocks (Benxi Formation; HBGMR 1989; SBGMR 1989) in the North China Craton, and they belong to the genetic group of karst bauxite deposits (Bogatyrev et al. 2009). The ore bodies consist mainly of three layers: ferruginous clay rock (lower layer), bauxite zone (middle layer), and silty clay rocks (upper layer; Fig. 2). The ore bodies have a homogeneous structure, with thicknesses ranging from 0.5 to 20 m. The bauxite deposits are either directly in contact with the Ordovician limestones or located within the clastic sedimentary rocks at the bottom of the Late Carboniferous Benxi Formation.\nThe primary minerals found in the ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits in the northern North China Craton are diaspore (5–95%) and kaolinite (1–90%); other minerals include boehmite, illite, iron oxide, quartz, feldspar and zircon. Diaspore, which is the primary mineral component of the ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits, most probably resulted\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/171/5/695/2796959/695.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\nfrom further hydrothermal alteration of clay minerals such as kaolinite and halloysite. Crystal fragments of quartz and feldspar can be observed in some bauxite samples (Fig. 3c and d).\nWe collected seven samples of the ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits from different outcrops in the northern North China Craton, and then separated zircons from these samples for laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) dating and in situ Lu–Hf analysis. Samples of LT-1, D01, ZY-2 and WYS-1 were directly in contact with the limestones, and samples 08065-1, T14 and P02 were from within the clastic sedimentary rocks at the bottom of the Late Carboniferous Benxi\nFormation (Fig. 2). In contrast to typical claystones that result from the weathering of limestones and old crustal rocks, all the bauxite samples contain abundant magmatic zircons, 50–200 μm in size, which are characterized by euhedral prismatic forms and oscillatory zoning that is visible in cathodoluminescence (CL) images (Fig. 4).\nAnalytical methods\nZircons were extracted using conventional techniques of crushing, grinding, sieving and heavy liquid and magnetic separation, and\nFig. 2.

They were mounted in epoxy resin and polished to expose the cores of the grains in readiness for photomicrography and CL, LA-ICP-MS U–Pb and in situ Lu–Hf isotopic analyses. LA-ICP-MS U–Pb dating was performed with an Agilent 7500a ICP-MS system equipped with a 193 nm laser at the State Key Laboratory of Continental Dynamics, Northwest University, Xi’an and State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, following the method described by Yuan et al. (2004) and Liu et al. (2010). In situ Lu– Hf isotope analyses were undertaken with a Geolas 193 nm laserablation microprobe attached to a Neptune multi-collector ICP-MS system at the State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics (IGG), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), using techniques and analytical procedures described by Wu et al. (2006). Hf model ages (TDM) were calculated on the basis of the depleted mantle model described by Griffin et al. (2000).\nResults\nZircon U–Pb geochronology\nZircons from the seven ‘G’ layer bauxite samples were analysed using the LA-ICP-MS method. The results of zircon U–Pb dating are summarized in Table 1 with details listed in Table 2. The zircons analysed are dominated by magmatic zircons that are characterized by euhedral prismatic forms and oscillatory zoning in CL images (Fig. 4) and high Th/U ratios (>0.3; Table 2).\nTwenty-five zircon grains from sample LT-1 were analysed, and 24 concordant grains gave a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 304 ± 3 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 2.0, Fig. 5a). Twenty-eight spots on 26 zircon grains from sample D01 were analysed, and 20 concordant spots gave a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 296 ± 2 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 1.3, Fig. 5b), which is the youngest age recorded. Sixteen zircon grains from sample ZY-2 were analysed, and except for one old spot with a 207Pb/206Pb age of around 2.7 Ga,\nTable 1.

Thirty-five spots on 32 zircon grains from sample WYS-1 were analysed, and the concordant ages can be divided into two groups (Fig. 5d). The weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of the two groups are 303 ± 2 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 2.3, n = 30) and 381 ± 4 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 0.6, n = 3). The mean age of the younger group is very similar to that of sample LT-1. Eighteen zircon grains from sample 08065-1 were analysed, and the results indicate an abundance of Archaean–Proterozoic zircons with 207Pb/206Pb ages around 2.5–2.6 Ga. The younger ages from this sample can be divided into two groups, yielding weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of 399 ± 17 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 14, n = 4) and 308 ± 19 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 5.8, n = 3) (Fig. 5e). Twenty-two spots on 20 zircon grains from sample P02 were analysed, with a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 311 ± 7 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 1.2, n = 3, Fig. 5f) for the younger population. The sample also contains many Palaeoproterozoic zircons with 207Pb/206Pb ages ranging from 1.8 to 2.44 Ga. Twenty-six spots on 25 zircon grains from sample T14 were analysed, and the complex pattern of ages can be divided into several groups (Figs. 5g). Four spots in the youngest group gave a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 302 ± 15 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 3.5, n = 3), and the weighted mean 206Pb/238U ages of the other two groups are 403 ± 9 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 4.8, n = 6) and 436 ± 6 Ma (95% confidence, MSWD = 3.3, n = 3).\nZircon Hf isotopes\nOnly the Phanerozoic zircons (<478 Ma) were analysed for Lu–Hf isotopic compositions. The results are listed in Table 3 and plotted in Figure 6. Seven samples show a wide range of initial 176Hf/177Hf ratios (0.28131–0.28265) and εHf(t) values (2.2 to −24.5). The calculated one-stage Hf model ages (TDM) range from 0.87 to 2.95 Ga. It is noteworthy that, in contrast to the zircon Hf isotope compositions of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt magmatic rocks, most zircons in this study exhibit significantly negative εHf(t) values, similar to those of the Late Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton (Fig. 6).\nDiscussion\nThe ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits in the northern North China Craton are located above the disconformity surface between the Middle Ordovician (472–461 Ma) limestones and the Late Carboniferous clastic sedimentary rocks. They were thought by some researchers to be the result of long-term weathering of the underlying Middle Ordovician limestone (e.g. Meng et al. 1987; Wu 1997; Cheng et al. 2001; Meng et al. 2011). Others, however, held the opinion that the source materials of the bauxite deposits were mainly silicate rocks that contain aluminosilicates (e.g. Lu et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2011).\nOur U–Pb dating results of zircons in the bauxite samples provide evidence that the Middle Ordovician limestone was not the principal source material of the bauxite deposits. One one hand, most zircons in our study have post-Middle Ordovician ages (448– 291 Ma; Table 2 and Fig. 7). Notably, the largest population of zircons show ages between 338 and 291 Ma and peaks around 300 Ma, coeval with the Late Palaeozoic arc magmatic rocks (324–276 Ma) on the northern margin of the North China Craton (Zhang et al. 2007a, 2009a,c; Ma et al. 2013). This suggests that the major source materials of the bauxites are magmatic and formed later than the underlying limestone strata. On the other hand, only minor zircons\nshow ancient ages (>900 Ma), reflecting a minor contribution from recycling of the Precambrian basement in rocks that formed before the bauxites. In other words, direct material input from the Middle Ordovician limestone, if any, was insignificant in the formation of the bauxite deposits. Therefore, rather than being a direct weathering product of the Middle Ordovician limestone, the bauxites studied were mainly derived from younger magmatic rocks.\nPrevious studies show that multiple layers of volcanic dust exist in the Late Palaeozoic coal-bearing sedimentary rocks within various parts of the North China Craton (e.g. Jia & Guo 1993; Peng & Zhong 1995; Zhong et al. 1995, 1996; Jia et al. 1999; Sang et al. 1999a,b; Zhou et al. 2001). Geochemical analyses reveal that the dust came from calc-alkaline volcanic rocks (Jia & Gu 1998; Jia et al. 1999). An age of 296 ± 4 Ma was determined by zircon U–Pb dating for a tuff within the Late Palaeozoic strata from western Beijing (Zhang et al. 2007b). A similar zircon U–Pb age of 290 ± 4 Ma was also obtained for a tuff sample within the Late Palaeozoic strata near Daqingshan, west of Hohhot in Figure 1 (Cope et al. 2005). These ages fall within the range of emplacement ages of the Late Palaeozoic intrusive rocks (395–276 Ma) in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton (Zhang et al. 2007a,c, 2009a,b,c; Ma et al. 2013). In particular, the Carboniferous to Early Permian (324–276 Ma) intrusive rocks are calc-alkaline and display geochemical characteristics of arc magmas, indicating that the northern margin of the North China Craton was an Andean-type active continental arc (e.g. Zhang et al. 2007a, 2009a,c; Ma et al. 2013). The age consistency together with geochemical similarities between the volcanic dust and the Late Palaeozoic intrusive rocks thus suggests that the volcanic dust layers resulted from contemporaneous arc volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift, where remnants of early volcanism are rare owing to strong erosion (Zhang et al. 2007b). This is also supported by the observations that the volcanic dust layers tend to decrease in thickness from north to south (Jia & Guo 1993; Zhou et al. 2001) with a lithology transition from tuff to tuffaceous sedimentary rocks (e.g. Jia & Guo 1993; Peng & Zhong 1995; Zhong et al. 1995).\nSimilarly, we infer that the major source materials of the bauxite deposits also came from the Palaeozoic volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton, based on the significant overlap between our zircon U–Pb ages and those of Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift. Except for minor Precambrian zircons, the Phanerozoic zircons cluster as three age populations: 338–291 Ma peaking around 300 Ma (n = 103), 417–380 Ma with a mean of c. 400 Ma (n = 14), and 448–426 Ma peaking around 440 Ma (n = 19) (Fig. 7). Because the latter two populations are next to each other, an F-test was carried to see if these two distributions are similar. The resulting F-statistic is 3.93, larger than the critical F value at the 5% significance level (F(13,18,0.05) = 2.31), and the p-value is 0.00826. These two age groups are, therefore, statistically distinct. The age interval of 338–291 Ma with a peak at 300 Ma, which is the largest population, exists in all samples and is comparable with that of the Late Palaeozoic arc magmatic rocks (324–276 Ma) in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift (Zhang et al. 2007a, 2009a,c; Ma et al. 2013). The peak age of c. 300 Ma is particularly obvious in samples LT-1, D01 and WYS-1, consistent with the age of 296 ± 4 Ma for a tuff from western Beijing (Zhang et al. 2007b). The age interval of 417–380 Ma is similar to the ages of subduction-related rocks of mafic–ultramafic complexes (395 ± 11 to 392 ± 5 Ma; Zhang et al. 2009b), an alkaline complex (409 ± 2 Ma; Zhang et al. 2010), and a diorite pluton (390 ± 5 Ma; Zhang et al. 2007c). The third age interval of 448–426 Ma with a peak of c. 440 Ma, however, corresponds to no magmatic rocks of similar ages identified in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift. The exact source of these zircons thus remains unclear and warrants future research.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/171/5/695/2796959/695.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\nTable 3.

The 176Hf/177Hf ratios reported were corrected according to the recommended value of the standard zircon 91500.\nNone the less, the overall good agreement in ages presented above suggests that the Palaeozoic, particularly Carboniferous to Early Permian (338–291 Ma), subduction-related volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift along the northern margin of the North China Craton may have provided a dominant amount of source materials for the bauxites.\nAs shown in Figure 6, most zircons of the bauxites show significantly negative εHf(t) values, down to −24.5, falling into the εHf(t) range defined by Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift (e.g. Zhang et al. 2007a,c, 2009a,b,c; Zhang et al. 2010; Ma et al. 2013). Conversely, Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, which are the result of juvenile crustal growth, are distinctive and characterized by significantly positive εHf(t) values (see Fig. 6; e.g. Yang et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2009; Meng et al. 2011; Hao & Hou 2012; Wang et al. 2012). Correspondingly, detrital zircons in sedimentary rocks that originated from the Palaeozoic Central Asian Orogenic Belt magmatic rocks should display similar positive εHf(t) values (e.g. Li et al. 2011), which is, however, not the case for the zircons in this study. In combination with evidence from zircon U–Pb geochronology, the zircon Hf isotope data thus support our argument that the major\nsource materials of the bauxites originated from the Palaeozoic subduction-related volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton.\nFinally, we propose a likely scenario for the formation of the bauxites studied. According to some palaeomagnetic studies (Yang et al. 1998; Zhu et al. 1998; Stampfli & Borel 2002), the North China Craton was located at low latitudes during the Carboniferous to Permian. The palaeowind directions over this region at the time were generally south-vergent as suggested by climate model simulations and oxygen isotopic studies (e.g. Tabor & Montañez 2002; Horton et al. 2012). Volcanic dust from the Palaeozoic, particularly Carboniferous to Early Permian (338–291 Ma), subduction-related volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift along the northern margin of the North China Craton was thus transported mainly by wind to the south and widely deposited on exposed karstified carbonate rocks in sedimentary basins within the North China Craton. Intense chemical weathering of the deposited volcanic dust, which accumulated Al by removing Si and other cations, was most probably favoured by the hot and humid climate prevalent at low latitudes, and ultimately led to the formation of the bauxites within the North China Craton.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/171/5/695/2796959/695.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\nFig. 7.

Combining zircon U–Pb geochronology and in situ Hf isotope data, we show that the bauxites were derived mainly from volcanic dust produced during the Palaeozoic, particularly from Carboniferous to Early Permian (338–291 Ma) volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift along the northern margin of the North China Craton, rather than in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt.\nThis research was supported financially by the Geological Investigation Project of China Geological Survey (No. 1212011120044), the National Basic Research Program of China (2006CB403501; 40776004).

  "abstractText": "Bauxite deposits that lie between Middle Ordovician limestones and Late Carboniferous clastic sediments (known as the ‘G’ layer bauxites) are widespread throughout the northern part of the North China Craton. The origin of these bauxites has remained uncertain and has been attributed either to alteration of the underlying limestone or to tephra deposited on the limestone erosional surface. We use U–Pb ages and in situ Hf isotopic analyses of detrital zircons from the ‘G’ layer bauxite deposits (both by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) to constrain the major source materials of the bauxites. The zircon ages are dominated by Palaeozoic ages, especially Carboniferous to Early Permian (338–291 Ma), coeval with the Palaeozoic subduction-related volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton. Zircon εHf(t) values range from 2.2 to −24.5 and are dominated by negative values, similar to those of Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift, but distinct from those of Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt with positive εHf(t) values. Thus, we argue that the bauxites were derived mainly from volcanic dust produced during the Palaeozoic, particularly in the Carboniferous to Early Permian (338–291 Ma), by volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift along the northern margin of the North China Craton, rather than in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt to the north. The underlying Middle Ordovician limestones, however, had provided only minor, if any, source materials for the bauxites. research-articleResearch ArticleXXX10.1144/jgs2013-074J.
