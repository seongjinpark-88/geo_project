We present a provenance study based on 630 U–Pb (LA-ICP-MS) ages of detrital zircon from the latest Cambrian to Ordovician siliciclastic rocks of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin situated in the Algerian Sahara. Most authors suggest local sources only for the sandstones. Instead, we demonstrate that the detritus is derived from different cratons and terranes which contributed to the deposition of a Cambrian–Ordovician overstep sequence covering western and northern Africa. Most zircon ages (61.0%) fall in the range of ~540 to 740 Ma and are interpreted to have been derived from Pan-African orogenic belts such as the Trans-Saharan Belt of NW Africa and previously from the Brazila belt of South America. Other potential sources for this zircon population are terranes of Cadomian affinity situatedmarginal toWest Africa. The second-largest zircon population (20.2%) is 2.0 to 2.2 Ga, and is attributed to sources in the West African craton, such as the Birimian basement and the Eburnean orogenic belt, with possible partial input from the Amazonian craton. A zircon population of 7.1% yields Mesoproterozoic and early Paleoproterozoic ages in the range of ~1.3 to ~1.8 Ga and was probably derived from source rocks outside of the West African basement, the Tuareg shield and other adjoining areas. The Amazonian craton is a potential source region. A population of 6.7% of all zircon ages scatter from ~750 Ma to ~980 Ma and may reflect input from latest stages of the formation of Rodinia and its subsequent dispersal. A smaller population (3.2%) of zircon ages lie between ~2.3 and 2.65 Ga, and may be derived from late Paleoproterozoic to early Archaean rocks from the West African craton and possibly from Amazonia. Less than 1% of all zircons are Meso- to Paleoarchaean ones and provide evidence for the input of very old cratonic basement, most likely from cratonic inliers of the West African craton (Leonian, Liberian). Because of the potential input of detrital zircon from the Amazonian craton, which is reflected in theMesoproterozoic and late Paleoproterozoic grains, we speculate that some of the Paleoproterozoic to Neoarchean (2.0 Ga to 2.6 Ga) zircons were also derived from Amazonia. Due to the total lack of 1.0–1.2 Ga old zircon, our data set excludes all crustal domains situated in the Arabian-Nubian shield and the East African belt, as well as the Sunsás belt of Amazonia (“Sunsás-Grenvillian”) as potential sediment sources. Sedimentation in the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin started in uppermost Cambrian to Ordovician time due to the opening of the Rheic Ocean. This event led to subsidence related to the rift and drift of Avalonia and related terranes from the northwestern Gondwanan margin. The basal Early Tassili quartzite has detrital zircon populations that suggest a local provenance either from West African or from a related terrane in the Tuareg shield. A dramatic change occurs in the deltaic to shallow marine strata of the Lower Ordovician Ajjers Formation and in the overlying marine sandstones of the Middle Ordovician d'In Azaoua Formation. Our data for both formations indicate the Pan-African orogen, and very likely Cadomian terranes as the main source for the detritus. During this time, the region was affected by rift tectonics due to the opening of the Rheic Ocean and therefore amenable to erosion at rift shoulders and escarpments. Our data also indicate that glacial erosion in Upper Ordovician (Hirnantian) time must have affected larger areas of old cratonic surfaces as the populations of Paleoproterozoic to Archaean zircons are significantly higher than in other age clusters.\ninnemann).\nll rights reserved.\nLarge parts of highlymature sands of the Cambro-Ordovician section in the Tassili OuanAhaggar basinwere derived fromapeneplain in the interior of Gondwana, that formedduringCambrian times.

    "text": "U–Pb ages of detrital zircon grains in clastic rocks are a geological archive and provide constraints on source areas, which can be of great use in tectono-magmatic studies. Rapid measurement of U and Pb isotopes from large numbers of zircon grains is possible by modern analytical techniques suchas Laser Ablation combinedwith InductivelyCoupled-Plasma Mass-Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), which is nowadays considered to be a robust technique for provenance studies (e.g. Frei and Gerdes, 2009;Gehrels et al., 2008; Jeffries et al., 2003). Zircon–U–Pbages can be used for (i) the determination of the maximum age of sedimentation by making use of the concordia age of the youngest zircon population (Linnemann et al., 2007), (ii) provenance studies using the age cluster of all measured zircon populations (Drost et al., 2011), (iii) the reconstruction of major breaks in basin history by comparing ages of zircon populations from different samples in a given basin (Kalsbeek et al., 2008), (iv) the reconstruction and characterization of the tectono-magmatic history of the hinterland (Hofmann et al., 2009), and (v) paleogeographic reconstructions utilizing the diverse characteristic ages of zircon populations typical for a craton, terrane, or region (Drost et al., 2011;Murphy and Nance, 1991; Nance et al., 2010).\nDetrital zircon grains are an important tool for paleogeographic reconstructions of peri-Gondwanan terranes. Especially the Mesoproterozoic magmatic gap of the West African craton plays an important role. U–Pb zircondata of Cambro-Ordovician siliciclastic sediments form the northern periphery of the West African craton are still scarce. To identify theWest Africanmagmatic gap in such sediments and to get an overview on the secular magmatism in the potential source areas, we present in this paper a study of U–Pb-ages of 850 detrital zircon grains, from which 630 show a degree of concordance between 90 and 110%. Samples are from a Cambrian–Ordovician section that was deposited along the northern margin of Gondwana and potentially characterizes the long-lasting tectono-magmatic history of the central and marginal part of West Gondwana and the multiple factors of basin development in the depositional area. The basin history was strongly controlled by paleoclimate; its deposition started under moderate to cold climate conditions and ended in an ice house (Hirnantian glaciation) (Beuf et al., 1971; Ghienne et al., 2007a,b).\nOur study area is the Cambrian–Ordovician section of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin located in the Algerian Sahara at the southern margin of the Hoggar being a part of the Tuareg shield (Figs. 1 and 2). The Tassili OuanAhaggar basin is composed of subhorizontal Cambrian–\nmpiled by U. Linnemann by making use of the maps of Bahlburg et\nOrdovician to Lower Devonian siliciclastic rocks. The sandstones and quartzites were transported mostly from the south (Beuf et al., 1971) and the ages of their detrital zircon grains provide insights into the composition of the crust inWesternGondwana thatwas exposedduring the Cambrian and Ordovician. As much of the potential source rocks are now covered by deserts, rainforests and thick tropical soil formations, the detrital zircon record of these rocks preserves an important archive of that interval of Earth history, and facilitates the reconstruction of magmatic events through time as well as tectonic activity and other aspects of basin evolution. Further, a general Cambro-Ordovician peneplain development of Gondwana and major breaks in basin development related to the widespread Upper Ordovician (Hirnantian) glaciation are reflected in theU–Pb detrital zircon age populations of the analyzed samples. In addition, our results are important for the paleogeographic reconstruction of peri-Gondwanan terranes (Cadomia, Avalonia), which accumulated detrital material from the northern margin of Gondwana during Lower Paleozoic time (Murphy and Nance, 1991; Murphy et al., 2004).\nMost authors assume local sources for the masses of the highly mature Cambrian–Ordovician siliciclastic sands in northwestern Africa. Our provenance study shows, that different cratons and continents, likeWest Africa and Amazonia, most probably contributed to the formation of the early Paleozoic sands of West Gondwana. In addition, peri-Gondwanan terranes of Cadomian affinity are also potential source areas."

    "heading": "2.1. Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin",
    "text": "The Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin (Fig. 2) is composed of subhorizontal Lower Paleozoic strata that were deposited unconformably upon Precambrian rocks of the Tuareg shield (Figs. 1–3). A pioneering study by Beuf et al. (1971) provided a detailed stratigraphy, history of basin development, as well as an interpretation of sedimentological, paleoenvironmental, and paleocurrent data (Fig. 4). The Cambrian–Ordovician part of the section is about 500 m thick and is conformably overlain by 1000 m of Silurian strata followed by ca 300 to 400 m thick Lower Devonian strata.\nThe basal Cambrian–Ordovician part of the section consists of the Ajjers Formation which rests unconformably on the Precambrian basement of the Hoggar. The lower part the Ajjers Formation is composed of fluvial to deltaic conglomerates and sandstones (Fig. 5A and B) which grade into shallow marine sandstones and conglomerates in the upper part of the formation (Fig. 4). The depositional age of the lower part of the Ajjers Formation is uncertain and could represent uppermost Cambrian to earliest Ordovician (Tremadocian) sedimentary rocks. The rest of the formation is assigned to a Lower Ordovician (Tremadoc to Arenig) age, which was obtained from paleontological data (Beuf et al., 1971; Le Heron, 2010). A quartzite sample (HOG 1) from that lowermost part of the Ajjers Formation plays a significant role in our investigations and therefore the deposit is informally named the “Early-Tassili quartzite”.\nThe Ajjers Formation is overlain by the Middle Ordovician (uppermost Arenig?, Llanvirn to Caradoc) d'In Azaoua Formation, which is composed of marine sandstones that exhibit planar crossbedding and a rich ichnofauna containing Skolithos sp. (Fig. 5C and D) and Cruziana sp. After a gap in sedimentation comprising most of the Caradoc and the Lower Ashgill, massive glacial sedimentary strata consisting of Upper Ashgill (Hirnantian) diamictites and glaciomarine sandstones overlie glacial abrasion surfaces (Beuf et al., 1971; Ghienne et al., 2007a,b). Scour marks of drifting icebergs are common (Fig. 5E) in thick-bedded glaciomarine sandstones (Fig. 5F) (Woodworth-Lynas and Dowdeswell, 1994). The glacial strata are assigned to the Tamadjert Formation (Fig. 4). After the glaciation, a general flooding during the Silurian followed and deposition of black graptolitic shales (“hot shales”) and associated mudstones occurred on the deeper shelf. Up-section, these dark pelites grade into Lower Devonian marine sandstones (Fig. 4).\nThe general transport direction of the Cambrian–Ordovician preglacial sandstones, as determined by statistical analysis of crossbedding, is top-NNE (Beuf et al., 1971). The glacigenic material was transported likewise top-N to NNW as shown by scour marks and glacial lineations (Beuf et al., 1971; Ghienne et al., 2007a,b). The bulk of the siliciclastic material came from the central part of West Gondwana. Extreme chemical weathering and erosion of the Gondwanan interior took place during the Cambrian and provided large volumes of highly mature quartz sands and led to the formation of a peneplain in the Gondwanan supercontinent (Avigad et al., 2005; Linnemann et al., 2000, 2007). During the Silurian and Lower Devonian, the general transport direction changes slightly from NNW to NW (Beuf et al., 1971)."

    "heading": "2.2. Tuareg shield",
    "text": "The basement of the Tuareg shield underlies the Paleozoic strata of the Tassili OuanAhaggar basin and is about 500,000 km2 in surface area. Most of the shield occurs in Algeria (Hoggar) and continues SW into Mali (Adrar des Iforas) and SE into Niger (Aïr) (Fig. 1).The shield principally is made of Archaean, Paleoproterozoic, and Neoproterozoic terranes and is bounded by a suture to the West African craton (Black et al, 1994). To the east, the Saharanmetacraton forms the eastern part of the Tuareg shield (Abdelsalam et al., 2002) (Fig. 2). To the south, the shield continues below the Phanerozoic cover into the Benin-Nigeria shield (Fig. 1). To the north it is covered by Paleozoic and Mesozoic to Cenozoic strata. The Tuareg shield crops out at the surfacedue to amajor Cenozoic doming (Aït-Hamou et al., 2000). The geological units in that area belong to the Trans-Saharan belt (Fig. 1), which has a complex geological history strongly related to Pan-African orogenic processes. It was formeddue to plate-tectonic interactions between theWestAfrican craton, the Saharan metacraton and a number of terranes in between during Neoproterozoic time. The Tuareg shield is composed of 23 single terranes, each terrane with its own lithological, metamorphic, magmatic, and tectonic characteristics (Fig. 2). These crustal fragments are separated by sub-vertical and N–S-trending strike-slip megashear\nzones and major thrust fronts that can be traced for hundreds of kilometers (Black et al., 1994). The shield was formed during PanAfrican orogenic processes between ~570 and ~630 Ma. In addition, related magmatic rocks are known from ~870 to ~520 Ma (Liégeois et al., 2003).\nMost of the Tuareg shield is composed of Pan-African terranes consisting of recycled Archaean and Paleoproterozoic crust. Some remnants of such cratonic crust are well-preserved today and are embedded in Neoproterozoic crustal material, because such inliers survived the Pan-African orogeny and younger magmatic and metamorphic overprint. Neoproterozoic juvenile oceanic or continental crustal blocks are also common in the Tuareg shield, generally predating the main collision period around ~620 Ma (Jahn et al., 2001), with ages in a range of 870 to 650 Ma (Fezaa et al., 2010). The central part of the Hoggar shield is composed of the Laouni, Azrou-n-Fad, Tefedest, and Egéré-Aleksod terranes, which belonged to a single old passive margin of a craton to which the acronym name LATEA metacraton was given (Liégeois et al., 2003) (Figs. 1 and 2). The LATEA metacraton was destabilized and dissected during the Late Neoproterozoic Pan-African orogenesis. All in all, the Tuareg shield is a large geological window in a giant Pan-African continent–continent collisional orogen between the margins of the West African craton and the Saharan metacraton. That orogenic remnant is totally sliced by abundant major N–S trending strike-slip faults (Figs. 1 and 2)."

    "heading": "2.3. West African craton",
    "text": "TheWest African craton (Kennedy, 1964) is situated to the west of the Tuareg shield and is bounded by a suture at its eastern margin (Figs. 1 and 2). The craton was stabilized by orogenic events in the Archaean (Leonian, Liberian) and the Paleoproterozoic (Eburnean). Phases ofmajor crustal growthoccurredbetween1.9-2.4 Ga (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher et al., 1992; Rocci et al., 1991; Zhao et al., 2002a,b), 2.7– 3.0 Ga (Guerrot et al., 1989; Key et al., 2008), and 3.05–3.6 Ga (Kröner et al., 2001; Potrel et al., 1996, 1998). TheWestAfrican craton crops out in the Reguibat shield to the north and in the Man-Léo shield to the south (Fig. 1). The central part of the craton is covered by Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic strata of the Taoudeni basin (Clauer and Deynoux, 1987; Deynoux et al., 1978, 1985; Trompette, 1994). The southeastern part of the West African craton is overlain by the Neoproterozoic Volta basin (Affaton et al., 1980) (Fig. 1). At the northern edge of the craton, the Tindouf basin strata (except its southern end) are younger than the Pan-African orogeny and begin with sandstones deposited during Late Ordovician glaciation (Deynoux et al., 1985) (Fig. 1). Except at its southern edge, theWest African craton is surroundedby Pan-African fold belts; theMauritanide fold belt in the northwest andwest, the Rockelide fold belt in the southwest, and the Pharussian andDahomyean fold belts in the east (Fig. 1) (Guiraud et al., 2005; Piqué, 2001; Trompette, 1994; Villeneuve, 2005; and references therein)."

    "heading": "2.4. Saharan metacraton",
    "text": "The Saharan metacraton (Abdelsalam et al., 2002) occurs to the east of the Tuareg shield and extends beneath the Saharan desert (Fig. 1). The term “metacraton” is used because this region consists of an extensive Meso-Cenozoic cover above a poorly known tract of continental crust. The term “metacraton” refers to a craton that has been remobilizedduringPan-Africanorogenic processes (Schandelmeier et al., 1988; Stern, 1994), but it is still recognizable through its rheological, geochronological and isotopic characteristics. Neoproterozoic reworking took place by deformation, metamorphism, emplacement of igneous rocks, and local episodes of crust formation and is related to rifting and formation of oceanic crust. Relics of unaffected or only weakly remobilized cratonic lithosphere are present in Archaean and Paleoproterozoic rock units (Abdelsalam et al., 2002, 2003; Shang et al., 2010). Phases of crustal growth obtained from U–Pb ages of magmatic and inherited zircon grains are 0.6–0.8 Ga, 1.75–2.6 Ga, and 3.0 Ga (Abdelsalam et al., 2002 and references therein).\nA small number of reported Mesoproterozoic zircon ages of 1120 Ma (Dixon, 1981) and 1460 Ma (Wust, 1989) were obtained from granitic cobbles and siliciclastic rocks by making use of Pb–Pb single zircon evaporation ages. Such ages are generally minimum ages and the ages of the zircons could be older (Kober, 1986, 1987). Using a similar method, Stern (1994) reported 14 grains with an age range of 1232±13 Ma for orthogneisses of the eastern part of the Saharan metacraton near Wadi Halfa in the Nubian Desert of northern Sudan. Generally, the degree of concordance of Pb–Pb ages cannot be proved and, thus the zircons could be older and the given age is a minimum age. Therefore, the existence of a massive true Mesoproterozoic crust in the Saharan metacraton remains unproven."

    "text": "Zircon concentrate was separated from 2 to 4 kg sample material at the Laboratoire de Géodynamique (Algiers) using standard methods. Final selection of the zircon grains for U–Pb dating was achieved by\nhand-picking under a binocular microscope. Zircon grains of all grain sizes and morphological types were selected, mounted in resin blocks and polished to half their thickness. Zirconswere analyzed for U, Th, and Pb isotopes by LA-ICP-MS techniques at the Museum für Mineralogie und Geologie (GeoPlasma Lab, Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden), using a Thermo-Scientific Element 2 XR sector field ICP-MS coupled to a New Wave UP-193 Excimer Laser System. A teardrop-shaped, low volume laser cell constructed by Ben Jähne (Dresden) and Axel Gerdes (Frankfurt/M.) was used to enable sequential sampling of heterogeneous grains (e.g., growth zones) during time resolved data acquisition. Each analysis consisted of approximately 15 s background acquisition followed by 30 s data acquisition, using a laser spot-size of 25 and 35 μm, respectively. A common-Pb correction based on the interference- and backgroundcorrected 204Pb signal and amodel Pb composition (Stacey andKramers, 1975) was carried out if necessary. The necessity of the correction is judged onwhether the corrected 207Pb/206Pb lies outside of the internal errors of the measured ratios. Discordant analyses were generally interpreted with care. Raw data were corrected for background signal, common Pb, laser induced elemental fractionation, instrumental mass discrimination, and time-dependant elemental fractionation of Pb/Th and Pb/U using an Excel® spreadsheet program developed by Axel Gerdes (Institute of Geosciences, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). Reported uncertainties were propagated by quadratic addition of the external reproducibility obtained from the standard zircon GJ-1 (~0.6% and 0.5–1% for the 207Pb/206Pb and 206Pb/238U, respectively) during individual analytical sessions and the within-run precision of each analysis. Concordia diagrams (2σ error ellipses) and concordia ages (95% confidence level) were produced using Isoplot/Ex 2.49 (Ludwig, 2001) and frequency and relative probability plots using AgeDisplay (Sircombe, 2004). The 207Pb/ 206Pb age was taken for interpretation for all zircons N1.0 Ga, and the 206Pb/238U ages for younger grains. Further details of the instruments settings are available from Table DR-1 (data repository). For further details on analytical protocol and data processing see Frei and Gerdes (2009).\nTo demonstrate analytical accuracy, well-characterized reference materials like the Harvard 91500 (Wiedenbeck et al., 1995) and Plešovice standards (Sláma et al., 2008) were analyzed and normalized against the GJ-1 zircon standard. For theHarvard 91500 zircon standard (1065 Ma), the obtained concordia age from four analyses is 1065.5± 6 Ma (Fig. 6 A). From four analyses of the Plešovice zircon standard (337 Ma), a concordia age of 336.9±3.6 Ma was obtained (Fig. 6B). U–Th–Pb data of both the reference materials are represented in Table DR-2 (data repository). Fig. 7 shows U–Pb ages from a complex zircon grain (grainnumber c47)of investigated sampleHOG7.A2101±38 Ma old core (207Pb–206Pb age) is overgrown by a rim, which is analyzed by two spots. The 206Pb–238U ages of the rim are 577±15 and 579±13 Ma and overlap in error. Results ofmeasurements of theHarvard 91500 and\nPlešovice reference materials, and of the complex zircon grain c47 (sample HOG 7) demonstrate a precision of an in-situ analysis of U and Pb isotopes comparable to analytical data of the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Micro Probe (SHRIMP).\nThe uncertainty in the degree of concordance of Precambrian– Paleozoic grains dated by the LA-ICP-MS method is relatively large and results obtained from just a single analysis have to be interpreted with care. A typical uncertainty of 2–3% (2σ) in 207Pb/206Pb for a Late Neoproterozoic grain (e.g., 560 Ma) relates to an absolute error on the 207Pb/206Pb age of 45–65 Myr. Such a result gives space for interpretation of concordanceor slight discordance. The latter one couldbe caused by episodic lead loss, fractionation, or infiltration Pb isotopes by a fluid or on micro-cracks. Thus, zircons showing a degree of concordance in\nthe range of 90–110% in this paper are classified as concordant because of the overlap of the error ellipse with the concordia (e.g. Frei and Gerdes, 2009; Jeffries et al., 2003; Linnemann et al., 2007).\nTh/U ratios (Tables DR-3 to DR-9, data repository) are obtained from the LA-ICP-MS measurements of investigated zircon grains. U and Pb content and Th/U ratio were calculated relative to the GJ-1\nzircon standard and are accurate to approximately 10%. Cathodoluminescence (CL)-images of zircon are produced by a Zeiss scanning electron microscope EVO 50 at the Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden."

The youngest and only Cambrian zircon grain is 539±6 Ma old. The oldest zircon is one of two Archaean grains, with an age of 2954±12 Ma. 80.7% of all zircons in the sample are Neoproterozoic in age ranging from ~558 to 924 Ma (Fig. 11, Table DR-5).

The youngest grain yields an age of 541±11 Ma. Only one zircon yields an Archaean age (2575±15 Ma). 66.7% of all zircons in the sample are Neoproterozoic in age and with a range of ~541–967 Ma (Fig. 13, Table DR-7). The probability plot shows three major peaks in descending order at 695, 630, and 611 Ma (Fig. 13). 30.3% of all grains analyzed are Paleoproterozoic zircon grains ranging from 1694±21 to 2233±25 Ma.

Such information is a powerful method to constrain the maximum age of sedimentation of clastic rocks.\nPaleocurrent data suggest that parts of West Africa and centraleastern parts of South America are potential sediment sources for both the Lower–Middle Ordovician fluvial–deltaic marine and the Upper Ordovician glacial environments (Beuf et al., 1971). Other potential source areas include the Neoproterozoic belts of the PanAfrican and Cadomian orogenic events (Fig. 1).\nPotential cratonic source areas, which could act as sediment sources, show distinct fingerprints of zircon populations, which trace back to the crustal evolution of the cratons (Abati et al., 2010; Avigad et al., 2003, 2005; Bahlburg et al., 2009; Drost et al., 2011; Fezaa et al.,\n2010; Liégeois et al., 2003; Linnemann et al., 2007, 2008; Nance and Murphy, 1994; Rocci et al., 1991). Most likely, cratonic sources for the sediments are the West African craton, the Saharan metacraton, the Tuareg shield, the Arabian-Nubian shield, and parts of South America, such as the Amazonian craton (Fig. 1).\nThe complete data set of 630 concordant U–Pb ages of detrital zircon grains from HOG 1–7 (Fig. 16) shows that the bulk of the zircon ages (61.0%) falls in the range of ~540–750 Ma. These are attributed to a combination of Pan-African orogenic collisional processes (local sources) and to Neoproterozoic subduction-related orogenic events along Gondwana's northern margin. Avalonian and Cadomian terranes were formed at the northern Gondwanan margin coeval to tectonomagmatic belts related to Pan-African continent–continent collision. Murphy and Nance (1991) discussed the dual nature of Neoproterozoic\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\nF req u en cy\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\nF req u en cy\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\norogenesis in terms of supercontinent assembly of Gondwana and the existence of subduction zones between colliding blocks to the periphery of Gondwana. Avalonian terranes are characterized by recycling Mesoproterozoic crust at the margin of Amazonia showing a major content of 1.0–1.1 Ga old zircon. Instead, Cadomian terranes are characterized by a large gap of magmatic activity during Mesoproterozoic time (Murphy et al., 2004). If our assumption of a contribution to the debris of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin is correct, only Cadomian terranes could be a potential source at the Gondwanan margin because of the total lack of 1.0–1.1 Ga old zircon in the represented data set. Outcrops in the Bohemian and Armorican Massifs demonstrate that Cadomian basement rocks were available to abrasion and erosion during the Cambro-Ordovician (Cadomian unconformity) (Rabu et al., 1990; Linnemann et al., 2000, 2007).\nThe second-largest zircon population (20.2%) is between ~2.0 and 2.25 Ga reflecting input of the Birimian and Eburnian basement rocks of theWest African craton and possibly temporally equivalent rocks in the Amazonian craton (Trans-Amazonian belt and the MarconiIcantiunas Province, Fig. 1). A zircon population (6.7%) of 750 to 980 Ma (Fig. 16) might be related to tectonothermal events associated with the geological history of Rodinia and its dispersal.\nA very exotic zircon population (7.1%) consists of Mesoproterozoic and Early Paleoproterozoic zircon grains ranging from ~1.3 to 1.9 Ga (Fig. 16). Such zircon ages are unknown from theWest African craton, which is characterized by a gap in magmatic activity from ca 1.0 to 1.6 Ga (e.g., Linnemann et al., 2007; Nance and Murphy, 1994; Nance et al., 2010). From the eastern edge of the Saharanmetacraton a Pb–Pb intrusion age of 1232±13 Ma for an orthogneiss is reported (Stern,\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\nF req u en cy\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\nF req u en cy\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\nP ro\nb ab\nili ty\nF req u en cy F req u en cy\n1994). Dixon (1981) describes zircon grains with a Pb–Pb age of about 1120 Ma (no error is given) from granite cobbles in a volcanoclastic and greywacke sedimentary sequence exposed in the Wadi Mubarak area in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Wust (1989) reports 9 detrital zircon grains obtained from a greywacke with a Pb–Pb age of 1460± 100 Ma located in the Eastern Desert of Egypt (Wadi Miyah and Wadi Allaqi). From the Eastern Hoggar (Tuareg shield), Henry et al. (2009) report from the 793±5 Ma old Oued Tuffok pluton SHRIMPU–Pb ages of 4 Mesoproterozoic zircon grains (1.18–1.38 Ga). The existence of some Mesoproterozoic zircons in the Saharan Metacraton with an age range of ~1.2–1.3 Ga has been proposed from fragmentary evidence (Henry et al., 2009; Stern, 1994) but proof of Mesoproterozoic crust that could act as a potential source area for Cambrian–Ordovician strata of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar is missing. The localities that\ndelivered the very few Mesoproterozoic Pb–Pb single zircon evaporation ages from detrital zircon are located at the far eastern end of the Saharan metacraton. But given the analytical techniques employed, these ages are considered minimum ages (Dixon, 1981; Wust, 1989). These circumstances, when considered with the general south–northdirected sedimentary transport of Cambro-Ordovician sediments deposited in the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin, suggest that the Mesoproterozoic zircon grains of our data set may have been derived from a source in the Amazonian craton. Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Rio Negro–Jurena belt (1.8–1.55 Ga) and of the Rondonia–San Ignacio belt (1.55–1.2 Ga) provide a potential source region for ~1.3–1.5 Ga old zircon in Amazonia (Bahlburg et al., 2009 and references therein). A contribution from the ~1.0 Ga old Sunsás belt of Amazonia is not evident in the data. If the interpretation of the contribution of\nMesoproterozoic detrital material from Amazonia is correct, then a larger fraction of other zircon populations could be likewise derived from Amazonia and adjoining Pan-African belts.\nA recent detrital zircon study of the Neoproterozoic clastic rocks in the Volta basin, which rest unconformably on the southeastern part of the West African Craton (Fig. 1), reveals a massive input of 1.0 to 1.9 Ga old zircons, and is interpreted to reflect a source from outside of the West African craton, most probably from Amazonia (Kalsbeek et al., 2008). Theoretically it is possible that the Cambrian–Ordovician drainage system and the Upper Ordovician glaciers may have recycled these deposits, which were then re-deposited in the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin. But this is not very likely because of the absence of ~1.0 Ga old zircon in our data set. Such a zircon population forms a major peak in samples from the Volta basin (Kalsbeek et al., 2008).\nVery few zircon grains of the data set seem to be derived fromMesoand Paleoarchean orogens, however possible source regionsmay be the Liberian (0.63%) and the Leonian (0.31%) orogenic belts of the West African craton (Kröner et al., 2001; Potrel et al., 1996, 1998). Input from Cambrian–Ordovician igneous rocks (~520–475 Ma) is reflected by a small zircon population (0.95%, Fig. 16). Such magmatism maybe is related to the rift and drift-off of the Avalonian microcontinent and related terranes related to the opening of the Rheic Ocean (Linnemann et al., 2008; Murphy and Nance, 1991; Murphy et al., 2004; Nance et al., 2010).\nThe total absenceof ~1.0 Gaoldzircons inall our investigated samples fromtheTassili OuanAhaggar basin rocksprovides important constraints for paleogeographic reconstructions and provenance studies and excludes the Arabian-Nubian shield as a potential source area (Fig. 18).\ntransition field\ntypical for zircons from mafic melts\nn(all)=630/850 n\n=4 0/\n43 0\n002/31= n\nAge (Ma)\nT h\n/U\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500\ntypical for zircons from felsic melts\nFig. 17. U/Th ratio plotted against the U–Pb age of analyzed detrital zircon from all investigated samples (HOG 1 to HOG 7).\nSquire et al. (2006) proposed the East African belt (“Transgondwanan Supermountains”) (Fig. 1) or the East-African–Antarctic Orogen, respectively, as potential source areas for the Cambrian–Ordovician strata in North Gondwana. Following Squire et al. (2006), this sedimentary transport should be characterized by super-fan systems. However, as the detrital zircon grains from the East African belt show an important ~1.0 Ga zircon population (Squire et al., 2006), we can eliminate this orogen as a potential source of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin rocks.\nThe Th/U ratio is indicative of the magma composition from which zircons originated. If the ratio ranges between 0.1 and 1.0, usually the zircon is derived from felsic to intermediate melts (Hoskin and Schaltegger, 2003; Liu et al., 2008). If the Th/U ratio is significantly higher, the zircon is probably derived from amaficmelt. Most of the Th/ U ratios are in the range for felsic to intermediate magmas (Fig. 17). Of the Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic zircons, 40 grains (9%) have a\nratio ranging from 1.5 to 2.8, 13 grains (6.5%) of Mesoproterozoic to Paleoproterozoic zircon grains have a ratio higher than 1.5, suggesting derivation from mafic magmas (Fig. 17). In comparison to these older grains, more distinct zircons from the Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic show a Th/U ratio typical for mafic melts (Fig. 17). Thus, in the record of our data set, Pan-African orogenic processes could indicate much more involvement of mafic melts than all the older orogenic events."

    "heading": "7. Evolution of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin",
    "text": "The Cambrian–Ordovician Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin opened earliest during uppermost Cambrian to lowermost Ordovician times, at a time when Avalonia and related terranes (e.g., Meguma) left the Gondwana margin during the opening of the Rheic Ocean (Linnemann et al., 2007; Murphy et al., 2004; Nance et al., 2010). Northern and western African crust underwent extension, thermal subsidence and accumulation of clastic sediments that were re-deposited from the Gondwanan hinterland. The ~500 m thick siliciclastic deposits in the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin are super-mature and consist mainly of quartz. Such deposits require a strong chemical weathering and several episodes of sediment recycling, a scenario consistent with an origin in the Gondwanan interior. This interpretation implies that the PanAfrican orogen was eroded and denuded in most of Cambrian time, because the Upper Cambrian to Ordovician sandstones of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin overlie directly on its deeply eroded basement (Fig. 4).\nThe oldest sample (HOG1)has a zircon cluster dominated bya single strong peak in the range of ~2.0–2.2 Ga (Fig. 9) implying that a fluvial systemerodedmainly theEburneanbasementor a related terrane in the Tuareg shield.Only a small numberof zircon grains showaffinities to the Pan-African basement. However, in the deltaic to shallow marine sandstones of the Lower to Middle Ordovician (samples HOG 2 to 5), detrital material from the Pan-African basement is overwhelmingly\nples of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin (recent study) and comparison with Amazonia, Drost et al., 2011; Linnemann et al., 2004; and references therein).\ndominant implying that cratonic sources became less important in the source area during the Lower and Middle Ordovician transgressions, implying that the cratonic rocks may have been covered by sediments. Instead, Pan-African rocks became remobilised during the Lower to Middle Ordovician opening of the Rheic Ocean. The Pan-African basement was most probably exposed on rift shoulders and escarpments throughout Ordovician time. Samewas the case for large areas in Cadomia, especially in the Bohemian and Armorican massifs. Thus, a contribution from those massifs seems reasonable.\nAnother dramatic change in the sediment supply occurred during the deposition of the Upper Ordovician (Hirnantian) glaciomarine massive sandstones. Sample HOG 6 shows (i) a significant increase in cratonic zircons (Fig. 14) and (ii) the occurrence of 1.3 to 1.5 Ga Mesoproterozoic zircons (Fig. 14). Transport directions of glaciers and floating ice (Fig. 19) show the top-N to top-NNW streaming directions of the ice shield indicated by measured glacial lineations (Beuf et al., 1971; Ghienne et al., 2007a,b). Increasing populations of Archaean, and Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic zircons indicate derivation from West African cratonic basement, implying that this basement was eroded by the ice. Mesoproterozoic zircons (1.3–1.5 Ga) imply also a long-distance transport of a smaller portion of sediments by glaciers from Amazonia and/or the Volta basin. At the end of the glaciation (HOG 7), the relatively low content of craton-derived zircons suggests that rising sea level reduced the area of exposed cratonic basement.\nSedimentary supply from more distant areas like Amazonia and Cadomia into the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin could be realized by sediment transport along the coast for the Cambrian–Ordovician marine settings, and by floating ice for the Late Ordovician glaciation.\nLAURENTIA\nBAL TICA\nIBERIAN MASSIFAI N OL A V A T S E W E\nA S\nT A\nV A\nLO N\nIA\nSAXOTHURING\nARMORICAN MASSIF\nR h\ne i c\nO c\ne a\nn\nI a p e t u s O c e a n\nglacigenic diamictites\nmarine\nterrestrial\nCAD O\nWe Am Ic\nFig. 19.Main transport directions during theOrdovician (Beuf et al., 1971), themaximumconfig Ouan Ahaggar (from Beuf et al., 1971; Ghienne et al., 2007a; Schönian and Egenhoff, 2007).

    "text": "A vast sheet of Cambrian–Ordovician sandstone with an estimated volume of 15 million km3 was deposited along the northern margin of Gondwana from Morocco to Oman in the aftermath of the Pan-African and Cadomian orogenies (Avigad et al., 2005; Drost et al., 2011; Linnemann et al., 2000, 2004; Noblet and Lefort, 1990). Further, in periGondwanan terranes formed on the northern Gondwanan margin, correlative mature sandstones occur in the Lower Ordovician sections part of Paleozoic sections (e.g., Iberian Massif, Armorican Massif, and Bohemian Massif). High maturity sand deposits imply intervals of intense chemical weathering and cleaning by streamingwater between late Neoproterozoic and Middle Cambrian times (e.g., Linnemann et al., 2000). Gondwana drifted into lower latitudes during the Lower and Middle Cambrian (McKerrow et al., 1992; McKerrow and Cocks, 1995) where a warm to humid climate dominated. Pan-African and Avalonian–Cadomian volcanism during late Neoproterozoic and early Cambrian time (Avigad et al., 2005) caused an extreme unusually corrosive atmospherewith a very high atmospheric pCO2 that forced an extreme chemical weathering on the vegetation-free landscape under warm-humid climatic conditions. Intense erosion and denudation of Pan-African, Cadomian and related Neoproterozoic orogens formed a peneplain on the surface of Gondwana. Ordovician rifting and widespread thermal subsidence on the margins of Gondwana opened shallow marine shelf basins where masses of high maturity sands accumulated. Aggressive weathering might have had been a large impact on the radiation of organisms, because abundant nutrients would have been transported by super-large drainage systems (Squire et al., 2006) in late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian times to the oceans.\nIA PROTO-ALPINE\nTERRANES GONDW ANAN TURKEY\nTEPLÁBARRANDIEN/ MOLDANUBIAN\nG O N D W A N A\n444 Ma\n80 °S\n60 °S\n40 °S\n20 °S\n0°S\nMIA\nTASSILI OUAN\nAHAGGAR\nst African azonian e Sheet\nuration of theUpper Ordovician ice sheet inWest Gondwana and theposition of the Tassili ansport directions underline the possible input of detrital zircon grains from Amazonia."

    "text": "Detrital zircons in seven samples (HOG 1–7) from Upper Cambrian to Ordovician sandstones in the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin in the Algerian Sahara have been analyzed by U–Pb LA-ICP-MS at the Senckenberg Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden (Germany). Of 850 zircon grains analyzed, 630 zircon grains yield concordant ages, i.e. in the range of 90 to 110% concordance, and provide an archive of the provenance, tectono-magmatic history, basin development and peneplain formation along the northern margin of Gondwana. These data show:\n(i) The main sedimentary sources of the Cambrian–Ordovician of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin are the West African craton, the Tuareg shield, the Pan-African orogen at the periphery of the West African craton, and the Trans-Saharan orogenic belt including the Benin-Nigeria shield. The Saharan metacraton cannot be excluded from the potential source areas.\n(ii) A potential source for exotic Mesoproterozoic to Early Paleoproterozoic zircon grains (1.3–1.9 Ga) is the Amazonian craton.\n(iii) Cadomian terranes from the periphery of northern Gondwana may have contributed to the sedimentary rocks of the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin. (iv) More eastern located areas like the Arabian-Nubian shield and the East African belt can be excluded as a source area because of the total lackof ~1.0 Gaold zircon grains in the analyzed samples.\n(v) Peaks of major crustal growth in the source areas are in descending order. (a) A mixture of collisional Pan-African and subduction-related Cadomian orogenic processes culminating in the range of 560–620 Ma, and (b) the formation of the Birimian basement and its cratonic stabilization during the Eburnian orogenic event (2.0–2.2 Ga).\n(vi) Due to the likely input of an Amazonian source for the Mesoproterozoic and Early Paleoproterozoic zircons, a contribution of Amazonia to all other zircon populations has to be assumed.\n(vii) The Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin was opened in uppermost Cambrian to lowermost Ordovician time due to the tension along the north Gondwanan margin during the separation of Avalonia and the opening of the Rheic Ocean.\n(viii) Sedimentation in the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin started with Upper Cambrian fluvial sediments (Early Tassili-quartzite), which has a local provenance (West African craton or a related terrane in the Tuareg shield).\n(ix) A dramatic change occurred during the deposition of the deltaic–shallow marine sediments of the Lower Ordovician Ajjers Formation and the marine sandstones of the Middle Ordovician d'In Azaoua Formation. Detrital zircon data from both formations indicate the Pan-African orogen of the TransSaharan belt as the main source for the siliciclastic detritus. During Ordovician rifting, the denuded Pan-African orogen was exposed by crustal extension and made accessible to erosion at rift shoulders and escarpments.\n(x) Another major change in basin history occurred during the glaciomarine sedimentation of the Tamadjert Formation during Upper Ordovician (Hirnantian) time. Glacial erosion first involved mainly old cratonic surfaces as demonstrated by the Paleoproterozoic to Archaean zircon population age clusters. Remarkably, the presence of a small portion of Mesoproterozoic zircon grains suggests long-distance transport from Amazonia and/or a crustal domain from central West Gondwana.\n(xi) High mature sands of the Cambrian–Ordovician section in the Tassili Ouan Ahaggar basin were derived from the formation of a Cambrian peneplain in the interior of West Gondwana. The Gondwanan peneplainwas formed underwarm-humid climate\nin the Cambrian on a vegetation-free land surface and under the influence of an extreme corrosive atmosphere that originated from high pCO2 caused by Pan-African and Cadomian volcanism in late Neoproterozoic–early Cambrian time.\nSupplementarymaterials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.lithos.2011.01.010."
