    "text": "The palynological analysis of the Burdigalian (Early Miocene) successions of the Güvem Basin (NW Central Anatoia, Turkey) has been carried out with the aim of reconstructing the palaeovegetation. The pollen spectra indicate a flora dominated by trees such as Quercus deciduous type, Carya, Carpinus, Ulmus/Zelkova, Engelhardia, Quercus ilex type and Pinaceae. Pterocarya, Juglans, Alnus, Salix, Liquidambar and Oleaceae are represented by lower percentages. Herbs and shrubs are represented by minor amounts of Poaceae, Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae, Asteraceae/Asteroideae, Brassicaceae, and the aquatics Potamogeton, Sparganium and Typha. The Burdigalian flora reflects a mixed mesophytic forest with Quercus deciduous type, Quercus ilex type, pine species, Ulmus/Zelkova, Engelhardia, Carya, Carpinus, Pterocarya, etc., sparcely interspersed with open herbaceous areas. This flora reflects a warm-temperate climate. The fluctuations in abundances of broadleaved trees and xerophytes may represent fluctuations of relatively wet and dry periods. The overall composition of the flora of the Güvem Basin reflects cooler conditions compared with other Early Miocene floras in Europe, which is possibly due to intense volcanic activity of the area. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The Galatean Volcanic Province (GVP) is located in the northwestern part of Central Anatolia (Fig. 1), which occurs within the Pontide structural division of Turkey (Ketin, 1966). The northern margin of the GVP is bordered by the North Anatolian Fault, whereas the southern margin is surrounded by a continental clastic sedimentary sequence which interfingers with the volcanics. Two different volcanic cycles have been recognised in the GVP (Keller et al., 1992; Toprak et al., 1996; Wilson et al., 1997). Miocene volcanic activity is widespread. The Early Miocene older cycle is dominated by intermediate-acid lava flows and associated pyroclastics with relatively minor occurrences of alkali basaltic lava flows, whilst\n⁎ Tel.: +90 362 3121919/1065; fax: +90 362 4566035.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.revpalbo.2008.02.001\nthe Late Miocene younger cycle consists of small-volume alkali basalt flows capping the older volcanic sequence (Wilson et al., 1997). Radiometric age determinations indicate an age of 17 to 20 Ma for the older cycle (Türkecan et al., 1991; Keller et al., 1992; Wilson et al., 1997; Tankut et al., 1998a) and 9 to 11 Ma for the younger cycle (Keller et al., 1992; Wilson et al., 1997; Tankut et al., 1998a).\nThe GVP comprises a number of volcanic complexes intimately associated with the development of a series of sedimentary basins. The Pelitçik, Güvem and Orta Basins are examples (Fig. 1B). These basins are contamporaneous with the volcanic complexes in the vicinity (Toprak et al., 1996). The lithologies and ages of the sequences deposited in these isolated basins are somewhat different from each other. The Early Miocene freshwater deposits of the Güvem Basin have been known for their rich record of plant macrofossils (Kasaplıgil 1977; Erdei et al., 2002) as well as animal fossils (Kasaplıgil 1977; Paicheler et al., 1978; Rückert-Ülkümen 1985, 2003). Baki Kasaplıgil was the first scientist who recognised the\nabundance of fossils in the area (plant macrofossils: cones, fruits, seeds, leaves and branches; animal fossils: skeletal impressions of fishes, frogs and insects). He reported several fossil sites that are scattered in an area 15 km long and 7 km wide (Kasaplıgil, 1977). Collections of Kasaplıgil were confined mainly to the Beşkonak and Kadıoğlu sites of the Güvem area. Kasaplıgil (1977) for the first time draw attention to the exceptionally high scientific value of the area and suggested its protection. Later, following efforts of the General Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration Institute (MTA) in Ankara, the Güvem fossil site became formally protected. Today, official permission is needed to enter the area.\nAs mentioned above there are some earlier studies on plant macrofossils and animal fossils of the Güvem area and currently a few plant macrofossils are exhibited in the Natural History Museum of MTA. However, to date there is no palynological information from the Güvem Basin,except a few pollen grains identified by Kasaplıgil (1977) and Fourquin et al. (1970). This study therefore aims to investigate palynologically the Güvem deposits in order to reconstruct the Early Miocene vegetation and to discuss its paleoclimatic implications."

    "text": "The formation of the GVP is related to the closure of the northern branch of the Neotethys with the collision between the African Plate in the south and the Eurasian Plate in the north. During the Late Oligocene–Miocene, continuing postcollisional convergence between the Sakarya Continent (southfacing northern active margin of the northern Neotethys) and the Menderes–Tauride Platform led to the thickening of the crust, uplift and subsequent emergence of a broad ENE–WSW trending intermontane basin. This basin was later structurally seperated into several small-scale successor basins with an infill of a thick fluvio-lacustrine volcano-sedimentary sequence accompanied by calc-alkaline, and later alkaline volcanism (Koçyiğit et al., 2003 and references therein). The Güvem Basin is one of these isolated basins within the GVP containing thick fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary infills interfingering with the volcanic rocks (Paicheler, 1978; Toprak et al., 1996). In a relatively short period without magmatic activity, a lacustrine regime, in which a rich variety of fauna and flora developed, expanded in the Güvem Basin. The continental clastic sequence\nof the basin is well developed around Beşkonak village (Fig. 2) and is represented by an alternation of fossil-rich diatomites and pyroclastics. The volcano-sedimentary sequence of the Güvem Basin along with that of other successor basins, is folded and thrust-faulted to reverse-faulted during Late Miocene compression (Koçyiğit et al., 2003).\nAlthough the stratigraphy of the Güvem Basin was already studied in conjunction with geological mapping at a 1:25000 scale by Fourquin (1977), the first formal classification was proposed by Tankut et al. (1998b). They carried out deatiled field mapping around Güvem and subdivided the Miocene volcanic sequence into a series of well defined stratigraphic units (Fig. 3). The Çukurviran dacite (19.7 Ma) is unconformably overlain by the Güvem Formation, which in turn is unconformably overlain by the Sabuncukaya basalt (9.5 Ma). The Burdigalian Güvem Formation is subdivided into seven units on the basis of lithology and phenocryst mineralogy. The Dereköy pyroclastics, at the very bottom of Güvem Formation,\nare predominantly composed of andesitic blocks, ash flows, lapilli tuffs and locally intercalated with diatomite. The fossilrich diatomites of the Dereköy pyroclastics is the focus of this study. The Dereköy pyroclastics are overlain by the Balta rhyolite, Bakacak andesite (17.9 Ma), Oğlakcı dacite (17.8 Ma), Karto dacite, Sivritepe dacite and Uluyol dacite. The Güvem Formation is unconformably overlain by a columnar jointed basaltic lava flow of Late Miocene age (Sabuncukaya basalt). This flow represents the youngest phase of volcanic actvity in the Güvem area (Tankut et al., 1998a). The presence of a wellknown and well-dated mammal locality, the Keseköy site, within the Güvem Basin further supports the Burdigalian age (MN3) of the Dereköy pyroclastics (De Bruijn et al., 1992)."

    "heading": "4. Results",
    "text": "The pollen assemblage of the Güvem section can be divided into four zones on the basis of changes in the major pollen components, from bottom to top (Fig. 5), as follows:\nZone 4 extends from the base of the studied section at 3860 to 3558 cm (included). This zone is characterized by the dominance of Quercus, Pinus and Pinaceae undifferentiated (Pinaceae undiff.). Quercus occurs both as evergreen subtropical species and deciduous temperate species. Evergreen Quercus slightly increases upward (11 to 18%) while deciduous Quercus has a more uniform representation with an average of 11%. Pinaceae undiff. increases upward and reaches 22% at the top of this zone. Ulmus/Zelkova and Carya, ranging from 4% to 22% are also well-repsented. These types show a decreasing upward trend. Engelhardia and Carpinus are represented by lower percentages. Cedrus, Betula, Tilia and Apiaceae are all represented by a single pollen grain in this zone. Taxa exclusive to the Zone 4 are Araliaceae, Caryophyllaceae and Polygalaceae. Acer has its maximum (1.8%) at the base of this zone\nwhile Pterocarya increases upward and reaches its maximum (3.5%) at 3590 cm. Herb pollen is represented mainly by Poaceae and Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae with 2–7%.\nZone 3 extends from 3558 (excluded) to 1537 cm (included). This zone is seperated from Zone 4 by an increase in percentages of Ulmus/Zelkova, Pinus, evergreen Quercus, Carya and Engelhardia. Evergreen Quercus (29% to 26%), Ulmus/Zelkova (25% to 20), Pinus (23% to 10), Engelhardia (15% to 12%) and Carya (16% to 3%) dominate this zone with decreasing upward trends and Pinaceae undiff. (12% to 20%) and Carpinus (8% to 12%) with increasing trends. The first occurrences of Hamameliaceae, Salix, Cathaya, Cedrus, Typha, Potamogeton and freshwater algae Botryococcus are registered. Juglans and Castanea–Castanopsis type pollen are rare in this zone and Pterocarya is not represented. Salix, Fagus, Cathaya and Cedrus are scarce. Herb pollen is represented by Poaceae and Brassicaceae with 2–5%. Typha and Potamogeton pollen occur from this zone onwards. Aquatic plants are represented by low percentages (1–7%).\nZone 2 extends from 1537 cm (excluded) to 423 cm (included). This zone is distinguished by a decrease in evergreen Quercus and an increase in Carya and Pinaceae undifferentiated. Within the zone, evergreen Quercus (8–20%), deciduous Quercus (2–8%), Carya (7–15%), Ulmus/Zelkova (10–25%), Pinus (5–15%) and Pinaceae undiff. (10–30%) fluctuate and the genera Liquidambar, Lonicera and Celtis appear for he first time. A steady presence of Engelhardia and\nCarpinus around 10–15% and lower quantities for Castanea– Castanopsis type, Acer, Salix and Pterocarya of 1–3% are recorded. The aquatic taxa Potamogeton shows a sudden increase (10%), whereas Typha is not present in this zone.\nZone 1 extends from 423 cm (excluded) to the top of the studied section. This zone is distinguished by maxima for Carpinus pollen of 13% at the base of zone and the absence of Pinus. A steady presence of Ulmus/Zelkova and Pinaceae undiff., each around 22% are recorded. Carya and evergreen Quercus show upward increase with 7–15% while Carpinus and Engelhardia show upward decrease with 13–2%. Pollen of Cyrillaceae–Clethraceae, Sapotaceae, Pterocarya, Castanea– Castanopsis type, Tilia, Salix, Alnus, Oleaceae and Cathaya participate with frequencies below 3%. Herbs are represented by few Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae, Brassicaceae and Poaceae. Aquatic plants Potamogeton and Typha show an upward decrease with 7–1%.\nThe pollen flora shows some variations in occurrence. In general, Engelhardia, Carpinus, Pinaceae undiff. and Ulmus/ Zelkova increase upwards while Quercus deciduous type and Pinus decrease upwards. When percentage values of Ulmus/ Zelkova decrease, that of Engelhardia increases and vice versa. Poaceae, Sapotaceae, Castanea–Castanopsis type, Asteraceae/ Asteroideae and Caryophyllaceae are present generally in the lower part of the section. Acer and Brassicaceae are almost continuous in occurrence without any significant variation. Potamogeton and Sparganium reach their maximum occurrences parallel to Engelhardia, and Carpinus reaches its maximum in the upper parts of the section. The algae Botryococcus is found in very small quantities but continuously through the section."

    "text": "The pollen diagram for the Güvem Basin records the presence of a mixed-mesophytic forest with the dominance of deciduous and a considerable proportion of evergreen plants. The mixed-mesophytic forest trees such as Quercus (ilex and deciduous types), Ulmus/Zelkova, Engelhardia, Carpinus and Carya are predominantly represented in the samples. The sum of the percentages of Quercus ilex and Quercus deciduous types form a large part of the total percentage of the pollen spectra without Pinus and undifferentiated Pinaceae. Q. ilex type is quite common especially in the lower and middle parts of the section. Peaks of Q. ilex type, which is an important element in the xeric forests of the Mediterranean region (Barbero et al., 1992), may reflect relatively dry conditions. However, Ulmus is a major and important element of deciduous broad-leaved forests and coniferous mixed forests in northern China (Li et al., 2004) and high Ulmus percentages reflect warm periods. The fluctuations in percentages of Q. ilex type and Ulmus probably show minor fluctuations of relatively dry and wet periods during early to middle Burdigalian. The presence of Ephedra in the pollen and megafossil record, although in minor amounts, also points to relatively dry conditions.\nIt should be mentioned that conifer pollen (Pinus and undifferentiated Pinaceae) is abundant in the samples, presumably because of their production in high numbers and the capacity of bisaccate pollen for long distance transport (Traverse, 1988; Suc and Drivaliari, 1991).\nOne of the most important factors to which vegetation of an area depends on is altitude, controlling temperature and precipitation. Paleovegetation organized in altitudional belts, like today in subtropical to temperate SE China and Central Nepal, is also recorded in palynological data (Hoorn et al., 2000; Jimenez-Moreno, 2006 and references therein). JimenezMoreno (2006) identified the following vegetational belts in the middle Miocene of Pannonian Basin (Hungary): 1) coastal marine environments occupied by halophytes; 2) low altitudinal belt populated by a broad-leaved rain forest and evergreen forest together with a well developed swamp forest; 3) areas of higher altitude characterized by an evergreen and deciduous mixed forests together with a riparian vegetation; 4) middle altitude belt with Cathaya, Tsuga and Cedrus; and 5) high altitude belt with Picea and Abies.\nAlthough scarcity of higher-altitude elements (meso-microthermic elements) in the pollen spectra indicate that the area was situated at a relatively low altitude, Central Anatolia underwent orogenic uplift during Early Miocene. The paleogeographic panorama of Turkey was an eastward-sloping highland represented by western and central Anatolia and a lowland with rolling topography in large parts of the Pontides (Şengör et al., 1985). The land area in western and central Turkey was surrounded by shallow seas. The actual elevation of this highland is difficult to assess but minimum and maximum figures may be surmised for its western part as an average elevation with respect to present sea level of about 2 to 5 km (Şengör et al., 1985). The altitude of the Güvem area during the Burdigalian, as regard to altitudinal vegetation, was probably not high enough for the spread of higher-altitude elements (represented only by few pollen grains of Cedrus, which lives today at 2000–2500 m altitude in the Himalayas; Hoorn et al., 2000), but also not low enough to provide suitable conditions for swamp forest taxa (presently, Güvem is at about 1100 m altitude).\nThe scarcity of Cedrus may also result from latitudinal difference within Anatolia as the genus is represented by higher percentages (18,5%) in the Seyitömer Basin (Yavuz-Işık, 2007), which is located further south. The Early Miocene palaeogeography of Anatolia is relatively well-known and was relatively similar to the modern one. The latitudinal range between two localities (Güvem and Seyitömer), like today, may be estimated to have been about 1° in the Early Miocene (Lüttig and Steffens, 1976; Steininger and Rögl, 1984).\nThe group of herbs is relatively important in the pollen sum and is mainly made up of Poaceae, Amaranthaceae/ Chenopodiaceae and Asteraceae/Asteroideae. This type of vegetation characterizes open areas with herbaceous plants. Strömberg et al. (2007) studied the phytoliths (siliceous plant microfossils) from well known faunal localities in Turkey, Greece and Iran to provide information about habitat changes through Cenozoic times in this region. Since phytoliths\nconstitute microscopic bodies in many vascular plants and are deposited in the soils when plants decay, either in situ or after transportation (e.g., through wind or river action or as a part of animal droppings) (Strömberg et al., 2007), phytolith analysis is very complementary to pollen analysis in paleoenvironmental studies. Unlike pollen or plant macrofossils, phytolith assemblages often provide a proxy for habitat openness. In their study Strömberg et al. (2007) examined phytolith assemblages of two samples from the Güvem area exclusively from the Keseköy mammal locality. One sample is from 1 m, the other from 2 m above the Keseköy faunal level (De Bruijn et al., 1992). The lower sample is dominated by phytoliths produced exclusively by grasses (Poaceae), while the upper sample contains phytoliths indicative of forest (palms, woody or herbaceous dicotyledons, conifers and ferns) and grass phytoliths in roughly equal amounts. The results of phytolith analysis are consistent with those of pollen analysis of this study showing decreasing frequencies of Poaceae pollen and increasing forest taxa upward in the studied section. Although the data of Strömberg et al. (2007) indicated that relatively open habitats had become common in Turkey and surrounding regions by the Early Miocene (∼20 Ma), low percentages (maximum 6%) of herb pollen (Fig. 5) indicate that open areas were not widespread in the Güvem area during the Burdigalian."

    "text": "The Güvem palynoflora is dominated by deciduous and mesothermic plants such as Ulmus/Zelkova, Carya, Carpinus, Quercus deciduous type and Engelhardia together with some Pinaceae. Megathermic and meso-microthermic elements are scarce. This type of vegetation points to a warm-temperate climate for the Güvem Basin.\nMegathermic elements are abundant in European early Early Miocene (Hungarian Neogene deposits, Egerian: Nagy, 1992; Burdur–Kavak and Denizli–Kurbalık areas, early Aquitanian: Akgün et al., 2007) and late Early Miocene (Hungarian Neogene deposits, Karpatian: Nagy, 1992; Magyaregregy, Karpatian: Erdei et al., 2007; Ortenburg gravel, late Ottangian: Böhme et al., 2007) but relatively rare in middle Early Miocene as in the Güvem Basin (this study), Seyitömer Basin (Kütahya– Turkey, Early–Middle Miocene; Yavuz-Işık, 2007), Rubielos de Mora Basin (Teruel— NE Spain, late Burdigalian—MN4; Jimenez-Moreno et al., 2007) and the Oberdorf lignite seam (Styrian Basin—Austria, Ottangian ∼17.5 Ma; Kolcon and Sachsenhofer, 1999).\nMega-mesothermic elements are rich in Early Miocene coalforming basins of Europe and commonly represent swamp forest communities with Taxodium, Glyptostrobus, Myrica, Nyssa, etc. (Takahashi and Jux, 1991; Kohlman-Adamska, 1993; Kvacek, 1998; Kolcon and Sachsenhofer, 1999; Yavuz-Işık, 2007). However, the conditions in the Güvem Basin were not suitable for swamp forest taxa, possibly due to slightly cooler climatic conditions. Despite this, warm taxa like Engelhardia were still present within the mixed mesophytic forest. Engelhardia, a present-day mega-mesothermic mainly evergreen tree-genus of the Juglandaceae typical from the low altitude mixed broad-\nleaved and evergreen forests in subtropical SE China (JimenezMoreno, 2006), is more common in the upper parts of the studied section probably indicating slightly higher temperatures.\nThe relative proportion of palaeotropical (P) and arctotertiary (A) floral elements may give some qualitative impression on the general climate. The share of the two geofloras in the European Neogene is variable and strictly related to climatic fluctuations (Planderova et al., 1993). Palaeotropical elements are numerous in the earliest Miocene of Europe and outnumber the arctotertiary elements (Akgün et al., 2007 and refences therein; Stuchlik, 1992; Planderova et al., 1993). Planderova et al. (1993) state that the number of palaeotropical elements is high in Central and Eastern Europe in the Egerian while arctotertiary elements become enriched in the early Eggenburgian as an evidence of cooling and paleotropical elements again dominate in the late Eggenburgian. The maximum warming of the climate begun in the Eggenburgian in the Paratethys region and continued in the lower portion of the Ottangian, while outside the Paratethys region (in Bohemia and Polish lowlands) the proportions of P and A elements are almost equal (Planderova et al., 1993). Kolcon and Sachsenhofer (1999) also recorded that the P/A ratio is about 1 in the Early Miocene Oberdorf lignite seam (Styrian Basin, Austria). In the early Karpatian no changes have been noted in the P/A ratio, which indicates a climate similar to that of the late Ottangian, and finally in the late Karpatian the role of paleotropical elements increases distinctly (Planderova et al., 1993).\nThe P/A ratios of the Güvem palynoflora do not show changes along the studied section and are all low (b0,3). For comparison with other regions, quantitative data from Burdigalian are scarce. The P/A ratios from Turkish Early Miocene localities of Peçenek (very close to Güvem Basin within the GVP; Yavuz-Isık, in prep.), Seyitömer (Western Turkey; YavuzIşık, 2007) and Biga Peninsula (NW Turkey; Ediger, 1990) are all calculated to be b1 (but see Akgün et al., 2007). In comparison with other Early Miocene floras from Europe, the low P/A ratios of the Güvem palynoflora may reflect the presence of relatively cooler climatic conditions.\nFor quantitative climate analyses of fossil plant and pollen assemblages from the Miocene of the Pannonian domain and Central Anatolia, Erdei et al. (2007) and Akgün et al. (2007) used the Coexistence Approach (Mosbrugger and Utescher, 1997). Erdei et al. (2007) estimated mean annual temperatures at 16.5–18.8 °C for the Eggenburgian (?Ottnangian, Ipolytarnóc) and at 15.6–16.6 °C for the Karpatian (Magyaregregy) and stated that warmer climate conditions are indicated by the Ipolytarnóc flora and vegetation characterised by an extremely high number of thermophilous taxa as well as a complex vegetation structure. Akgün et al. (2007) estimated 17.2–20.8 °C for the latest Burdigalian (Samsun–Havza) and stated that swamp, riparian and mixed mesophytic forest elements with high percentages of mountain forest species show cooling during the latest Burdigalian in Central Anatolia. These data support the interpretation that the Güvem palynoflora reflects slightly cooler conditions. This is possibly related to volcanic activity in the area since episodes of frequent and intense effusive volcanism tend to be associated with cooler times with decreasing surface\ntemperatures (Axelrod, 1981). Also continental influence on the climatic conditions in Europe may account for this relative cooling (see Bruch and Zhilin, 2007)."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "The palynological study of the early Burdigalian section in the Güvem Basin has permitted the identification of a large number of pollen types. The vegetation during Burdigalian times was dominated by mesothermic tree taxa such as Ulmus/ Zelkova, Quercus deciduous type, Carpinus, Carya and Pinaceae together with mega-mesothermic Engelhardia. Also herbs are relatively important in the pollen spectra. They characterize open areas with Poaceae, Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae, Asteraceae/Asteroideae and Brassicaceae. The presence of water plants, mainly Potamogeton, together with minor but persistent occurrences of Botryococcus indicates freshwater environments. The palynofloral components show some variations in occurrence and fluctuations in percenteges of Quercus ilex type andUlmus are interpreted in terms ofminor fluctuations of relatively dry and wet periods. The reconstructed vegetation points to a warm-temperate climate for he Güvem Basin during the early Burdigalian. The Güvem palynoflora reflects cooler climatic conditions compared with other Early Miocene floras in Europe. This is possibly related to intense volcanic activity in the area and to the influence of continentality."

  "abstractText": "The palynological analysis of the Burdigalian (Early Miocene) successions of the Güvem Basin (NW Central Anatoia, Turkey) has been carried out with the aim of reconstructing the palaeovegetation. The pollen spectra indicate a flora dominated by trees such as Quercus deciduous type, Carya, Carpinus, Ulmus/Zelkova, Engelhardia, Quercus ilex type and Pinaceae. Pterocarya, Juglans, Alnus, Salix, Liquidambar and Oleaceae are represented by lower percentages. Herbs and shrubs are represented by minor amounts of Poaceae, Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae, Asteraceae/Asteroideae, Brassicaceae, and the aquatics Potamogeton, Sparganium and Typha. The Burdigalian flora reflects a mixed mesophytic forest with Quercus deciduous type, Quercus ilex type, pine species, Ulmus/Zelkova, Engelhardia, Carya, Carpinus, Pterocarya, etc., sparcely interspersed with open herbaceous areas. This flora reflects a warm-temperate climate. The fluctuations in abundances of broadleaved trees and xerophytes may represent fluctuations of relatively wet and dry periods. The overall composition of the flora of the Güvem Basin reflects cooler conditions compared with other Early Miocene floras in Europe, which is possibly due to intense volcanic activity of the area. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
