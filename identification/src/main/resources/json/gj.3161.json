Somerville\n398 Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Lt\nThe Qinling Orogenic Belt is a typical composite continental orogenic belt in China. The Qinling Mountains is not only a natural demarcation that separates China into a southern part and a northern part, in terms of Qinling Orogenic Belt's geography, climate, organisms, and river systems, but also forms a cultural boundary between the Yellow River Civilization to the north and the Yangtze River Civilization to the south. The Xi'an Qinling Zhongnanshan World Geopark is situated in the major portion of the collision zone between the South China and North China plates, which is also a typical section of the Qinling Orogenic Belt. It has been the focus of great attention for its long history of geological evolution, intensive tectonism, various rock types, unique strata, frequent magmatism, and abundant geological heritage sites. This paper clarifies the regional geological background of the Qinling ZhongnanshanWorld Geopark in 3 aspects, that is, the regional geological setting, regional evolution, and regional strata. With an integrated analysis and classification, the paper describes the main features of geological relics and geological remains of scientific significance in the geopark, on the basis of an investigation and systematic analysis for the geological relic resources of the world geopark. Compared with the geosites in other world geoparks, the sites in the Zhongnanshan area are particularly distinctive, even unique.\nKEYWORDS\ncomparative analyses, geological sites, Qinling Orogenic Belt, World Geopark, Zhongnanshan"

    "text": "Preservation and valuation of a heritage that once lost will never be recovered, has become common knowledge among inhabitants of the Earth village (Cowie & Wimbledon, 1994). The system of The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Geoparks was established in 2004 to highlight and protect some of the world's most spectacular and important geological sites. As such, scientific studies in and around these parks offer some of the best opportunities to understand important events in Earth's history and serve as permanent and protected sites where scientific ideas can be tested for generations to come (Ye, Wang, & Wang, 2010). Global Geopark is an important extension and complementarity of “Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Heritage” (Hazen, 2008) and “Man and Biosphere.” It accentuates the recognition of the values of geological heritage, and sceneries with regional and national significance that are still unlisted in “The list of World Heritage” so far, paying more attentions to the relationships between social‐economic development and protection of geological heritage and natural environment, and finally, the establishment of geoparks\nd. wileyonlinelib\nto achieve the goals of protection of geological heritage and promotion of sustainable development of social economy (Chen, Zhao, & Lan, 2006). Especially, in developing countries, it is an effective way to set up geoparks for geoheritage protection (Eder, 1999; International Declaration of the Rights of the Memories of the Earth, 1991, Digne, France). Up to 2006, 55 geoparks in the world have been enrolled in the Network of Global Geoparks based on selection through appraisal, in which 18 are in China. Today, geoparks are widespread in our country and have become bases of scientific popularization for the general public (T. Zhao & Zhao, 2002).\nZhongnan Mountain, located in the midst of Qinling Mountains, begins in Mei County in the west and extends for nearly 200 km to Lantian County in the east (Figure 2), and whose main peak within the boundaries of the Chang'an Area has an elevation of 2,604 m. Qinling Zhongnanshan World Geopark (QZG) is located in the precinct of Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province. Of all the world's geoparks, this is the nearest one to a metropolis. It covers an area of 1,075 km2, in which the Qinling Orogenic Belt, the Quaternary geology heritages, geomorphological sites, and the relics of palaeoanthropology are the major attractions (T. Li, Li, & Li, 2009). It falls within the\nGeological Journal. 2018;53(S1):398–413.rary.com/journal/gj\ncoordinates of 33°41′00″‐34°22′30″N and 107°37′00″‐109°49′30″E and has an elevation ranging between 494 and 3,767 m. The geopark consists of five specific and mutually related parks. They are (a) the Cuihuashan collapse‐slide Park, (b) the Lishuan rift‐horst Park, (c) the Bingjingding ductile‐shear zone and structural magmatite Park, (d) the Yushan Park with island‐arc granite peaks and ridges, and (e) the South Taibai Park with the collisional suture of plates and the Quaternary glacier. Situated in the major portion of the collision zone between the South China and North China plates, the geopark forms a natural boundary dividing China's territory into a southern and northern part, with different natural geology, geography, ecology, climate, and environment, and is regarded as the “Natural Zoo in China” and the “Natural arboretum in Asia” (Mattauer, Matte, & Malavieille, 1985; Meng, Zhang, & W., 2000; Ratschbacher, Hacker, & Calvert, 2003; Sun, Sun, & Liu, 2006; Zhang et al., 2009)."

    "text": "In the sense of global tectonics, the Qinling Orogenic Belt (QOB) lies in a transformation and composite area of different tectonic dynamic systems between the southern and the northern continents (Figure 1). Crossing central China, the Qinling mountain chain stretches over thousand kilometres from the east to the west and in such a way links the Dabie‐Tongbai Mountains with the Qilian and Kunlun mountains together, forming the central orogenic system.\nAs a part of the central mountainous chain in China's territory, the east‐west trending Qinling mountain chain forms a natural boundary dividing China's territory into the south and the north with different natural geographic factors in terms of geology, biology, water system, soil, and climate. The Qinling Orogenic Belt is one of the typical compound continental orogenic zones in the world and a major juncture zone forming the China's continent.\nThe Qinling Orogenic Belt is formed as a result of the interaction among the North China Plate, Yangtze Plate, and the clamp in the Qinling Mountains between the two blocks and the Yangtze Block (Figure 2). Having experienced three different stages of tectonic evolution, it represents a composite orogenic belt of different tectonic systems. The major orogenic tectonic evolution stages are the collision among the three plates along two subduction zones, involving a long complicated orogenic process. With the impact of two main suturing events of the three blocks, the geologic framework of the Qinling‐ Dabie Orogen took shape. Ranging from north to south, these contain the North China Craton (including the north Qinling Block), the Qinling–Dabie microblock (including, from west to east, the Qaidam, the West Qinling, South Qinling, and Dabie–Sulu blocks), and the South China Craton, separated by the Shangxian–Danfeng (abbreviated to the Shangdan) and the Mianlue sutures (S. Z. Li, Jahn, & Zhao, 2017). Nevertheless, the Mianlue Suture arose from the Late Triassic closure of the Mianlue Ocean and collision of the Qinling–Dabie microblock and the South China Craton (S. Z. Li, Kusky, et al., 2007).\nTaibai Mountain, the main peak of Qinling, is the highest peak interior. At more than 3,000‐m elevation, it retains the integrity of\nctonic. Abbreviations: NCB = North China Block, SCB = South China\nthe Quaternary glacial activity at the end of the late Pleistocene, which is a typical Valley Glacier Ice. The landslides and other geological disasters of the Zhongnan Mountain are frequent, as it is tall as well as steep, whose elevation ranges from 2,500 to 3,000 m, together with active recent structural movement (Guo Huadong & Liang, 2016; T. Li, Yi, Ti, & Cheng, 2016)."

    "text": "The Zhongnan Mountain is present as a natural laboratory for academic study on the formation, development, and evolution of the QOB due to its typical location in the belt. In the Paleoproterozoic, the ZhongnanMountain area was in an extensional setting whose main sediments were differentiated materials derived from juvenile crust, while the limited oceanic basin occurring during the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic eras accepted accumulation of transitional materials between mid‐ocean ridge and oceanic islands.\nDuring the Jinning movement (800–1,000 Ma), the terrains of the above sedimentary bodies and associated magma migrated with each other and constituted part of the Rodinia supercontinent (Lai, Zhang, & Li, 2004). These terrains quickly moved away before merging. In these processes, the tectonic regime experienced transformation and the modern plate tectonics. The Caledonian movement was present at the subduction of the Yangtze Plate, resulting in emplacement of the residual oceanic crust of the Neoproterozoic Songshugou Formation and formed accumulations of ultrabasic rocks, basic complex, the Early Palaeozoic ophiolite, the subduction‐related granites, volcanic rocks, pyroclastics, and marble. The Hercynian‐Indosinian movement changed two plates (including Qinling microplate) from the contact collision to the complete oblique collision, so as to initiate the extensive deformation, metamorphism, and magmatism and to uplift completely into mountain ranges. During the Yanshan period, the intensive intracontinental orogeny occurred, and it was\nrepresented by uplift, collapse, strike‐slip faulting of the faulted blocks, the fan‐shaped thrust‐nappe, the magmatism dominant in acid rocks, and the deformation and metamorphism of continental‐facies strata. The Himalayan movement resulted in the strike‐slip faulting of the fault blocks, forming the skyey Qinling Mountains and the complicated graben, both of which have a maximum elevation difference of about 3,400 m. If the thickness of the sediments in the Weihe Basin was excluded, the elevation height difference would be up to 10,000 m."

    "text": "Geological sites encompass the important geological phenomena preserved all through Earth's history from with which we can trace the evolutionary history of the Earth (Liu & Cai, 2000). A report by IUCN entitled Geological World Heritage: A Global Framework (Dingwall, Weighell, & Badman, 2005; Thorsell & Hamilton, 2002; X. Zhao, Li, & Wang, 2007) listed 13 kinds of geological types with universal values that focus on glaciers. They are tectonics, volcanoes, mountains, stratigraphic sites, fossils, fluvial/lacustrine and deltaic systems, karst, coastal systems, reef‐island, glaciers, Ice Ages, arid and semi‐arid deserts, and meteorite impacts. The geopark is abundant in geological heritage sites that fall into six major classes and 22 subclasses (Table 1 and Figure 3), of which orogenic geoheritage and the Quaternary geological heritage sites are the most typical in the geopark."

Owing to its long history of geological evolution, intensive tectonics,\nvarieties of rocks, complete stratigraphy, frequent magmatic activities, varieties of metamorphic types, abundant geological heritage sites, and mineral resources, the geopark has attracted great attention from geological communities from home and abroad.\nThe geopark preserves abundant heritage sites of stratigraphy, lithology, and structures involved in orogenic belt, indicating the\nforming and evolutionary features of the Qinling orogenic belt, the characteristics of continental enlargement, preservation and material reintegration, and complex relations between the dynamic process of the deep‐seated mantle and crustal reflection. Therefore, the geopark has its specific regional characteristics in the globally common structures, serving as a natural basis and a laboratory for exploring continental dynamics."

Based on well‐preserved outcrops of basement rocks, they display the history of the forming and evolution process of the Qinling Mountains from the Proterozoic era. The convenient accessibility has made the place an excellent place for the research of the Qinling orogenic zone of 25‐km‐long Heihe‐ Wangjiahe section and 18‐km‐long Banfanghe cross‐section. Both sections run along motorways and are easy access for investigation.\nFrom the entrance of the Heihe River to the south, the stratigraphic section is composed of the Kuanping Group, Qinling Group, Danfeng Group, Devonian system, and the Carboniferous system, the occurrences of which are generally steep and locally vertical."

    "heading": "3.1.2 | Magmatic rocks",
    "text": "Owing to the multiphase activities of the Qinling orogenic zone, the geopark is abundant in magmatic rocks. Their typical representatives are described as follows:\nThe Lantian rock body is distributed between the Huaxu–Liangtou and the Tieshuzi–Sanyao faults, 31 km long and ranging between 2,000 and 9,000 m in width from the south to the north. It is a compound rock mass extending in east‐west direction and occupying an area of 154 km2 at the outcrops of basement rocks. It is in contact with theTietonggou Formation at intrusive or faulted relations in the south and with theTaihua Group at intrusive relation in the east, containing a migmatized zone 10–20 m wide. According to the contact relations and the lithologic features, the rock body can be recognized to have had two times of intrusion. The first intrusion is of porphyritic adamellite and is distributed in the south of the rock body, forming the major rock landscape in the Wangshunshan area (Figure 4). The second intrusion is of medium‐ to fine‐grained granite' and adamellite.\nIt is distributed in the east and the north parts of the rock body and intruded into the first porphyritic granite. The rock contains dark mineral concentration among the long‐shaped granular, showing orientation and intensive emplacement with characteristics of I‐type granite. Isotopic dating of the rock body is about 106±0.7 Ma.\nThe Baliping granite mass is I‐type granite, occurring in the Laoyu, Taipingyu, and Bingjingding areas of Huxian County. It has a length ranging between 24 and 33 km from the east to the west and a width 3–11 km from the south to the north. The rock body intruded in the Qinling Group and the Devonian system, showing an intrusive relation with its wallrocks, well‐developed marginal rock veins and forming beautiful figures. The principal rocks are composed of two types of rocks with different textures: one is pink‐coloured porphyritic biotite adamellite with porphyritic texture, massive, and gneissic structures; the second is grey‐pink‐coloured medium‐ to fine‐grained adamellite with massive and gneissic structures. They formed the major landscape in the Taiping and Zhuque scenic areas (Figure 5).\nThe Taibaishan–Houzhenzi rock body, also called the Baoji rock body, has approximately similar characteristics with the Baliping rock body. Its isotopic age is 216.4 ± 14 Ma, and it is of the I‐type granite and belongs to the result from magmatic activities (Figure 6). It formed major basement rock of the Taibaishan glacial erosion."

There are three prominent groups of cirques, one totally\ncovered by plants, hollow cirques, and modern glaciers. Taken together, they reflect the stages and characteristics of the glacial shrinkage and vegetation expansion (P. Y. Zhao, Xiao, & F.D., 2010).\nNunataks and knife‐edges (arêtes), as well as huge glacial grooves, have widely developed, and the bedrocks of the glacial pavement and sheep‐back rocks (roches moutonnée) outcrop frequently (Liu & Wang, 1983). In the Baxiantai and Paomaliang areas, “stone river” and “stone sea” are of a great importance with drifting and swirling foams of breaking waves. Looking around Baxiantai, you can observe the specific Quaternary glacial landforms of pyramidal peaks, the trough valley, the cirque and the glacial staircase (Table 2 and Figure 11)."

    "text": "Taibaishan Mountain is universally recognized as an important region for research into the Qinling fossil glaciations and the Quaternary glacial period in China, in which the heritage sites of the Quaternary glaciations are well preserved. Because of the final glaciations in the Quaternary period, the fossil glaciations in Taibaishan Mountain occurred mainly around 11,500 years ago. The heritage sites of the Taibaishan glaciations can compare with that of the Wurm glaciations (Alps), Weichsel glaciations (North Europe), and the Wisconsin glaciations (USA). Since there is no current glacial coverage on Taibaishan Mountain, the glacial landscapes there crop out intact and complete, which has an important significance in research of the climate variation and glaciations of the Quaternary period in China and in Eastern Asia."

Above all, the Weihe graben has its specific geological features, which would be helpful to recognize the formation mechanism and evolution model of continental fault depression."

    "heading": "5 | CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "Qinling Mountain is a typical compound continental orogenic belt in China and also a major juncture to form an integrated Chinese continent, which is transcontinental in east–west direction and forms a natural boundary of geology, geography, ecology, climate, environment, and humanities between the north and south of China. It has its own specific features in global common features of geology and has been paid close attention by scientists from home and abroad for its abundant, typical, and concentrated contents of geosciences. It is a typical and representative continental orogenic belt in the world and contains rich information about current development of geosciences.\nOn the basis of comparative analyses of regional geology, geological sites in Qinling Zhongnanshan World Geopark, this paper has been concluded as follows:\n1. The Qinling Mountain is famous among all China and the world\nbecause of its significance in geological and geographical research. In its middle section, Zhongnanshan region, there are many complicated geological phenomena and important geosites: representative stratigraphic section, magmatic activity remains, structure section and tectonic motion remains, geological–geomorphological landscape, special rocks and minerals, special hydrogeological phenomena, human engineering activity remains, disastrous geological process remains, and palaeontological fossils and sites, a total of nine types based on genetic classification.\n2. The big piedmont fault in the northern margin of Mt. Qinling is a\nmarginal scarpside of the Weihe rift. Since the late Cretaceous period, it has been in active at all times and is still active up to now. It has a fault displacement up to 13 km. In the north side of Mt. Qinling, the Weihe graben is an intracontinental fault basin infilled with thick sediments, which has a global significance in geoscience research.\n3. The heritage sites of the Cuihuashan Mountain collapse‐slide\nranks third in size in the world, with which the landscapes are intact in patterns, including freeing surfaces, collapse‐slide accumulation, barrier dams, barrier lakes, and caves.\n4. The landforms of glacial erosion, moraine, and cryergy in\nTaibaishan Mountain are preserved well, which have an important significance in research of the evolution of the Quaternary climate and glaciations in China and East Asia.\n5. The unique geological background formed the highest peak and\nthe broad and prosperous Weihe basin in Eastern China. From the Palaeolithic Age, the Lantian Homo erectus was attracted to the foot area of the Qinling Mountains and began to settle down and multiply the following generations. Hereafter, the Chenjiawo Homo erectus (700,000 years) and the Banpo clan (6,500 years)\nhad their colourful and prosperous life in this area. Thirteen dynasties of ancient China had established their capital cities in Xi'an, which had drove religions of Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianism to prosperity. So the territory of the geopark is one of the most representative areas in harmonious coexistence between human and nature.\nGeosites are records of geological history handed over through tens up to thousands of millions of years. In their probe into the nature's history, human beings understand gradually the importance of safeguarding geological heritage, and through long practice of conserving the heritage, they have found an optimal approach for this purpose, that is, establishing geoparks, make them special landscape areas for protecting the Earth's legacy and the geological–ecological environment, and furthermore, network them at different levels to form a research base for important geoscientific issues, educational field base for students, and scientific popularization base to the general public. The prominent value is the core content of World Natural Heritage application, protection, and management. Thus, for world geoparks, they also should enhance the ability to protect and manage geological sites. The park should make a scientific decision for implementing planning, exploitation, and construction; it is necessary to assess the whole value from the angle of tourists' demand. In doing so, revenues from geotourism, for example, knowledge tours, science tours, and environmental protection tours, can support the local economy and promote local employment."
