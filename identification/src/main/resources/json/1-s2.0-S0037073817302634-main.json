Jones\nNew Sr isotope data from well-preserved aragonite ammonoid shell material from the Mesozoic are compared with that from a living Nautilus shell. The prominent negative Sr isotope excursions known from the Middle Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous probably have their origins in intensive plate tectonic activity, followed by enhanced hydrothermal activity at the mid-ocean ridges (mantle volcanism) which supplied low radiogenic Sr to seawater. The maximum positive (radiogenic) shift in the lower Mesozoic Sr isotope curve (Lower Triassic peak) was likely caused by a significant expansion of dry land surfaces (Dabie-Sulu Triassic orogeny) and their intensive silicate weathering in conditions of extreme warming and aridity in the very end of the Smithian, followed by warm and humid conditions in the late Spathian, which apparently resulted in a significant oceanic input of radiogenic Sr through riverine flux. The comparatively high 87Sr/86Sr ratio obtained from the livingNautilus shell is probably a function of both the Alpine orogeny, which was accompanied by significant continental weathering and input of radiogenic Sr to the oceans, and the weakening of mantle volcanism.\n© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Over the past four decades vast data on Phanerozoic Sr-isotope stratigraphy have been compiled from calcitic and apatite fossil material and whole-rock samples (e.g., Veizer and Compston, 1974; Brass, 1976; Burke et al., 1982; Hess et al., 1986; Koepnick et al., 1990; Clements et al., 1993; McArthur et al., 1993, 2000, 2004, 2012, 2016; Denison et al., 1994, 2003; McArthur, 1994; Jones et al., 1994; Jenkyns et al., 1995, 2002; Martin and MacDougell, 1995; Veizer et al., 1999; Zachos et al., 1999; Jones and Jenkyns, 2001; Korte et al., 2003, 2004, 2006; Van Geldern et al., 2006; Wotte et al., 2007; Prokoph et al., 2008; Wierzbowski, 2013; Madhavaraju et al., 2015). However, only a few aragonite-preserved fossils, originatingmostly from the Campanian and upper Maastrichtian of North America (e.g., Cochran et al., 2003, 2016) and the lower Albian of Madagascar (Zakharov et al., 2016) have been used for this purpose. The benefit of aragonitic fossils in isotope studies lies in their absence of significant diagenetic alteration.\ndril@igc.irk.ru (S.I. Dril), ru (A.M. Popov), va@mail.ru (I.A. Michailova),\nThis paper focuses on someMesozoic Sr isotope oscillations, derived from the study of well-preserved, aragonitic cephalopod shells.

    "text": "Material for Sr isotope investigation includes ammonoid shells from the lower and upper Olenekian and mid Anisian of Arctic Siberia, the lower Toarcian of Western Switzerland, the upper Callovian and lower Aptian of the Russian Platform, the upper Santonian and lower Campanian of North America, and finally a shell of living Nautilus pompilius Lenne from the Philippines (Fig. 1). Lower Toarcian mollusc shells from Western Switzerland, as well as some fossils from the lower Bathonian and lower Callovian of Central Switzerland, upper Hauterivian of Argentina, and lower Barremian of the Alps were also utilized for O and C isotope investigations.\nThe following criteria were used to determine diagenetic alteration: (1) hand-sample visual indications; (2) percentage of aragonite in mollusc shells, which were originally represented by 100% aragonite; (3) presence or lack of diagenetic admixture, determined by X-ray diffraction analysis; (4) the degree of integrity of shell microstructure,\ndetermined under a scanning electronmicroscope (SEM). We have recognized four stages of diagenetic alteration in aragonitic mollusc shells (Zakharov et al., 1975, 2016).\nX-ray powder analyses were carried out at the Analytical Centre (FEGI) in Vladivostok using a desktop X-ray diffractometer MiniFlex II (Rigaku Firm). SEM and X-ray studies of selected Mesozoic fossils suggest that most of them retain their original shell microstructure, and thus their original Sr, C and O isotope compositions. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the lack of secondary admixtures, including α-SiO2, in most samples from this area, and 75–100% aragonitic composition of most of our selected ammonoids, and some bivalve shells.\nO and C isotope measurements at the Stable Isotope Laboratory (FEGI FEB RAN, Vladivostok). Oxygen and carbon isotope measurements were carried out using a Finnigan MAT-252 (Analytical Centre, FEGI, Vladivostok). The laboratory gas standard used in the O and C isotope measurements was calibrated relatively to NBS-19 δ13C = 1.93‰ and δ18O=−2.20‰ (Coplen et al., 1983). Reproducibility of replicate standards was always better than 0.1‰.\nThe following equation was used for palaeotemperature calculation (Grossman and Ku, 1986): T (C) = 20.6–4.34 (δ18Oaragonite – δw).\nIn this equation T (C) is the ambient temperature; δ18Oaragonite is the measured oxygen-isotope value of aragonite (versus VPDB), and δw (‰) is the ambient water isotope ratio (versus VSMOW). A δw of −1.0‰ is often assumed to be appropriate for an ice-free world (e.g., Shackleton and Kennet, 1975; Hudson and Anderson, 1989; Huber et al., 2002; Pirrie and Marshall, 1990; Price and Hart, 2002; Lukeneder et al., 2010). It is known that there are definitely ice and ice-free times during Mesozoic (Price and Passey, 2013; Veizer and Prokoph, 2015), but intervals investigated in this study correspond to ice-free times. However, the isotopic composition of Cretaceous seawater may have varied considerably due to freshwater input and/or evaporation.\nSr isotope measurements at the Laboratory of Isotope Geochemistry (IG SB RAS, Irkutsk). Laboratory methods for the Sr isotope analysis followed instrumental and operating specifications as discussed in Degryse and Schneider (2008). Material for our Sr isotope investigation, taken from well preserved cephalopod shells that still exist in their\noriginal aragonitic mineralogy, was obtained by chemical preparation of straight Sr fractions, using ion-exchange polymers BioRad AG 50W*8, 200–400mesh and BioRad AG50*12, 200–400mesh (Collective Enjoyment Center of Isotope Geochemical Investigation, Institute of Geochemistry of Russian Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch, Irkutsk).\nN50 ng (nanogram) of each sample were loaded onto rhenium filaments (cathode) and analyzed for 87Sr/86Sr on a Finnigan MAT262 seven-collector (Collective Joint Center of Geodynamic and Geochronology, Institute of Earth Core, Russian Academy of Sciences, Siberian Branch, Irkutsk) using themulti-dynamic routines that include a correction for isobaric interference from 87Rb (87Rb/85Rb = 0.386). The rhenium cathode was previously covered by an activator, prepared on the basis of Ta2O5. The 88Sr ion current was usually been equal to 2–3 ∗ 10(−11) А. Data have been normalized to a value of 8.37521 for 88Sr/86Sr.\n87Sr/86Sr measurements were made using the following most common standards: (1) NBS-987 (known earlier as SRM987); and (2) BCR-2. The 87Sr/86Sr values for these standards are (1) 0.710249 ± 8 (2 SD, n = 12); and (2) 0.705011 ± 14 (2 SD, n = 7) respectively, where SD is standard deviation and n is number of measurements. External precision (2σ) is typically in the range of ±0.00001 to ±0.00003 (Banner, 2004)."

We now add to this data with material from the Russian Platform and from North America.\nUlyanovsk area, Russian Platform (middle lower Aptian). Sr isotopes were analyzed from two Deshayesites volgensis Sazonova shells (Fig. 2) from this locality. Both shells were collected from calcareous-marl concretions in a 3.8–4.0 m thick layer of black bituminous shale (OAE 1a, also known as the Selli Event) of the Volgensis-Schilovkensis Zone (Gavrilov et al., 2002; Zakharov et al., 2013a).\nShell 45/96 of Deshayesites volgensis, a middle-sized and silverywhite (D = 160 mm; 84–100% aragonite) specimen, is characterised by a comparatively low Sr isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr = 0.707382) at H = 55 mm (Table S1). δ18O and δ13C values in this shell fluctuate from −2.59 to −2.24‰ and from −3.8 to −1.97‰, respectively (Zakharov et al., 2013a). The δ18O values suggest comparatively high paleotemperatures (25.1–26.8 °C).\nAnother investigated shell of Deshayesites volgensis (50/96), middlesized and silvery-white (D = 61.0 mm; 95–100% aragonite), is also characterised by a comparatively low Sr-isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr = 0.707333) at H = 27.5 mm (Table S1). δ18O and δ13C values in this shell vary between −3.6 to −2.6‰ and −2.8 to −0.6‰, respectively. The δ18O values of this shell indicate somewhat higher palaeotemperatures (26.7–30.8 °C).\nVancouver, British Columbia (upper Santonian Haslam Fm.; Ward et al., 2012).

A fragment of middle-sized, silvery-cream Submortoniceras sp. shell, specimen Cal-2 (100% aragonite) from the Chico Formation of the Butte Creek area, California (Chicoensis Zone) was used for Sr isotope investigation.

We have investigated the Sr isotope composition of Triassic ammonoids from three localities in Arctic Siberia: (1) Buur River (Olenek River basin); (2) Mengilyakh Creek (right bank of the lower reaches of the Olenek River); and (3) Keshin Creek, Tsvetkov Cape (eastern Taimyr).\nBuur River (lowermost Olenekian). A large Hedenstroemia hedenstroemi (Keyserling) shell, specimen 890/4–5 (up to 120 mm in\ndiameter) was found in a calcareous-marl concretion from lowermost Olenekianmudstoneof theHedenstroemi Zone of this locality. A sample for Sr-isotope analysis was taken from the best-preserved creamcolored area (98% aragonite) of its outer whorl, consisting of three layers: external prismatic, nacreous and inner prismatic (Zakharov et al., 1987). A comparatively high Sr-isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr = 0.708043; Table S1) was determined from this sample. According to our previous study (Zakharov et al., 1999a), this area is characterised by δ18O of−4‰ and δ13C of −0.3‰ at H = 98 mm.\nMengilyakh Creek (uppermost Olenekian). A medium-sized specimen of Boreomeekoceras keyserlingi (Mojsisovics), specimen 45/802 (D = 76.0 mm) was found in a calcareous-marl concretion from uppermost Olenekianmudstone of the Spiniplicatus Zone (Fig. 3). The investigated cream-colored area (87% aragonite at H=27.0mm) records a very high Sr-isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr = 0.709041; Table S1), similar to that of our living Nautilus pompilius Linne shell from the Philippines. The investigated Boreomeekoceras keyserlingi shell is characterised by lower δ18O and δ13C values in comparison with those obtained from the Hedenstroemia hedenstroemi shell: −6.0‰ and −3.3‰, respectively (Zakharov et al., 1999a).\nKeshin Creek (middle Anisian). A small, cream-colored Arctohungarites sp. shell, specimen 4/816 (up to 30mm in diameter; 88% aragonite) was collected in a calcareous-marl concretion frommiddle Anisianmudstone (likely from the Kharaulakhensis Zone). The calculated Sr-isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr = 0.707744; Table S1) in this shell is also comparatively high. This shell is characterised by δ18O and δ13C values of −4.1 and −2.3‰ at H = 15.8 mm, respectively (Zakharov et al., 1999a).\nFollowing Hallam (1969) and Zakharov et al. (1975), we suggest that the comparatively low δ18O values of aragonite preserved in our Olenekian and Anisian ammonoid shells fromArctic Siberia is a function of the environment that these ammonoids inhabited being within the Boreal realm under reduced salinity conditions. Our previous calculations, applying a water correction for approximate computation of palaeotemperatures in the shallow-water Olenekian-Anisian sea of Arctic Siberia, give mean values for early and late Olenekian and Anisian of ?8.8, ?16.3 and ?15.4 °C, respectively (Zakharov et al., 1999a)."

The lower Toarcian ammonoids Hildaites serpentinum Buckman (Fig. 3), Harpoceras falciferum Sowerby and Phylloceratidae? gen. et sp. indet. are well known from the 10 m thick organic-rich “Posidonia Shale”, or “Posidonienschiefers” in Western Switzerland (Etter, 2014a). These sequences record the Toarcian OAE, also known as the Posidonienschifer Event. Ammonoids were found in association with the bivalves Bositra sp.

Among these, OAE 1a\n(Weissert-event) has received themost research effort. The bituminous shale member that records OAE 1a in the Ulianovsk area (up to 10.5 m thick) is located mostly in the upper part of the lower Aptian Volgensis–Schilovkensis Zone and was formed during a eustatic transgression (Gavrilov et al., 2002) under a warm climate (Zakharov et al., 2013a). Its lower part is characterised by the negative C isotope excursion; the positive C isotope excursion has been recognized somewhat higher up in the stratigraphy, in the lower Aptian Deshayesi– Tuberculatum Zone (Zakharov et al., 2013a). No benthic taxa were discovered in the Volgensis–Schilovkensis Zone of the Ulyanovsk area.\nTaking into account that the Turonian–Campanian interval was the main depositional phase of the Cretaceous oceanic red beds (Wang et al., 2005, 2009; Wagreich, 2009, 2012; Hu et al., 2012), it can be concluded that themain period of development of theOAEs in theMesozoic (Toarcian–Cenomanian) was followed by the period characterised by oxygen-rich deep waters in most of the oceans (Turonian–Campanian red-bed facies [Wang et al., 2005] and upper Campanian methaneseep facies [Cochran et al., 2016]).\nBased on the C isotope composition of living Nautilus and brachiopods obtained from thePhilippines (Zakharov et al., 2006a) and information on solar activity during the years 1991–1999 (solar cycles 22 and 23; Gnezdilov, 2004), when the investigated shells were secreted, we suspect, following Alcala-Herrera et al. (1992), that δ13C fluctuations are mostly connected with fluctuations of phytoplankton bioproductivity, partly related to oscillations between low and high solar activity (sunspot cycles).\nAbout 30 positive δ13C excursions have been recognized from different stages of the Phanerozoic (Zakharov et al., 2006c, Fig. 62), ten of them are known in the Cretaceous. The majority of them coincided with episodes of volcanic activity that are proposed as to have been one of main sources of excess CO2 (e.g., Weissert and Erba, 2004; Naafs et al., 2016). The most prominent negative C isotope excursion\noccurs globally in the Permian–Triassic boundary beds (e.g., Baud et al., 1989; Holser et al., 1991)."

Our results from aragonite-preserved fossil material with good diagenetic control are useful for both corroboration of published Sr data and also for the minor correction of data points in some littlestudied intervals.\nThe 87Sr/86Sr ratios of recent oceans are considered to be mainly a mixture of continental and hydrothermal (oceanic) flux (0.7120 and 0.7035, respectively; Davis et al., 2003). Riverine mass flux (continental flux) is almost certainly higher today than at any time during the Phanerozoic (Edmond, 1992)."

    "text": "It has been suggested that themost prominent ophiolite pulses in the\nMesozoic occurred during the Jurassic-Cretaceous (Toarcian–Berriasian and Aptian–Campanian; e.g., Dilek, 2003). We agree with some authors (Jenkyns et al., 1995; Jones and Jenkyns, 2001) that the prominent negative Sr isotope excursions known from the Mesozoic (e.g., AptianAlbian and Late Cretaceous) were the result of strong plate tectonic activity. It might be partly connected with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, which was followed by enhanced hydrothermal activity at the mid-ocean ridges (mantle volcanism) that supplied low radiogenic Sr to seawater. Most of these events were accompanied by significant sea-level changes, warming and Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) that coincided closely in time. Comparatively low 87Sr/86Sr ratios were calculated by us from aragonitic ammonoid shells from the mid lower Aptian (0.707333–0.707382), lower Albian (0.707242–0.707276), upper\nSantonian (0.707333), and lower Campanian (0.707198) (Fig. 6), as well as from lower Toarcian (0.707300–0.707382) and lower upper Callovian (0.707429).\nAt the same time, the relatively higher and more variable 87Sr/86Sr ratios for some of the aforementioned intervals have been recently reported from deposits of some local areas, for instance in limestones of the upper Aptian–lower Albian Mural Formation in Mexico (0.707479–0.708790); the latter suggest significant weathering of local granitic provenance (Madhavaraju et al., 2015).\nA final consideration that must be taken into account in our study is the problem of the strontium isotope stratification of the water column of Phanerozoic marine basins. Some efforts to understand this problem have beenmade in a study of the Albian of Madagascar (Zakharov et al., 2016). A gradual decrease of Sr-isotope ratio from 0.707296 to 0.707241 has been discovered in the following ammonoid shells, secreted in habitats from shallow to deeper zones of the water column: Desmoceras (0.707296), an inhabitant of the upper epipelagic zone; Douvilleiceras (0.707276), an inhabitant of the same zone; Cleoniceras (0.707275), an inhabitant of the deeper (likely lower epipelagic zone); and Eogaudryceras (0.707241), an inhabitant of the deeper, likely upper mesopelagic zone."

    "text": "The Paleozoic seawater Sr isotope curve reached its lowest equilibrium 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the Capitanian before rebounding tomore strongly radiogenic values during the Permian/Triassic transition (Korte et al.,\n2006; McArthur et al., 2012; Kani et al., 2013; Kani et al., in press). The Capitanian low point may have its origins in the unusually strong ophiolite activity, taking into account (1) theMiddle Permian Emeishan activity in South China, generated apparently by the opening of the Neotethys Ocean along the eastern margin of Gondwana during the Permian (e.g., Korte et al., 2006); (2) emplacement of contemporaneous Uralian ophiolites prior to the collision of Baltica-Eastern Europe and Kazakhstan-Siberia and closure of the Pleionic Ocean during the Late Permian (e.g., Dilek, 2003) and Siberian Trap activity of Late Permian age (e.g., Sadovnikov, 2016). As a result, a highly enhanced flux of low radiogenic Sr to seawater took place during Mid-Late Permian. In an alternative hypothesis, the Capitanian minimum was mainly caused by a decrease in the continental weathering rate due to the Mid Permian cooling that may have driven extensive ice-cover over continental crust to suppress continental flux enriched in high radiogenic Sr into the Ocean (Kani et al., 2013). Here we concur with the former model, because the latter is in disagreementwith evidence for a dramatic Cenozoic rise in seawater 87Sr/86Sr that corresponded to times of progressive cooling and glaciation (François et al., 1993; Jones and Jenkyns, 2001).\nOn the contrary, the Lower Triassic is characterised by themaximum upward (more radiogenic) shift in the Sr isotope curve for the entire Mesozoic (an increase of 87Sr/86Sr ratio from 0.708043 to 0.709041 has been discovered in the Olenekian interval; Fig. 6). This is apparently due to significant expansion of dry land surfaces, partly because of the Dabie-Sulu Triassic orogeny in central-eastern China, created by\nnorthward subduction of the Yangtze cratonal plate beneath the SinoKorean craton (Zhang et al., 2009; Hacker et al., 2004; Isozaki et al., 2017) and their intensiveweathering in conditions of extremewarming and aridity at the very end of the Smithian, which was followed by the development of warm and humid conditions in the late Spathian. The resulting excess weathering likely resulted in a global-scale input of a significant amount of high radiogenic Sr through riverine flux. Alternatively, the Olenekian maximum recorded in Arctic Siberian might be partly caused by brackish environments (the Sr isotope composition of fossils is used by Wierzbowski (2013; Wierzbowski et al., 2013) as an indicator of palaeosalinity, which needs confirmation).\nThe comparatively high 87Sr/86Sr ratio (0.709148), obtained by us from the living Nautilus pompilius shell is probably connected mainly with both the Alpine orogeny, accompanied by significant continental weathering and coming of high radiogenic Sr to seawater, and the weakening of mantle volcanism (Fig. 7)."

    "heading": "5. Conclusions",
    "text": "Following (in part) Jones and Jenkyns (2001), we assume that there is a close temporal correspondence between episodes of increased hydrothermal activity at mid-ocean ridges, negative seawater Sr-isotope excursions, climatic warming and sea level rises, that usually resulted in the Aptian–Campanian OAEs. According to our data (Figs 5, 6), the Aptian and Santonian–Campanian Sr-isotope minima seem to be corresponded to climatic warming (marked as 6a and 8a, respectively), but Turonian–Coniacian and late Maastrichtian Sr-isotope maxima, in contrast, to climatic cooling (7b and 8b, respectively), However, there is no any clear correspondence in general between δ18O and Srisotope records, especially for Late Permian–Jurassic and. Cenozoic times. The most distinctive feature of the Phanerozoic Sr isotope record\nis an exceedingly large swing in 87Sr/86Sr ratio between the Capitanian minimum (0.706800–707,000 in South Primorye; Kani et al., in press) and the Olenekian maximum (0.708043–0.709041). This seems to be mostly a result of enhanced Early–Mid Permian ophiolite activity and, on the other hand, the significant expansion of dry land surfaces (partly because of Dabie-Sulu orogeny) and their intensive weathering in conditions of extreme warming during much of the Early Triassic. These conditions gave way to warm and humid conditions in the latest Olenekian, which apparently released a significant amount of high radiogenic Sr via the riverine flux.\nThere are some hypotheses of cyclic or pulsating development of Earth conditions under impact of cosmic factors (e.g., Yepifanov, 2012a, 2012b; Barash, 2015). Data at least on early and late Mesozoic O and N isotope cycles seem to be in agreement with this idea, taking into account, for instance, information on long period cycles in the Earth's climate (galactic seasons). However, suitable information on Sr isotope cycles of the Earth is too limited in this stage of our knowledge to discuss on this topic, although periodicity in some processes, responsible for some fluctuations in seawater 87Sr/86Sr (e.g., mantle plume activities and orogenic events) inclines us to take interest in it.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2017.11.011."
