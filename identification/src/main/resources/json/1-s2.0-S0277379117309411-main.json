All rights reserved.\na b s t r a c t\nThe iconic climate archive of Tenaghi Philippon (TP), NE Greece, allows the study of short-term palaeoclimatic and environmental change throughout the past 1.3 Ma. To provide high-quality age control for detailed palaeoclimate reconstructions based on the TP archive, (crypto)tephra studies of a peat core ‘TP2005’ have been carried out for the 0e130 ka interval. The results show that the TP basin is ideally positioned to receive tephra fall from both the Italian and Aegean Arc volcanic provinces. Two visible tephra layers, the Santorini Cape Riva/Y-2 (c. 22 ka) and the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI)/Y-5 (c. 39.8 ka) tephras, and six primary cryptotephra layers, namely the early Holocene E1 tephra from the Aeolian Islands (c. 8.3 ka), the Campanian Y-3 (c. 29 ka) and X-6 tephras (c. 109.5 ka), as well as counterpart tephras TM-18-1d (c. 40.4 ka), TM-23-11 (c. 92.4 ka) and TM-33-1a (c. 116.7 ka) from the Lago Grande di Monticchio sequence (southern Italy), were identified along with repeatedly redeposited Y-2 and CI tephra material. Bayesian modelling of the ages of seven of the primary tephra layers, 60 radiocarbon measurements and 20 palynological control points have been applied to markedly improve the chronology of the TP archive. This revised chronology constrains the age of tephra TM-18-1d to 40.90 e41.66 cal ka BP (95.4% range). Several tephra layers identified in the TP record form important isochrons for correlating this archive with other terrestrial (e.g., Lago Grande di Monticchio, Sulmona Basin and\ny, University of Portsmouth, 1HE, United Kingdom.\nLake Ohrid) and marine (e.g., Adriatic Sea core PRAD 1-2 and Aegean Sea core LC21) palaeoclimate records in the Mediterranean region.\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "In light of current anthropogenic climate change, detailed temporal-spatial reconstructions of past natural climate variability are required. This holds true particularly for the climatically highly sensitive Eastern Mediterranean region, which is currently experiencing increased frequency and intensity of droughts and heat waves (e.g., Giorgi and Lionello, 2008; IPCC, 2014). Past short-term climate change as evidenced in marine cores from the North Atlantic (e.g., Shackleton et al., 2000) and ice cores from Greenland (e.g., NGRIP members, 2004) is also registered in Mediterranean palaeoclimate archives. However, the exact age relationships of climate signals recorded in these archives have remained difficult to decipher due to a lack of precise age control. Long key records from this region include the annually laminated archive from Lago Grande di Monticchio (e.g., Allen et al., 1999; Brauer et al., 2007; Martin-Puertas et al., 2014), the Sulmona and Fucino Basins in Italy (e.g., Giaccio et al., 2012, 2017b; Regattieri et al., 2017), and Lake Ohrid (e.g., Sadori et al., 2016; Wagner et al., 2017), Lake Prespa (e.g., Damaschke et al., 2013; Panagiotopoulos et al., 2014) and the Tenaghi Philippon peatland (e.g., Pross et al., 2015; Tzedakis et al., 2006) in the Balkan Peninsula. In addition, precise correlation of terrestrial records with marine records from the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Seas is notoriously difficult due to dating uncertainties stemming from unknown or regionally variable radiocarbon reservoir ages (e.g., Rohling, 1994; Siani et al., 2001). Precise landsea correlations can, however, be obtained through using event markers such as volcanic ash (tephra) layers that are preserved in the respective sedimentary archives. Tephras from explosive eruptions are deposited synchronously, often over wide geographic areas, and provide independent chronological markers in geological archives when well dated (e.g., Thorarinsson, 1944; Lowe, 2011). The Eastern Mediterranean region is ideally suited for a tephrochronological approach due to (i) the frequent activity of high-explosive, volcanoes in central and southern Italy, the Aegean Arc (Greece), central and eastern Anatolia (Turkey), and the East Carpathians (Romania) during the Quaternary (Fig. 1a); (ii) distinctive glass chemical compositions of tephras derived from different volcanic sources that enable unambiguous identification; and (iii) wide tephra dispersal plumes transported by prevailing westerly, but also minor northerly and southerly, winds, leading to the stratigraphical layering of tephras derived from different source regions (e.g., Druitt et al., 1995; Federman and Carey, 1980; Keller et al., 1978; Narcisi and Vezzoli, 1999).\nThe Tenaghi Philippon (TP) peatland in NE Greece is situated in an ideal geographical position to record eruptions of Eastern Mediterranean volcanoes (Fig. 1), and has a long history of palaeoclimatic and environmental research that extends back to coring campaigns during the 1960s (van der Wiel and Wijmstra, 1987a, 1987b; Wijmstra, 1969; Wijmstra and Smit, 1976; see review of Pross et al., 2015, and references therein). The millennial-scaleresolution pollen records generated from these early TP cores for the last c. 1.35Ma revealed strong similarities with deep-sea oxygen isotope records (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2006; van der Wiel and Wijmstra, 1987b; Wijmstra and Groenhart, 1983; Wijmstra and Young, 1992).\nBecause the core material recovered through the drilling efforts\nfrom the 1960s has long since deteriorated and also suffered from partially limited core recovery, the potential of the TP archive for the analysis of short-term climate and ecosystem variability has long remained untapped. Therefore, two new long cores (TP-2005 and TP-2009) were drilled in 2005 and 2009 (Pross et al., 2007, 2015). The excellent core recovery achieved during these later drilling campaigns allows high-resolution (i.e., decadal to centennial) analyses (e.g., Fletcher et al., 2013; Milner et al., 2012, 2013, 2016; Müller et al., 2011; Pross et al., 2009).\nA full, state-of-the-art tephrostratigraphic record for the TP sediment sequence, (crypto)tephra analysis has been conducted on the upper 34m of the TP-2005 core, encompassing the time interval of the last c. 130 ka (Marine Isotope Stages [MIS] 1 to 5/6). This core interval has been selected because it spans the last full glacial-interglacial cycle and reveals pronounced millennial-scale climate variability similar to those reported from other highresolution, tephra-dated Eastern Mediterranean palaeoclimate archives. Hence, it offers the potential for distal correlation of palaeoclimate signals in this region using common tephra isochrons (see Section 6.4).\nIn this study, we present major and trace element geochemical data for visible and non-visible (crypto)tephras from the 1e34m depth interval of the TP-2005 core. Where the new data are combined with previously published tephra data (e.g., Müller et al., 2011, Albert et al., 2015, Pross et al., 2015: see details in Section 3), the results allow refined correlation of individual tephra layers to their respective volcanic sources. Published ages for the assigned tephra eruptions, together with radiocarbon dates and palynological control points from the TP archive, lead to an improved age model for the TP sequence, while refinement of the tephra record allows more secure correlations with other high-resolution palaeoclimate archives. Our results therefore provide additional critical anchor points to underpin the distal tephrostratigraphical framework of the Eastern Mediterranean region."

    "text": "The TP site is situated in the Philippi peatland within the southeastern part of the Drama Basin in NE Greece (Fig. 1b). The Drama Basin (40e200m a.s.l.; Fig. 1) formed as a low-elevation graben structure resulting from post-orogenic, arc-parallel extension that started in the late early or middle Miocene (Christanis, 1983; see Pross et al., 2015, for a discussion of its geological evolution). The basin is bordered by the Phalakron Range (2232m a.s.l.) to the north, the Menikion Range (1956m a.s.l.) to the west, the Pangaeon Range (1956m a.s.l.) to the south, and the Lekanis Mountains (1150m a.s.l.) to the east; to the southeast, the Symvolon Hills (477m a.s.l.) separate the basin from the northern Aegean Sea. Today, several streams that discharge into the Angitis River and onward into the Strymon River drain the Drama Basin.\nThe Philippi peatland harbours nearly 200m of limnotelmatic sediments, which make it the thickest known peat-dominated succession in the world (Christanis, 1987). A shallow unconfined aquifer exists at ~1e1.5m below the surface in the central part of the basin (Georgakopoulos et al., 2001). Between 1931 and 1944, the Philippi peatland was drained for intensive agricultural cultivation, which has caused severe disturbances at the peat surface\nand subsidence that nowadays exceeds 7m in the central part of the peatland (Christanis, 2016).\nThe regional climate is characterised by a typical Mediterranean seasonal regime modified by continental influence. During winter, anomalously cold and windy episodes occur that are triggered by southward outbreaks of polar air masses from the Russian High (Saaroni et al., 1996). Today's average annual precipitation amounts to 459mm, with September being the driest (18mm) and December being the wettest months (55mm) (www.geoclima.eu). Moisture availability is mainly linked to the penetration of westerly storm tracks and Mediterranean cyclogenesis (Lionello et al., 2006; Xoplaki et al., 2004).\nThe TP site is located in a favourable downwind position with\nrespect to the potential volcanic sources of tephra, c. 820e870 km east of alkaline Roman and Campanian, calc-alkaline Aeolian Island and peralkaline Pantelleria volcanoes (Italy), and c. 520e550 km north-northwest of calc-alkaline Aegean Arc volcanoes (e.g., Santorini, Nisyros, Yali, Kos) (Fig. 1a). Both the Italian and Aegean volcanic provinces are home to restless volcanoes that have explosively erupted during the Late Quaternary (e.g., Druitt et al., 1989, 1999; Keller et al., 1978; Narcisi and Vezzoli, 1999; Paterne et al., 1988; Sulpizio et al., 2003; Zanchetta et al., 2011). Widely dispersed trachyphonolitic and rhyolitic-dacitic tephras have been detected in numerous sedimentary archives in the AegeanLevantine (e.g., Eastwood et al., 1999; Federman and Carey, 1980; Keller et al., 1978; Leicher et al., 2016; Margari et al., 2007; Satow\net al., 2015; Vinci, 1985) and Black Sea regions (e.g., Ça gatay et al., 2015; Kwiecien et al., 2008; Wulf et al., 2002), some with trajectories towards the TP site. Other potential Late Quaternary tephra sources that may have impacted the TP site include the Ciomadul volcanic complex in Romania (c. 600 km north of TP; e.g., Harangi et al., 2015; Kar atson et al., 2016; Moln ar et al., 2018) and Central Anatolia (e.g., Acig€ol, Hasan Dagi, and Erciyes Dagi; c. 930 km eastsoutheast of TP; e.g., Kuzucuoglu et al., 1998; Sarikaya et al., 2017; Schmitt et al., 2011) (Fig. 1a). However, erupted calcalkaline (highsilica) rhyolites from both these provinces are normally dispersed either towards the east (e.g., Cullen et al., 2014; Wulf et al., 2016) or south (e.g., Hamann et al., 2010; Neugebauer et al., 2017) and therefore may not necessarily be registered in the TP sequence."

    "heading": "3. Previous tephra studies of the TP sequence",
    "text": "In the 1980s, short (<15m long) cores from the Tenaghi Philippon basin were examined for their tephrostratigraphic potential. These efforts initially yielded four visible tephra horizons that were mineralogically characterised, and tephra ages were constrained by radiocarbon dates of over- and underlying sediments (Christanis, 1983). Two prominent tephra layers, labelled ‘unterer Tuffit’ and ‘oberer Tuffit’ by Christanis (1983), were tentatively correlated with Late Pleistocene Campanian and Santorini tephras that occur in deep-sea sediments in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, namely the Y-5 and Y-2 tephras, radiocarbon dated at TP to >28 14C ka BP and c. 14 14C ka BP, respectively. Christanis (1983) also mentioned a Holocene tephra (c. 3.6e4 14C ka BP) and a layer intercalated between the Y-5 and Y-2 tephras (c. 19 14C ka BP) of unknown origin. In a later study, St. Seymour et al. (2004) were the first to geochemically analyse three visible tephra horizons (PhT1, PhT2, PhT3) recovered from new cores from the marginal zone of the Philippi peatland (cores Ph1, Ph2 and Ph3; Fig. 1), but in similar stratigraphic positions to those described by Christanis (1983). The major element glass compositions of the lowermost tephras PhT2 and PhT3 confirmed the correlations of Christanis (1983) with the Y-2/Cape Riva tephra from Santorini (c. 22 cal ka BP; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2015) and the Y-5/Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) eruption from Italy (39.85 ka; Giaccio et al., 2017a), respectively. The youngest visible tephra PhT1, dated to c. 13.0 14C ka BP, was found to be geochemically similar to the Y-2 tephra and therefore was tentatively assigned to an unknown eruption of Thera volcano, Santorini (St. Seymour et al., 2004). These results demonstrated that the TP site has received volcanic fall material from both Italian and Aegean Arc volcanoes. Hence, from a tephrostratigraphical perspective it can be considered a key archive for linking Central and Eastern Mediterranean palaeoclimate records.\nThe first studies on visible tephra layers of the newly drilled TP2005 core (Pross et al., 2007) geochemically identified the Y-2 tephra (PhT2, ‘oberer Tuffit’) and CI/Y-5 (PhT3, ‘unterer Tuffit’) at 7.61m and 12.87m core depth (Müller et al., 2011; Lowe et al., 2012), but failed to detect the ~13.0 14C ka PhT1 tephra previously described by St. Seymour et al. (2004). Initial cryptotephra studies on the 4e19m interval of the TP-2005 core were performed within the RESET project (Lowe et al., 2015), and as part of the results, Albert et al. (2015) highlighted the identification of the Campanian Y-3 tephra (29 cal ka BP; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2015). Furthermore, a preliminary account of cryptotephra findings from the 6e15m interval of the TP-2005 core (MIS 2e4) was provided by Pross et al. (2015). Recent cryptotephra studies at Heidelberg University focused on TP-2005 core sections from 1 to 4m (Middle-late Holocene) and 19e34m (MIS 5) depth. In order to provide a complete tephrostratigraphy for the entire MIS 1 to MIS 5 interval, data and results of all (crypto)tephra studies conducted on the TP-2005 core are either newly presented or reviewed in this paper."

    "text": "The deep core TP-2005 was drilled in April 2005 in the southern part of the Philippi peatland (coordinates: 40 5804000N, 24 1304200E, 40m a.s.l., Fig. 1c) using a non-rotating probe driven by a pneumatic hammer system on a WIRTH Eco l drill rig (Pross et al., 2007, 2015). It extends from the surface to 60m depth and represents a sedimentary sequence that spans the Late Holocene to MIS 9c continuously (base at c. 312 ka; Fletcher et al., 2013). The core material was used to generate the first high-resolution (decadal-to centennial-scale) pollen record from the TP archive (Fletcher et al., 2013; Milner et al., 2012, 2013, 2016; Müller et al., 2011; Peyron et al., 2011; Pross et al., 2009, 2015; Schemmel et al., 2017) (Fig. 2).\nAge control of the upper 15m of the TP-2005 sequence, as currently published, is based on 20 radiocarbon ages and inclusion of the age estimates for the two visible Y-2 and Y-5/CI tephra layers (Müller et al., 2011; Pross et al., 2009); beyond the range of 14C dating, the age control was based on either tuning to the NGRIP oxygen isotope curve (MIS 4; Müller et al., 2011) or alignment of the TP pollen data with marine core MD95-2042 from the Iberian Margin (MIS 5; Milner et al., 2012, 2016)."

    "heading": "4.1. Preparation of tephra samples",
    "text": "Detailed cryptotephra analyses were carried out for the depth interval from 1 to 34m of the TP-2005 core, spanning the period from the late Holocene (MIS 1; c. 2.8 cal ka BP) to the transition from the Penultimate Glacial (MIS 6) to the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e) (c. 130 ka BP). The uppermost metre of the TP peat sequence (<2.8 cal ka BP) was not considered for tephra sampling because it is compromised by anthropogenic disturbances, notably oxidation and self-combustion of the mire surface due to intense drainage and cultivation of the peatland (Kalaitzidis and Christanis, 2004). The core interval from 4 to 19m was analysed at Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL, UK). The core intervals from 1 to 4m and from 19 to 34m were analysed at Heidelberg University (Germany). In addition, the core interval between 4.9 and 5.3m was resampled in Heidelberg in order to extract further glass shards from detected tephra layers for geochemical analyses.\nThe investigated sediments consist almost entirely of decomposed fen peat and peaty muds with two layers of lake marl at depths of 12.55e12.64m and 32.00e33.00m. The sequence was continuously subsampled in 10-cm-sections for initial cryptotephra scans. Samples inwhich tephra glass shards were detected were reexamined in 1-cm increments for isochron refinement. The preparation procedures for cryptotephra scanning followed slightly different methods at the RHUL and Heidelberg laboratories, which, however, did not impact upon the quality and comparability of data.\nIn a first step, samples were dried at 105 C for 12e24 h and weighed, then combusted in a muffle furnace for 4 h at 550 C and subsequently treated overnight with c. 15% H2O2 solution (Heidelberg) to remove organic matter. Carbonates were dissolved by a 7.5e10% HCl solution. The residues were sieved to yield 25e125 mm (RHUL) and 20e100 mm (Heidelberg) grain-size fractions, to which a density flotation procedure was applied based on the protocols of Turney (1998) and Blockley et al. (2005). At RHUL, the residual samples of the light (2.0e2.55 g/cm3) and heavy fractions (>2.55 g/ cm3) were mounted onto slides using Euparal™ or Glycerol. The samples in Heidelberg were transferred into rectangular plastic lids using Ethanol and dried prior to inspection for glass shards under a transmitted light microscope. Counts of detected glass shards were based on the replicated 1-cm interval samples and are expressed as ‘shards per g dry weight (shards/gdwt)’.\nWhere the number of glass shards was very low, individual\nshards were extracted with a 5 ml gas chromatography syringe fitted with a 110 mm diameter micromanipulator needle, transferred onto a resin stub and covered with Specifix™ resin (RHUL). Alternatively, glass shards were handpicked with a single-hair brush into a single-hole aluminium stub and embedded in Epofix™ resin (Heidelberg) prior to sectioning and polishing for geochemical analyses. Samples with very high tephra-shard concentrations were directly sprayed and mounted onto stubs. Identified tephra layers were labelled using the mean isochron depth in the TP-2005 core in meters below the surface (e.g., TP05e7.61).\nIn order to test potential correlations with the tephra samples from TP, medial-distal tephras (samples TM-18-1d, TM-18-4, TM18-9e and TM-27; Wulf et al., 2006, 2012; Wutke et al., 2015) were sampled from the lacustrine sediment record of Lago Grande di Monticchio (southern Italy; Fig. 1) and geochemically reanalysed with the same instrument as the potential TP tephra correlatives. In addition, juvenile material from the proximal Cape Tripiti pumice fall deposits, which correspond to the 26 ka marine Y-4 tephra (Fabbro et al., 2013), was sampled by R. Gertisser (Keele University, UK) at Cape Tripiti at the southern coast of Therasia Island, Santorini (coordinates: 36.41401 N, 25.3439 E) and provided for geochemical analysis."

A waiting time of 450 s was necessary to obtain steady-state sputtering conditions, and four acquisition cycles using the following count times per cycle were performed: Li (5 s), Be (5 s), Si (2 s), K (2 s), Sc (5 s), Ti (4 s), V (5 s), Cr (5 s), Rb (5 s), Sr (5 s), Y (5 s), Zr (5 s), Nb (5 s), Cs (8 s), Ba (8 s), La (10 s), Ce (10 s), Nd (10 s), Sm (15 s), Dy (20 s), Er and Yb (15 s each), Th and U (20 s each). Standards used for calibration and interference correction were the following: NIST-SRM 610 (Pearce et al., 1997), BCR-2G (USGS), BB basalt glass (inner CNR-IGG standard), and WY1 basaltic glass (CEA/CNRS - CE/ Saclay, France) (for details of the reference concentrations assumed see Supplement 1).\nCryptotephras processed in Heidelberg (i.e., TP055.075, 19.915, 25.195, 25.465, 27.915, 32.225 and 32.265) and glass shards from the visible Campanian Ignimbrite layer at 12.87 m core depth were analysed at Heidelberg University using both a CAMECA IMS 3f and CAMECA 1280-HR (HIP) ion probe with a respective 5 nA/1 nA current intensity and a spot diameter of 10e5 mm. The width of the energy slit was 50 eV and the voltage offset applied to the sample accelerating voltage (þ10 kV)was 105 V/-75 V. Pre-sputtering timewas 120 s/30 s, and five acquisition cycles with the following count times per cycle were obtained: Si (2 s/0.5 s), Rb (5 s/3 s), Sr (5 s), Y (5 s/3 s), Zr (5 s/ 3 s), Nb (5 s/6 s), Ba (5 s), La (5 s/6 s), Ce (5 s/6 s), Th (20 s/10 s) and U (20 s/12 s). The NIST-SRM 612 glass standard was used as an internal (primary) standard for both SIMS instruments alongside secondary referencematerials such as the rhyolitic ATHO-G and the andesitic StHs6/80-G glass standards (Jochum et al., 2006)."

Poisson-process deposition sequences (‘P_Sequences’) were utilised for successive core sections (Bronk Ramsey, 2008; Bronk Ramsey and Lee, 2013). A model averaging approach (‘variable k’) was applied to the section for which contiguous (5 cm resolution) 14C data were available (i.e., 12.87e14.80m core depth, c. 39e48 cal ka BP), whereas a conservatively low rigidity (k¼ 10) was applied to the core sections with fewer dated levels, allowing increased uncertainty ranges between dated core depths. The IntCal13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2013) was used for all radiocarbon data, and objective outlier analysis was applied (Bronk Ramsey, 2009b; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2010). Median modelled ages were imported into the program AnalySeries 2.0.8 (Paillard et al., 1996) in order to plot the TP-2005 palaeo-proxy data on the new time scale (Supplement 3) and to provide new age estimates of identified tephras (Table 1)."

Trace compositional glass data were obtained from the two visible tephras and from a total of 24 cryptotephra layers using either LA-ICP-MS or SIMS analysis; two tephras (i.e., TP05e7.07 and TP05e12.87) were analysed using both techniques in order to test the compatibility of LA-ICP-MS and SIMS data.\nThe chemical data repeatedly revealed the presence of redeposited components from the Y-2 and/or Y-5/CI visible tephra\nlayers (7.61m and 12.87m depth) in most cryptotephra layers. Only six layers revealed distinctive geochemical features that enabled confident allocation to primary tephra fallout.

    "text": "5.1.1. TP05e2.625 and TP05e3.375 (c. 5.67 and 6.53 cal ka BP) The youngest cryptotephras, TP05e2.625 and TP05e3.375, are tightly constrained layers confined to 2.62e2.63m and 3.37e3.38m core depth, with glass shard peak concentrations of 95 and 12 shards/gdwt, respectively (Fig. 3a). The major-element glass compositions of both cryptotephras are trachyphonolitic with narrow concentration ranges of 61.5e62.4wt% SiO2, 18.8e19.6wt% Al2O3, 3.0e3.3wt% FeO, 1.8e2.5wt% CaO, and alkali (K2O/Na2O) ratios of 1.7e3.2 (TP05e2.625) and 1.1e1.5 (TP05e3.375) (Fig. 4a). This alkaline composition suggests a Campanian (Italian) source, more specifically within the Campi Flegrei (CF) volcanic field. Widespread mid-Holocene tephras from this region are only known from the Astroni sequence, Agnano Monte Spina and Averno 1 eruptions (Di Vito et al., 1999; referred to hereafter as the ‘AAA’ cluster). They form a geochemically relatively homogenous cluster of tephra layers dated to c. 4.1e4.6 cal ka BP and c. 5.1e5.4 cal ka BP in proximal tephra deposits (Smith et al., 2011), and have been previously described from distal sites in the southern Adriatic Sea (Siani et al., 2004) and in Lake Shkodra in Albania/ Montenegro (Sulpizio et al., 2010a). Other widely dispersed tephras from the Campanian province include the phonolitic Avellino (3945± 20 cal yr BP; Sevink et al., 2011) and older Mercato tephras (8535± 90 cal yr BP; Zanchetta et al., 2011) from Mount Vesuvius, both identified in lake records from the Balkans (Damaschke et al., 2013; Leicher et al., 2016; Sulpizio et al., 2010a, 2010b). However, despite some similarities in silica and CaO concentrations none of the TP cryptotephra chemistries match the major-element composition of Holocene CF (Smith et al., 2011) or Vesuvian tephras (Tomlinson et al., 2015) (Fig. 4a). Instead, they fully fall within the compositional field of the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) that occurs as a thick layer in TP sediments c. 9e10m further downcore. Therefore, we interpret cryptotephras TP05e2.625 and TP05e3.375 as re-deposited CI tephra material most likely through anthropogenically induced erosional processes (see Section 6.1). Thus, these layers cannot serve as marker horizons for the TP-2005 sequence.\n5.1.2. TP05e5.075 (c. 8.26 cal ka BP) TP05e5.075 (5.05e5.10m depth) is an early Holocene cryptotephra with low glass shard concentrations (12 shards/gdwt) that immediately precedes the palynologically and organic geochemically defined 8.2 ka climatic event (Pross et al., 2009; Schemmel et al., 2016) (Fig. 3a). The major element composition of five glass shards is bimodal between alkaline trachyphonolitic (n¼ 4) and calc-alkaline rhyolitic (n¼ 1). The trachyphonolitic component is similar to that of cryptotephra TP05e3.375 and is characterised by concentration ranges of 60.8e62.2wt% SiO2, 18.8e20.6wt% Al2O3, 2.6e3.3wt% FeO, 1.9e2.1wt% CaO, and alkali ratios of 1.0e1.3 (Fig. 4a). SIMS trace elemental data display a rather heterogeneous composition with 271e343 ppm Rb, 33e44 ppm Sr, 9e49 ppm Y, 187e563 ppm Zr, 42e97 ppm Nb, 23e381 ppm Ba, 40e106 ppm La, 52e197 ppm Ce, 10e45 ppm Th, and 4e15 ppm U. The geochemical data suggest a Campanian origin. During the early Holocene, violent eruptions of Somma-Vesuvius and the CF produced several tephra deposits, notably the widespread Mercato tephra (Vesuvius;\n8535± 90 cal yr BP; Zanchetta et al., 2011), which has also been detected in sediments from Lake Ohrid (Leicher et al., 2016), and CF tephra deposits at Fondi di Baia (9610± 85 cal yr BP; Smith et al., 2011) and Pigna San Nicola (9367± 166 cal yr BP; Di Vito et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2011). Comparisons of major element glass data obtained from these tephras yield a tentative correlation with the Fondi di Baia eruption, although this cannot be confirmed by trace-element data (Fig. 4a). Instead, the best chemical match of all analysed trachyphonolitic glass shards is with Campanian Ignimbrite compositional data (Fig. 4a), suggesting again the impact of\nsecondary re-deposition processes. The rhyolitic glass component of cryptotephra TP05e5.075 has concentrations in SiO2 of 76.7 wt%, in FeO of 1.55wt%, in CaO of 0.68wt%, in Cl of 0.45wt%, and an alkali ratio of 1.3. Hence, it shows a good match with the glass composition of the GabellottoFiumebianco pumices from Lipari, Aeolian Islands (Fig. 4b). These deposits represent the proximal equivalent of the marine E1 tephra (e.g., Albert et al., 2017), which has been identified in Tyrrhenian (Paterne et al., 1988), Adriatic (7770± 70 14C yr BP; Siani et al., 2004) and Ionian deep-sea sediments (7810± 45 14C yr BP; Caron\net al., 2012) within early Holocene sapropel S1. The calibrated age of the E1 tephra at 8270± 96 cal yr BP (Caron et al., 2012) is in excellent agreement with the stratigraphic position of the rhyolitic component of cryptotephra TP05e5.075 right below the 8.2 ka climatic event, implying that it reflects primary deposition.\nIn summary, the 5-cm-thick sediment segment across which cryptotephra TP05e5.075 occurs contains both a re-deposited CI component and low concentrations of a primary fall of the E1 tephra. Due to the lack of reproducibility of chemical data at higher resolution (viz. 1-cm sample increments), it was impossible to further constrain the positions of the reworked and primary tephra components. Therefore, a mean depth of 5.075m has been adopted for the E1 tephra isochron in the TP-2005 core."

    "text": "5.2.1. TP05e7.07, TP05e7.26 and TP05e7.61 (c. 18e22 cal ka BP) TP05e7.61 is one of two visible tephra layers occurring diffusively throughout the 7.46e7.61m interval (Fig. 3a). This primary fallout layer sits within MIS 2, just after a sharp increase and contraction in total tree pollen percentages (up to c. 20%). A cryptotephra component appears above the visible layer for a further\n16 cm (Fig. 3a). Major and trace element glass compositions of TP05e7.61 reveal a homogenous calc-alkaline rhyolitic composition with narrow geochemical ranges of 70.9e72.0wt% SiO2, 14.1e14.7wt% Al2O3, 2.7e3.3wt% FeO, 4.8e5.6wt% Na2O, and 2.8e3.1wt% K2O (Fig. 5), a homogeneity that is also apparent in trace-element concentrations of Zr (289e322 ppm), Rb (104e109 ppm), Sr (72e80 ppm), and Th (14.5e16.7 ppm). Based on major element data, the visible TP05e7.61 tephra layer in core TP2005 has previously been assigned by Müller et al. (2011) to the Cape Riva eruption of Thera volcano, Santorini (22,024± 321 cal yr BP; Lee et al., 2013; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2015, and references therein) and its marine distal equivalent, the Y-2 tephra (e.g., Keller et al., 1978; Wulf et al., 2002). Our trace elemental data support this correlation. The TP05e7.61/Y-2 tephra is likely identical to the c. 4 cm thick PhT2 tephra previously identified by St. Seymour et al. (2004) in previous short cores Ph1, Ph2 and Ph3, and most likely to the Upper Tephra (‘obere Tuffitlage’, c. 13,900 14C yr BP), generally found between depths of 3.2 and 8.7m in numerous short cores from across the Philippi peatland (Christanis, 1983). Therefore, TP05e7.61 forms a valuable tephrochronological marker in the TP2005 core dating to 22,024± 321 cal yr BP.\nTwo further dispersed cryptotephra layers (>10,000 shards/\ngdwt) of identical rhyolitic major and trace element glass compositions appear at depths of 7.07m and 7.26m in the TP-2005 core (Figs. 3a and 5). They most likely represent re-depositedmaterial of the underlying primary TP05e7.61/Y-2 tephra. However, it is worth\nnoting that the shard concentration in these layers is much higher than in the majority of the cryptotephra layers detected in the TP2005 sequence (see Figs. 3 and 7). St. Seymour et al. (2004) described a visible tephra layer, PhT1, with a geochemical affinity\nto Y-2 in a similar stratigraphic position only a few decimeters above the primary PhT2/Y-2 tephra. The PhT1 layer has been radiocarbon-dated in core Ph2 to c. 10,152± 57 14C yr BP (11,735± 325 cal yr BP) and thereby assigned to a potentially younger, as yet unknown eruptive event from Thera (Santorini) volcano (St. Seymour et al., 2004). This correlation, however, was based solely on comparisonwith a conventional radiocarbon age of 12,950± 756 14C yr BP obtained from carbonized plant remains in a palaeosol directly overlying the Cape Riva ignimbrites at a proximal site on Santorini (Pichler and Friedrich, 1976). To date, there is no field, geochemical or additional geochronological evidence for an early Holocene/Lateglacial tephra from Thera volcano that approximates the Cape Riva/Y-2 glass composition (e.g., Druitt et al., 1999, 2015). The only distal tephra originating from Santorini with an early Holocene age has been reported from SE Aegean Sea core LC21 (cryptotephra LC21e2.005; Satow et al., 2015, Fig. 1). The major and trace element glass composition of this tephra, however, is more similar to that of the 3.6 ka Minoan/Z-2 tephra than to the Cape Riva/Y-2 tephra (Fig. 5). Consequently, we interpret tephra PhT1 not as a primary fallout deposit, but as a result of postdepositional recycling of PhT2/Y-2 material (see Section 6.1), which may correlate with either the TP05e7.07 or the TP05e7.26 cryptotephra layers.\n5.2.2. TP05e8.90 and TP05e8.96 (c. 27.6 and 27.7 cal ka BP) TP05e8.90 and TP05e8.96 are two cryptotephra layers with\nnegative glass shard distribution skews over 4e5 cmwide intervals and low shard peak concentrations of 275 and 65 shards/gdwt, respectively. Both tephra layers sit within early MIS 2 in an interval of low, but increasing total tree-pollen percentages (c. 2.7e8.1%; Fig. 3a). Unfortunately, geochemical data could not be obtained from these layers due to problems of reproducibility during subsampling for geochemical analyses."

TP05e9.23, TP05e9.38, TP05e9.51, TP05e9.70 and TP05e9.78 (c. 28.2e29.2 cal ka BP)\nThis cluster of five cryptotephra deposits comprises one primary cryptotephra layer (TP05e9.70) and redeposited tephra material. The primary layer TP05e9.70 sits within a MIS 3 interval of low (c. 8%) total tree pollen percentages (Figs. 2 and 3b). It shows a highly positive distribution skewwith a peak of ca. 2060 shards/gdwt and a vertical stratigraphic spread of glass shards over 8 cm (Fig. 3b). Glass chemical data reveal a bi-modal mixed geochemical population of both alkaline trachytic and sub-alkaline rhyolitic composition in a 2:1 ratio, respectively (Fig. 5). Major elements in the main, trachytic component range from 60.1 to 62.7wt% SiO2, 18.1e18.7wt% Al2O3, 2.8e3.8wt% FeO, and 2.2e2.8wt% CaO with alkali ratios of 2.1e2.8. Trace element concentrations also show a heterogeneous composition with ranges of 211e307 ppm Zr, 300e347 ppm Rb, 92e116 ppm Ce, 49e63 ppm La, 145e1601 ppm\nBa, 314e845 ppm Sr, 32e48 ppm Nb, 22e28 ppm Y, and 17e26 ppm Th. Glass shards of the same trachytic major and trace element compositions are also found in three cryptotephra layers up to 47 cm above tephra TP05e9.70, i.e., in TP05e9.23 (56 shards/ gdwt), TP05e9.38 (1258 shards/gdwt) and TP05e9.51 (1028 shards/ gdwt) (Fig. 3b). Both the major and trace element compositions of the trachytic component of TP05e9.70 and of the overlying cryptotephras best match that of the Y-3 tephra from the Campi Flegrei (29,059± 178 cal yr BP; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2015) as previously recognized by Albert et al. (2015) (Fig. 5). Because it has the highest shard count, we define TP05e9.70 as the primary fallout layer and consider the overlaying cryptotephras TP05e9.23, TP05e9.38 and TP05e9.51 as re-depositedmaterial derived from the primary layer. Consequently, TP05e9.70 is considered a reliable isochron dating to 29,059± 178 cal yr BP.\nThe rhyolitic component of TP05e9.70 is rather homogenous, with major element concentration ranges of 71.3e71.5wt% SiO2, 14.4e14.6wt% Al2O3, 2.9e3.3wt% FeO, 1.6e1.8wt% CaO, 5.1e5.5wt % Na2O, and 2.9e3.0wt% K2O, and trace element values of 309e336 ppm Zr, 106e112 ppm Rb, 59e62 ppm Ce, 29e31 ppm La, 489e491 ppm Ba, 76e82 ppm Sr, 11e12 ppmNb, 50e52 ppm Y, and 14.7e15.0 ppm Th. Both the major and trace element glass compositions are identical to a single glass shard in the overlying tephra TP05e9.51 and to rhyolitic cryptotephra TP05e9.78 (952 shards/ gdwt) that directly underlies and merges into the primary TP05e9.70/Y-3 tephra. Comparisons of glass data from rhyolitic volcanic centres in the Eastern Mediterranean region that were active during MIS 3 (e.g., Santorini, Nisyros, Yali, Acig€ol, and Lipari) strongly suggest a Santorini provenance for the TP05e9.78 tephra (Fig. 5). Considering the timing of tephra deposition at TP at c. 29 cal ka BP, a potential source eruption could be the Cape Tripiti/Y-4 eruption of Santorini (c. 26 ka BP; Fabbro et al., 2013; Schwarz, 2000). However, the glass chemical composition of Cape Tripiti/Y4 differs significantly from that of TP05e9.78, with lower SiO2 (68.8e71.4wt%) and higher FeO (2.9e4.6wt%) and CaO (1.8e2.6wt %) values as well as slightly different trace-element concentrations (Fig. 5). The good chemical match with the Cape Riva/Y-2 tephra (Fig. 5), however, is inconsistent with the stratigraphic position of TP05e9.78, more than two meters below the visible TP05e7.61/Y-2 tephra. Such a displacement of primary tephramaterial could result from post-depositional processes (see Section 6.1).\n5.3.2. TP05e12.87 (c. 39.7 cal ka BP) TP05e12.87 (12.64e12.87m depth) is the lowermost and thickest visible tephra layer in the TP-2005 sequence. There is also a cryptotephra component that is distributed over a 20 cm interval above the primary layer. Total tree-pollen percentages immediately below and above the visible tephra are c. 5% and 1.4%, respectively, indicating deposition well after the onset of Heinrich Stadial H4 (Fig. 3b). Glass shards of TP05e12.87 reveal a phonotrachytic composition with ranges of 60.0e62.3wt% SiO2, 18.1e18.9wt% Al2O3, 0.3e0.5wt% TiO2, 2.7e4.1wt% FeO, 0.2e0.9wt% MgO, 1.6e2.8wt% CaO, and bimodal alkali ratios of 1.1e1.3 and 2.5e3.7. Trace element concentrations also show a heterogeneous composition with large ranges of 176e678 ppm Zr, 276e477 ppm Rb, 84e251 ppm Ce, 44e133 ppm La, 13e662 ppm Ba, 18e563 ppm Sr, 28e126 ppm Nb, 19e56 ppm Y, and 13e55 ppm Th.\nTP05e12.87 corresponds stratigraphically to the lower tephra (‘untere Tuffitlage’) of Christanis (1983) and to tephra PhT3 of St. Seymour et al. (2004); it has been previously correlated in the TP2005 sequence by Müller et al. (2011) and Lowe et al. (2012) with the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) eruption of the Campi Flegrei, Italy, (39.85± 0.14 ka; 40Ar/39Ar; Giaccio et al., 2017a). This attribution is supported by our new trace element data (Figs. 5 and 6). TP05e12.87 therefore provides a valuable independent marker for\ncalibrating the TP-2005 chronology.\n5.3.3. TP05e13.25 to TP05e14.50 (6 layers, c. 40.1e46.7 cal ka BP) Below the visible Campanian Ignimbrite deposit, a total of six cryptotephra layers were detected between 13.25 and 14.50m core depth (Fig. 3b). TP05e13.25, TP05e13.28 and TP05e13.34 form three tightly clustered peaks between 13.22 and 13.35m depth, and all sit within a period of elevated total tree pollen percentages (c. 30e40%) (Figs. 2 and 3b). TP05e13.25 is a well-constrained layer with a negative distribution skew between 13.22 and 13.26m and a maximum peak of 1311 shards/gdwt. TP05e13.28 is confined to a 3- cm-thick interval with a peak of 1455 shards/gdwt. TP05e13.34 shows the strongest cryptotephra peak below the visible CI layer at 3092 shards/gdwt. The geochemical glass compositions of all three cryptotephra layers are alkaline phonotrachytic with ranges of 60.4e62.2 wt% SiO2, 18.2e19.0wt% Al2O3, 0.32e0.46wt% TiO2, 2.4e3.6wt% FeO, 0.27e0.79wt% MgO, and 1.5e2.8wt% CaO, and bimodal alkali ratios of 1.0e1.5 and 2.5e3.8 (Fig. 6). SIMS trace element concentrations of TP05e13.34 show a less homogenous composition with ranges of 263e793 ppm Zr, 305e431 ppm Rb, 116e275 ppm Ce, 65e160 ppm La, 42e136 ppm Ba, 17e292 ppm Sr, 39e136 ppm Nb, 29e63 ppm Y, and 23e70 ppm Th (Fig. 6).\nCryptotephra TP05e13.54 forms a 5-cm-thick horizon with a peak of c. 1582 shards/gdwt. TP05e13.92, in turn, is a tightly (3-cmthick) constrained cryptotephrawith a peak of ca. 2038 shards/gdwt. TP05e13.54 and TP05e13.92 are situated within periods of low tree-pollen percentages (c. 6% and 1.4e7.9%, respectively; Fig. 3b). Both cryptotephras have heterogeneous trachyphonolitic major and trace element glass compositions that are indistinguishable from the overlying triple-cryptotephra set (Fig. 6, Supplement 1).\nThe lowermost cryptotephra TP05e14.50 has a diffuse shard distribution between 14.46 and 14.54m core depth, with a maximum shard count of c. 40 shards/gdwt, and lies in a period of low total tree percentages (c. 3e6% total tree pollen). It has a homogenous trachytic geochemical glass composition with relatively low alkali ratios of 1.0e1.3, which overlaps with that of the five overlying cryptotephras (Fig. 6).\nGlass compositions of all six cryptotephras that precede the CI suggest an origin from the Campi Flegrei in southern Italy, and best match the major and trace element composition of tephra TP05e12.87/CI. Only cryptotephra TP05e13.34 reveals an additional different component that more closely resembles the composition of the medial-distal tephra TM-18-1d in the Lago Grande di Monticchio sediment record (Fig. 6). TM-18-1d has a major element affinity to the CI, but differs in trace element composition by having higher concentrations in Y (50e64 ppm), Zr (618e795 ppm), Nb (115e143 ppm), La (116e148 ppm), Ce (227e281 ppm), Th (47e64 ppm), and U (17e22 ppm), and lower values in Rb (447e636 ppm), Sr (4e20 ppm), and Ba (4e95 ppm) (Supplement 2). At Lago Grande di Monticchio, TM-18-1d is dated by annual layer counting to 37,360 varve yr (Brauer et al., 2007). It precedes the deposition of the CI in this record by approximately 590 years (Wutke et al., 2015). Given that the 40Ar/39Ar age for the CI eruption is 39.85± 0.14 ka (Giaccio et al., 2017a), the varve age of TM-18-1d can be considered too young, and therefore this date should be used with caution.\nIn summary, all six pre-CI cryptotephras appear to consist of redeposited CI material that was moved from the primary fall layer to lower peat levels by post-depositional processes (see Section 6.1). Only tephra TP05e13.34 contains some glass shards that are slightly more distinctive, and which we tentatively correlate with tephra TM-18-1d at Lago Grande di Monticchio. Due to the uncertain varve age of this tephra in the Monticchio record, cryptotephra TP05e13.34 is not included as a chronological marker for the TP2005 age model."

TP05e17.91 (c. 65.1 ka) TP05e17.91 is a tightly constrained cryptotephra layer with a glass shard concentration peak of 749 shards/gdwt that occurs in the middle of MIS 4 where there is a slight increase in relatively low tree-pollen percentages (to c. 12%; Fig. 3b). Unfortunately, it was not possible to extract glass shards from this tephra for geochemical analyses at this stage, and hence the volcanic source is yet unknown."

    "text": "5.5.1. TP05e19.915 to TP05e25.135 (8 layers, c. 74e95.6 ka) Eight cryptotephra layers occur between 19.91 and 25.15m depth, showing mainly tight (within 1e2 cm wide intervals) glass shard distributions with the following peak concentration values: 144 shards/gdwt (TP05e19.915), 76 shards/gdwt (TP05e21.045), 64 shards/gdwt (TP05e22.065), 73 shards/gdwt (TP05e23.055), 217 shards/gdwt (TP05e24.055), 234 shards/gdwt (TP05e24.915), 22 shards/gdwt (TP05e25.085), and 83 shards/gdwt (TP05e25.135). Only the lowermost cryptotephras (TP05e25.085 and TP05e25.135) show rather dispersed distributions over 5- and 4- cm-wide intervals, respectively (Fig. 7). Cryptotephras TP05e19.915, TP05e21.045 and TP05e22.065 sit within the palynologically defined MIS 5a interval, which records abrupt increases of temperate tree pollen (to c. 50e70%). TP05e23.055 and TP05e24.055 occur at the end and the beginning of MIS 5b,\nrespectively, in intervals that are characterised by short-term increases in temperate tree pollen percentages (c. 50%). The preceding layers TP05e24.915, TP05e25.085 and TP05e25.135 were deposited during late MIS 5c, within a period of increased temperate tree pollen (c. 55e80%) (Figs. 2 and 7). All eight cryptotephra layers show similar heterogeneous phonotrachytic compositions that are characterised by ranges in concentrations of 59.7e64.2wt% SiO2, 17.8e20.8wt% Al2O3, 2.6e3.8wt% FeO, and 1.5e3.0wt% CaO, and bimodal alkali ratios of 1.0e1.5 and 1.7e3.3 (Fig. 8aþb). SIMS trace element data from cryptotephras TP05e22.065, TP05e24.055 and TP05e25.135 confirm this heterogeneity and strongly suggest a correlation of all layers with the Campanian Ignimbrite (Figs. 8aþb, 9). Two single glass shards extracted from cryptotephras TP05e21.045 and TP05e22.065 are rhyolitic, with the same compositional field as the Cape Riva/Y-2 tephra (Fig. 8a). The overall chemical evidence and the fact that most of the TP tephras occur within the top 10 cm of individual core segments suggests that they all consist of re-distributed material from the overlying visible CI and Y-2 tephras and thus cannot be used as tephrochronological markers. The remobilization of tephra material is here most likely due to drilling procedures (see Section 6.1).\n5.5.2. TP05e25.195 (c. 95.8 ka) Cryptotephra TP05e25.195 is a well-constrained, stratigraphically normally distributed cryptotephra layer (39 shards/ gdwt) that occurs between 25.18 and 25.20m depth. It sits in the middle of MIS 5c within an interval of decreased temperate tree\npollen (c. 50%) (Figs. 2 and 7). Major element glass compositions indicate a heterogeneous trachytic chemistry with concentration ranges of 60.2e62.9 wt% SiO2, 18.2e20.1wt% Al2O3, 2.6e4.2wt% FeO, and 1.7e2.9wt% CaO, and bimodal alkali ratios of 1.0e1.5 and 1.6e3.5 (Fig. 8b, Table 2). Trace element glass compositions confirm this heterogeneity with concentration ranges of 235e392 ppm Rb, 18e582 ppm Sr, 19e54 ppm Y, 170e638 ppm Zr, 25e113 ppm Nb, 14e770 ppm Ba, 39e118 ppm La, 75e217 ppm Ce, 12e47 ppm Th, and 4e16 ppm U. Most major and associated trace element glass compositions match that of the CI (Figs. 8b and 9a), implying that there is also re-deposited material in this core section. However, a minor component (2 glass shards) deviates from the CI composition and plots within the geochemical field of the prominent MIS 5c tephra TM-23-11/POP1 (Fig. 8b). This tephra derives from a yet unknown Campanian eruption; it has been described from the Sulmona Basin (POP1) and Lago Grande di Monticchio (TM-23-11) records in central and southern Italy, respectively (Giaccio et al., 2012; Wulf et al., 2006), and correlated with marine tephras C-22 in the Tyrrhenian basin (Paterne et al., 2008) and PRAD-2517-2525 in the Adriatic Sea (Bourne et al., 2010, 2015). The TM-23-11/POP1 tephra is dated in Sulmona by 40Ar/39Ar to 92.4± 4.6 ka (Giaccio et al., 2012) and in Monticchio by annual layer counting to 96,210± 4810 varve yr (Martin-Puertas et al., 2014), respectively. Our results strongly suggest an allocation of TP05e25.195 to TM23-11/POP1, which leads us to integrate the 40Ar/39Ar age of this\ntephrochronological marker into the new TP age model.\n5.5.3. TP05e25.465 to TP05e27.035 (5 layers, c. 96.7e105.4 ka) Another five cryptotephra layers have been identified in peatdominated lithologies between 25.46 and 27.04m core depth, corresponding to the middle to early phase of the MIS 5c interval. They are tightly constrained in the core, with shard peaks of ca. 956 shards/gdwt (TP05e25.465), 41 shards/gdwt (TP05e26.055), 8 shards/gdwt (TP05e26.35), 34 shards/gdwt (TP05e26.915), and 110 shards/gdwt (TP05e27.035). The glass shards of cryptotephras TP05e25.465, TP05e26.055, TP05e26.915 and TP05e27.035 are dominated by a heterogeneous phonotrachytic composition with concentration ranges of 59.7e65.4 wt% SiO2, 16.4e20.6wt% Al2O3, 2.7e3.6wt% FeO, and 1.6e2.8wt% CaO, and bimodal alkali ratios of 1.0e1.5 and 2.2e3.1. Major element data and additional trace element data available for TP05e25.465 strongly suggest a correlation of the phonotrachytic glass component in all four cryptotephras with the CI (Figs. 8b, c, 9a). A minor rhyolitic component found in tephras TP05e25.465 and TP05e26.915 best matches the Y-2 composition (Fig. 8b and c). Within this reworked material, an additional minor, but distinctive alkaline glass composition is evident, i.e., TP05e25.465 contains a phonotrachytic glass with CaO concentrations of 1.4wt% and an alkali ratio of 0.9, which are both lower than in the CI (Supplement 1). However, to date no Campanian tephra of comparable composition has been described for this\ntree pollen curve (Milner et al., 2012, 2013, 2016); photographic images of lithological counts; and transmitted light images of some typical glass shards in the cryptotephra d blue lines indicate reworked and yet unidentified tephra material, respectively. Grey , respectively. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the\ntime interval, thus preventing a firm tephra assignment. Furthermore, cryptotephras TP05e26.35 and TP05e26.915 both exhibit a single trachytic glass composition with concentrations in SiO2 of 61.9e62.2wt%, FeO of 2.7e3.0wt%, CaO of 1.7e1.9wt%, and low alkali ratios of 0.7e0.8 (Fig. 8c, Supplement 1). This composition best matches the chemistry of the primary X-6 tephra deposited one meter further down-core in the TP-2005 sequence. The composition of another single glass shard in cryptotephras TP05e26.915 and TP05e27.035 slightly resembles the composition of the Campanian X-5 tephra (106.2± 1.3 ka 40Ar/39Ar; Regattieri et al., 2015) (Fig. 8c), but a firm correlation cannot be established at this point due to the lack of trace element data.\nIn summary, out of the five cryptotephras discussed here only TP05e25.465may relate to a primary eruption at c. 97.5 ka, which is of a yet unknown, but likely Campanian origin. Therefore, to date no tephrochronological tie-point for the TP age model is available from this part of the TP-2005 core.\n5.5.4. TP05e27.915 and TP05e27.995 (c. 109.4e109.7 ka) Cryptotephras TP05e27.915 and TP05e27.995 form tightly constrained normal and reversed distributed layers with peak glass shard concentrations of 92 and 128 shards/gdwt, respectively. They are positioned in the middle (TP05e27.995) and at the onset (TP05e27.995) of MIS 5d and C24, a cold period that is characterised by sharp declines in total (c. 30%) and temperate tree-pollen percentages (c. 5%; Figs. 2 and 7). Both cryptotephras are phonotrachytic in composition, which suggests a Campanian origin. The major element chemistry is heterogeneous with concentration ranges of 60.2e64.9wt% SiO2, 18.3e20.6wt% Al2O3, 2.7e3.6wt% FeO, and 1.1e2.6wt% CaO, and bimodal alkali ratios of 0.75e0.95 and 1.1e3.1 (Fig. 8c, Table 2). The bimodality of alkali ratios (Na2O> K2O and K2O>Na2O) implies the presence of two distinct tephra components, which likely derive from different eruptions. Larger glass shards with K2O>Na2O values and trace element compositions of 350e451 ppm Rb, 20e550 ppm Sr, 19e53 ppm Y, 172e676 ppm Zr, 26e131 ppm Nb, 20e648 ppm Ba, 42e118 ppm La, 76e220 ppm Ce, 13e48 ppm Th, and 4e19 ppm U suggests a correlation with re-deposited CI tephra material (Figs. 8c and 9b). The second component with Na2O> K2O is restricted to smaller glass shards (<50 mm) and best matches the composition of the late Last Interglacial X-6 tephra. The X-6 tephra is a widespread tephra marker in the central-eastern Mediterranean that derived from a Plinian and co-ignimbritic plume from the Campanian region, but the specific centre is yet unknown (see e.g., Albert et al., 2012; Bourne et al., 2015; Giaccio et al., 2012; Keller et al., 1978; Leicher et al., 2016; Lucchi et al., 2008; Sulpizio et al., 2010b; Wulf et al., 2012). X-6 is characterised by a typical bimodal peralkaline and low-K-alkaline chemistry, of which the latter is partly indistinguishable from the CI composition (Fig. 8c, Table 2, Supplement 2). The X-6 tephra has been precisely dated for the Sulmona Basin (POP4 tephra) and Lago Grande di Monticchio locations (TM-27) by 40Ar/39Ar methods using sanidine to 109.5± 0.9 ka (Regattieri et al., 2017) and by annual layer counting to 109,370± 5469 varve yr (Martin-Puertas et al., 2014; Wulf et al., 2012), respectively. When compared to the tephrostratigraphic record from Lago Grande di Monticchio, cryptotephra TP05e27.915 shows the best fit to the X-6 tephra, which accords with its stratigraphic position in the middle of the C24 stadial, and therefore it is considered a useful isochron layer with an age of c. 109.5 ka.\n5.5.5. TP05e31.255 (c. 120.9 ka) Cryptotephra TP05e31.255 is a well-constrained layer between 31.24 and 31.26m core depth, with a low glass shard peak concentration of 11 shards/gdwt at 31.255m depth. The tephra occurs in the middle of MIS 5e in an interval of high percentages of total tree\n(c. 97%) and temperate tree taxa percentages (c. 78%; Figs. 2 and 7). TP05e31.255 has a heterogeneous trachyphonolitic glass composition with concentration ranges of 61.4e63.0wt% SiO2, 18.7e19.8wt% Al2O3, 2.9e3.6wt% FeO, and 1.1e2.5wt% CaO, and low alkali ratios of 0.8e1.5. Trace element compositions of two larger glass shards show ranges in values of 282e382 ppm Rb, 33e92 ppm Sr, 21e46 ppm Y, 230e519 ppm Zr, 36e90 ppm Nb, 26e60 ppm Ba, 45e95 ppm La, 87e172 ppm Ce,14e34 ppm Th, and 6e11 ppm U (Fig. 9). These shards can be confidently correlated with the CI, once again suggesting downward tephra remobilization in this core interval. The majority of TP05e31.255 major element chemical data, however, plots into the discrimination field of tephra TM-33-1a from Lago Grande di Monticchio (MartinPuertas et al., 2014; Wulf et al., 2012) (Fig. 8d). This tephra has been assigned to the Punta Imperatore deposits on Ischia (116± 2.9 ka to 123 ± 3.8 ka K/Ar; Gillot et al., 1982) and is likely dated more accurately by annual layer counting to 116,700± 5835 varve yr (Martin-Puertas et al., 2014). We use the varve age for integrating tephra TP05e33.255 into the new TP-2005 age model.\n5.5.6. TP05e31.95 (c. 123.8 ka) This cryptotephra has very low glass shard concentrations (7 shards across a 10-cm-thick interval) and occurs during early MIS 5e at the onset of a slight decline in total tree pollen (c. 91%; Figs. 2 and 7). TP05e31.95 shows both alkaline and calcalkaline glass compositions. The alkaline glass population is bimodal trachyphonolitic with one component (consisting of two shards) showing concentration ranges of 63.0e63.7 wt% SiO2, 18.2e18.7wt% Al2O3, 2.7e2.9wt% FeO, and 1.8e2.0wt% CaO, and alkali ratios of 1.3e1.4 (Fig. 8d). The second component (consisting of four shards) mainly differs in higher values of Al2O3 (18.8e19.3wt%) and lower values of SiO2 (62.1e62.7wt%), CaO (0.7e1.3wt%) and alkali ratios (0.7e1.1). Both compositions have a Campanian affinity and show similarities to Eemian tephras TM-33-1a, TM-33-2a and TM-37a recorded at Lago Grande di Monticchio (Wulf et al., 2012) but also to the Campanian Ignimbrite (Fig. 8d). However, due to the lack of trace element data for both the TP05e31.95 and the potentially correlative Monticchio tephras, it is not possible to make a firm correlation. The calcalkaline glass population (two shards) is rhyolitic, approximating both the major and trace element compositions of the Y-2 tephra from Santorini (Figs. 8d and 9b). The rhyolitic component in addition to the potential CI material suggests drilling-related tephra remobilization processes in this part of the TP-2005 sequence (see Section 6.1).\n5.5.7. TP05e32.225 and TP05e32.265 (c. 124.9 and 125.1 ka) Cryptotephras TP05e32.225 and TP05e32.265 are two closely spaced, tightly constrained layers with low glass peak concentrations of 13 and 21 shards/gdwt, respectively. They are positioned within early MIS 5e in an interval of very high tree-pollen percentages (c. 95%; Figs. 2 and 7). Glass chemical compositions of both tephras are dominated by a relatively homogenous trachytic composition with concentration ranges in SiO2 of 60.6e64.3wt%, Al2O3 of 17.5e20.1wt%, FeO of 2.8e3.3wt%, and CaO of 1.7e2.1wt%, and alkali ratios of 0.9e1.5 (Fig. 8d). Additional SIMS trace element data of a total of eight shards reveal values of 342e498 ppm Rb, 19e29 ppm Sr, 51e56 ppm Y, 616e731 ppm Zr, 105e135 ppm Nb, 13e26 ppm Ba, 110e126 ppm La, 203e235 ppm Ce, 42e50 ppm Th, and 16e18 ppm U, strongly suggesting a correlation with the CI (Figs. 8d and 9b). TP05e32.225 has an additional rhyolitic component that approximates the Santorini Y-2 composition (Fig. 8d). Since no other large eruptions with similar compositions are known to have occurred from these centres during this time period, we consider both the trachytic and rhyolitic glass components as reworked tephra material, which may not be used as time\nmarkers for the TP chronology.\n5.5.8. TP05e32.53 (c. 126.2 ka) TP05e32.53 (32.52e32.54m depth) is the deepest cryptotephra in the investigated core interval. It is a tightly constrained layer with a low glass shard concentration (2 shards/gdwt, >10 shards in the 10-cm-thick scanning sample) that lies within early MIS 5e (c. 122.4e130 ka BP), where tree-pollen percentages are high (c. 87%; Figs. 2 and 7). Major element glass data reveal a heterogeneous phonotrachytic composition with concentration ranges of 60.1e62.6wt% SiO2, 18.8e20.2wt% Al2O3, 2.8e3.5wt% FeO, and 1.7e2.5wt% CaO, and bimodal alkali ratios of 1.0e1.4 and c. 2.8 (Fig. 8d). The trace element composition of two glass shards with values of 372e398 ppm Rb, 23e24 ppm Sr, 48 ppm Y, 578e600 ppm Zr, 100e102 ppm Nb, 21e23 ppm Ba, 99 ppm La, 183e187 ppm Ce, 36 ppm Th, and 13e17 ppm U suggest a correlation of this glass population with the CI (Fig. 9b). One single glass shard shows a slightly more distinctive phonotrachytic compositionwith a lower CaO value of 1.3 and an alkali ratio of 0.7. The data indicate a Campanian origin, but the eruption cannot be further constrained at this time."

    "text": "Our results show that in addition to in situ cryptotephras a considerable number of the recorded cryptotephra layers in the TP2005 core contain secondary glass shards from the Campanian Ignimbrite and/or the Y-2 tephra. This suggests a complex history of re-deposition of tephra shards, with cross contamination between tephra layers. In the TP-2005 sequence, thick, macroscopically visible layers represent the Campanian Ignimbrite and the Y-2 tephra at 7.61 and 12.87m depth, respectively. Based on the stratigraphic positions of CI and Y-2 tephramaterial throughout the core sequence (Fig. 10), three main processes of tephra displacement are thought to be involved:"
  }, {
    "heading": "6.1.1. Post-depositional movement of tephra particles",
    "text": "Some of the reworked CI and Y-2 material is found stratigraphically close to the visible primary tephra layers. In the case of the TP05e7.61/Y-2 tephra, primary material has been displaced as much as c. 58 cm up-core (cryptotephra layers TP05e7.07 and TP05e7.26) and up to c. 220 cm down-core (cryptotephra layers TP05e9.23 to TP05e9.78) with respect to the visible layer. Reworked shards from the CI, in turn, were detected up to c. 167 cm below the primary deposit (cryptotephra layers TP05e13.25 to TP05e14.50), but are absent from the overlying lakemarls and peat. This re-distribution is likely due to post-depositional movement of tephramaterial. Several experimental studies on peat deposits have shown that tephra shards can be moved vertically after deposition on a peat bog surface (e.g., Bjarnason, 1991; Payne and Gehrels, 2010; Payne et al., 2005). In lightly compacted peat, downward displacement is mainly by gravitational sinking, rainfall percolation and root penetration, particularly during times of a lowered water table, whilst upward displacement can result from vigorous plant growth or a rising water table (Payne and Gehrels, 2010). The scale of vertical tephra movement likely depends on the density and porosity of the surface peat and on the size of the tephra shards (Payne and Gehrels, 2010; Payne et al., 2005). These mechanisms might explain the vertical movement of most of the displaced Y-2 and CI tephra material within the subsurface of the Philippi peatland. The rather surprising extent to which Y-2 shards have been displaced both up-core and down-core suggests substantial fluctuations in the depth of the local water table leading to secondary\nre-deposition of tephra shards in the Philippi peatland. In contrast, tephra material derived from the CI is displaced exclusively downcore, possibly because the subsequent deposition of dense lake marls prevented upward movements when the water table was rising."

    "heading": "6.1.2. Secondary deposition of tephra particles",
    "text": "The re-distribution of CI tephra material in the 2e5m section of the TP-2005 core (cryptotephra layers TP05e2.625, TP05e3.375 and TP05e5.075) is unlikely to reflect the displacement processes inferred above due to the long, vertical distance to the primary CI deposit (>7.5m). Instead, they may be explained by secondary redeposition resulting from anthropogenic exploitation of unconsolidated sediments and soils around the margins of the peat basin, leading to a release of tephra shards, which are then transported by wind or water to the peat surface into the basin (e.g., Payne and Gehrels, 2010). Other disturbance mechanisms that could lead to erosion and remobilization of buried tephras include earthquake activity, natural fires, self-combustion or peat cutting (Payne and Gehrels, 2010). At TP, human agro-pastoral activities at the margin of the basin have been detected in sediments dating from c. 8.4 cal ka BP (Glais et al., 2016), suggesting that erosional and redepositional processes may have played a role in this area since the onset of the Neolithic. Furthermore, drainage of the TP basin in 1931e1944 caused severe subsidence of the peatland resulting in the flooding of large areas and in the destruction of crop yields, which necessitates frequent deepening of the modern ditches and channels in the basin (e.g., Christanis, 2016)."

    "heading": "6.1.3. Coring-related displacement of tephra particles",
    "text": "The third type of tephra displacement is associated with coring processes, particularly in the deeper part of the TP-2005 core. It is evidenced by the repeated occurrence in particular of CI, but also of Y-2 material at the tops and the ends of individual 1-m-long core segments between 17 and 34m depth (Table 1). This repeating pattern most likely relates to the core-driving mechanism during drilling: When the core barrel is retracted, loose sediment (including tephra components) can slump into, and accumulate at the bottom of the borehole. In the next core segment recovered, these reworked sediments form a displaced top layer of variable thickness, which has to be rejected for pollen and tephra sampling. Between individual core retrievals small tephra shards can be gravitationally forced with water into lower peat levels as a result of the load of the borehole water column. The latter was maintained constantly at a depth of 0e2m below surface in order to avoid peat expansion at the bottom of the hole. The only exception was for the recovery of cores between 29 and 31m depth, when the water level was minimized to c. 20 m depth below surface; these cores do not contain reworked tephra material. The distribution of re-mobilised CI and Y-2 tephra shards (Table 1) suggests that their penetration depth is not only a function of the load of the water column, but also of the loading residence time (i.e., the time interval between successive core recoveries). Core segments recovered within a routine time of 15e25min generally exhibit evidence of reworked shards only in the uppermost 10 cm (e.g., cryptotephra layers TP05e21.045, Table 1), while longer time gaps of c. 45e60min appear to result in displaced tephra shards being forced to depths of 20 cm or more into the top part of the subsequent core segment (e.g., cryptotephra layers TP05e32.225 and TP05e32.265).\nGlass shard peak concentrations in top and basal samples affected by coring-related displacement of Y-2 and CI tephra particles in the 17e34m interval is lower than 250 shards/gdwt (Fig. 10, Table 1). However, two exceptions are cryptotephras TP05e17.91 and TP05e25.465, which exhibit significantly higher concentrations of 749 and 956 shards/gdwt (Fig. 10). These tephras most likely\ncontain a primary tephra component that adds to the reworked CI and Y-2 material.\nIn terms of the reliability of the palynological results, we do not expect pollen grains to be displaced by water into deeper peat levels, since pollen grains are more adhesive and substantially less dense than tephra shards (c. 1 g/cm3 [e.g., van Hout and Katz, 2004] compared with glass-shard densities of >2 g/cm3). Also, the concentration of in situ pollen grains would greatly exceed the number of any potentially re-deposited pollen grains and hence have only a negligible, if any impact on pollen spectra from the respective sections."

    "heading": "6.2. Revision of the TP-2005 age model",
    "text": "As described in the previous section, distinguishing between primary and re-deposited tephra material requires careful analysis of geochemical datasets, including trace-element determinations, and independent stratigraphic control, which in this case is provided by high-resolution pollen stratigraphy. Integration of these data has enabled identification of six primary cryptotephras (TP05e5.075, TP05e9.70, TP05e13.34, TP05e25.195, TP05e27.915 and TP05e31.255), along with two visible tephras (CI and Y-2) the ages of which have previously been determined elsewhere by radiometric methods and/or varve chronology and can therefore be\nincorporated into a revised age model for the TP-2005 core. Prior to this study, the chronology for the 1e34m interval of the TP-2005 sequence has been established: (i) for the upper 15m by radiocarbon dating, tephrochronology (visible Y-2 and CI tephras) and alignment of the Lateglacial to early Holocene pollen curve from the core with marine core SL152 (Müller et al., 2011; Pross et al., 2009); (ii) for the temperate tree pollen data between 15 and 19m depth by alignment with the NGRIP oxygen isotope curve (Müller et al., 2011); and (iii) for the 19e34m depth interval, by alignment with the pollen curve of marine core MD95-2042 from the Iberian Margin (Milner et al., 2012, 2016). Here we present a revised age model for the TP-2005 sequence that incorporates the ages of the additional primary tephra layers identified in the present study.\nThe timing of the eruptions to which the primary tephra layers reported here have been assigned are well constrained by a variety of approaches (Table 1). The ages of the youngest tephra correlatives (E1, Y-2 and Y-3) are based on radiocarbon dates obtained from marine sediments (E1; Caron et al., 2012), proximal volcanic deposits (Y-2; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2015, and references therein) and distal terrestrial sites (Y-3; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2015, and references therein). The original 14C dates obtained for these eruptions have been calibrated using the Marine13 or IntCal13 calibration curves (Reimer et al., 2013) prior to their integration\ninto the revised TP-2005 age model (Fig. 11). The corresponding tephra calendar ages, which are given in cal yr BP (1950) and include a 2s error range, are 8270± 96 cal yr BP for the E1 eruption, 22,024± 642 cal yr BP for Y-2, and 29,059± 356 cal yr BP for Y-3. The age of the visible tephra layer TP05e12.87 is well constrained by a new, precise 40Ar/39Ar date of the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) eruption at 39.85± 0.14 ka (before AD 2015, 2s error) ka (39,785± 140 cal yr before AD 1950; Giaccio et al., 2017a).\nThe tephra correlatives of theMIS 5 cryptotephras TP05e25.195, TP05e27.915 and TP05e31.255 have been dated both radiometrically and by varve chronologies, but these are not always in statistical agreement and have different precisions (Fig. 11b). For the integration of the ages of cryptotephras TP05e25.195 and TP05e27.915 into the new age model, preference is therefore given to the 40Ar/39Ar sanidine ages of the tephra correlatives POP1 (92.4± 4.6 ka, 2s; Giaccio et al., 2012) and POP4 (X-6; 109.5± 0.9 ka, 2s; Regattieri et al., 2017) rather than the varve-based ages of the respective Lago Grande di Monticchio tephra equivalents (96,210± 4810 and 109,370± 5470 varve yr, respectively; MartinPuertas et al., 2014). For TP05e31.255, we use the Monticchio varve age of tephra TM-33-1a at 116,700± 5825 varve yr (Brauer et al., 2007; Martin-Puertas et al., 2014) because of its higher precision compared with the wider range of the corresponding K/Ar dates (116± 2.9 ka to 123 ± 3.8 ka; Gillot et al., 1982) obtained from the proximal ‘Punta Imperatore’ deposits from Ischia.\nIn a first step towards constructing a revised age-depth model for the MIS 1e5 interval of the TP-2005 core, the above-mentioned tephra ages were compared with the previous chronologies established by Müller et al. (2011) and Milner et al. (2016). Fig. 11a shows a comparison of all MIS 1e3 tephra ages (this study) with the former tephra-supported radiocarbon chronology for the uppermost c. 15 m of the TP-2005 sequence. The radiocarbon chronology is based on 17 AMS 14C dates of bulk peat samples and three dates of snail shell fragments from the uppermost middle-late Holocene section (Müller et al., 2011), which have been re-calibrated here using the more recent IntCal13 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 2013) and incorporated into a Poisson-process (‘P_Sequence’) depositional model using the OxCal 4.3 program (Bronk Ramsey, 2008, 2009a). The comparison shows that most radiometric tephra ages agree with the radiocarbon chronology within 2s error ranges. The only exception is in the early Holocene (Fig.11a); here, a mean temporal deviation of 870 years can be observed between the published age of the E1/TP05e5.075 tephra (8270± 96 cal yr BP; Caron et al., 2012) and the 14C-interpolated age in the TP core (9140± 695 cal yr BP). This deviation can be explained by an enhanced hard-water effect within the TP basin during the wet early Holocene period (Pross et al., 2009), although based on our data this hard-water effect appears slightly less pronounced than the ~1000e1200 years originally proposed.\nHowever, our new tephrochronological results for the MIS 5 interval of the TP-2005 core suggest that a more thorough revision of the former, pollen-based chronology of Milner et al. (2016) may be necessary (Fig. 11b). The original age model used ten age-control points at mid-transitions for the onset and end of the MIS 5 interglacial (Pangaion), interstadials (Doxaton-Drama and Elevtheroupolis) and stadials (Lydia I and II) to correlate the total tree pollen curves of cores TP-2005 andMD95-2042 (Milner et al., 2016) (Fig. 11b). According to this chronology, the cryptotephras TP05e25.195/TM-23-11, TP05e27.915/TM-27 and TP05e31.255/ TM-33-1a would have mean ages of c. 98.8, 112.6 and 122.4 ka, respectively. These mean ages deviate systematically from the tephra-based ages derived from both the above-mentioned radiometric or Monticchio varve chronologies by> 2600 years at the beginning of MIS 5c and by up to c. 5700 years during MIS 5e (Fig. 11b).\nIn view of these age discrepancies, we established a revised agedepth model for the MIS 1 to MIS 5 interval of TP-2005, integrating independent 14C and tephra age estimates with those based on tuning with other high-resolution, well-dated proxy records in those core sections for which independent dates are not available (Figs. 11c, d, e; Supplement 3):\nFor the uppermost 13m (<40 cal ka BP), four imported tephra radiometric ages, twelve AMS-14C dates based on snail fragments and bulk peat from Müller et al. (2011), and one 14C age from pollen concentrates (Pross et al., 2009) have been included. In addition, the ages of five palynological tie points with marine core SL152 (Kotthoff et al., 2008a, b) were used instead of the reservoir-age affected radiocarbon dates obtained from early Holocene bulk peat samples (c. 7e11 cal ka BP; Pross et al., 2009). Radiocarbon dates from the glacial part of the record, however, do not appear to suffer from this reservoir-age effect, with radiocarbon age estimates corresponding well with independent ages of the visible TP05e7.61 (Y2) and TP05e12.87 (CI) tephra layers (see Albert et al., 2015 for details). The ~40e50 cal ka BP section is based on 44 new AMS-14C dates of bulk peat samples (Supplement 3; Staff et al., in prep.) that substantially increase the temporal resolution of the previous radiocarbon chronology of Müller et al. (2011). The early MIS 3eMIS 5b interval (c. 50e90 ka) does not yet have independent time control, and hence recourse has beenmade to alignment of the TP pollen record with other well-dated proxy records that are considered to offer the best control points for this long time interval. Previous research has suggested that vegetation response to North Atlantic climate change was rapid and effectively synchronous across southern Europe (Roucoux et al., 2001; S anchez Go~ni et al., 2002; Tzedakis et al., 2002), which may justify a direct alignment of the TP pollen curve with otherMediterranean vegetation records. However, the 50e90 ka chronologies of the two available high-resolution pollen records, Lago Grande di Monticchio in southern Italy (Allen et al., 1999; Brauer et al., 2007) and marine core MD95-2042 from the Iberian margin (S anchez Go~ni et al., 1999), either exhibit large uncertainties (Lago Grande di Monticchio; Wulf et al., 2012) or are tuned to the NGRIP oxygen isotope record (MD95-2042; S anchez Go~ni et al., 2013, 2017). Since the ages of the onsets of Greenland Interstadials (GI) 9 to 12 in the NGRIP oxygen isotope record (Svensson et al., 2008) are within 2s dating uncertainties of radiometrically-obtained ages for abrupt increases in total tree pollen concentrations (Fig.12), tuning of theMIS 4e5 pollen record from TP directly to the NGRIP oxygen-isotope record is considered reasonable. Hence, for the 50e75 ka interval, seven chronological tie points of the onsets of Greenland Interstadials (GI) 13 to 19 based on NGRIP annual layer counting (GICC05; Svensson et al., 2008) and ss09sea age scale estimations (Wolff et al., 2010) have been transferred to midpoint transitions of defined peaks in total tree pollen percentages in the TP record (Fig. 12; Supplement 3). Because of increased dating uncertainties in the NGRIP chronology beyond 75 ka, we have integrated three original control points of Milner et al. (2016) for the 75e90 ka interval into the new TP-2005 age model by tuning the onset of GI 20/C19 and the transitions of the Lydia II (GI 21/C21) cold stage with the Mediterranean forest pollen signals of core MD95-2042 (S anchez Go~ni et al., 1999) (Supplement 3). These dates were derived by aligning the MD95-2042 planktonic d18O record (Shackleton et al., 2000) with the synthetic Greenland record of Barker et al. (2011). The chronology of the MIS 5ceMIS 5e section (c. 90e130 ka) is based on three imported tephra ages, two of them derived from sanidine 40Ar/39Ar dating and one from the Lago Grande di\nMonticchio varve chronology. In addition to these independent time markers, tephrochronologically confirmed Monticchio varve ages (Martin-Puertas et al., 2014; Wulf et al., 2012) for five palynological tie points were transferred to the new TP-2005 chronology (Fig. 12). These represent palynologically and sedimentologically well-defined transitions at the ends and onsets of cold stages MON3/GS-24/C23 (103,000± 5150 and 105,500± 5275 varve yr) and MON2/GS-25/C24 (108,630± 5431 and 110,429± 5521 varve yr), and the MIS 6/ MIS 5 boundary at 127,750± 6388 varve yr (Martin-Puertas et al., 2014).\nConsequently, the new age-depth model of the MIS 1eMIS 5 interval of the TP-2005 sequence synthesises a total of 61 independent time markers and 20 palynological alignment points (Supplement 3). Linear interpolation of these chronological markers, however, suggests a virtual hiatus at c. 25 m depth (Fig. 11c), which is not reflected in the sedimentological and/or palynological data. Therefore, an alternative age-depth model was generated using the Bayesian statistical software OxCal ver. 4.3 (Bronk Ramsey, 2017) (Fig. 11d and e), which is more consistent than the linear interpolation (Fig. 11c) with credible estimates of mean peat accumulation rates of c. 1 mm/a and 0.4 mm/a during the late/middle and early Holocene, respectively. For the core interval representing MIS 2 to MIS 5, mean accumulation rates were relatively constant at c. 0.2e0.3 mm/a, being in agreement with previous studies (Christanis, 1983; Kalaitzidis, 2007).\nOne of the highlights of establishing a partly independent, highprecision chronology for the TP-2005 sequence is the potential it\nprovides for yielding more precise age estimates for currently poorly dated tephra layers (Table 1). For example, the age of TP05e13.34 (TM-18-1d) is estimated to between 40,900 and 41,660 cal yr BP based on our new chronology, which is slightly older than the age of 40,440 cal yr BP approximated from incremental varve counting for its counterpart in the Lago Grande die Monticchio record. Moreover, tephras TP05e25.195 (POP1/TM-2311) and TP05e31.255 (TM33-1a) have been re-dated to 93,250e98,430 yr and 117,780e123,970 yr, respectively; these new ages are, however, still within the 2s error range of previously determined radiometric ages and/or varve-count estimates. All of the other Bayesian modelled TP tephra ages, E1, Y-2, Y-3, CI and X-6, are in very close agreement with published radiometric ages."

    "text": "The (crypto)tephra results for the TP-2005 sequence show that some Italian tephras that are prominent in, for example, nearby lake records in the western Balkans (e.g., Lakes Ohrid and Prespa; c. 270e300 km from the TP site) are either not represented at all or are present in trace amounts only in the TP-2005 record (Fig. 12). This does not appear to be the result of chemical degradation, since glass shards in the visible tephra layers in the TP sequence are very well preserved.\nThese different distribution patterns can be explained by a number of factors. First of all, they may be due to differences in the depositional processes that were at work in the environmental settings of the respective archives. Such processes include hydrological focussing of tephra particles via fluvial transportation from\nNGRIP ice-core record for the last c. 140 ka.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure\nthe terrestrial catchment into the depocentres of Lakes Ohrid and Prespa, whereas the mire setting at TP predominantly captured the direct air fall. On the other hand, the variations in tephra thicknesses and occurrences can also be related to differences in atmospheric tephra dispersal caused by variations in local wind and precipitation patterns. Lakes Ohrid, Lake Prespa and Tenaghi Philippon are positioned in a climatic transition zone that is influenced by the complex interplay between moist Westerlies, cold-dry Etesian air masses from the North, warm-humid air from the south and cyclonic/anticyclonic atmospheric circulation patterns in the Aegean region (e.g., Hamann et al., 2008; Koutsodendris et al., 2017; Kutiel and Benaroch, 2002; Maheras et al., 2000; Wagner et al., 2017). It is particularly noteworthy that precipitation patterns differ substantially in the western and eastern Balkans: whereas mean annual precipitation in the Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa region was c. 1000e1600mm/yr during the 1940e1995 period, it was merely c. 500e800mm/yr at Tenaghi Philippon (Fotiadi et al., 1999; Hijmans et al., 2005; https://www.eea.europa. eu). The two times higher rainfall received in the western part of the Balkans results partially from orographic forcing of the moist Westerlies by the Dinarides and Pindos mountain ranges (Metaxas, 1978; Xoplaki et al., 2000). This enhanced precipitation results in a higher likelihood for atmospheric fallout of eastward-transported fine-grained Italian tephra in the western Balkans. Differences in precipitation between thewestern Balkans and TPmay have played an even more important role during the last glacial, when a generally drier climate prevailed across the Balkan Peninsula compared to the warmer/moist conditions during MIS 1 and MIS 5 (e.g., Milner et al., 2012, 2013, 2016; Sadori et al., 2016; Tzedakis et al., 2002).\nFurthermore, moist southerly winds during spring, summer and autumn can also enhance the dispersal and fallout of Aegean Arc tephras in the eastern Balkans and western Black Sea region. This is reflected, for example, by the striking thickness of the Y-2 tephra at TP (4e15 cm; St. Seymour et al., 2004; this study) and in the Sea of Marmara (1e7 cm; Wulf et al., 2002), approximately 530 km from the Santorini source volcano. Other Santorini eruptions of comparable magnitude such as the Late Holocene Minoan eruption are recorded in the Black Sea (e.g., Kwiecien et al., 2008) but not in sediments from the northern Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara (e.g., Aksu et al., 2008; Ça gatay et al., 2015; Wulf et al., 2002) or at TP. This may indicate a stronger influence of westerly winds during the time of that eruption.\nThese considerations highlight the important influence of atmospheric and climatic conditions on tephra dispersal in the greater Balkan region. Additional dispersal complexities may arise from atmospheric circulation contrasts between glacial/stadial and interglacial/interstadial times."

    "heading": "6.4. Climatostratigraphic context of tephras in Eastern Mediterranean records",
    "text": "The identification of eight primary tephra layers in the MIS 1 to MIS 5 section of the TP-2005 sequence allows climate-proxy datasets from TP to be correlated with those from other long terrestrial and marine records in the Mediterranean region that have been analysed for their tephra content (Figs. 12 and 13). For the time being, the terrestrial climate-proxy archives comprise mainly pollen data from lacustrine sediments, such as Lago Grande di Monticchio in southern Italy and Lake Ohrid in Albania/ Macedonia. Lago Grande di Monticchio provides a continuous highresolution (decadal-to centennial-scale) vegetation and tephra record for the MIS 1e5 interval (e.g., Allen et al., 1999; Brauer et al., 2007; Martin-Puertas et al., 2014; Wulf et al., 2004, 2012), and therefore is the most suitable for comparison with the TP record\n(Figs., 12, 13). In the case of Lake Ohrid, high-resolution pollen data are presently only available for the MIS 5 interval (Sinopoli et al., 2018), while the generation of a continuous high-resolution pollen and cryptotephra record is still in progress (e.g., Leicher et al., 2016; Sadori et al., 2016; Wagner et al., 2017) (Figs. 1, 12 and 13). Other valuable terrestrial tephra archives include the Sulmona and Fucino basins in central Italy (Fig. 1), although these are either incomplete for the MIS 1 to MIS 5 interval (Sulmona; Giaccio et al., 2012, 2013; Regattieri et al., 2015, 2017) or lack a comprehensive palaeoenvironmental dataset (Fucino; Giaccio et al., 2015, 2017b) (Fig. 13). A recent study has, however, provided a high-resolution oxygen isotope record for the MIS 5 interval in Sulmona (Regattieri et al., 2017) enabling a detailed comparison of precipitation data for the Central Mediterranean with the TP vegetation record for this time period (Fig. 12). The palaeoclimatic record from Ioannina in southwestern Greece (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2003, Fig. 1) also offers the potential for detailed comparisonwith the TP record, but lacks a detailed tephrochronology.\nMediterranean deep-sea records, on the other hand, have rarely been examined for their (crypto)tephra content so far. The only marine records in the Central Mediterranean with detailed tephrostratigraphies spanning the MIS1 to MIS 5 time period are cores PRAD 1-2 from the Adriatic Sea (Bourne et al., 2010, 2015) and KC01B from the Ionian Sea (Insinga et al., 2014; Lourens, 2004); these cores register a number of tephra layers in common with TP (e.g. Y-3, CI, TM-23-11, and X-6; Fig. 13) but lack high-resolution proxy data. Aegean Sea core LC21, on the other hand, provides temporally highly resolved proxy datasets (Grant et al., 2012) and a detailed (crypto)tephrochronology (Satow et al., 2015); however the only common tephra is the CI, and proxy data from core LC21 are not available for this time interval (Satow et al., 2015) (Figs. 1 and 13).\nHence detailed comparisons of Mediterranean palaeoclimatic records spanning the MIS-1 to MIS-5 interval are presently restricted to few terrestrial records (Figs. 1, 12 and 13). Nevertheless, progress is beingmade in the identification of tephra isochrons that can aid these comparisons, and some of the key points to emerge from the new results presented here are as follows.\nE1 tephra. The early Holocene E1 tephra from Lipari, Aeolian Islands, only occurs in the TP record and has been re-dated by the new TP-2005 age model to 8255± 95 cal yr BP, which is in close agreement with the marine-reservoir corrected, calibrated 14C ages of its marine tephra equivalents (Caron et al., 2012; Siani et al., 2004). The climatostratigraphic position of the E1 tephra in the TP record is c. 120 years prior to the onset of the palynologically well-defined 8.2 ka-event, which is dated in TP to 8140± 90 cal yr BP.\nY-2 tephra. The Santorini Y-2 tephra also only occurs in TP and is dated by the new TP-2005 age model to 21,885± 625 cal yr BP. This age accords with the age constrained by Lee et al. (2013) and Bronk Ramsey et al. (2015) based on two deposition records and proximal 14C dates. In TP, the Y-2 tephra occurs within MIS 2, c. 530 years after the onset of Greenland Interstadial GI2.\nY-3 tephra. The Campanian Y-3 tephra, re-dated in TP-2005 to 29,040± 280 cal yr BP, occurs at TP and Lago Grande di Monticchio in a similar palynostratigraphic position within Greenland Stadial (GS) 5 and Heinrich Stadial H3. More specifically, the new TP-2005 chronology places the Y-3 deposition c. 2400 years after the onset of GS5/H3 (c. 31.44 cal ka BP) and 930 years prior to the onset of GI4 (c. 28.1 cal ka BP) (Fig. 12). The timing at TP differs from varve counts and sedimentation rate estimates at Lago Grande di Monticchio; here, deposition of the Y-3 tephra occurred c. 3430 years after the onset of GS5/H3 and 590 years before the onset of GI4, but is within 2s uncertainties of both chronologies.\nCI tephra. The new TP-2005 chronology re-dates the Campanian\nIgnimbrite to 39,680± 140 cal yr BP and places it at c. 1000 years after the onset of GS9/H4 (c. 40.58 cal ka BP) and 3280 years before the onset of GI8 (c. 36.3 cal ka BP). The resulting total duration of c. 4280 years for H4, however, strongly deviates from the c. 2000 years obtained through high-precision incremental varve dating at Lago Grande di Monticchio (Wutke et al., 2015); there, the CI was deposited c. 820 years after the onset and c. 1170 years before the end of GS9/H4 (Wutke et al. (2015).\nTM-18-1d tephra. This tephra occurs in Lago Grande di Monticchio c. 590 years prior to the deposition of the CI and therewith c. 230 years after the onset of GS9/H4 (Wutke et al., 2015). In TP, where the TM-18-1d tephra correlative is newly dated to 41,280± 380 cal yr BP, the time difference between the GS9/H4 onset and tephra deposition is estimated to c. 720 years.\nTM-23-11/POP1. The climatostratigraphic position of the TM23-11 tephra in Monticchio is roughly defined within MIS 5c and c. 6800 years after the end of GS24/C23 (Martin-Puertas et al., 2014). The new TP-2005 age model re-dates this tephra to 95,840± 2590 yr and allows a more precise palynostratigraphical placement c. 4800 years after the decline of GS24/C23 and c. 2690 years prior to the onset of GS23/C22. The position of TM-23-11 in TP at the onset of a short decline in total tree pollen percentages within the GI23 warm/wet interval coincides with the position of the POP1 tephra equivalent in the Sulmona Basin at the onset of a brief drier event during GI23 (Giaccio et al., 2012; Regattieri et al., 2015, 2017).\nX-6 tephra. The X-6 tephrawas first reported fromMIS 5d deepsea cores from the EasternMediterranean Sea by Keller et al. (1978). Its stratigraphic position was subsequently more tightly constrained in the Lago Grande di Monticchio records, where it occurs during cold event GS25/C24, c. 740 years before the onset of GI24 (Brauer et al., 2007; Martin Puertas et al., 2014). High-resolution oxygen isotope and new high-resolution vegetation data for the MIS 5 intervals in the Sulmona Basin and Lake Ohrid sediments (Regattieri et al., 2017; Sinopoli et al., 2018) allow a more detailed\nassessment of the climatostratigraphic position of the X-6 tephra and hence a direct comparison with the MIS 5 pollen record from TP. In Sulmona, the X-6 (POP4) tephra is positioned at the end of a brief wetter period that occurs in the middle of the arid interval correlated with the North Atlantic C24 cooling event (Regattieri et al., 2017). This position is in striking agreement with the occurrence of the X-6 tephra in the pollen records from Lago Grande di Monticchio, Lake Ohrid and TP at the end of a short event of increased total pollen percentages, interpreted as a wetter incursion during the C24 dry period (Fig. 12). The age of the X-6 tephra has been re-modelled by the new TP-2005 chronology to 109,380± 860 yr, which is in accordance with the Lago Grande di Monticchio varve age and previous radiometric dates.\nTM-33-1a tephra. This tephra is placed in the Lago Grande di Monticchio record within MIS 5e, c. 11,050 years after the MIS 6/5e transition (Martin Puertas et al., 2014). In TP, its tephra equivalent is re-dated to 120,875± 3095 yr, which makes it c. 4000 years older than its age estimate based on varve counting at Monticchio. The timing of the MIS 6/5e boundary is re-dated by the new TP-2005 age model to 129,040 ± 4170 yr, hence placing the deposition of TM-33-1a in TP c. 9170 years after the onset of the Last Interglacial.\nThe comparison of the climatostratigraphic positions of tephras in the Monticchio and TP pollen records indicates similarities in the relative positions of tephras, but some divergence in absolute ages as they would derive from the pollen records (e.g., tephras Y3, CI, TM-23-11, TM-33-1a). These differences do most likely not represent temporal leads or lags of vegetation responses to climate changes, but rather reflect resolution issues and chronological uncertainties of the different dating methods, namely varve counting at Monticchio versus radiometric dating and palynological tuning at TP. Hence, for a more robust assessment of the proposed climatostratigraphic positions of tephras, additional well-dated MIS 1e5 records from the Mediterranean region are much needed."

    "text": "Examination of the 1e34m interval of the TP-2005 core for cryptotephra content has led to the detection of five new cryptotephra layers that represent new primary fall events, adding to the Y-2, Y-3 and Campanian Ignimbrite volcanic ash layers previously identified. The new cryptotephras, which represent the most distal findings with regard to their sources, are the early Holocene E1 tephra from the Aeolian Islands, the Campanian POP1/TM-23-11 (92.4 ka) and X-6 tephras (109.5 ka), and two Italian tephras that have so far only been identified at Lago Grande di Monticchio, namely tephras TM-18-1d (c. 41.3 cal ka BP) and TM-33-1a (116.7 ka). Integration of tephra ages, additional 14C dates on TP sediments and high-resolution palynological alignments resulted in an improved age-depth model of the MIS 1e5 interval of the TP-2005 sequence, and is a major step towards increasing the number of well-dated, long and temporally highly resolved palaeoclimate records in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The new cryptotephra data provide additional isochrons for improving the correlation of long terrestrial and marine palaeoenvironmental records in the eastern Mediterranean region.\nThe tephra results furthermore imply that the Tenaghi Philippon record is key to further refining atmospheric circulation patterns for the EasternMediterranean and adjacent regions for theMIS 1e5 interval. It is located in an ideal position for receiving tephra from both Italian and Aegean Arc volcanoes, and modern atmospheric patterns hold the potential to transport volcanic ash also from East Carpathian and central Anatolian volcanic centres towards TP. This makes TP an important reference archive for correlating palaeoenvironmental sequences from sites in the central Mediterranean with those in the Eastern Mediterranean region.\nOur new cryptotephra investigation at TP has also provided new insight into the factors that can affect the preservation of volcanic glass shards in peat-dominated sedimentary sequences. The evidence for extensive displacement/re-deposition of tephra shards in the TP-2005 core can provide additional information about past environmental influences, such as potential changes in ground water level. The identification of potentially redeposited tephra glass shards versus in situ components critically hinges on the detailed major and trace element geochemical characterisation of a high number of shards, which requires elaborated shard extraction techniques and the application of high-precision microanalytical techniques. Hence, detailed cryptotephra studies may help to better understand post-depositional taphonomic processes in peat bogs, but potentially also in other terrestrial and marine sediments."

  "abstractText": "The iconic climate archive of Tenaghi Philippon (TP), NE Greece, allows the study of short-term palaeoclimatic and environmental change throughout the past 1.3 Ma. To provide high-quality age control for detailed palaeoclimate reconstructions based on the TP archive, (crypto)tephra studies of a peat core ‘TP2005’ have been carried out for the 0e130 ka interval. The results show that the TP basin is ideally positioned to receive tephra fall from both the Italian and Aegean Arc volcanic provinces. Two visible tephra layers, the Santorini Cape Riva/Y-2 (c. 22 ka) and the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI)/Y-5 (c. 39.8 ka) tephras, and six primary cryptotephra layers, namely the early Holocene E1 tephra from the Aeolian Islands (c. 8.3 ka), the Campanian Y-3 (c. 29 ka) and X-6 tephras (c. 109.5 ka), as well as counterpart tephras TM-18-1d (c. 40.4 ka), TM-23-11 (c. 92.4 ka) and TM-33-1a (c. 116.7 ka) from the Lago Grande di Monticchio sequence (southern Italy), were identified along with repeatedly redeposited Y-2 and CI tephra material. Bayesian modelling of the ages of seven of the primary tephra layers, 60 radiocarbon measurements and 20 palynological control points have been applied to markedly improve the chronology of the TP archive. This revised chronology constrains the age of tephra TM-18-1d to 40.90 e41.66 cal ka BP (95.4% range). Several tephra layers identified in the TP record form important isochrons for correlating this archive with other terrestrial (e.g., Lago Grande di Monticchio, Sulmona Basin and y, University of Portsmouth, 1HE, United Kingdom. S. Wulf et al. / Quaternary Science Reviews 186 (2018) 236e262 237 Lake Ohrid) and marine (e.g., Adriatic Sea core PRAD 1-2 and Aegean Sea core LC21) palaeoclimate records in the Mediterranean region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
