All rights reserved\nThe history of life on Earth is punctuated by a series of mass extinction episodes that vary widely in their magnitude, duration, and cause. Biomarkers are a powerful tool for the reconstruction of historical environmental conditions and can therefore provide insights into the cause and responses to ancient extinction events. In examining the five largest mass extinctions in the geological record, investigators have used biomarkers to elucidate key processes such as eutrophy, euxinia, ocean acidification, changes in hydrological balance, and changes in atmospheric CO2. By using these molecular fossils to understand how Earth and its ecosystems have responded to unusual environmental activity during these extinctions, models can be made to predict how Earth will respond to future changes in its climate.\n581\nA nn\nu.

    "text": "An extinction event is described as a widespread and rapid reduction in the amount of life on our planet, Earth. Mass extinction events involve the loss of more than one paleogeographically widespread higher taxon, typically comprising both marine and terrestrial species, identified with a transient decline in their abundance (Sepkoski 1986, Bambach 2006). In fact, some of the most profound changes in biotic evolution in Earth’s history have occurred near mass extinction events (e.g., Twitchett et al. 2001, Benton & Twitchett 2003) (Figure 1).\nThe five largest mass extinction events of the past 600 Myr include the end-Ordovician (EOE), Late Devonian (LDE), end-Permian (EPE), end-Triassic (ETE), and end-Cretaceous (ECE) extinction events (Wiese & Reitner 2011) (Figures 1 and 2). It is telling that all but one of these events (i.e., the EOE) are associated with periods of massive outpourings of mantle-derived magmas [large igneous provinces (LIPs)] (Figure 2), indicating that volcanic activity associated with the tectonic evolution of the planet is the primary trigger (Bambach 2006). For example, the EPE is synchronous with outpouring of the Siberian Traps, and the ECE, though coeval with\n0\n1,000\n200\n0\n400\n600\n800\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\n050100150200250300350400\nCO 2 (\nμa tm\n)\nN um ber of genera\n450\nOrdovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian Triassic Jurassic Cretaceous\nPaleogene Neogene\nI C E H O U S E ICEHOUSEG R E E N H O U S E\nE X T I N C T I O N\nE V E N T S\nG R E E N H O U S EI C E H O U S E\nBoron Paleosols Foraminifera\nStomatal density Liverworts Sodium carbonates\nTime (Ma)\n050100150200250300350400450\nEndTriassic ~201 Ma EndPermian ~252 Ma EndOrdovician 443 Ma Late Devonian 375–360 Ma\nEndCretaceous\n~66 Ma\nA nn\nu.

Fossil and molecular fossil (biomarker) data support the idea that mass extinctions are times of biotic stress caused by both tectonically induced hydrothermal and volcanic processes, which lead to eutrophic oceans, global warming, sea-level rise, and anoxia (Benton & Twitchett 2003).\nTraces of past life are preserved in the rock record as fossils. Biomarkers are fossil molecules that carry a wealth of information concerning the composition, ecology, and diversity of marine and terrestrial communities (see sidebar). They have the additional advantage that they are preserved in many sediments where fossil hard parts are absent. Many of the biomarkers encountered in sediments have been related to lipids and other biochemicals of present-day biological systems, which allows their biomarker-precursor relationships to be established (Table 1). Biomarkers originate from all three domains of life: Eukaryota, Bacteria, and Archaea (e.g., Peters et al. 2004, Brocks & Grice 2011, Grice & Brocks 2011, Grice & Eiserbeck 2013). The identities, isomeric arrangements, and stable isotopic compositions of biomarkers have been widely used in studies of oils and sedimentary organic matter to assess the source of organic matter, provide paleoenvironmental depositional information (Peters et al. 1995, Gaines et al. 2009), and offer insights into the ecology of microbial communities in the wake of mass extinctions.\nwww.annualreviews.org • Biomarkers and Mass Extinction Events 583\nA nn\nu.

Biomarker signatures yield information about the presence and relative abundance of specific classes of organisms. These data can be used to gain insights into features such as cataclysmic losses in biodiversity associated with mass extinctions, and changes in biogeochemical cycling in both marine and terrestrial environments during periods of global climate change.\nBiomarkers inform us about the paleoenvironment, ecology, and underlying kill mechanisms associated with mass extinction events over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Several mass extinction events have shown compelling biomarker evidence for photic zone euxinia caused by anoxygenic green sulfur bacteria; the end-Cretaceous extinction is an exception to this trend. Future work using high-resolution records promises to help constrain changes in primary productivity across extinction intervals.\nBelow we review each of the five major extinctions, beginning with the EPE and ETE because they have been the most intensively studied with biomarkers in recent years. In each case, we provide a discussion of the insights that have been derived from biomarker research and highlight some of the opportunities and outstanding questions for future studies. Because factors such as the shape and connectivity of the ocean basins, including the access they provide for ocean currents to reach high latitudes, are important influences on climate, the configurations of the continental masses at the time of each of the mass extinction events are shown in Figure 3."

    "text": "The EPE is regarded as the “great dying” that led to the disappearance of some 95% of marine and 70% of terrestrial species (e.g., Erwin et al. 2002), the most dramatic loss of life in Earth’s history. This extinction event is constrained to have occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Ma, spanning an interval of 60 ± 48 kyr, based on uranium-lead zircon ages from five ash beds from the highly condensed Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the EPE at Meishan, South China (Burgess et al. 2014). Earlier uranium-lead ages on zircons from numerous sequences located in South China dated the EPE as a single event at 252.28 ± 0.08 Ma (Shen et al. 2011) and 251.4 ± 0.3 Ma (Bowring et al. 1998); continual revisions of the exact timing of the event have been well documented (e.g., Burgess et al. 2014), and the fossil record indicates that the extinction rate held steady at a high level for some time after the event ( Jin et al. 2000).\nOver the past two decades, researchers have developed a great deal of knowledge about the EPE—in particular, an improved understanding of the patterns and timing of the extinction, the rapid and synchronous shifts in the global biogeochemical cycles operating in the oceans and atmosphere, the possible triggers and kill mechanisms, and the existence of a prolonged recovery phase (Grice et al. 2005a,b; Kump et al. 2005; Erwin 2006; Knoll et al. 2007; Wignall 2007; Payne et al. 2012). Many have suggested that the EPE was initiated by an episode of global warming (e.g., Payne & Clapham 2012) attributed to the release of large amounts of CO2 from the eruption of the Siberian Traps LIP (Kamo et al. 1996). The latter is assumed to have occurred over a 1– 2-Myr time interval coinciding with the main extinction phase, similar to the ETE (see below). There appears to be a growing consensus that as global temperatures rose due to the release of copious amounts of CO2 and volatiles, methane was released into the atmosphere as marine\n584 Whiteside · Grice\nA nn\nu.

Elevated weathering rates tied to higher CO2 levels have been proposed as the trigger for the marine ecosystem collapse, and as a control on the pace and pattern of ecosystem recovery.\nThe first appearance of the conodont Hindeodus parvus (the index fossil) and the bivalve Claria (supporting low oxygen levels) marks the Lower Triassic (Twitchett 1999, Wang et al. 2009, Luo et al. 2011). Fossil and palynomorph distributions indicate that the terrestrial collapse predated the collapse of the marine ecosystem (Looy et al. 2001, Twitchett et al. 2001) and are concordant with terrestrial-derived biomarker distributions in marine sections from Italy (Sephton et al. 2005, Watson et al. 2005), China (Wang & Visscher 2007, Xie et al. 2007), Spitsbergen (Nabbefeld et al. 2010b,d), and Arctic Canada (Algeo et al. 2012).\nOne of the most important recent advances in understanding the EPE has come from biomarker evidence for photic zone euxinia (PZE) within EPE sections.

Organisms are shown in the water column under conditions of PZE, keyed to their location in the water column.

Biomarkers indicative of PZE arise from aromatic molecules [e.g., isorenieratane (Figure 5, structure I)] and polar compounds called maleimides (Grice et al. 1996a, Naeher & Grice 2015), which are derived from pigments [e.g., isorenieratene (Figure 5, structure II) and bacteriochlorophylls c, d, and e (Figure 5, structures III, IV, and V, respectively) of Chlorobi]. Evidence for PZE has been reported in at least six global sections (Grice et al. 2005a–c; Hays et al. 2007; Cao et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2010; Nabbefeld et al. 2010d; Hays et al. 2012).

It has been suggested that lignin derived from Late Permian terrestrial plants is their likely source (e.g., Fenton et al. 2007, Luo et al. 2013). Wang & Visscher (2007) applied the ratio of dibenzofuran to the sum of dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, and fluorene (Figure 5, structure IX) [DBF/(DBF + DBT + F)] as a proxy for land plant input and found it reliable and consistent with other proxies related to terrestrial erosion (Xie et al. 2007).\nParent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with high molecular weight, such as coronene (Figure 5, structure X), form at elevated combustion temperatures (Finkelstein et al. 2005). PAHs are relatively low in abundance in most geological samples (Hallmann et al. 2011) but abundant in hydrothermal deposits (Simoneit et al. 2004, Williford et al. 2011). In the GSSP section, high abundances of PAHs support a source from wildfire (Nabbefeld et al. 2010d), potentially at a global scale, which is concordant with studies by Grasby et al. (2011) and Shen et al. (2011). High amounts of combustion-derived PAHs [pyrene (Figure 5, structure XI), fluoranthene (structure XII), benzo[a]anthracene (structure XIII), benzofluoranthenes (e.g., structure XIV), benzo[a]pyrene (structure XV), benzo[e]pyrene (structure XVI), and coronene (structure X)] are abundant in bed 25 of GSSP, which contains ash probably sourced from the Siberian Traps LIP ( Jin et al. 2000).\nOther PAHs, such as perylene (Figure 5, structure XVII), are reported to be derived from perylenequinone pigments of wood-degrading fungi (Grice et al. 2009) and coincide with the fungal remains reported in the GSSP section (Visscher et al. 1996) at the onset of the main extinction horizon (bed 5) (Nabbefeld et al. 2010a). However, the palynomorph has been strongly debated as being of algal origin. Similarly, PAHs such as benzo[e]pyrene (Figure 5, structure XVI), once assumed to be of terrestrial origin, are now attributed to algal sources in Early Triassic–aged samples (Grice et al. 2007).\nSediment data, biomarker abundances, and biomarker δ13C and δD—together with δ34S pyrite, δ13C carbonate, and δ13C kerogen for Late Permian sequences—support a marine transgression and collapse of the marine ecosystem during the EPE event (e.g., Nabbefeld et al. 2010a,c). The δ13C of algal- and terrestrial-derived biomarkers supports synchronous changes in the δ13C of marine and atmospheric CO2. These are ascribed to a 13C-depleted source—for example, 13C-depleted methane and/or CO2 derived from recycling of organic matter as a consequence of the marine ecosystem collapse. Evidence for anoxic conditions (Wignall & Twitchett 2002), and the waxing and waning of PZE from the EPE, is provided by Chlorobi-derived biomarkers, which indicate numerous episodes of H2S outgassing and possibly protracted, multiple pulses of extinction (e.g., Grice et al. 2005a–c; Hays et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2010; Nabbefeld et al. 2010a; Metcalfe et al. 2013). Similar conditions also occurred during the LDE (Maslen et al. 2009; Melendez et al. 2013a,b; Tulipani et al. 2015a,b) (see below). In some cases, the δ13C of kerogen can also reflect a facies change; that is, land plant–derived organic matter (type III kerogen to type IV inertinite) in the Late Permian changing to algal-derived organic matter [type II kerogen (sapropelic)] in the Early Triassic (e.g., Foster et al. 1997, Thomas et al. 2004, Grice et al. 2007).\nThe δ13C values of the biomarkers pristane (Figure 5, structure XVIII) and phytane (structure XIX) vary gradually across the ETE, representing (a) a change in their origin(s) or (b) a rise in stratification toward the Triassic, leading to abundant recycling of 13C-depleted CO2.

In contrast, the δ13C values of C14−18 n-alkyl lipids have multiple inputs, including a variety of primary producers and heterotrophic organisms. If the n-alkyl lipids are derived from primary sources, they are on average depleted in 13C by 1.5 per mil compared with isoprenoids (e.g., Schouten et al. 1998, Hayes 2001). Such a trend has been reported in the Triassic for several sections, such as in Western Australia (Grice et al. 2005a,b) and Spitsbergen (Nabbefeld et al. 2010c). Alternatively, isotopic enrichment of C14−18 n-alkyl lipids can occur through heterotrophic processing of primary biomass. This trend has also been observed in Permian sediments from Western Australia and Spitsbergen (Grice et al. 2005a,b; Nabbefeld et al. 2010c) and in Jurassic sediments spanning the ETE ( Jaraula et al. 2013). These data support high algal productivity in the ancient seas due to nutrient runoff and soil erosion. A comparable trend (but with a reversal in the expected C-isotopic relation) between n-alkyl lipids and isoprenoidal lipids has been reported for the Proterozoic–Cambrian boundary (Logan et al. 1995).\nA biomarker exceptional to the EPE—a C33 alkylcyclohexane [n-heptacosylcyclohexane (Figure 5, structure XX)] that first appears at the onset of the extinction interval of the endPermian ecological crisis—is reported from many EPE sequences globally (e.g., Grice et al. 2005c, Hays et al. 2012, Kim et al. 2010, Nabbefeld et al. 2010a). One exception is the GSSP at Meishan, South China, where this distinctive biomarker is absent in carbonate sequences and microbialites that flourished after the EPE (Luo et al. 2013), pointing to an association with facies type (Grice et al. 2005c). The C33 alkylcyclohexane is likely derived from a unique marine organism that bloomed in the extinction aftermath and was probably the basis of the food chain in the Early Triassic oceans (Grice et al. 2005c). The C33 alkylcyclohexane is regarded as a biomarker index of the EPE event. It has an association with transgressive events and cooccurs with remains of spinose acritarchs Veryhachium and Micrhystridium, based on similarities in stratigraphic distribution within studied sections. Phytanylbenzene (Figure 5, structure XXI), 1-methyl-3-phytanylbenzene (structure XXII), and 2-phytanylnaphthalene (structure XXIII) have been identified in a number of sediment extracts from three Permian–Triassic boundary sections and show a distribution and trend similar to those of C33 alkylcyclohexane (Thomas & Barber 2004, Grice et al. 2005c). The discovery of the occurrence of phytanylbenzene as well as 4-methylated phytanylbenzenes was first reported by Sinninghe Damsté et al. (1988). These biomarkers have been reported in a few case studies, especially in evaporitic systems (Sinninghe Damsté et al. 1988, 1995; Grimalt et al. 1991). It has been proposed that phytanylbenzene and -toluenes are related to specific halophilic Archaea, based in particular on the correlations among the relative concentration of these biomarkers and various chroman ratios [as defined by Sinninghe Damsté et al. (1995)]. Their strong correlation with the C33 alkylcyclohexane is probably consistent with transgressive phases during and following the EPE event (Grice et al. 2005c). As is the case with C33 alkylcyclohexane, these compounds are absent in the GSSP section.\nIn summary, biomarker studies across the EPE provide exceptionally strong evidence that environmental conditions in both the marine and terrestrial realms were severely disrupted."

    "text": "The ETE was the fourth most acute extinction event of the Phanerozoic, and is well dated to 201.4 Myr ago (Payne & Kump 2007, Jourdan et al. 2009, Schoene et al. 2010, Blackburn et al. 2013). This event decimated biodiversity in marine and terrestrial realms. It was equivalent in magnitude to the ECE extinction; 40–50% of marine species were lost (Alroy et al. 2008).

Floral assemblages indicate up to a 90% species turnover in terrestrial megaflora (McElwain & Punyasena 2007). Studies of nonmarine vertebrates suggest a number of clades went extinct at or near the ETE (Benton 1993, Sahney et al. 2010, Benton et al. 2013), though the effect at local to regional scales appears variable (Cuny 1996, Olsen et al. 2002). Early studies suggested that marine reptiles suffered minor extinctions (Benton 1993), but more recent work found no evidence of elevated extinction rates in these groups (Benson et al. 2010), and aquatic basal vertebrates (i.e., fish, sensu lato) were apparently largely unaffected as well (McCune & Schaeffer 1986; Friedman & Sallan 2012).\nThe timing of extinction events and the relationships among the causative factors have been the focus of work spanning the past two decades. Multiple Triassic–Jurassic sections show evidence for marine regression followed by transgression across the boundary, and this sea-level change has been implicated in the extinctions (Newell 1967; Hallam 1995, 1997; Barattolo & Romano 2005). An isolated iridium anomaly located near the ETE in the Newark Supergroup of eastern North America has been interpreted as evidence for a bolide impact (Olsen et al. 2002), but converging lines of globally distributed evidence for an impact are lacking. However, the Rochechouart impact (202.7 ± 2.2 Ma; Schmieder et al. 2010) possibly contributed to a degraded Rhaetian environment without acting as a catastrophic ETE kill mechanism.\nInstead, one of the most extensive LIPs, the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, has been linked to the ETE (Marzoli et al. 1999, Whiteside et al. 2010) through rapid CO2-driven global warming, changes in ocean chemistry, and ocean acidification and deoxygenation (McElwain et al. 1999, Kidder & Worsley 2010, Richoz et al. 2012, Jaraula et al. 2013, Kasprak et al. 2015). Against a backdrop of elevated atmospheric pCO2 [calculated from stomatal indices (McElwain et al. 1999)], the extinction is coincident with a transient negative δ13Corg excursion, termed the initial carbon isotope excursion, considered by most to be a global marker recording perturbation to the global exchangeable carbon reservoirs. This horizon has been identified in marine strata (Ward et al. 2001, 2004; Williford et al. 2007; Pálfy et al. 2001; Hesselbo et al. 2002; Guex et al. 2004) and terrestrial strata (McElwain et al. 1999, Whiteside et al. 2010, Williford et al. 2014), including strata with fossil wood (Kannenberg & Poralla 1999). A protracted positive main excursion in the earliest Hettangian has also been identified. Compound-specific organic carbon isotope studies focusing on terrestrial plant-derived leaf waxes (n-alkanes) help confirm the link between the carbon isotopic excursion and atmospheric CO2 injection at the ETE (Whiteside et al. 2010, Jaraula et al. 2013, Williford et al. 2014). Further indications of a perturbation in the carbon cycle comes from evidence for intense heat stress and fire, identified in the form of biomarker PAHs such as retene (Figure 5, structure XXIV) and coronene (structure X) and compoundspecific stable isotopic compositions of biomarkers from the boundary section at Astartekløft, East Greenland (Williford et al. 2014). High concentrations of PAHs in a Danish-German basin sequence have been ascribed directly to the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, based on high coronene-to-benzo[a]pyrene ratios [up to 3.46 (van de Schootbrugge et al. 2009)].\nDecreasing δ13C and increasing δD (30 ) of plant wax lipids coincide with other evidence of ecosystem collapse, indicating that the crisis was complemented by intense but localized hydrological change (Williford et al. 2014). The co-occurrence of fossil charcoal (Belcher et al. 2010), high concentrations of combustion-ascribed PAHs, and a monoaromatic diterpenoid related to gymnosperm resin derivatives (Figure 5, structure XXV) in the same time interval marked by abrupt plant diversity loss and maximum plant turnover strongly supports the role\nwww.annualreviews.org • Biomarkers and Mass Extinction Events 595\nA nn\nu.

Anomalously high concentrations of the resin occur exclusively in samples from the boundary bed, signifying that environmental stress factors leading to peak plant extinction and intensified resin production developed at that time. More generally, these findings also suggest that such plant resin derivatives may be biomarkers indicative of terrestrial ecosystem stress.\nIn the marine environment, biomarker and other evidence indicates that the deoxygenation of ocean waters in the Panthalassic realm altered nutrient inventories and led to the shoaling of hydrogen sulfide–rich waters and the development of PZE (Figure 4) (Kasprak et al. 2015). Kasprak et al. argued that PZE disrupted nutrient cycling and altered food chains essential for the survival of marine ecosystems, creating a condition similar to the mass extinction at the Permian– Triassic boundary.\nWhereas the Kasprak et al. study is the only report of biomarker evidence for the ETE from an open-ocean setting, biomarkers preserved in shallow marine/marginal basin sediments from the Tethyan realm have been much more extensively studied and highlight the variability of environmental change associated with the ETE. Information for nutrient cycle deposition at St. Audries Bay derives from interpretation of micropaleontological data (van de Schootbrugge et al. 2007), which suggest a rise in prasinophytes following the extinction event. Additional evidence from Chlorobi-derived biomarkers indicates episodic and persistent intervals of PZE (Figures 4 and 5) ( Jaraula et al. 2013), which are associated with perturbations of the carbon and sulfur cycles. Euxinic conditions recorded at Pinhay are derived from pyrite framboids and faunal data (Wignall 2001). The Frick Swiss Jura section provides geochemical evidence consistent with PZE and increased cyanobacterial production (from the occurrence of 13C-enriched isorenieratene derivatives and 2β-methylhopanes, respectively) in middle Hettangian samples (Schwab & Spangenberg 2007). Numerous sections from the Eiberg Basin, Austria, have recently been investigated by Bonis et al. (2009, 2010) within a geochemical and palynological framework. Data from these studies support redox shifts through the Triassic–Jurassic in this area, and based on carbon isotopes and palynology these authors proposed that terrigenous input drove bottom waters to anoxia. Bonis et al. (2009) demonstrated that the widespread occurrence of prasinophytes is concurrent with excursions in the bulk carbon isotope signature, supporting hypotheses for disrupted nutrient cycles. Sections at Csővár, Hungary (Haas et al. 2010), show a dramatic prasinophyte bloom that is concurrent with a negative carbon isotope excursion, also suggestive of nutrient disruption. Haas et al. (2010) also reported a bloom of trilete spores from land plants concurrent with the prasinophyte bloom. This was interpreted to represent coupled changes in marine and terrestrial realms driven by the same forcing mechanism and is consistent with the notion that global warming was a major driver of environmental disruption during the ETE in both marine and terrestrial settings. Geochemical and paleontological data from Roswinkel, Luxemburg, and from Mingolsheim and Mariental, Germany (Richoz et al. 2012), demonstrate a shift from oxygenated shales in the late Rhaetian to anoxic shales with abundant evidence for the occurrence of PZE in the Hettangian. These euxinic depositional conditions coincide with increased prasinophyte dominance, consistent with a nutrient disruption scenario, and are similar in chronology to the record from the open-ocean Kennecott Point section (Kasprak et al. 2015). Although the southern German site of Mingolsheim did not present evidence for nutrient disruption or euxinia—leading the authors to propose that anoxia, stratification, and euxinia affected only the marginal marine basins of northwest Europe—the newer data of Kasprak et al. (2015) from open-ocean sites in the Panthalassic realm call this into question.\nThus biomarker evidence associated with the ETE provides strong evidence that, similar to what occurred during the EPE, mass extinction followed parallel, coupled, large-magnitude perturbations in both marine and terrestrial environments. Moreover, global warming associated\n596 Whiteside · Grice\nA nn\nu. R\nev .

    "heading": "THE LATE DEVONIAN EXTINCTION",
    "text": "The Late Devonian witnessed one of the largest mass extinctions in Earth’s history (Figure 1), ultimately wiping out the extensive reef systems prominent throughout that era (Sepkoski 1986, 1993; Walliser 1996; Bambach 2006). The most pronounced extinction occurred at the Frasnian– Famennian (F-F) boundary; however, there were also distinct biodiversity crises towards the end of the Givetian and Famennian, as well as earlier in the Frasnian (Walliser 1996, Caplan & Bustin 1999, Aboussalam & Becker 2001). Reef-building communities and associated fauna in tropical, shallow marine settings comprised the most severely affected organisms, whereas terrestrial ecosystems were only marginally impacted (Copper 1986, Fagerstrom 1994, McGhee 1996).\nThe cause(s) and nature of the extinctions, whether they be distinct events, several smaller pulses, or a gradual diversity decline, continue to be debated (e.g., McGhee 1996, House 2002, Racki 2005). Hypotheses range from bolide impacts (McLaren 1970, 1983; Sandberg et al. 2002; Ellwood et al. 2003) to volcanism to climate change and rapid sea-level fluctuations that developed in response to various parameters, including atmospheric CO2 reduction due to the rise of terrestrial plants (Murphy et al. 2000, Courtillot & Renne 2003, McGhee 2005, Algeo & Scheckler 2010). The expansion of terrestrial vegetation and the associated higher nutrient input from enhanced weathering and soil formation may have further contributed to widespread anoxia and eutrophication in Late Devonian oceans; these phenomena in particular have been linked to the F-F extinction ( Joachimski & Buggisch 1993, Bond et al. 2004, Algeo & Scheckler 2010). Most research has focused on the investigation of the F-F and end-Famennian extinctions, whereas studies of earlier late Givetian and early to middle Frasnian events are comparatively rare.\nAs described above, several Phanerozoic mass extinction events have been associated with oceanic anoxic events, during which a stagnant water column leads to persistent stratification, widespread anoxia, and PZE (e.g., Grice et al. 2005a,b; Summons et al. 2006; Jenkyns 2010; Nabbefeld et al. 2010a,d; Jaraula et al. 2013). PZE may have also contributed to the Late Devonian extinctions, as evidence of this condition has been reported in Middle to Late Devonian sediments and crude oils from various locations, including North America (Summons & Powell 1986, 1987; Requejo et al. 1992; Brown & Kenig 2004; Maslen et al. 2009), Europe (Marynowski et al. 2000, 2011; Joachimski et al. 2001; Marynowski & Filipiak 2007), and Western Australia (Maslen et al. 2009; Melendez et al. 2013a,b; Tulipani et al. 2015a).\nMuch of the ancient marine life of this time has been captured in the extensive and wellpreserved Devonian reef systems of the Western Australian Canning Basin (e.g., Playford et al. 2009). The location is particularly well known for the excellent preservation of macrofossils (Long & Trinajstic 2010) and molecular fossils (Melendez et al. 2013a,b) in sections of the Gogo Formation, the middle Givetian to middle Frasnian basin facies. Further, recent research shows that PZE played a pivotal role in the exceptional preservation of soft tissue and biomarkers (Melendez et al. 2013a). Most importantly, it was demonstrated that the oldest intact sterols in a crustacean had been preserved for some 380 Myr within a Devonian concretion (Melendez et al. 2013b). This exceptional preservation of original biomass is attributed to microbially induced carbonate encapsulation, which suppressed decomposition and transformation and thereby extended sterol occurrences in the geological record by 250 Myr. A suite of diagenetic transformation products of sterols was also identified, showing the exceptional coexistence of biomolecules and geomolecules in the same sample. The co-occurrence of steroids in a diagenetic continuum ranging from sterols to aromatic steroids was attributed to microbially mediated eogenetic activities.

In addition to the most pronounced biodiversity losses at the F-F boundary and the end-Famennian, there are also less extensively documented extinction pulses in the middle to late Givetian and the Frasnian. In a recent study, Tulipani et al. (2015a) used palynological, elemental, molecular, and stable isotope analyses to investigate a sedimentary record of reef systems from this time period in the Western Australia Canning Basin. These data generally show the sediments near the Givetian– Frasnian (G-F) boundary preserve a distinct interval of more intense biotic stress, particularly for reef-builders, than that revealed in the Frasnian sediments. Pristane/phytane ratios, gammacerane indices, Chlorobi biomarkers, δDkerogen, and chroman ratios describe a change from a restricted marine paleoenvironment with an anoxic/euxinic hypolimnion toward a presumably more open marine setting with a vertically mixed oxic to suboxic water column. Simultaneous excursions in δ13C profiles of carbonates, organic matter, and hydrocarbons in the older sediments reflect the stratification-induced enhancement of organic matter recycling by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Alterations in sterane distributions and elevated abundances of methyltrimethyltridecylchromans and perylene indicate an increased terrigenous nutrient input via riverine influx, which would have promoted stratification, phytoplankton blooms, and the development of lower–water column anoxia. It remains uncertain whether the paleoenvironmental conditions around the G-F boundary reflect a local or global extinction event. However, these data suggest contributions from higher plant expansion and PZE to the Late Devonian extinctions, consistent with three previous hypotheses. More generally, this work potentially aids in the understanding of variations in Devonian reef margin and platform-top architecture, which are of potential relevance to petroleum exploration and the development of Devonian hydrocarbon resources globally."

    "heading": "THE END-ORDOVICIAN EXTINCTION",
    "text": "The remarkable rise in marine biodiversity associated with the Great Ordovician Biodiversity Event (Sepkoski 1981, Droser et al. 1997, Webby et al. 2004, Harper 2006) was interrupted by a massive extinction at the end-Ordovician, with an estimated 85% loss of marine species and 26% loss of families ( Jablonski 1991, Sepkoski 1996, Sheehan 2001) (Figure 1). Extinction proceeded in two distinct pulses (Sheehan 2001), both linked in various ways to glaciation of the southern supercontinent, Gondwana, during the terminal Ordovician Hirnantian Age (444.7–443.4 Ma). Glacially induced cooling and oxygenation are two of the many suggested kill mechanisms for this extinction, but a general consensus is lacking. It is notable that the end-Ordovician glaciation is the only known glacial episode that appears to have coincided with a major mass extinction of marine life.\nThe Late Ordovician witnessed atmospheric pCO2 8–16 times preindustrial levels (Berner & Kothavala 2001) (Figure 1) and warm surface seawater temperatures. Late Ordovician cooling punctuated this warm climate state, although the magnitude and timing are debatable (e.g., Brenchley et al. 1994, Finnegan et al. 2011). Expansion and retreat of high–southern latitude ice sheets in the Hirnantian are associated with a 3–6 positive carbon isotope excursion (Brenchley et al. 1994).\nAtmospheric oxygen was likely lower than at present, dissolved inorganic oxidant availability (i.e., sulfate) stayed lower than modern levels (Gill et al. 2007), and a significant portion of continental landmass was subaqueous (Figure 2). The fusion of elevated temperatures, extensive epeiric seas, and reduced dissolved inorganic oxidant concentrations probably rendered the Late Ordovician susceptible to the development of quasi-estuarine circulation and vast oxygen\n598 Whiteside · Grice\nA nn\nu.

Amplified denitrification within Late Ordovician oxygen minimum zones could have driven nitrogen limitation of marine ecosystems (Finney et al. 2007, LaPorte et al. 2009; but see also Saltzman 2005), a situation with possible direct implications of reduced sulfate abundance (Ratti et al. 2011). If decreased seawater pH due to increased pCO2 inhibits nitrification (Beman et al. 2011), further influence on nitrogen limitation is possible in lower Paleozoic marine settings. Limitation of nutrients potentially caused a switch to phosphorus limitation in intervals characterized by carbon isotope variability and perhaps cooler global conditions (e.g., Saltzman 2005).\nBiomarkers provide some useful constraints on environmental conditions associated with the EOE. The Hirnantian glacial maximum presents both marked peaks in hopane/sterane ratio and a decrease in average ratio below the pre-Hirnantian mean, perhaps related to disrupted eukaryotic productivity and increased nutrient availability, respectively. Compounds derived from aerobic methanotrophic bacteria (3β-methylhopane) occur in high relative abundance across the paleotropics and reveal an overall positive relationship with paleotemperature proxies (Rohrssen et al. 2012). This implies increased methane cycling during warm intervals, which might provide an important positive feedback mechanism on climate during extended intervals of early Paleozoic time. Sea-level fall may have provided the trigger, with ensuing anoxia serving as a kill mechanism. Much more work with biomarkers and other paleoenvironmental indicators will be needed to evaluate these possibilities."

    "text": "The ECE at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary (∼66 Ma) is unique among the five mass extinction events discussed here in that it has clear ties to a meteorite impact (Schulte et al. 2010) (Figure 2). It is associated with 76% species extinction (Vilhena et al. 2013) among calcifying plankton (>90% of species), including planktic foraminifera (Smit 1982, Stott & Kennett 1990, Liu & Olsson 1992, Berggren & Norris 1997, Molina et al. 1998) and calcareous nannoplankton (Pospichal & Wise 1990, Bown 2005, Fuqua et al. 2008). In contrast, most noncalcifying pelagic organisms, such as diatoms, radiolarians (Harwood 1988, Hollis et al. 2003), dinoflagellates (Brinkhuis et al. 1998), benthic foraminifera (e.g., Thomas 1990a,b; Alegret & Thomas 2005), and ostracodes (e.g., Majoran et al. 1997, Boomer 1999, Elewa 2002) escaped extinction. The K-Pg boundary is characterized by a sudden 1–3 negative excursion in δ13C. This can be interpreted as a collapse of the surface-to-bottom δ13C gradient, indicative of a major alteration in marine primary productivity levels and the biological pump. The δ13C gradient did not fully recover until hundreds of thousands to a few million years after the extinction event. However, plankton-dependent benthic foraminifera did not suffer mass extinction, indicating there must have been a sufficient level of export production to support their community. Furthermore, the presence of C27−29 algal steranes, C30 4-methyl steranes and dinosteranes, and bacterial triterpenoids indicates marine organic matter in the wake of the extinction and suggests that photosynthesis, although reduced, continued (Sepúlveda et al. 2009).\nSoot and charcoal are found in above-normal concentrations in K-Pg boundary layers, raising the possibility that widespread wildfires raged in the aftermath of the meteorite impact, perhaps on a global scale (Wolbach et al. 1990). Increases to as much as 150 times normal levels of pyrosynthetic PAHs, such as coronene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, and benzo[e]pyrene (Gilmour & Guenther 1988, Venkatesan & Dahl 1989, Arinobu et al. 1999), and increases in fullerenes (e.g., Becker et al. 1995) are also consistent with widespread wildfires during this time interval. However, a global distribution of wildfire is most reliably indicated by the presence of soot and charcoal in deep-sea K-Pg sections [e.g., Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 465 in the central Pacific;\nwww.annualreviews.org • Biomarkers and Mass Extinction Events 599\nA nn\nu.

Using mass balance arguments, Arinobu et al. (1999) estimated that 18–24% of the total aboveground terrestrial biomass would have to have been instantaneously combusted in order to produce this abrupt isotopic shift.\nThe fact that extinctions in the marine environment appear to largely affect the upper ocean, and even there seem to affect primarily calcifying organisms, suggests that environmental conditions in the oceans were less extreme and less pervasive than those associated with the other mass extinctions. However, the δ13C excursion still requires explanation; at present, it is thought to be related to some form of disruption in marine primary productivity. This could be examined in future work through the use of an appropriate suite of biomarkers, for example, by looking for more organism-specific evidence for disruption of food chains, or changes in nitrogen fixation."

    "heading": "SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK",
    "text": "When mass extinction events are examined from the viewpoint of biomarkers, the ECE differs from the other four large extinction events in that there is no evidence of PZE from anoxygenic green sulfur bacteria and oceanic primary production did not shift to widespread dominance of cyanobacteria and algal picoplankton. Calcareous groups (foraminifera, nannoplankton) appear to have been especially affected at the K-Pg boundary, and siliceous and organic-walled phytoplankton less so. The other four large extinction events are all associated with episodes of dysoxic to euxinic marine conditions that led to shifts in the availability of biolimiting nutrients (Figure 2). For the ETE and EPE, a mass extinction scenario whereby flood-basalt volcanism induced greenhouse warming is commonly accepted. For the LDE, a similar scenario is suspected, though in conjunction with the evolutionary innovation of the initial arrival of plants.\nThis review shows that qualitative changes in biomarkers across extinction events are becoming well constrained. One of the tasks ahead will be to ask how changes in primary production can be quantified across extinction events. Overall, these data demonstrate the potential for biomarkers to inform the paleoenvironment, ecology, and underlying mechanisms of mass extinction events at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. As analytical methods improve, more widespread application of biomarker techniques to the older mass extinctions (e.g., the EOE and LDE) should greatly improve our understanding of these major earth history events, and further studies of the EPE, ETE, and ECE will help refine the processes that underlie their causes and effects."

  "abstractText": "The history of life on Earth is punctuated by a series of mass extinction episodes that vary widely in their magnitude, duration, and cause. Biomarkers are a powerful tool for the reconstruction of historical environmental conditions and can therefore provide insights into the cause and responses to ancient extinction events. In examining the five largest mass extinctions in the geological record, investigators have used biomarkers to elucidate key processes such as eutrophy, euxinia, ocean acidification, changes in hydrological balance, and changes in atmospheric CO2. By using these molecular fossils to understand how Earth and its ecosystems have responded to unusual environmental activity during these extinctions, models can be made to predict how Earth will respond to future changes in its climate. 581 Click here to view this article's online features: • Download figures as PPT slides • Navigate linked references • Download citations • Explore related articles • Search keywords ANNUAL REVIEWS Further A nn u.
