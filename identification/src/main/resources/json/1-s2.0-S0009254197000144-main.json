    "heading": "2. Curve construction",
    "text": "The principal assumptions underlying construction of the curve of seawater 87Srr 86 Sr are that at any given time the oceans contain well mixed Sr isotopes and that marine carbonate, sulfate, and phosphate samples will record the seawater 87Srr 86 Sr. Measurements on modern seawater and shell material show that open oceans contain per87 86 Ž .fectly mixed Srr Sr within measurement error\nand we assumed that the oceans were isotopically mixed throughout the Phanerozoic. Agreement in the results from widely separated ancient rocks of the same age support this assumption.\nDetermination of the seawater value for particular times in the past is based on analyses of marine samples of known age. Consistency of 87Srr 86 Sr values among samples of the same age is considered the best guide to the true seawater ratio for a particular time. Individual data points are plotted in a coordinate system of 87Srr 86 Sr versus numerical age Ž .Fig. 2 . Age assessments based on time–stratigraphic or biostratigraphic information are converted to estimates of numerical age using the time scale of Ž .Harland et al. 1990 . Specific numerical age assignments have been made by linear extrapolation. Sample identification, location, assigned age and analytical results are presented in the appendices.\nOur original field criteria for collection were: a clearly marine environment of deposition, and a low Žterrigenous content. The terrigenous component as .insoluble residue might contain radiogenic Sr that\ncould potentially exchange with the marine Sr to yield an anomalous high ratio. However, no direct relationships between the retention of marine values and the terrigenous or Sr content could be deter-\nmined. The percentage of insoluble residue and Sr content are no longer used as criteria of retention.\nExamination of the data points on the 1982 curve shows clearly that there is greater scatter of determined ratios with increasing age. We now consider that nearly all the scatter in the isotopic values is due to exchange of original Sr with waters in pore fluid and not because of the equilibration of Sr in detrital minerals with seawater Sr in carbonate minerals. This is supported by a systematic increase in Mn and Ž .Fe in limestones Denison et al., 1994b and oysters Ž .and belemnites Jones et al., 1994a,b that yield\naberrant Sr isotope values. Lime–mud-supported\nrocks proved most likely to have retained the original seawater ratio because they most effectively exclude foreign pore fluids. The actual estimated path of seawater Sr in 1982 was based on petrographic judgment as to which samples were considered most reliable and on the consistency of isotope results from restricted stratigraphic intervals.\nThe accurate definition of the 87Srr 86 Sr in seawater with time is dependent on three major factors: analytical accuracy, retention of the original ratio, and the precision of the biostratigraphic assignment. With modern mass spectrometers and operator persistence, analytical accuracy has largely been elimi-\nnated as a major cause of error. Retention of the seawater ratio and the accuracy of age assignment are geologically determinative factors that are difficult to quantify. Diagenetic alteration is clearly the major cause of scatter during times when the seawater 87Srr 86 Sr is changing slowly. There is no reason to believe that it is less of a problem when the ratio is changing rapidly. But during times of rapid seawater change, diagenetic alteration of the original ratio can be difficult to recognize. During these times, accuracy of biostratigraphic assignment is crucial in the definition of the seawater 87Srr 86 Sr. An age assignment error of \"2% is difficult to recognize in the Cenozoic but has tremendous impact in the Paleozoic.\nMajor and trace element distribution can be used to identify limestones that are most likely to retain 87 86 Žthe original seawater Srr Sr Denison et al., .1994b . This allows suites of analyzed samples to be\nevaluated independently for potential reliability. Using the criteria developed from late Paleozoic shelf carbonates, middle Paleozoic limestone with SrrMn )2.0 and with Mn ppm-300 are considered the most favorable samples.\nThe ideal definition of seawater Sr variation is based upon several accessible, geographically separated, well studied stratigraphic sections that represent near-continuous sedimentation over an extended time interval. These sections should contain a diverse diagnostic fauna and abundant limestones with well distributed mud-supported intervals. Sections of this type are not common in the Silurian and Devonian of North America. The curve construction is therefore pieced together from samples collected at widely separated sections. Some of the units that meet many of our favored criteria contain limestones with inexplicably low Sr contents. A number of our most Žsuitable samples i.e., low Mn, high Sr, mud-sup.ported limestones are from European localities and\nthese have correlation uncertainties with our North American sample suite.\nThe middle Paleozoic curve here is defined on the basis of whole-rock limestone samples. Only two fossil samples were analyzed. Conodonts and well preserved brachiopods have been used to define the Žseawater ratio e.g., Popp et al., 1986; Ruppel et al., .1996 . But studies have shown that comparative\nresults from brachiopods and conodonts do not in-\nŽ .variably agree e.g., Cummins and Elderfield, 1994 . Limestones samples must be chosen with care, as is true for any sample for analysis. We believe that whole-rock limestones are capable of accurately defining the path of seawater Sr variation with time. This is supported by the agreement of Sr isotope Žresults from conodonts Martin and Macdougall, . Ž .1995 , brachiopods Popp et al., 1986 and limeŽ .stones Denison et al., 1994a of Permian age.\nThere are several reports of short-term, smallscale, slope reversals in the Paleozoic seawater curve Že.g., Douthit et al., 1993; Ruppel et al., 1996; .Cummins and Elderfield, 1994 . Slope reversals may occur during the middle Paleozoic but cannot be defined with our data. We have chosen to draw the curve to emphasize the long-term seawater 87Srr 86 Sr trends.\nAn inclusive envelope or band has been superimposed on the distribution of data points. The width of the inclusive envelope has been substantially decreased from the original 1982 plot. This decrease reflects our increased ability to identify samples that have undergone extensive alteration. For the middle Ž .Paleozoic Fig. 2 this band is defined by upper and lower lines that enclose 58% of the data points. For any given time the correct seawater ratio probably lies within this envelope. The heavy line drawn through the band represents our estimate of the actual seawater ratio at any time. This judgment line is drawn near the base of the data points because diagenesis in shelf rocks most often leads to an increase in the 87Srr 86 Sr. The degree of isotopic consistency among samples of the same age determines our confidence in the estimate of the actual path of seawater 87Srr 86 Sr. The scatter in the data reflects diagenetic alteration of the original seawater ratio andror error in the age assignment."

    "heading": "3. Sample preparation and analysis",
    "text": "Data for the seawater curve have been compiled over a twenty-year period. During this time a variety of sample preparation techniques were employed. The samples were dissolved with either 1 N hydrochloric or nitric acid, and Sr was separated from other elements either by means of ion-exchange Žcolumns or by precipitation using nitric acid Otto et\n.al., 1988 . Approximately 20% of the middle Paleozoic samples originally separated using ion-exchange columns have been reanalyzed using the nitric acid precipitation technique. No systematic difference has been detected.\nIsotope ratios were measured by comparison with Ž .standard SrCO NBS SRM 987 for which a ratio of3 0.71014 has been assumed. Measurements were made using a second-order double-focusing Nier– X ŽJohnson-type mass spectrometer with a 608, 13 33.0 .cm radius of curvature magnetic sector and a 918, X Ž .15.8 40.1 cm radius of curvature electric sector. Masses 85, 86, 87, and 88 are collected simultaneŽously in four separate Faraday cups Burke and . 87 86Hetherington, 1984 . Srr Sr values are corrected for the presence of 87Rb and have been normalized to 87Srr 88 Srs0.1194. Precision is estimated to be \"0.00005 or better at the 95% confidence level Ž .Burke et al., 1982 . We also report the Sr isotopic ratio of samples as the difference from modern seaŽ .water Dsw . The result allows direct comparison of results from any laboratory. The calculation is simple:\n87 86Dsws Srr Sr unknownŽ y86 Srr 86 Sr modern seawater =105.\nOur weighted mean of modern seawater 87Srr 86 Srs0.709073\"3 is based on more than 100 measurements of modern shells. Thus, a measured Sr isotope value of 0.70800 yields a Dsw Žw x 5.value of y107, i.e. 0.70800y0.70907 =10 . The Dsw for the assumed 87Srr 86 Sr value of Ž .NBSrSRM 987 0.71014 is q106.7\"0.3."

    "text": "Twenty-four samples were used to define the 87 86 Ž .Srr Sr of Silurian seawater by Burke et al. 1982 , less than one sample per million years. Thirty two Ž .samples are used here Appendix A , the least number of samples used for any geologic period. Nearly all the samples originally used were from Europe. All analyses are on whole-rock samples. A total of 137 Silurian samples were analyzed in the original study, including an extensive suite from North America. But only about one sample in four contained\n)200 ppm Sr and -10% insoluble residue, the limiting values used by Burke et al. Only 9 of 110 samples, for which we have complete chemistry, have more than 300 ppm Sr.\nThe oldest Silurian samples analyzed here yield a Ž .value near 0.70800 Dsw y107 . Late Ordovician\nvalues are significantly lower than this value. Our oldest Silurian limestone samples are about 4 Ma younger than the Ordovician–Silurian boundary. Therefore, the boundary ratio is probably less than Ž .this, perhaps near 0.70793 Dsw y114 . The seawater ratio is interpreted to rise consistently throughout the Silurian. Although more than twenty limestones of Llandoverian age were collected and analyzed, only one contained as much as 200 ppm Sr and -10% insoluble residue. By early Wenlockian time Ž .the value is estimated to be 0.70821 Dsw y86 and Ž .continues to rise to reach 0.70842 Dsw y65 near\nthe end of the Wenlockian. The increase continues to 87 86 Ž .near Srr Srs0.70867 Dsw y40 at the end of\nthe Ludlovian. Here the curve appears to flatten to Ž .reach a maximum value near 0.70871 Dsw y36 at\nthe Silurian–Devonian boundary. A value this high would not be reached again in seawater for nearly 400 Ma, in the Late Miocene.\nA total of 63 Silurian samples from Sweden were originally examined, of which only 17 met the - 10% insoluble residue and 200 ppm Sr criteria and were analyzed. Later, these 17 samples were analyzed for all major and trace elements. Only two Wenlockian limestones have a SrrMn)2.0 and - 300 ppm Mn, our criteria for retention of the seawater 87Srr 86 Sr developed using a different late Paleozoic sample suite. It is only these two lime mudŽ .stones of the original 63 from the Halla beds Ž .Appendix A that are considered to have retained the original ratio.\nThere are few published 87Srr 86 Sr values for the ŽSilurian. The results from Kovach in Lee Roark, .1989 show the same shape for the curve. We estimate from the Kovach plot a 87Srr 86 Sr of 0.70782 Ž .Dsw y125 for a beginning Silurian value, considŽerably lower than our estimate of 0.70792 Dsw .y115 . The end Silurian value of Kovach is esti-\nmated to be within error of ours. Bertram et al. Ž . 86 861992 determined Srr Sr values for Silurian phosphatic material from Sweden, the UK, Czechoslovakia, Norway and Illinois. Using careful\ndissolution techniques, they were able to obtain consistent results from conodonts with a low thermal maturity. Results from their phosphatic material with Sr concentrations between 3300 and 3800 ppm fall within the range of our results. The Silurian seawater Ž .strontium line no data points of Smalley et al. Ž .1994 is offset below ours but is in the approximate same range of values.\nThe Silurian sample suite contains the lowest average Sr content of any time period we have analyzed. Many of the anomalous low Sr samples are from widely separated localities in North America, Great Britain, Sweden and Germany. This could be the consequence of unfortunate selective sampling or some nonuniformitarian difference in Silurian carbonate formation. It is most likely due to diagenetic stripping of trace elements during extensive exposure. Most, if not all, of our samples are from shelfrplatform localities. This apparent low Sr Ž .anomaly is not universal. Wang et al. 1993 analyzed a suite of basal Silurian deeper water limestones from a transitional basin to shelf locality in the Selwyn Basin in Canada. These limestones have normal to high Sr contents and high SrrMn ratios.\nThe estimated path of Silurian seawater Sr is subject to substantial revision. The revision will require a much wider and better chosen sample suite than was available in our study. In spite of the limitations, we believe that the shape of the curve is essentially correct in defining the long-term variation and that the values for the time subdivision are close to correct."

    "heading": "5. Devonian",
    "text": "Forty four sample analyses were used by Burke et Ž .al. 1982 to define the variation in seawater 87Srr 86 Sr during the Devonian. After a reevaluation of the original sample suite, 1 was deleted and 11 Ž .added for a total of 54 used here Appendix B . One brachiopod and a bulk conodont sample were analyzed, the remainder of the samples are whole rocks.\nThe Early Devonian data from New York are thought to be particularly good. Consistent results from this high-quality sample suite indicates a beginŽ .ning of Devonian value near 0.70871 Dsw y36 . By the end of the Pragian, the value has fallen to\nŽ .near 0.70811 Dsw y97 . The seawater ratio continues to fall rapidly through the Pragian and Emsian to reach a low in the Eifelian and Givetian of near Ž .0.70772 Dsw y135 . The curve rises through the Late Devonian but the\nexact path is uncertain from our data. Burke et al. Ž . 87 861982 showed the highest Srr Sr values in the mid-Late Devonian. Results from other workers Ž .chiefly Lee Roark, 1989 indicate that the maximum occurs near the Mississippian–Devonian boundary and that the path of the seawater curve in the Late Devonian is considerably lower than originally Ž .drawn. Data from Carpenter et al. 1991 support this lower path. Evaluation of our later Devonian sample suite shows that the rocks are characterized by grain-supported textures, non-marine cements, extensive recrystallization and have trace element distributions that indicate diagenetic alteration. We therefore defer to the data of other workers and estimate the path to rise from a low in the Givetian to reach a Ž .value near 0.70805 Dsw y102 at the end of the Devonian. The highest ratio is near or at the boundary and the 87Srr 86 Sr appears to fall throughout the early Mississippian.\nŽ .Kovach in Lee Roark, 1989 appears to agree with our earliest Devonian value. His estimated MidŽ .dle Devonian ratio of about 0.70770 Dsw y137 is close to our Dsw y135 value. We estimate a Late 87 86 Ž .Devonian Srr Sr of 0.70817 Dsw y90 and an Ž .end Devonian value of 0.70812 Dsw y95 from the Ž .Kovach plot. DeJonghe et al. 1989 obtained 0.70820 Ž .Dsw y87 for Frasnian limestones in Belgium. Lee Ž .Roark 1989 has Middle Devonian values close to Žours and an end Devonian value near 0.70803 Dsw . Ž .y104 . Carpenter et al. 1991 obtained consistent Ž .values near 0.70795 Dsw y112 on middle FrasŽ .nian marine cements. Popp et al. 1986 reports an 87 87 Ž .Srr Sr of 0.70771 Dsw y136 on a Givetian Ž .brachiopod from Ontario. Gao 1993 analyzed four late Lochkovian Bois d’ArcrHaragan limestone Ž .samples from Oklahoma SrrMn)2.0 with a mean 87 86 Ž .Srr Sr of 0.70839\"1 Dsw y68 . We collected a total of 18 Bois d’ArcrHaragan samples from various Oklahoma localities, including the quarry used by Gao. Only 2 of the 18 samples contain as much as 200 ppm Sr with a SrrMn)2.0 and these 87 86 Ž .yielded a mean Srr Sr of 0.70853 Dsw y54 . While this is significantly different from the values\nreported by Gao, it is in the range expected for a formation of Lochkovian age. The Devonian seawaŽ .ter strontium line no data points of Smalley et al. Ž .1994 is well above the results from all other workers.\nŽ . 87 86Diener et al. 1996 determined the Srr Sr for Middle Devonian seawater using skeletal material. Ž .They, like Cummins and Elderfield 1994 , found conodonts that yielded higher values than braŽchiopods. They show a value near 0.70802 Dsw . Ž .y110 in the Emsian falling to 070772 Dsw y135\nin early Eifelian. The results range from about Ž .0.70777 to 0.70767 Dsw y130 to y140 through Ž .the Givetian then rise to 0.70797 Dsw y105 in the mid-Frasnian. Their 145 analyses show the curve to be essentially flat through Givetian and Eifelian time. Their analyses also show apparent fine structure that cannot be seen in our data set. The eight points plotted in our Fig. 2 are taken from the mean of their Ž .results their fig. 9 . Considering the problems regarding intercontinental correlation and the differences in sample type and treatment, the agreement with our best line in Fig. 2 is considered good.\nThe general curve shape and isotopic values for the Devonian are believed to be reasonably accurate. Except in earliest Devonian, we lack suites of petrographically and chemically favorable samples. We also lack samples from extended sections and are required to piece the curve together using samples from widely separated sections with all the correlation problems that this entails.\n6. Possible controls on the 87Srr 86Sr in middle Paleozoic seawater\nSeawater Sr isotope changes are driven by the difference in the contribution by ocean and continental sources. The area, age and composition of crystalline rocks exposed to erosion controls the radiogenic contribution to the oceans. The extent of oceanic volcanism, directly or indirectly, controls the contribution of low ratio Sr. Both high and low ratio Sr reservoirs contribute constantly to the seas. Increases and decreases in the seawater Sr isotope ratio are caused by the dominance of one source.\nDuring highstands less of the continent is exposed to contribute radiogenic Sr. The simplest model\nwould, therefore, call for the 87Srr 86 Sr of seawater to fall during highstands and rise during lowstands. Ž .Leggett et al. 1981 interpret a lowstand at the Ordovician–Silurian boundary with sealevel rising through the Wenlockian and lowering through the Pridolian. There is general agreement for a WenlockŽ .ian highstand Hallam, 1992 . Sealevel is thought to Ž .rise during the Devonian Johnson et al., 1985 or,\nalternatively, may drop in the earlier Devonian and Ž .rise later House, 1983 .\nMiddle Paleozoic Sr isotope variation suggests alternating dominance of oceanic and continental sources. This curious porpoising through all the Paleozoic, in contrast to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic curve shape, has been used to suggest that the fundamental balance between oceans and continents Žchanged at the end of the Paleozoic Denison et al., .1994a . It is not just the extent of the epicontinental\nseas but the climate and age and composition of the exposed crystalline rocks that control radiogenic contribution. The system is complicated and it is difficult to tie the seawater Sr rises and falls to specific geologic events. Certainly the scenarios for sealevel changes do not appear to have the expected effect on seawater Sr. The explanation for the apparent disparŽ .ity must lie in the unseen oceans. Ronov et al. 1980 show a substantial increase in continental volcanism during the Devonian that can be used to infer oceanic activity. Late Devonian is a time of continental flooding, but it is also a time of stability and of anoxic, stratified intercratonic seas. This stability and sedimentary uniformity suggests oceanic quiescence. It would appear that the level of oceanic volcanic activity may control the seawater 87Srr 86 Sr changes regardless of continental contributions. If this is true, only in Early Devonian time was there substantial oceanic volcanism during the middle Paleozoic."

  "abstractText": "87 86 Ž . The estimated path of seawater Srr Sr during the Silurian and Devonian is based on 86 analyses 84 whole rocks presented here and in other published results. The seawater Srr Sr rose steadily throughout the Silurian from a poorly Ž . 87 86 constrained value near 0.70793 Dsw y114 at the Ordovician–Silurian boundary. The Srr Sr value at the Silurian–DeŽ . 87 86 vonian boundary is near 0.70871 Dsw y36 based on an earliest Devonian limestone suite from New York. The Srr Sr Ž . falls through the Early Devonian to reach a low near 0.70772 Dsw y135 in the Eifelian and Givetian and rises to near Ž . 87 86 0.70803 Dsw y104 in Famennian time. The seawater Srr Sr at the Devonian–Mississippian boundary is estimated to Ž . 87 86 be near 0.70805 Dsw y102 . The middle Paleozoic sample suite is judged less suitable for defining seawater Srr Sr than those from other Paleozoic periods. The middle Paleozoic seawater Srr Sr variation indicates domination of continental Sr contributions during the Ž . Silurian and later Devonian. The high ratio continental Sr contribution is controlled by the climate and the area, age and Ž . composition of exposed crystalline rocks. The dominance of the oceanic low ratio Sr during the Early and part of Middle Devonian is coincident with a reported increase in continental volcanism. The estimated rise and fall of sealevel, leading to flooding or exposure of the continents, does not appear to control seawater Srr Sr during the middle Paleozoic.",
