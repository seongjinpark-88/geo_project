Frank\nKeywords: Carnian Humid Episode carbon isotopes marine anoxia climate warming Wrangellia flood basalt large igneous provinces\nThe Carnian Humid Episode (CHE), also known as the Carnian Pluvial Event, and associated biotic changes are major enigmas of the Mesozoic record in western Tethys. We show that the CHE also occurred in eastern Tethys (South China), suggestive of a much more widespread and probably global climate perturbation. Oxygen isotope records from conodont apatite indicate a double-pulse warming event. The CHE coincided with an initial warming of 4 ◦C. This was followed by a transient cooling period and then a prolonged ∼7 ◦C warming in the later Carnian (Tuvalian 2). Carbon isotope perturbations associated with the CHE of western Tethys occurred contemporaneously in South China, and mark the start of a prolonged period of carbon cycle instability that persisted until the late Carnian. The dry-wet transition during the CHE coincides with the negative carbon isotope excursion and the temperature rise, pointing to an intensification of hydrologic cycle activities due to climatic warming. While carbonate platform shutdown in western Tethys is associated with an influx of siliciclastic sediment, the eastern Tethyan carbonate platforms are overlain by deep-water anoxic facies. The transition from oxygenated to euxinic facies was via a condensed, manganiferous carbonate (MnO content up to 15.1 wt%), that records an intense Mn shuttle operating in the basin. Significant siliciclastic influx in South China only occurred after the CHE climatic changes and was probably due to foreland basin development at the onset of the Indosinian Orogeny. The mid-Carnian biotic crisis thus coincided with several phenomena associated with major extinction events: a carbonate production crisis, climate warming, δ13C oscillations, marine anoxia, biotic turnover and flood basalt eruptions (of the Wrangellia Large Igneous Province).\n© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Environmental and biotic changes during the Carnian Stage (∼237–227 Ma) of the Triassic are amongst the most enigmatic of the geological record (Simms and Ruffell, 1989; Ogg, 2015). Prominent amongst these was the Carnian Humid Episode (CHE, after Ruffell et al., 2015, but also known as Carnian Pluvial Event or Carnian Pluvial Phase), a short-lived phase (<1 Myr, Zhang et al., 2015) of increased rainfall. The CHE has been attributed to an intensification of a mega-monsoonal climate (Parrish, 1993;\n* Corresponding author at: GeoZentrum Nordbayern, Universität Erlangen– Nürnberg, Schlossgarten 5, 91054 Erlangen, Germany.

All rights reserved.\nKozur and Bachmann, 2010), although climate change driven by voluminous volcanism and greenhouse gas exhalation has also been suggested (Dal Corso et al., 2012). A contemporaneous major increase in siliciclastic influx to marine areas has been implicated in the shutdown of carbonate platforms and the demise of reef ecosystems in western Tethys and the peri-Gondwana margin (e.g., Hornung et al., 2007a). The CHE also coincided with extinctions amongst crinoids and scallops, while nekton such as ammonoids and conodonts also suffered losses (Simms and Ruffell, 1989; Rigo et al., 2007), suggesting a broad-reaching marine crisis. Terrestrial floras record a shift towards hygrophytic forms in the late Julian substage (early Carnian, ∼237–233 Ma) before returning to xerophytic associations by the early Tuvalian substage (late Carnian, ∼233–227 Ma) (Roghi et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2016);\na change that may have been responsible for elevated extinction rates reported amongst herbivorous tetrapods (Benton, 1986).\nDespite the magnitude of the changes, the majority of evidence for the Carnian Crisis has come from western Europe (Fig. 1) and major questions remain as to the global significance and cause(s) of this event. We evaluate the global extent of the CHE and associated environmental changes by investigating palaeotemperature, δ13C, sedimentary facies and redox changes in South China, a region far removed (∼13,000 km distant) from the better-studied western Tethyan locations. Our results indicate that the environmental changes in the Carnian were truly global and associated\nwith a carbonate production crisis, double-pulse climate warming, intense oceanic anoxia and large δ13C oscillations associated with flood basalt eruptions."

    "text": "The studied section at Long Chang (25◦26.565′N, 105◦28.791′E) outcrops in a road cut ∼2 km south of the town of Long Chang (Figs. 2 and 3). In comparison to the well-known section of Enos et al. (1998) in the nearby area (Fig. 2C), our section is more condensed and has been chosen for its excellent outcrop situation\nand ease of access. The Long Chang area was located in a transitional zone between the Yangtze Platform and Nanpanjiang Basin (Fig. 2A, B) in eastern Tethys at ∼15◦N during the Carnian (Enos et al., 1998; Golonka, 2007). The deep-waters of the Nanpanjiang Basin opened to the east into the Panthalassa Ocean (Fig. 1). This platform-and-basin topography later evolved into a foreland basin in the latest Carnian due to collision between the North and South China blocks that saw carbonate platforms swamped by siliciclastic input (Enos et al., 1998). Therefore, while in western Tethys, the mid-Carnian is marked by a transition from carbonate to siliciclastic deposition, and a re-establishment of carbonate production in the aftermath of the CHE (e.g., Hornung et al., 2007b), in South China renewed carbonate deposition was short-lived because foreland basin siliciclastics were soon established (Fig. 2C). Our interpretation of climatic and environmental history of this region during the Carnian must therefore be viewed in the context of an on-going, and as yet poorly understood major tectonic change."

    "heading": "3. Methods",
    "text": "The 50 m-thick Long Chang section was logged and sampled at ∼20 cm intervals yielding 190 samples for thin sections, conodont biostratigraphy, pyrite framboid and geochemical analyses. Conodont samples were crushed to small chips and dissolved by using 6%–10% acetic acid. The acid solution was buffered with tricalcium phosphate and exchanged every 48 h until the samples were fully dissolved. Residuals were wet sieved, dried at 50 ◦C and separated for heavy fractions using sodium polytungstate. Conodont elements were picked under a binocular microscope. For carbonate carbon isotope analyses (δ13Ccarb), sample powders were reacted with 100% phosphoric acid at 70 ◦C in a Gasbench II gas preparation and introduction system connected online to a Thermo Delta Plus mass spectrometer. Reproducibility, monitored by replicate analyses of laboratory standards calibrated to NBS 19 and LSVEC, was ±0.09 (1σ). Carbon isotopes were determined from total organic carbon (δ13Corg) using decarbonatized samples in an elemental analyzer (CE 1110) connected online to a Thermo Delta Plus mass spectrometer. Reproducibility, monitored by replicate analyses of the standard USGS 40, was ±0.06 (1σ). All carbon isotope values are given in per mille relative to VPDB. Oxygen isotopes were measured on conodont apatite (δ18OPO4) following the method described in Joachimski et al. (2009) and are given in per mille relative to VSMOW. Analyses were performed using a TC-EA coupled online to a Thermo Delta Plus mass spectrometer. Reproducibility, monitored by replicate analyses of the standard NBS 120c (21.7 ), was ±0.14 (1σ). Pyrite framboid analysis was performed on 30 samples in the form of small polished chips that were examined at 2500× magnification using a Zeiss scanning electron microscope\nunder backscattered electron mode. The minimum, maximum and mean diameter of framboids in each sample, and their standard deviation were calculated. Where possible, >100 individual framboids were measured in each sample. Mo, Mn, U, Th and Al contents were measured on powdered samples digested in a 2:2:1:1 acid solution of H2O–HF–HClO4–HNO3. Solutions were analyzed using a PerkinElmer ICP-MS with a reproducibility better than ±2% (2σ ). XRF analyses on high-Mn samples were further performed on an AMETEK Spectro XEPOS XRF analyzer for cross comparisons. Data were calibrated to the limestone standard JLs-1. Ten major element contents (CaO, P2O5, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, Na2O, K2O, MnO and TiO2) were quantitatively determined. Reproducibility was better than ±0.06 wt% (1σ ). Mn concentrations were calculated from the MnO content by multiplication with a coefficient 0.775 (= molecular weight [Mn]/molecular weight [MnO])."

    "text": "The global Carnian conodont biostratigraphy is complex, and no consensus has been reached on a single biostratigraphic scheme (e.g., Kozur, 2003; Orchard, 2010). Here we present the first detailed attempt at an approach combing conodont zonation, bivalve and ammonoid biostratigraphy to define Carnian substage boundaries in South China. The Zhuganpo and Wayao Formations (Fm.) are likely regionally diachronous lithological units that require sitespecific age diagnosis, and we have studied a part of the Zhuganpo Fm. that is time-equivalent to only the upper part of Enos et al.’s (1998) Zhuganpo Fm. Since most Late Triassic conodont species are long-ranging, we use assemblage zones for a better age constraint. The strata are biostratigraphically dated to the Julian 1 to Tuvalian 2 and record continuous sedimentation through most of the Carnian Stage (Fig. 4). The Long Chang conodont fauna is dominated by the genus Quadralella (Q .) with less abundant Paragondolella (P .), Norigondolella and exceptionally rare Gladigondolella. Three conodont zones are recognized. They are, in ascending order, the P. foliata-Q. polygnathiformis assemblage zone, Q. polygnathiformis noah zone and Q . carpathica assemblage zone. These zones can be correlated with the western Tethys zonation (e.g., Hornung et al., 2007b; Kozur, 2003; Fig. 5).\nConodonts from Long Chang display some features endemic to the region (Fig. 6). In comparison to western Tethyan and North American faunas, the South China conodonts generally have more elongated and less up-turned platforms. Adult specimens are locally rather rare in the Tuvalian strata. Some diagnostic features such as the presence of a bifurcated keel are less developed in the Q. carpathica group.\nA few ammonoid and bivalve body fossils were collected from the uppermost Zhuganpo Fm. and overlying Wayao Fm. (Fig. 7). The ammonoid Austrotrachyceras ex gr. A. austriacum at ∼26 m level (sample LC 34) indicates basal Julian 2 (i.e., Julian 2/I a sensu\nGallet et al., 1994). The bivalve Halobia cf. zitteli at ∼30 m level (sample LC 41) is suggestive of a Julian age.\nCollectively, the Julian 1–Julian 2 boundary is assigned below sample LC 34. The Julian–Tuvalian boundary is tentatively assigned\n92 Y.D .Sun et al./Earth and Planetary Science Letters 444 (2016) 88–100\ns’ depict the minimum and maximum framboid diameters, ions are based on palynological studies (Roghi et al., 2010; a log scale.

    "text": "The Long Chang section records major facies changes. The basal 13 m lie within the early Carnian Zhuganpo Fm. (Julian 1) and consist of bioclastic wackestones. Thin-shelled bivalves (filaments) and holothurian sclerites are abundant; calcispheres are locally common while Tubiphytes, ostracods and benthic foraminifers are rare. The succeeding 8 m consist of intraclastic limestones in which the matrix, of filamentous limestone, surrounds clasts of darker bettercemented patches of the matrix lithology (Fig. 3F). The clasts are generally well rounded and often rotated so that the alignment of the bivalve filaments is at an angle to the filaments in the matrix. The topmost metre of the Zhuganpo Fm. (Julian 2) sees the development of two distinct manganese-rich limestone beds: a lower bed consisting of nodular limestone with abundant ammonoids and an upper bed consisting of thinly bedded mudstones with calcispheres (Fig. 3C).\nThe overlying Wayao Fm. (Julian 2–Tuvalian 2) consists mostly of black shales with interbeds of filamentous packstones composed of valves of the bivalve Halobia (Fig. 3E). The Halobia packstones range from 2–30 cm thick, although a metre-thick example is found around 45 m above the base of the section (Fig. 4). Ammonoids, crinoids and radiolarians are common, together with calcispheres (Fig. 3G–I). At one level, 28 m above the base of the section, calcispheres ranging in size from 20–200 μm, dominate in thin section. Towards the top of the section (beginning at 45.5 m above the base of the section) thin interbeds of sharp-based, laminated calcisiltites appear.\nThe Wayao Fm. is overlain by a thick development of amalgamated sandstone turbidite beds belonging to the Laishike Fm. (possibly Tuvalian 3) that marks the start of flysch-style sedimentation (Enos et al., 1998), but note that black shale facies persist into the lowermost metres of the Laishike Fm. The boundary between Wayao Fm. and Laishike Fm. is defined regionally by the first occurrence of a fine-grained sandstone/mudstone (normally yellow–brownish in colour)."

    "heading": "4.3. Redox proxies",
    "text": "Pyrite framboid analysis is a widely used petrographic palaeoredox proxy (Wilkin et al., 1996). In general, populations of tiny framboids (mean 3–6 μm in diameter) indicate anoxic–euxinic conditions, and populations of larger framboids (mean 6–10 μm in diameter, and typically a larger standard deviation) indicate dysoxic conditions (Bond and Wignall, 2010). Pyrite crystals are absent from much of the Zhuganpo Fm. Only in the topmost metre does euhedral pyrite become common, although there are no framboids at this level. In contrast, tiny pyrite framboids are prolifically abundant throughout the Wayao Fm. Average diameters are small (mean ∼4 μm, with maximum framboid diameter [MFD] ∼8 μm) in the lower part of the Wayao Fm., and somewhat larger in the upper part, where MFD increase to ∼20 μm (Fig. 4).\nTrace metals provide additional information on depositional conditions since many trace metals are insoluble in reducing environments and consequently adsorbed to sediments under an anoxic water column. Redox-controlled trace metal concentrations (Mn, Mo, U) show marked fluctuations at Long Chang. Manganese values are low (∼200–2500 ppm) through most of the section, but increase notably by two orders of magnitude to values ranging from ∼0.8 to 11.2 wt% (8000–112,000 ppm) in a 2 m interval at the Zhuganpo–Wayao transition (Julian 2) (Table 1; Fig. 3C; Fig. 4). Mo/Al ratios show a different trend. Mo/Al is ≤1.0 throughout the Zhuganpo Fm., before the ratio rises sharply at the base of the Wayao Fm. from where it remains between ∼3 and ∼10 up-section. U/Th ratios are ≤1.0 throughout most of the Zhuganpo Fm., and rise to ∼2 in the uppermost Zhuganpo Fm. from where they remain between 1 and 2 up-section."

    "text": "The δ13Ccarb values are stable at ∼2.6 through the lower part of the section, then show an abrupt ∼4.5 negative excursion starting at the latest Julian 1 (Fig. 4). A low point of −2 is reached at the Julian–Tuvalian boundary before values rise again to ∼1.5 in the middle of the Tuvalian 1. A second, short-lived negative shift of ∼2 is seen in the upper Tuvalian 1, before values stabilize up-section at ∼ 2.5 .δ13Corg data show good covariance with δ13Ccarb. Thus, δ13Corg values decrease from ∼ − 26 in the Julian 1 to ∼ − 29 at the Julian–Tuvalian boundary, before stabilizing at pre-excursion values in the Tuvalian 2. However, the\ndouble negative spike observed in the δ13Ccarb record is not well developed in the δ13Corg record, although there is a small increase in δ13Corg values between the two negative shifts (Fig. 4).\nThe δ18OPO4 record contains two negative excursions. A ∼1 negative shift occurs in the Julian 2 when δ18OPO4 decreased from ∼20.0 to ∼19.0 . This was followed by a positive shift to pre-\nexcursion δ18OPO4 values. A second, more gradual ∼1.5% negative shift occurs throughout Tuvalian 2, when δ18OPO4 decreased from ∼20.0 to ∼18.5 (Fig. 4)."

    "text": "The Long Chang section records many of the attributes of the Carnian Crisis and CHE that have been reported from far removed sections of western Tethys, indicating that those changes were manifest over a large (global?) geographical area (Fig. 1B). Significantly, the δ13Corg trends known from western Tethys (e.g., Dal Corso et al., 2015) are replicated eastern Tethys where they also occur in the δ13Ccarb record. The δ18OPO4 record reveals that the Carnian Crisis was associated with two phases of warming that correlate with the dry-wet climatic transition."

    "heading": "5.1. Towards an age model",
    "text": "Establishing the timing of the Carnian Crisis and the CHE in South China and elsewhere is a crucial step in the evaluation of various causal mechanisms that have been postulated for the inferred environmental changes. However, the age of Late Triassic strata in Guizhou is a subject of intense debate. Unfortunately, many age-diagnostic taxa exhibit regional differences both in terms of individual morphologies and in terms of temporal range during the Carnian (Fig. 5) and so thorough dating of individual sections is essential when developing a regional biostratigraphy for South China. Our approach combines conodont interval and assemblage zones (based on a combination of conodont species) with ammonoid/bivalve ranges to define the biostratigraphic scheme, therefore excluding problems caused by regional differences in the first and last occurrences of individual conodont species. Our biostratigraphy supports conclusions of a recent ammonoid study (Zou et al., 2015) that assigned the upper part of Zhuganpo Fm. (studied in this paper) and the overlying Wayao Fm. to the Carnian. However, our biostratigraphic age assignment for the Long Chang sequence differs from that inferred by magnetostratigraphy and cyclostratigraphy performed on similar lithological units (Zhang et al., 2015). Zhang et al. (2015) place the Zhuganpo, Wayao, Laishike and Bana formations entirely within the Carnian, thus constraining the older formations to the early part of the Carnian. It is possible\nthat the discrepancy between bio- and magneto- and cyclostratigraphy is due to the diachronous nature of these rather loosely defined local lithological units. Thus, while other interpretations might be valid, our detailed ammonoid, bivalve and conodont sampling provides the first detailed biostratigraphy for the area, and it is independently verified by our carbon isotope chemostratigraphy that is correlatable to well-dated western Tethyan sections (Fig. 8)."

    "heading": "5.2. A carbonate production crisis",
    "text": "A decrease in carbonate productivity is indicated by the facies changes at Long Chang. The basal bivalve-holothurian wackestones of the Zhuganpo Fm. represent a rather unusual variety of platform carbonate that probably formed in deeper waters (compared to the underlying Yangliujing cyclic limestones and dolostones, Fig. 2C). The lack (or rarity) of typical shallow-water Carnian components such as calcareous algae, Tubiphytes and crinoids is probably due to the location of Long Chang at the transition between the Yangtze platform and an adjacent basin. The overlying intraclastic limestones show a high degree of early cementation followed by re-orientation of the clasts. Enos et al. (1998) argued that the intraclasts did not undergo significant transport because they are of the same lithology as the matrix. While this observation is pertinent we note that frequent re-orientation of the clasts suggests some degree of movement, perhaps during debris flow emplacement. Carbonate productivity declined at the Julian 1–Julian 2 transition when a manganiferous, ammonoid wackestone developed – a facies typical of deep-water, condensed limestones such as the Jurassic Ammonitico Rosso (Jenkyns, 1991). This was followed by deposition of deep-water black shales and Halobia packstones of the Wayao Fm., indicating further base-level deepening. The Halobia packstones consist of horizontally laminated, densely packed thin valves, probably formed under sediment-starved conditions (Fig. 3G). This facies persists up to 42 m above the base of the studied section, suggesting that the sedimentation rates were probably locally still low in the early Tuvalian 2 substage.\nThe drowning of the carbonate platform did not result in a complete shutdown of carbonate productivity because 1) though carbonates were relatively rare, Halobia packstones occur at several levels in the Wayao Fm. (Fig. 3D, G); 2) in the adjacent Guanling area ∼60 km away from Long Chang, carbonate produc-\ntion (though briefly punctuated by black shale deposition) continued well into the Tuvalian 3 substage (Wang et al., 2008); and 3) further afield, on the northwestern Yangtze Platform, carbonate platforms were replaced by ramp deposits and sponge reefs in Tuvalian and carbonate production persisted until the early Norian in Sichuan Province at which time they were inundated by flysch sediments (Wu, 1989; Li et al., 2014). The transition from an extensional platform-and-basin setting to a foreland basin setting in South China probably occurred between the latest Carnian (∼Tuvalian 3 at Long Chang) and earliest Norian (in NW Sichuan). In this scenario the loss of carbonate production late in the Julian cannot be the result of foreland basin development because it slightly predates this tectonic change. At Long Chang, it seems that sedimentation rates were still rather low during the Julian 2 (uppermost Zhuganpo Fm.) and the Tuvalian 1–2 substages (lower–middle Wayao Fm.) as suggested by the occurrence of nodular ammonoid wackestones and Halobia packstones. Indications of foreland basin development such as a substantial increase in sedimentation rates and occurrence of basin infill only occurred in the Laishike Fm. (probably Tuvalian 3 and later)."

    "heading": "5.3. Marine anoxia",
    "text": "The inferred increase in water depth at the top of the Zhuganpo Fm. at Long Chang saw the establishment of intense euxinia, although only after the development of Mn-rich limestones (MnO content is generally >1.0 wt%, up to 15.1 wt%). The U/Th ratio increases at the same level, suggesting that redox is one of the main controls on Mn scavenging. The increase in the U/Th ratio slightly predates the increases of Mo/Al, probably a function of the greater enrichment of U in dysoxic waters relative to Mo, which only enriches in intensely anoxic sulfidic water (Algeo and Tribovillard, 2009). Unlike most metal sulfides, manganese sulfide is soluble in anoxic waters, but in oxygenated waters Mn is rapidly precipitated in a carbonate form or as particulate oxides (Brewer and Spencer, 1974). In many euxinic basins Mn is shuttled from sulfidic, deeper basinal waters to the redox boundary where manganese-rich carbonates form a “bath-tub ring” (Frakes and Bolton, 1984). Manganese-rich deposits in effect herald the arrival of upward-expanding euxinic waters (Jenkyns et al., 1991). Thus, the Mn enrichment in the uppermost Zhuganpo Fm. suggests deeper water euxinia had already developed prior to the appearance of euxinic facies at Long Chang.\nPyrite framboids in the Wayao Fm. are even smaller than those raining to the seafloor in the modern euxinic Black Sea (Wilkin et al., 1996), indicating intense water column stratification (Bond and Wignall, 2010) developing later in the Julian 2 interval. This conclusion is supported by the exceptionally high Mo/Al values and low biodiversity in the Wayao Fm., which lacks benthos, and is dominated by the bivalve Halobia and the pseudoplanktonic crinoid Traumatocrinus which attached itself to driftwood. The ecology of Halobia has been debated – some regard it as pelagic while others suggest it is a low-oxygen specialist able to survive during short periods of elevated benthic oxygen levels (Allison et al., 1995). Thus occurrences of Halobia coquinas in the Wayao Fm. indicate recurring dysoxic conditions in an overall anoxic environment. Our pyrite framboid data, which show a clear trend from no pyrite to euhedral pyrite and then abundant small framboids up-section, help to exclude the possibility that the enrichment of redox sensitive elements in the uppermost Zhuganpo Fm. reflects a post-depositional exchange with the overlying anoxic Wayao black shales because although trace metals can migrate after deposition, pyrite crystals cannot – they record a primary signal of oxygen depletion.\nAn alternative interpretation of the low biodiversity of the Wayao Fm. lies in the poisoning of benthos due to the exces-\nsive supply of terrestrial nutrients in the local basin. However, the lack of apparent faunal changes, the lack of evidence for increase in bioerosion towards the termination of platform, and the lack of phosphate enrichment in the pelagic and condensed intervals at Long Chang and adjacent areas (Enos et al., 1998) do not support a substantial increase of nutrient level. Instead, contemporaneous oxygen depletion recorded in the Italian Alps, North Africa, Sicily, and South China provides compelling evidence for a supraregional anoxic event (Bellanca et al., 1995; Keim et al., 2006; Hornung et al., 2007b; Soua, 2014; Minzoni et al., 2015)."

    "text": "The late Julian 1 negative δ13C excursion at Long Chang matches that seen in the western Tethyan marine and terrestrial organic carbon isotope records (Dal Corso et al., 2012, 2015) indicating that it is a Tethys-wide, and probably global signal. The Long Chang δ13Ccarb profile reveals several further negative shifts, which are not yet known from elsewhere. This probably reflects a lack of detailed sampling at this level – the Tuvalian has received much less attention than the Julian (Fig. 1B; Fig. 8). In contrast, the δ13Corg profile in South China suggests a single, prolonged negative excursion between the Julian 2 and Tuvalian 2 substages (Fig. 2). Despite this minor discrepancy between the δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg records, there was clearly a prolonged perturbation of the carbon cycle in the later Carnian, coincident with several contemporaneous volcanic eruptions (Walderhaug et al., 2005; Maury et al., 2008; Greene et al., 2010; summarized in Fig. 1C). The Wayao Fm. is known for the excellent preservation of large pieces of driftwood that were encrusted with crinoids (Wang et al., 2008). The negative excursion seen in the δ13Corg record therefore could be an artefact of such terrestrial organic carbon input. However, this is unlikely because in general, δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg co-vary at Long Chang, and terrestrial organic carbon input cannot account for the scale of changes seen in the δ13Ccarb record. However, δ13Corg records from Long Chang and Luntz basin (Mueller et al., 2016) as well as within Northern Calcareous Alps (Dal Corso et al., 2015 v.s. Mueller et al., 2016) show different variation patterns in the Julian 2 (Fig. 8). Such differences likely suggest a major disturbance and compositional variation in regional organic carbon pools. The δ13Corg signal may reflect local effects (e.g., terrestrial/marine organic carbon mixing) and (potentially) the unreliability of measuring δ13Corg on very small amounts of carbon (e.g., on sandstone, claystone etc.).\nCalculating absolute seawater temperatures from δ18OPO4 using Pucéat et al.’s (2010) equation and assuming an ice-free world in the Late Triassic (δ18Oseawater = −1 ), yields warm subtropical SSTs (∼26–33 ◦C). These temperatures correspond to modern equatorial SSTs and are similar to temperatures calculated for the Middle Triassic of the same region (Sun et al., 2012). The two negative δ18OPO4 excursions indicate increased warmth with temperatures increasing by 4 ◦C from ∼27 ◦C to ∼31 ◦C in the Julian 2 substage, followed by a short-lived cooling and then a second rise of ∼7 ◦C from ∼26 to ∼33 ◦C, beginning in the Tuvalian 1 substage and persisting until the later Carnian. Despite differences in analytical methods, sampling resolution and regional δ18Oseawater, a comparable warming trend of ∼6–8 ◦C from the Julian to the late Tuvalian is also reported from contemporaneous sections in the Northern Calcareous Alps and Southern Alps (Hornung et al., 2007b; Trotter et al., 2015), suggesting that this is a true, global signature (Fig. 9)."

    "text": "One of the most intriguing features of the CHE is that the prevailing Late Triassic dry climate was interrupted by a tran-\nsient interval of enhanced rainfall (e.g., Simms and Ruffell, 1990). In western Tethys this caused the sudden shutdown of carbonate platforms by enhanced terrestrial siliciclastic input (sands and muds, etc.) due to elevated run-off rates (e.g., Kozur and Bachmann, 2010). High run-off is also invoked in North America where mid-Carnian sandstone occasionally contains kaolinite, suggesting a humid climate (Simms and Ruffell, 1990). The arid–humid transition in the Carnian is best constrained by palynological studies – the Carnian in general was very arid, but a humid pulse began at the Julian 1–Julian 2 boundary and ended in the early Tuvalian (Roghi et al., 2010; Mueller et al., 2016).\nThe ultimate cause(s) for the mid-Carnian climate change is a matter of intense debate. Enhanced precipitation is has long been postulated the result of mega-monsoon activities due to the palaeogeographic configuration of Pangea (e.g., Parrish, 1993). However, climate changes triggered by tectonic movements are generally gradual and long-lasting, in contrast to the sudden and transient nature of the CHE. The global climate change from arid to humid conditions in the Julian 2 (Mueller et al., 2016) coincided with the negative carbon isotope excursion and temperature rise seen at Long Chang and elsewhere (Fig. 4; Hornung et al., 2007b), which suggests instead a warm-climate-driven model.\nVolcanic activity, both silicic and basaltic, was geographically widespread and intense during the Carnian (e.g., Walderhaug et al., 2005; Maury et al., 2008; Greene et al., 2010; Moix et al., 2013). The Wrangellia Large Igneous Province (LIP) and contemporaneous volcanic activity elsewhere (Fig. 1) likely injected copious light carbon to the atmosphere and initiated the first warming event seen in the Julian 2 substage. An intensification of the hydrologic cycle and an increase in precipitation is a predictable consequence of climate warming. Thus, widely-distributed wind-blown dust found in the Carnian Panthalassa Ocean points to strong atmospheric convection (Nakada et al., 2014).\nOur combined biostratigraphy and carbon isotope records provide a temporal framework for the succession of intra-Carnian events, facilitating the detailed reconstruction of the sequence of environmental changes. The late Julian was marked by carbonate platform drowning (possibly correlating to sea level rise) and the development of intense basin anoxia. This coincided with the onset of a negative carbon isotope excursion and a warming trend that is correlative with the CHE and similar δ13C trends in western Tethys. Platform drowning may have been related in part to the development of deep-water euxinia, which could have “poisoned” carbonate production leading initially to the development of condensed, manganiferous carbonates and ultimately to the loss of all\nbut filamentous limestone production as the area of black shale deposition expanded. High Mn2+ concentrations in euxinic waters may have been another contributing (if not the key) factor to rarity of carbonates in the Wayao Fm. because Mn2+ inhibits carbonate precipitation (Dromgoole and Walter, 1990).\nOnce established, black shale and filamentous limestone deposition persisted into the Tuvalian when δ13C and δ18OPO4 fluctuations reveal substantial further perturbations to both the carbon cycle and SSTs: at least one more prolonged, warm episode and two further negative δ13C excursions. These phenomena have not been reported from western Tethys, probably due to the less intense study of the post-CHE interval there (Fig. 1B). Coincident with the Wrangellia LIP and other coeval substantial volcanic activity, the CHE likely represents another case of volcanism-induced global climatic changes."

    "text": "Major Carnian climatic and environmental changes were widespread throughout the Tethyan ocean region: they have the hallmarks of many mass extinction events including warming, carbon isotope oscillations, transgression and the spread of deep-water anoxic facies. The coincidence with the Wrangellia LIP and several Tethyan volcanic events strengthens the similarity of the Carnian Crisis to major Permian and Triassic extinctions, and suggests the Carnian event could rank alongside those in terms of environmental perturbations.\nThe dry-wet transition occurred during the CHE and coincided with a −4 negative carbon isotope excursion and a 4 ◦C warming, arguing for a volcanism-induced, warm-climate-driven intensification of hydrologic cycle activities.\nA decrease in carbonate productivity during the CHE is likely a global phenomenon triggered by different mechanisms. The complete shutdown of carbonate production by siliciclastic influx seen in western Europe only occurred at a regional scale. Though inhibited, carbonate precipitation persisted until at least the end of the Julian 2 in many deeper water localities (e.g., Lukeneder et al., 2012; Soua, 2014; this study). The carbonate production decrease in South China (Julian 2) predated foreland basin development (latest Tuvalian 2 to Tuvalian 3) at the onset of the Indosinian Orogeny and was probably the result of platform drowning, euxinia and high Mn2+ concentrations.\nThough more studies on other regions will provide a better understanding of this intriguing interval in Earth history, our work in South China supports a scenario in which environmental changes\nwere both geographically and temporally widespread during the Carnian. The most harmful interval for marine life is likely to have occurred at the start of Julian 2, coincident with the CHE, when a warming trend, increasing precipitation and intense marine anoxia were established, resulting in widespread, but as yet poorly constrained, faunal losses."
