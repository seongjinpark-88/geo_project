(2008) suggested that the perturbation at the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) was initiated by processes associated with an end-Permian mantle plume including igneous intrusions and uplift. These events resulted in the massive release of CH4 primarily from the dissociation of marine gas hydrates, and secondarily from maturation of organic-rich sediments and fracturing of petroleum reservoirs. Injection of CH4 into the ocean changed seawater composition (the acid-bath ocean) leading to marine mass extinction. Transfer of CO2 and CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere created a hot climate (the end-Permian inferno) which caused the terrestrial mass extinction. We suggested that the Siberian trap volcanism and marine anoxia played little role in this catastrophe. Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) have raised three criticisms to our article. The first is that our interpretation has been previously advocated by others. Our re-evaluation indicates that our interpretationwas in fact opposite of those considered by Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) to have presented scenarios similar to ours. The second, Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) also suggest that our proposed change in carbonate mineralogy across the PTB did not occur because such a change “should produce a large positive excursion rather than the observed negative excursion”. Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) have made a basic mathematical error in evaluating the effect of carbonate mineralogy on δ13C values. Therefore, they have reached two wrong conclusions: one about the validity of a change in carbonate mineralogy and the other regarding its effect on the shift inδ13C values at the PTB. A change in carbonatemineralogyproduced a larger negative excursion rather than a positive shift. The third, Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) indicate that the PTB oceanwas anoxic to the rim. This criticism is not supportedby the rock recordbecausehighlybioturbated strataweredeposited inenvironments ranging from shallow shelves to deep waters under oxygenated water column at the time of the PTB mass extinction. If the ocean were totally stratified for 20Ma, and if anoxia extended all the way to the shoreline, and if the oceanwere anoxic to the rim and H2S were oozing out of it, then we should see at least 100 m of organic-rich, varvedlaminated strata in areas ranging from the abyssal plain to the shoreline environments. Such strata have not yet been found.\n008.04.013, 10.1016/j.palaeo.\n+1 601 979 3630. ri), arzan2@yahoo.com\nll rights reserved.\n© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "text": "In a recent article, Heydari et al. (2008) presented major changes in lithofacies characteristics, original carbonate mineralogy, trace element\ncompositions, and stable isotopic values of three Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) sections that were deposited in open ocean localities. Weproposed that theperturbation at the PTBwas initiated byprocesses associated with an end-Permian mantle plume including igneous intrusions and uplift. These events resulted in the massive release of CH4 primarily from the dissociation of marine gas hydrates, and secondarily from maturation of organic-rich sediments and fracturing of petroleum reservoirs. Injection of CH4 into the ocean changed seawater composition (the acid-bath ocean) leading to marine mass extinction. Transfer of CO2 and CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere created a hot climate (the end-Permian inferno) which caused the\nterrestrial mass extinction. We suggested that the Siberian trap volcanism and anoxia played little role in this catastrophe. Volcanism did not produce sufficient gas to cause the global perturbation observed at the PTB. Shallow and deep water strata were deposited under an oxygenated water column condition at the time of the crisis.\nWignall and Racki (2009-this issue) have raised three objects to our article. The first, our interpretation has been previously advocated by others. The second, our proposed change in carbonate mineralogy across the PTB is not correct; and the third, oceans were anoxic to the photic zone. We welcome this opportunity for an exchange of ideas."

    "heading": "2. Comparison with previously published interpretations",
    "text": "Heydari et al. (2008) proposed that a series of events began in the lithosphere, which triggered the next set of processes in the hydrosphere which in turn initiated another series of changes in the atmosphere. Each of the Earth′s realms (lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere) experienced substantial changes of their own and the combined effect of these perturbations led to the end-Permian biological crisis. The scenario proposed by Heydari et al. (2008) can be considered a “Whole Earth Model” of the PTB mass extinction (see\nFig. 5 of Heydari et al. 2008).\nWignall and Racki (2009-this issue) claim that our interpretation has been clearly advocated in many papers that we did not cite, including Saunders (2005), Isozaki (2007), and Wignall (2007). As will be shown in the following paragraphs, the main conclusion of the article by Heydari et al. (2008) is indeed opposite to those reached by Saunders (2005), Isozaki (2007), and Wignall (2007).\nThe article by Wignall (2007) did not provide any new interpretation. It advocated the kill mechanism proposed by Wignall (2001) which related PTB mass extinction to the Siberian Trap volcanism. No mention of either mantle plume or its relationship to hydrosphere, atmosphere, and the end-Permian mass extinction was found in Wignall (2007). Similarly, the article by Saunders (2005) is a broad introduction to large igneous provinces (LIPs) and their effects on environmental change and mass extinctions. Saunders (2005) indicated that the source of LIPs could be mantle plumes. However, like Wignall (2007), Saunders (2005) emphasis rested entirely on the role of volcanism on environmental change.\nIsozaki (2007) rejected the role of continental flood basalt (i.e., Siberian trap volcanism) as the cause of the PTB mass extinction. Instead, he proposed that a mantle plume-related rhyo-dacitic volcanism (not the basaltic volcanism of the Siberian trap) and the eruption of air-borne ash caused the PTBmass extinction. In effect, the model proposed by Isozaki (2007) is another version of that suggested by Wignall (2001) and Saunders (2005): it was the volcanism that caused the PTB mass extinction.\nSaunders (2005), Isozaki (2007), and Wignall (2007) are indeed similar to those previously published by Wignall (2001). All advocate that volcanism and oceanic anoxia were responsible for the PTB mass extinction. However, these interpretations are in fact the opposite of the one proposed by Heydari et al. (2008) who clearly indicated that Siberian trap volcanism and oceanic anoxia had little effect on the PTB biological crisis.\nThe strength of ourmodel is that it accounts for all 10 characteristics of the PTBmass extinction (see Heydari et al. 2008, p. 155).Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) suggest that we should also show evidence of dike swarms in marine realm. It is a common knowledge that the Permian and Triassic oceanic crusts were consumed during the formation of Pangea and not available for examination. However, dike swarms and intrusions are commonly associated with mantle plumes and flood basalts (see Retallack and Jahren, 2008; Ganino and Arndt, 2009). Even with the absence of intrusion, the uplift associated with a mantle plume can produce the trigger for dissociation of marine gas hydrates (see Jahren, 2002). In addition, the shape of a mantle plume\nand the area they influence is complex and not well understood (see Maruyama et al., 2007)."

    "heading": "3. Carbonate mineralogy and its implication for the PTB mass extinction",
    "text": "Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) suggest that our proposed change in original carbonate mineralogy across the PTB did not occur. They provide three reasons for this objection: (1) the PTB occurred within an interval considered as an aragonite sea, therefore, calcitedominated limestones could not have precipitated. (2) The effect of mineralogy on δ13C composition of precipitating carbonates “should produce a large positive excursion rather than the observed negative excursion”; and (3) if there were any changes in carbonate mineralogy it could have been due to Mg/Ca ratio of seawater and not oceanic pH as proposed by Heydari et al. (2008)."
  }, {
    "heading": "3.1. Calcite precipitation during an aragonite sea",
    "text": "The suggestion by Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) that because the PTB boundary event occurred in the middle of an aragonite sea, thereforenocalcite-dominated limestoneshouldhaveprecipitatedduring this period is very simplistic. The aragonite sea in question extended from theMississippian to theMiddle Jurassic, an interval lasting nearly 160Ma (Sandberg, 1983;Wilkinson et al., 1985; Hardie 1996; Stanley andHardie 1998; Stanley, 2006). Firstly, there are not adequate data to resolved dominant carbonate mineralogy on a time interval resolution of 1–2Ma (i.e., the interval of PTB event as proposed by Heydari et al., 2008).\nSecondly, even with such a poor data base, the calculated Mg/Ca ratio of seawater shows four major fluctuations two of which range from 1 to 4.5 (see Fig. 1 of Stanley and Hardie, 1998). That means that fluctuations in carbonate mineralogy were highly possible during the Mississippian to Jurassic aragonite sea even if we assume that Mg/Ca ratio was the cause of the change in carbonate mineralogy. In fact, precipitation of aragonite during calcite seas or calcite during aragonite seas was common during the Phanerozoic. For example, Heydari et al. (1993) showed that calcite ooids precipitated during the Mississippian aragonite sea and Heydari andMoore (1994) documented formation of aragonite ooids during the Late Jurassic calcite sea."

    "heading": "3.2. Carbonate mineralogy and δ13C variation across the PTB",
    "text": "Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) cite an article by Swart and Eberli (2005) and suggest that calcite–aragonite δ13C fractionation is about 4–5‰ PDB. Therefore, they claim that our proposed change in carbonate mineralogy across the PTB “should produce a large positive excursion rather than the observed negative excursion”. That is, a change in carbonatemineralogy across the PTB could not have occurred.\nWignall and Racki (2009-this issue) are wrong about carbon isotope fractionation between calcite and aragonite. Because it is clear from many articles (including Swart and Eberli, 2005) that aragonite is enriched by 1.6‰ PDB relative to the co-precipitating calcite (Rubinson and Clayton, 1969; González and Lohmann, 1985), not the 4–5‰ PDB suggested by Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue).\nMore importantly, Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) havemade a basic mathematical error in evaluating the effect of carbonate mineralogy on δ13C values. As a result, they have reached two wrong conclusions: one about the validity of a change in carbonatemineralogy and the other regarding its effect on the shift in δ13C values across the PTB. If aragonite is 1.6‰ PDB heavier than co-precipitated calcite, then for a calcite-to-calcite comparison, the δ13C composition of the earliest Triassic carbonates should be lowered by 1.6‰ PDB (Fig. 1). When corrected for the change in mineralogy, the δ13C shift across the PTB produces a larger negative shift, rather than a “large positive excursion” as suggested byWignall and Racki (2009-this issue). Therefore, the total change in δ13C values form the latest Permian to the earliest Triassic is\nabout 6–7‰PDBat the Shahreza sectionof Iran. Such a large shift in δ13C composition of the PTB ocean effectively eliminates volcanic gas and anoxia as the cause of the mass extinction. Such a change in δ13C values can only be achieved bymassive input of CH4 froma large source suchas the marine gas hydrate further supporting the validity of the model proposedbyHeydari andHassanzadeh (2003) andHeydari et al. (2008)."

    "heading": "3.3. Mg/Ca ratio or pH of seawater",
    "text": "The Mg/Ca ratio is not the only cause of the change in original mineralogy of carbonates as perceived byWignall and Racki (2009-this issue). The saturation state of seawater has always been considered as an equally important factor (see Wilkinson et al., 1985). For example, Heydari and Moore (1994) suggested that secular variation in the original mineralogy of ooids during the Phanerozoic was most likely caused by variation in carbonate saturation of seawater as a function of atmospheric CO2. An elaborate recent investigation reached a similar conclusion (Locklair and Lerman, 2005).\nIn fact, recent studies have demonstrated that seawater saturation state has changed with increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Feely et al., 2004; Orr et al., 2005). If a geologically minor change in the modern atmospheric CO2 is capable of decreasing seawater pH, then the suggested major increase in CO2 atmosphere and ocean during the PTB event was more than adequate to produce an “acid-bath” ocean as suggested by Heydari and Hassanzadeh (2003). Most importantly, the low pH of seawater during the transition from Permian to Triassic (the “acid-bath ocean”) is supported by submarine dissolution of platform carbonates in open ocean (Heydari and Hassanzadeh, 2003; Payne et al., 2007)."

    "heading": "4. Anoxia and ocean circulation during the PTB interval",
    "text": "Our interpretation of seawater oxygenation is based on the evidence from sedimentary rocks at the PTB. The absence of anoxia in shallow shelves to moderately deep waters is suggested from many localities, including the following: Nanpanjiang Basin of China (Krull et al., 2004), Abadeh section of Iran (Heydari et al., 2003; Korte et al., 2004b), several Tethyan sections (Kozur, 2007), Oman (Twitchett et al., 2004; Weidlich and Bernecker, 2007), and Canada (Beatty et al., 2008). Even PTB strata that were deposited in the abyssal plain and base of the slope are bioturbated (see Kakuwa, 1996; Isozaki et al. 2007). Examples listed in Table1ofWignall andRacki (2009-this issue) arenot conclusiveevidence for aglobalwater columnanoxia at thePTB time(seeHeydari et al., 2008).\nIf the latest Permian to the earliest Triassic ocean were “totally stratified” for 20Ma (i.e., Isozaki, 1997), and if the anoxia extended all the way to the shoreline (i.e., Wignall and Twitchett, 2002), and if oceans were anoxic to the rim (i.e., photic zone anoxia of Hays et al., 2007), then we request that Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) to present the resultant varved-laminated strata which is typical of such environments (Fig. 2). For example, a stable stratifiedwater column in\nthe Late Jurassic marginal basins along the northern Gulf of Mexico that lasted less than 1 Ma deposited 50m of strata shown in Fig. 2. The anoxia scenario advocated byWignall and Racki (2009-this issue) and many others (i.e., Isozaki, 1997; Wignall and Twitchett, 2002; Hays et al., 2007) should have left at least 100 m of such varved-laminated strata in areas ranging from abyssal plain to near shore environments. But there is no trace of such strata so far.\nWignall and Racki (2009-this issue) suggest that the oxygenated part of the ocean acted as refuge areas otherwise the mass extinction would have been “100% of the world's species rather than just 95%”. We look at this situation differently. We suggest that the fact that so many refuge environments existed and still 95% of organisms died indicate that mass extinction occurred regardless of seawater redox condition. The suggestion that the PTB ocean was so anoxic that H2S was oozing out of it is not supported by the rock record. Anoxia was limited to deepest depression of the ocean and marginal seas.\nFinally, Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) also criticize our article because we did not refer to many works dealing with numerical simulation of PTB events (i.e., Kidder and Worsley, 2004 and few others). This is because we clearly expressed controversy surrounding such simulations (i.e., Winguth and Maier-Reimer, 2005). It was unnecessary to follow the subject."

  "abstractText": "Article history: Received 29 May 2009 Received in revised form 7 August 2009 Accepted 3 September 2009 Available online 12 September 2009 In a recent article, Heydari et al. (2008) suggested that the perturbation at the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) was initiated by processes associated with an end-Permian mantle plume including igneous intrusions and uplift. These events resulted in the massive release of CH4 primarily from the dissociation of marine gas hydrates, and secondarily from maturation of organic-rich sediments and fracturing of petroleum reservoirs. Injection of CH4 into the ocean changed seawater composition (the acid-bath ocean) leading to marine mass extinction. Transfer of CO2 and CH4 from the ocean to the atmosphere created a hot climate (the end-Permian inferno) which caused the terrestrial mass extinction. We suggested that the Siberian trap volcanism and marine anoxia played little role in this catastrophe. Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) have raised three criticisms to our article. The first is that our interpretation has been previously advocated by others. Our re-evaluation indicates that our interpretationwas in fact opposite of those considered by Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) to have presented scenarios similar to ours. The second, Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) also suggest that our proposed change in carbonate mineralogy across the PTB did not occur because such a change “should produce a large positive excursion rather than the observed negative excursion”. Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) have made a basic mathematical error in evaluating the effect of carbonate mineralogy on δC values. Therefore, they have reached two wrong conclusions: one about the validity of a change in carbonate mineralogy and the other regarding its effect on the shift inδC values at the PTB. A change in carbonatemineralogyproduced a larger negative excursion rather than a positive shift. The third, Wignall and Racki (2009-this issue) indicate that the PTB oceanwas anoxic to the rim. This criticism is not supportedby the rock recordbecausehighlybioturbated strataweredeposited inenvironments ranging from shallow shelves to deep waters under oxygenated water column at the time of the PTB mass extinction. If the ocean were totally stratified for 20Ma, and if anoxia extended all the way to the shoreline, and if the oceanwere anoxic to the rim and H2S were oozing out of it, then we should see at least 100 m of organic-rich, varvedlaminated strata in areas ranging from the abyssal plain to the shoreline environments. Such strata have not yet been found.",
