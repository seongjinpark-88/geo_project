    "text": "The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous continental flood basalt provinces on Earth. The mass extinction at the end of the Permian was the most severe in the history of life. In the present paper, these two major concurrent events that occurred are analysed and a geochemical model coupled with an energy balance model is used to calculate their environmental impact on atmospheric CO2, oceanic d 13C, and marine anoxia. The latitudinal temperature gradient is reduced relative to today, resulting in warmer temperatures at high latitudes. The warmer climate and the presence of fresh basaltic provinces increase the weatherability of the continental surfaces, resulting in an enhanced consumption of atmospheric CO2 through weathering. First, the eruption of the Siberian traps is accompanied by a massive volume of 13C depleted CO2 degassed from the mantle and added to the ocean through silicate weathering, thus lowering marine d13C. Second, the rapid collapse in productivity induces a strong decrease in the global organic carbon burial. This too tends to increase the proportion of light carbon in the ocean. These two effects can explain the low d13C values across the PT boundary, and methane release need not be invoked to explain the d13C fluctuations. It is proposed that the phosphorus cycle, which drives primary production in the model, plays an important role on the recovery of productivity and the d13C variations. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "During the Late Permian, about 250 million years ago (Ma), the continents were aggregated into the supercontinent Pangea. The breakup of Pangea began\nshortly after the emplacement of basaltic traps, which now cover vast areas of the Siberian platform. The original volume of basalt exceeded 2 106 km3, and may have reached twice that amount [1], but only 4 105 km3 currently remain. Kerrick [2] estimated a total volume of about 3.3 106 km3, but many authors [3,4] assume that the area of the basaltic flows was about 1.5 106 km2, although the present-day area of basalts is much smaller (3.4 105 km2). According to Reichow et al. [5], the total area of the traps is at least doubled (and possibly more than tripled) by inclusion of the West Siberian Basin (WSB) basalts, giving a combined area of 3.9 106 km2 and making the Siberian flood basalt province the largest subaerial volcanic event in the Phanerozoic record. ClaouéLong et al. [6] obtained U–Pb dates of zircons from an ash band immediately below the PT boundary in Southern China of 251.2F3.4 Ma. Renne et al. [7] analysed sanidine from the same ash band and obtained an 40Ar–39Ar age of 249.91F1.52 Ma. Redating the same ash band again, Bowring et al. [8] obtained a U–Pb age of 251.4F0.3 Ma. These dates suggest the PT boundary occurred between 250 and 251 Ma, with a greater likelihood for the older end of this age range. More recently, Mundil et al. [9] concluded that the PT boundary must be slightly older than 252.5F0.3 Ma. The radiometric dating efforts suggest that the onset of eruptions was coincident with the PT boundary within a few hundreds of thousands of years. Estimates for the duration of volcanism range from 0.6 [10] to 1 million years [7].\nDuring the end Permian mass extinction, it is estimated that 96% of marine species [11] and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate families went extinct [7]. Land plants were also affected. The causes of this catastrophic event are currently a topic of intense debate. Many processes have been offered to explain the biological extinction, including changes in sea level, climate change, large-scale volcanism, overturn of the ocean with the release of toxic gases, massive methane release from methane hydrates, a bolide impact, and others [12]. However, confusion remains in regard to whether geochemical signatures at the PT boundary reflect the causes or the effects of the extinction. For example, the release of isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere by volcanism induces a drop in the carbon isotopic composition (d13C) of the oceans, but this drop could also have been\ngenerated by a sudden mass extinction. In any case, given the coincidence between Siberian Trap emplacement and the PT boundary, it seems likely that volcanism at least contributed to the extinction [1,7,8].\nJin et al. [13] suggest that the peak in extinction rates occurred at 251.4 Ma, followed by the gradual disappearance of a small number of surviving genera over the next million years. The rapid marine extinction in the Meishan sections of Southern China coincides with the dramatic shift in the d13C composition of seawater (Fig. 1). According to Bowring et al. [8], the age of the event boundary is also 251.4F0.3 Ma at Meishan, and the biostratigraphically defined PT boundary is b 251.4F0.3 Ma and N 250.7F0.3 Ma. Their geochronological data indicate that the main pulse of Changhsingian\nextinction occurred in less than 1 million years (my), between 251.4F0.3 and 252.3F0.3 Ma. At Meishan, as well as at the other sections, there are abrupt negative shifts in the d13C value of both inorganic and organic carbon at the PT boundary [14,15]. The amplitude and duration of the shifts are a function of accumulation rate and sampling interval. In many studies, a shift from the Late Permian to the Early Triassic values of 2x to 4x is observed, with the maximum excursion approximately coincident with the boundary [16]. Holser et al. [17] suggest a duration for the extinction of 5–10 my, whereas Hallam and Wignall [18] prefer a drapid but not instantaneousT mass extinction. The knowledge of sediment accumulation rates at particular locations is needed to assign an actual duration to the extinction. Bowring et al. [8] obtained ages at Meishan that differed by 0.7F0.3 my for two ash layers that bracket the extinction period. Twitchett et al. [19] suggest a more rapid rate of ecosystems collapse of 10–30 thousand years for the marine extinctions based on typical sediment accumulation rates.\nMarine sediments deposited in the latest Permian record a change from oxic to anoxic conditions. This transition period is marked by the development of widely distributed facies, consisting of variable proportions of thinly bedded marls, micritic limestones [20] and sediments rich in organic matter (e.g. black shales) [21]. The abundance of pyrite (FeS2) and fine lamination implies that the rocks were deposited in a low-oxygen environment. Global warming contributes to lower oxygen concentrations in two ways [22]: (1) oxygen uptake by organisms increases rapidly with a rise in temperature, and (2) oxygen solubility in seawater decreases with an increase in temperature. Yet, the single most important cause of oxygen deficiency in bottom waters was likely a decline in the intensity of ocean circulation resulting from a decline in equator-to-pole temperature gradient [22]. An ocean depleted in oxygen is clearly an unfavourable environment for most animals, and anoxic waters are a plausible killing mechanism.\nVolcanic emissions can affect climate on different timescales [23]. Volcanoes release gases into the stratosphere: SO2 which is rapidly oxidised to yield sulfate aerosols producing short-term cooling (sulfate aerosols scatter the solar radiation back into space\nand, in the lower atmosphere, they can nucleate water droplets and modify the radiative properties of clouds; they are, however, removed from the atmosphere after 1 to 2 years), and CO2 which generates long-term warming.\nIn this paper, we explore the impact of the emplacement of the Siberian traps on the global carbon cycle, on the mass extinction, and the subsequent weathering of this large basaltic province. We also try to explain how these events have modified the d13C record across the PT boundary."

    "text": "Volcanic eruptions are known to have short-term effects on global climate through the release of aerosols to the stratosphere. Large volcanic eruptions are thus potential candidates for initiating major climatic and biological crisis in the Earth’s history. In contrast, tectonic activity and average volcanism are generally regarded as one of the major driving forces of climate change on geological timescales (N 1 my) due to the release of CO2 into the atmosphere and the associated greenhouse warming. On these timescales, the volcanic release of CO2 into the atmosphere–ocean system is counterbalanced by its consumption during silicate weathering and subsequent carbonate deposition [24]. This balance is maintained dynamically via the negative feedback of silicate weathering, as the system evolves towards hypothetical steady state. Hence, chemical silicate weathering plays a major role in the long-term evolution of atmospheric CO2 partial pressure.\nDessert et al. [25] have quantified the impact of the emplacement of the K/T Deccan traps on the global carbon cycle and climate. The weathering rate of continental silicates, including the flood basalts, is enhanced under a warmer and wetter climate [26], and this stabilizes the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2, increasing the sink as the source increases. Atmospheric CO2 thus reaches a new steady state several million years after the end of trap emplacement and degassing. Because basaltic rocks weather about 5 to 10 times faster than granitic rocks [27], the global weatherability of the continental surface drastically increases after the eruption of large continental flood basalts, and the new steady state atmospheric CO2 and\nmean global air temperature drop below the preperturbation values.\nThe original volume of the Siberian flood basalts may have reached 3 106 km3, which corresponds to a total degassing of 1.6 1018 mol of CO2 (equivalent to the Deccan traps degassing [28]). Continental reconstructions for the end of the Permian (e.g. [29]) indicate that the Siberian platform was located between 608 and 708N at the time of trap emplacement and has not moved substantially in latitude since. The current climate is cold and dry in these latitudes, and the weathering of the Siberian traps is weak. But in the past, the weathering of these basalts may have had a major impact on the atmospheric CO2 and climate, particularly towards the end of the Paleozoic when the high latitudes were warmer than today [30].\nThe massive subaerial intracontinental volcanism, combined with a voluminous subduction-related volcanism along the Proto-Cordilleran–Gondwana and Proto-Altaid orogens [31], presumably caused an increase in atmospheric CO2 partial pressure. However, the aerosol-induced reduction in solar irradiation and the enhanced consumption of atmospheric CO2 by continental silicate weathering of the newly exposed basaltic surface more than compensated for this dgreenhouseT effect."

    "heading": "3. Model considerations",
    "text": "In this contribution we quantify the events at the PT boundary with a numerical model that incorporates the biogeochemical carbon and alkalinity cycles. We calculate the long-term changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the geochemical signatures of elements across the transition boundaries. The three-box model (atmosphere, surface and deep ocean) in this study describes the global organic and inorganic carbon and alkalinity cycles. Time-dependent mass balance equations are written for total carbon, alkalinity, phosphorus, oxygen (O2), and 13C. The temporal evolution of the following fluxes is calculated: atmosphere–ocean exchange, weathering of silicates, weathering and precipitation of carbonates, weathering of kerogen carbon and deposition of organic carbon (Fig. 2). This geochemical model is coupled to a 1D energy balance\nmodel (EBM) that calculates annual mean air temperature as a function of atmospheric CO2 pressure in 18 latitude bands [32], with the continental zonal runoff calculated as a parametric function of the zonal air temperature, continental area and latitude. In the Late Permian, the latitudinal temperature gradient was reduced compared to today (~20 8C) [30]; therefore we force the model to flatten the gradient, which makes the high latitudes warmer. As a result, the heat transfer coefficients Ds (sensible heat), Dl (latent heat), and Do (oceanic heat), which are assumed to vary with latitude, are doubled. We adopt a Late Permian paleogeography [33] and a solar luminosity reduced by 2% relative to the present [34,35]. The main outputs of the model are the mean d13C evolution of marine dissolved inorganic carbon, atmospheric pCO2, alkalinity and carbon contents of the oceans, and a plethora of carbon and alkalinity exchange fluxes between the exosphere and sedimentary reservoirs.\nThe quantification of the effects of basaltic trap emplacement on silicate weathering rates requires global weathering laws. The calculations use the temperature output from the EBM where temperature-dependent weathering rates are assumed. Runoff and weathering rates are calculated for each latitude band. Four lithologies are considered: basalts, other silicates rocks (granites, gneisses), carbonates and shales (sedimentary rocks rich in organic matter). A different weathering law is used for each lithology and latitude band. The consumption of atmospheric CO2 by the weathering of basalts (noted b) and other silicates rocks (noted g) can be written as:\nf g;b w;i ¼ area g;b i d runoff idk g;bdexp Cg;bdWT\nð1Þ\nArea i g and areai b represent the continental area (in square kilometres) of exposed granitic and basaltic surfaces in latitude band i. Runoffi is the continental runoff in mm/year within a given latitude band i. kg and kb are constant for granite and basalt, respectively, and are calibrated in such a way that for present-day climatic and paleogeographic conditions Fw g+Fw b= Fw sil (global silicate weathering flux) equals 5.85 1012 mol/year [36]. Fwb is adjusted to be approximately the value used by Dessert et al. [27], and Fw g is calibrated by difference (Table 1). The CO2 consumption flux due to the weathering of the\nSiberian traps is estimated to be 0.053 1012 mol/year [27]. Cg and Cb are constants representing the temperature dependence of the weathering rate for\neach lithology. WT is the average air temperature in 8C during the weathering season, i.e. the time period with temperatures higher than a threshold T0 (=0 8C). WT is parameterized as a function of the annual mean temperature calculated by the EBM in the latitude band i:\nif 252:16 KbTiV294:88 K; WT ¼ 10:6783þ 0:508691d Ti 273:15ð Þ ð2Þ\nif 250:95 KVTiV252:16 K; WT ¼ 0 ð3Þ\nif Tiz294:88 K; WT ¼ Ti 273:15 ð4Þ\nNote that, if Tib250.95 K, f g,b w,i=0 and the global silicate weathering flux is also zero. New et al. [37] compiled a high-resolution data set of surface climate\nover global land areas. Using the mean monthly surface temperature from these data, we calculate the mean annual temperature and plot it against the average monthly positive temperatures at each location. The correlation coefficient between the data set and the WT relation is about 0.98. Where there is no positive monthly temperature, there is no weathering season (WT=0). Where monthly temperatures are all positive, the weathering season lasts the entire year (WT=T). Simple linear scaling is used to interpolate between these two extremes. It should be noted that the threshold T0 that determines the weathering season is not well known, and several tests using a lower threshold ( 5 8C) showed no fundamental difference. The carbonate weathering law ( f carbw,i ) is proportional to the continental surface covered by carbonates in each latitude band, the continental runoff, and the calcium ion concentration of the solution in equilibrium with both calcite and atmospheric CO2.\nThe kerogen weathering law ( f orgw,i ) is similar to that for basalt weathering, except that in this case there is no temperature dependence [38].\nThe pre-trap steady state can be controlled by the balance between CO2 degassing sources and the si-\nlicate weathering flux (Fsilw ¼ P18 i¼1 f g w;i þ P18 i¼1 f b w;i ), that is the net carbon released into the ocean– atmosphere system is equal to the total consumption of carbon by continental silicate weathering. This implies that the organic carbon subcycle is also assumed to be in balance. After basalt spreads over a granitic lithology within a given latitude band, a new steady state is achieved by the global ocean–atmosphere carbon cycle within several million years.\nA simple chemical model of phosphorus and oxygen cycling is included in the coupled model. The input flux of phosphorus is taken to be proportional to the continental silicate weathering flux. Two processes are taken into account as important phosphorus sinks [39], the burial of phosphorus tied up in organic matter and the sedimentation of calcium carbonates. Phosphorus is chosen as a driver of productivity because it is thought to exert the primary control on marine primary production on long timescales [40].\nThe organic carbon subcycle includes the burial of organic (reduced) carbon, Corg, and the oxidation of kerogen on continents. The kerogen weathering flux (Fw org) was already described above. The depositional flux of organic matter (Fd org) is proportional to the\nnew productivity, which in turn depends on the phosphorus content. The organic carbon cycle likely modulated the isotopic evolution of the oceans [41], through disequilibria between kerogen carbon weathering and organic carbon deposition. Due to the large carbon isotopic fractionation in the organic carbon subcycle, the seawater d13C is directly related to the amplitude of the imbalance between Fd org and Forgw . We also investigate the isotopic effect on seawater of the massive release of mantle 13C-depleted CO2 (d13Cvol= 5x) to the atmosphere during eruption of the Siberian traps. The degassing of large quantities of mantle carbon also increases weathering through the effect of warming, resulting in increased CO2 consumption and delivery of alkalinity and phosphorus to the ocean.\nA series of differential equations is used to track the evolution of the d13C composition of the atmosphere (da), the surface ocean (ds) and the deep ocean (dd) (see Table 2 for explanation of the variables).\nFor the atmosphere: dda dt ¼ Fvold dvol dað Þ þ Foad dg da\nCa\nð5Þ\nFor the surface ocean: dds dt ¼ Fmixd Cod=Vodð Þd dd dsð Þ\nbionpd rcpd rcarbd dCO3 dsð Þ bionpd rcp\nd dorg ds\nFoad dg ds þ Faod da dsð Þ\nþ 2Fsilw þFcarbw d da dsð Þ þFcarbw d dcw dsð Þ\nþ Forgw d dow dsð Þ\nCs\nð6Þ\nFor the deep ocean: ddd dt ¼ Fmixd Cos=Vosð Þd ds ddð Þ\nþ bionpd rcpd rcarb Fcarbd d dCO3 ddð Þ\nþ bionpd rcp Forgd d dorg dd\nCd\nð7Þ\nds and dd represent the average d 13C composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in their respective reservoirs. From the carbonate equilibria, the model calculates the concentrations of H2CO3, HCO3 and CO3 2 in the surface and deep ocean reservoirs, as well as their respective isotopic compositions dH2CO3,\ndHCO3, and dCO3. The isotopic fractionation between the carbonate species and the isotopic fractionation due to photosynthesis are calculated as a function of temperature according to Freeman and Hayes [42], while the fractionation between dissolved and gaseous CO2 is calculated according to Mook et al. [43].\nThe magnitude and global nature of the large negative excursions in carbon, sulfur and strontium isotopic compositions of surface waters [44], and anoxia led some authors [22,45,46] to propose that the entire ocean was severely stratified prior to the PT boundary, and that stagnation-induced anoxia may have played a role in the extinction at the end of the Permian. In this scenario, the marine extinction mechanism would have been closely related to the development of oxygen-deficient depositional environments. In the model, the oxygen concentration is calculated for the atmosphere, and the surface ocean is assumed to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere. The oxygen exchange between the surface and deep ocean is calculated to test whether or not the model can impose deep ocean anoxia."

    "heading": "4.1. Standard simulation",
    "text": "In this subsection, we illustrate with the model the sequence of events subsequent to the extrusion of the Siberian basaltic province. The pre-perturbation pCO2 is assumed to be the Permian level calculated by the model (3080 ppmv). The eruptive phase is assumed to last 600 thousands years (ky) [10], with a total degassing of 1.6 1018 mol of CO2 [28], similar to the rates proposed by Berner [12] and Kamo et al. [47]. The baseline CO2 degassing used in the model is taken from Engebretson et al. [48], and is therefore significantly less than the rate reconstructed by Gaffin [49]. The area of the basaltic floods, another critical\nparameter, is variably set to 2.5 106 km2 to account for just the main Siberian traps, and the more extreme value of 3.9 106 km2 [5], which includes buried basaltic sequences in the West Siberian Basin.\nIn the reference run, two time-dependent forcing functions are imposed to the system: the eruptive phase and the mass extinction. It is not clear whether these two events were simultaneous [7], or whether volcanism slightly pre-dated the extinction event [47]. In the simulation, both events start at the same time. The mass extinction has a duration of 100 ky and, in order to simulate the marine ecosystem collapse, the\nnew production is reduced by 80% during this time interval. Fig. 3 illustrates the combined effects of Siberian trap volcanism and the mass extinction on the d13C of seawater and the CO2 level of the atmosphere. The atmospheric CO2 level rises by about 1080 ppmv at the peak value, and global mean air temperature rises by about 1.2 8C. Two causes explain these effects. First, the release of volcanic CO2 into the atmosphere increases the atmospheric greenhouse, and the Earth becomes warmer. Second, the reduction of marine productivity induces a strong decrease in the deposition of organic carbon (Fig. 4), leading to an accumulation of carbon in the exospheric system and in the atmosphere. The CO2 spike appearing just before 0.1 my (Fig. 3a) is linked to the mass extinction forcing function. The reduced primary production induces rapid fluctuations in the deposition of carbonate on the seafloor, and the alkalinity contents of surface and deep oceanic reservoirs increase significantly. The result is a disequilibrium between the alkalinity and carbon pumps, and the alkalinity transfer dominates the exchanges during the extinction phase. Subsequently, CO2 is rapidly consumed by silicate weathering and the new steady state atmospheric CO2 and mean global air temperature are finally lower than the corresponding pre-perturbation values. After 2.3 my, the atmospheric pCO2 is lowered by 746 ppmv compared to its value before the perturbation. This CO2 decrease is accompanied by global cooling of 1.07 8C. In the model, we took\ninto account changes in the areal extent of the basaltic province with time, as a result of erosion. The change in area is calculated using a linear relationship between the chemical weathering rate of basalts and CO2 consumption that has previously been established for various basaltic catchments [27] and by approximating the geometry of the basalt province to be an inverted cone. We calculate that the Siberian traps province was reduced in area by a factor of two in 10 my, due to the warm and wet climate in the Late Permian and early Triassic. After this 10 my, the weathering rate was presumably reduced in response to high latitude cooling, except during the Eocene and the Cretaceous [50]. Consequently, the CO2 consumption flux attributed to the basaltic weathering gradually decreases, and after 2.3 my, the atmospheric CO2 level and global mean surface temperature increase slightly.\nThe rapid productivity collapse imposed on the system induces a strong decrease in organic carbon deposition, greatly decreasing the organic carbon burial sink for phosphorus. Since the source flux of phosphorus is proportional to the continental silicate weathering flux, the input of phosphorus to the ocean is enhanced throughout the 600 ky of Siberian volcanism. Therefore, phosphorus accumulates in the ocean, triggering a productivity bloom when photoautotrophs recover from the extinction event. The sharp rise in primary productivity increases the depositional flux of organic carbon, thus increasing the d13C of the ocean (d13Corg= 22x) and the oxygen production from the biosphere. However, oxygen consumption by heterotrophs is also stimulated, resulting in the development of anoxia in deep waters (Fig. 5). The high primary productivity is sustained by the elevated CO2 flux from Siberian eruptions and consequent elevated silicate weathering flux that increases the phosphorus delivery to the ocean. The productivity bloom persists N 1 my and induces deep ocean anoxia for almost 0.9 my. Thus, the productivity crash is followed by productivity bloom, a pattern characteristic of oceans where a rapid decline in circulation rates produces an anoxic lower water column [22]. The carbon and phosphorus cycles are linked by the C/P ratio in the buried organic matter, which is a function of the degree of anoxicity of oceanic waters [51]. For simplicity, the C/P molar ratio in the buried sediments is considered to be\nconstant in the model. Modeling shows that the productivity declines concomitantly with the decrease in the rate of oceanic overturn and nutrient supply. This effect is counterbalanced by the increased availability of reactive phosphorus, which is not as efficiently sequestered by organic matter in an anoxic ocean. The result is a significant time lag (on the order of tens of ky) between the onset of oceanic anoxia and the build-up of phosphorus [22].\nMass mortality also affects marine plankton, and would virtually eliminate the biological pump, resulting in a decrease in the d13C composition of the surface ocean (i.e. a Strangelove Ocean [52]). D’Hondt et al. [53] have suggested a similar drop in d13C in the surface ocean during the K/T boundary interval.\nThe oceanic d13C values in the early and midPermian were high (+5x, [12]), and remained elevated up to the PT boundary [44,54], where they dropped by 2x to 6x. Either of the two forcing functions in our model can cause a decline in oceanic d13C. First, volcanism could generate the anomaly, since mantle carbon is depleted in 13C (d13C= 5x). Second, a decline in primary productivity would decrease the amount of 13C-depleted organic carbon removed from the ocean. In our model, marine d13C falls by ~2.2x (Fig. 3b) at the PT boundary through a combination of these two effects. The negative excursion lasts ~140 ky and is followed by a positive excursion of ~1x, which results from the accumulation of phosphorus in the ocean during the mass extinction."

[56], and from other geological maps [23,57,58]. The weathering of silicate rocks is strongly dependent on climatic conditions (temperature and runoff) and constitutes a sink for atmospheric CO2 that could strongly influence the partial pressure of CO2. The latitudinal distribution of silicate rocks thus has an important impact on global climate. In order to test the impact of organic-rich rocks on the CO2 sink, we prescribed them to be equally distributed in each latitude band. This reorganization of lithologies results in no significant impact on the weathering and burial fluxes of organic carbon, since kerogen weathering law in the model is not dependent on temperature."

    "text": "The burial flux of organic matter is proportional to the new productivity, which itself is dependent on phosphorus availability in the ocean. If the phosphorus cycle is in steady state (Fig. 3), the input flux to the ocean is independent of the continental silicate weathering flux. Similarly, the phosphorus burial flux is independent of the carbonate and organic carbon burial fluxes. Therefore, phosphorus does not accumulate in the ocean during the phase of enhanced silicate weathering, and there is no productivity bloom accompanying the primary production recovery. The organic carbon deposition remains constant in the simulation, except during the mass extinction, where it decreases by more than 85%. The well-balanced phosphorus cycle induces an important organic disequilibrium which increases the steady state atmospheric CO2 pressure by 1650 ppmv (Fig. 3a). The elimination of the productivity bloom following the\nextinction removes the d13C positive excursion which was produced by the enhanced burial of organic carbon, but the amplitude of the negative d13C excursion is hardly affected (Fig. 3b)."

    "heading": "4.2.3. Siberian volcanism",
    "text": "In the reference run, Siberian volcanism and mass extinction have been introduced in the model as coupled forcing functions. Here, we try to evaluate the impact of the eruption alone (Fig. 6). The primary production is driven by the phosphorus content of the ocean. The increase in the weathering input of phosphorus to the ocean during the enhanced silicate weathering period induces a rise\n.\nby about 20% in marine production. However, without the productivity crash there is no significant accumulation of phosphorus in the ocean and thus no productivity bloom. The organic matter deposition is dependent on the new productivity and shows an increase of only about 1.5 1012 mol/year (Fig. 4). The enhanced organic burial flux counterbalances the effect on d13C of the input of 13Cdepleted volcanic carbon (d13Cvol= 5x). The drop in d13C is almost totally suppressed and only the positive excursion remains (Fig. 6b). The increase in marine primary production induces deep water anoxia which lasts about 0.77 my. The phosphorus cycle, and to a lesser extent the organic carbon cycle, mask the effect of volcanic CO2 release on the d13C drop. In order to quantify this effect, we must remove the organic carbon and phosphorus cycling. Under these conditions, the steady state d13C is lower than in the reference run and the d13C negative excursion, due to the degassing of 1.6 1018 mol of mantle CO2, is close to 0.4x (Fig. 6b). The drop in d13C is small and the volcanic degassing alone is clearly insufficient to explain the PT changes in d13C. A critical parameter in the model is the areal extent of the Siberian flood basalts. We have used the average value of 2.5 106 km2 [3,4], rather than the higher value of 3.9 106 km2 proposed by Reichow et al. [5]. A sensitivity test using the latter value results in greater consumption of atmospheric CO2 due to weathering of silicates lithologies. The new steady state atmospheric CO2 and mean global air temperature, following emplacement of the traps and subsequent weathering, are lower than in the reference run by 988 ppmv and 1.5 8C, respectively."

    "heading": "4.2.4. Duration of mass extinction",
    "text": "The amplitude of the d13C negative excursion at the PT boundary is about 3x (Fig. 1). Bowring et al. [8] estimated a duration of 0.7F0.3 my for the mass extinction. If the primary production is strongly reduced (by about 80%) for a period of 0.7 my (compared to 0.1 my), the model produces a d13C drop of 3.3x (Fig. 7), which is a larger decline than produced in the reference run due to the greater imbalance between organic burial and organic weathering at the PT boundary. This\nr\nsituation results in a stronger concomitant rise of atmospheric CO2 pressure of about 6300 ppmv (Fig. 7). The loss of productivity lasts longer than the Siberian volcanism. The perturbations of the carbon cycle linked to such a long ecosystem collapse are severe and result in a high atmospheric CO2 pressure, high weathering fluxes and a large drop in d13C. The total amount of phosphorus accumulated in the deep water reservoir during the low productivity phase is about 6 times higher than in the reference simulation. As a result, the productivity bloom following the extinction is much higher leading to pronounced deep water anoxia and to very high sedimentation rates of organic matter. The result is a very rapid drop of atmospheric CO2 near 0.7 my when productivity recovers (Fig. 7). This CO2 drop induces a strong reduction in the weathering rates and, hence, in the delivery of phosphorus to the ocean. Under low weathering rates and high organic matter sedimentation, the phosphorus cycle is largely out of balance and the deep ocean phosphorus content is reduced to its pre-perturbation value in a few hundreds of ky. Hence, the high productivity phase and the deep water anoxia are maintained for only 0.4 my (Fig. 5), a much shorter interval than in the standard simulation. Consequently, the productivity bloom and associated anoxia are driven essentially by the characteristics of the extinction imposed on the system. The Siberian traps volcanism, combined with the sudden mass mortality, could explain the negative excursion\nin d13C and the anoxia in deep waters observed at the PT boundary."

    "heading": "5. Discussion",
    "text": "During Late Permian, nearly all continents were assembled into the supercontinent, Pangea. This continental configuration limited the effect of the ocean on coastal areas [59]. Numerical experiments with a three-dimensional global ocean model with a low equator-to-pole temperature gradient [30] and linked to a biogeochemical model of phosphate and oxygen cycling, suggest that oceanic circulation would have been weak and anoxia would have been widespread during the Permian. Polar warming and tropical cooling cause anoxia throughout the deep ocean by decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the regions of deep water formation and by increasing nutrient utilization. Our model generates a global surface ocean temperature of about 21.7 8C and a CO2 level of 3080 ppmv prior to the PT mass extinction and Siberian flood basalt eruption. Imposing the present temperature gradient on the model yields average surface ocean temperatures ~3.4 8C colder and an atmospheric CO2 level of only 1530 ppmv. Thus, the warmer climate in the Late Permian sets the stage for the enhanced global weathering fluxes that severely perturbs the global carbon cycle and generate the drop in d13C at the PT boundary. The reorganization of the carbon cycle is the combined result of the Siberian flood basalt volcanism and the sudden mass extinction of marine biota. The sensitivity tests demonstrate the important role of the organic carbon subcycle on the sudden drop in marine d13C at the PT boundary. The seawater d13C composition is directly related to the amplitude of the imbalance between kerogen carbon weathering and organic carbon deposition [12]. Since the burial of organic matter depends on marine productivity, a prolonged Strangelove Ocean increases the organic disequilibrium and the amplitude of the d13C negative excursion. Disregard of the organic carbon cycle feedbacks thus precludes a good fit to the observed d13C data. Unfortunately, despite the huge amount of marine proxy data and numerical models, the organic cycle is still poorly constrained with respect to the exchange fluxes between the oceanic and crustal\nreservoirs. Nevertheless, the organic weathering and burial laws calibrated to present-day conditions provide reasonable results in our model.\nThe volcanic CO2 released with the massive eruption of the Siberian traps cannot alone explain the large drop in d13C and the deep waters anoxia at the PT boundary. As Broecker and Peacock proposed [60], the perturbations to the Earth’s ecosystems induced by the massive PT extinction can best explain the abrupt d13C decrease. The relative timing of the mass extinction and volcanism has an important impact on the duration of the anoxia event that follows. If the interval of low primary productivity exceeds the duration of flood basalt eruption, the recovery of marine productivity is more pronounced. The carbon cycle perturbations and the primary production following recover are controlled by the characteristics of the mass extinction. In the reference run, with rapid rates of ecosystem collapse, the high input of phosphorus to the ocean during Siberian volcanism sustains the recovery phase and associated anoxia for a longer period of time.\nSeveral authors have invoked methane release to explain the oceanic drop in d13C [12,19]. Whereas the release of CH4 to the atmosphere will cause the d 13C value of the ocean to decrease, it will not add appreciable CO2 to the atmosphere. Contrary to Berner [12], it appears that mass mortality and massive volcanism can generate in our model the d13C anomaly recorded at the PT boundary."

    "heading": "6. Conclusion",
    "text": "The Siberian traps are among the best-known flood basalt provinces. The latitudinal temperature gradient was reduced in the Permian compared to today (Fig. 8) and the high latitudes were wetter and warmer (281.6 K at the end of the Permian vs. 261.9 K today), which resulted in a relatively high rate of silicate weathering on the Pangean supercontinent.\nA simple model to explain the geochemical and geological observations across the PT boundary includes a combination of causes: (1) the emplacement of the large basaltic province in Siberia, and (2) a severe mass extinction. The combined input of carbon to the atmosphere from volcanic CO2 degassing and mass mortality (and induced disequilibrium of the organic subcycle) leads to extremely high levels of atmospheric CO2 and dissolved CO2 in the deep ocean. Temperature-dependent weathering processes would have been strongly enhanced. The reduced primary productivity induces a drop in global organic carbon burial and a subsequent imbalance in the rates of deposition and weathering of sedimentary organic matter. The combination of the volcanic degassing and the ecosystem collapse is able to provide enough isotopically light carbon to bring about the drop in d13C at the PT boundary without invoking methane emission from the sediments. Multiple d13C pulses are not reproduced by the model simulations, but this could be a consequence of multiple inputs of volcanic CO2 degassing or of multiple episodes of reduced marine productivity. However, the model only partly reproduces the complex variations of the d13C values occurring at the PT boundary [13]. A transient increase in d13C following the initial negative excursion is induced by the enhanced organic carbon burial during the productivity bloom and associated anoxia. The longer the Strangelove Ocean persists, the greater is the magnitude of the negative d13C excursion, and the shorter and more intense is the recovery phase and interval of deep anoxia."

  "abstractText": "The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous continental flood basalt provinces on Earth. The mass extinction at the end of the Permian was the most severe in the history of life. In the present paper, these two major concurrent events that occurred are analysed and a geochemical model coupled with an energy balance model is used to calculate their environmental impact on atmospheric CO2, oceanic d C, and marine anoxia. The latitudinal temperature gradient is reduced relative to today, resulting in warmer temperatures at high latitudes. The warmer climate and the presence of fresh basaltic provinces increase the weatherability of the continental surfaces, resulting in an enhanced consumption of atmospheric CO2 through weathering. First, the eruption of the Siberian traps is accompanied by a massive volume of C depleted CO2 degassed from the mantle and added to the ocean through silicate weathering, thus lowering marine dC. Second, the rapid collapse in productivity induces a strong decrease in the global organic carbon burial. This too tends to increase the proportion of light carbon in the ocean. These two effects can explain the low dC values across the PT boundary, and methane release need not be invoked to explain the dC fluctuations. It is proposed that the phosphorus cycle, which drives primary production in the model, plays an important role on the recovery of productivity and the dC variations. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.
