Vance\nKeywords: late Paleozoic ice age South China weathering trends early Wuchiapingian cooling Emeishan large igneous province\nThe last glaciation during the late Paleozoic ice age commenced at around the Guadalupian–Lopingian (G–L) boundary and is synchronous with the emplacement of the Emeishan large igneous province. Using CA-TIMS zircon U–Pb dating, we obtained an age of 259.51 ± 0.21 Ma for the uppermost tuff from the Puan volcanic sequence in the eastern Emeishan large igneous province, constraining the timing of Emeishan volcanism and providing another candidate age for the G–L boundary. In addition, we determined an age of 259.69 ± 0.72 Ma for a basal claystone in the immediately overlying Longtan Formation from a drill core section in southwest South China. These ages, along with source weathering trends of mudstones from the lower Longtan Formation, and compiled paleotemperature records, indicate an earliest Wuchiapingian cooling coinciding with the onset of the last Permian glaciation. This global cooling is associated with positive shifts in both organic and carbonate carbon isotopic records and likely a decrease in atmospheric pCO2. A hypothesised causal linkage is proposed in which the rapid posteruptive basaltic weathering of the Emeishan province in an equatorial humid belt may accelerate the atmospheric CO2 consumption and lead to climate cooling. Our work supports the long-term climate cooling effects of large igneous provinces.\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "text": "The late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) reached glacial maximum during the latest Carboniferous–early Permian and subsequently experienced stepwise demise through the Permian (Fielding et al., 2008; Montañez and Poulsen, 2013). The Permian warming trend was periodically punctuated by repeated middle-late Permian cooling (Montañez et al., 2007; Fielding et al., 2008), documented through the presence of glacial facies with glendonites and coldwater fauna in eastern Australia and elsewhere (Fielding et al., 2008; Waterhouse and Shi, 2013). Of these persistent Permian glaciations in eastern Australia, the last one has been constrained by high-precision zircon U–Pb dating to initiate at around the Guadalupian-Lopingian (G–L) boundary (∼260 Ma, Metcalfe et al., 2015), and thus coincides with the emplacement of the Emeishan large igneous province (LIP) (Zhong et al., 2014; He et al., 2007; Shellnutt et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2016).

However, the exact temporal correlation and mechanistic linkage between these two events are poorly constrained.\nTo improve our understanding on this topic, we here report new high-precision zircon U–Pb ages for the Emeishan LIP and the overlying Late Permian Longtan Formation in South China. These ages construct a chronostratigraphic framework to compare our new climate proxy data from the Longtan succession with the globally compiled climate records, and reveal a CO2-forced global climate cooling in response to the initiation of the last LPIA glaciation. This climate cooling is hypothesised to have a causal relationship with the post-eruptive weathering of Emeishan basalts in an equatorial humid belt."

    "heading": "2. The Late Permian terrigenous sedimentary systems in South China and Emeishan LIP",
    "text": "South China evolved as an isolated continental block during the Permian (Fig. 1). It occupied tropical latitudes in the eastern Paleo-Tethyan Ocean with the Panthalassa Ocean to the east. Across the G–L boundary, a large volume of terrigenous detritus\nwas deposited and overlay Middle Permian carbonate-dominated sequences in South China (Hu et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2014). These terrigenous detrital fluxes can be separated into two different sedimentary systems, one related to orogenesis along the southeast margin of South China (Hu et al., 2017) and the other to the Emeishan LIP in southwestern South China (Yang et al., 2014; He et al., 2007). For the latter system, the Late Permian detritus eroded from the Emeishan LIP were dominantly delivered into terrestrial, littoral and off-shore environments in the northern Youjiang Basin (Yang et al., 2014, Fig. 2).\nThe Emeishan LIP was emplaced in western South China at ∼260 Ma as constrained by bio- and magneto-stratigraphy (e.g., Sun et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012) and geochronology (He et al., 2007; Shellnutt et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017). This igneous province consists mainly of massive flood basalts and voluminous contemporaneous mafic and felsic\nintrusions with subordinate amounts of picrites, pyroclastic rock and basaltic andesites (Chung and Jahn, 1995; Xu et al., 2004). Two groups of high-Ti and low-Ti basalts are distinguished based on geochemical parameters with the former stratigraphically above the latter in the west but directly overlying the Middle Permian carbonates in the east of the province (Xu et al., 2004). Silicic volcanic eruptions may have an originally large volume, which has been estimated on the order of 104 km3 (Yang et al., 2015), but are now preserved as a very minor proportion due to subaerial erosion and tectonic disruption (He et al., 2007). The preserved volcanic sequences cover an area of more than 2.5 × 105 km2 with their thickness ranging from several hundred to ∼5000 m (Chung and Jahn, 1995; Xu et al., 2004).\nThe Youjiang Basin lies to the southeast of the Emeishan LIP and archived thick late Paleozoic–Triassic carbonates, cherts, mudstones and sandstones with intercalated basaltic rocks (Yang et al.,\n2014). The Late Permian detrital materials in the northern Youjiang Basin were derived from the Emeishan LIP are estimated at ∼3–4.5 × 104 km3 in volume and generally have a common source rock, which on average comprises, in weight percentage, ∼75% high-Ti basalts (HTB) and ∼25% silicic volcanic rocks (mainly of rhyolites, RH) (Yang et al., 2015)."

    "text": "Drill core Zk34381 from the northern Youjiang Basin, southwest Guizhou Province (Fig. 2), extends through the Early Triassic Yelang Formation, the Late Permian Changxing and Longtan formations to the top of the Middle Permian Maokou Formation (Fig. 2). The analysed Longtan Formation is mainly composed of mudstones, siltstones, and sandstones with intercalated coal seams and limestones, and is inferred to have accumulated in a littoral setting (Yang et al., 2014) with a northeast–southwest orientated shoreline lying to the northwest. It disconformably overlies the bioclastic limestones of the Maokou Formation. The selected hole provides the thickest section, some 700 m, in the study area through the Longtan Formation. The lower 480 m of the section is dominated by mudstones (Fig. 2) and sixty four samples were collected at high-resolution for bulk-rock mineral and geochemical analysis. One claystone sample from the bottom part of the core was also collected for zircon U–Pb dating. In addition, we collected a volcanic tuff sample for zircon U–Pb dating from the top part of a volcanic sequence near Puan county in the eastern Emeishan LIP. The Puan volcanic sequence is disconformably overlain by the Late Permian Longtan Formation and dominated by massive basaltic lava with pyroclastic rocks and tuffs at the bottom and top of the section (Fig. 2).\nZircon grains were extracted from the volcanic tuff sample PAP25 and claystone sample ZK3G1. They were analysed using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) at the Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IGGCAS) in Beijing and chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS) at the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory (NIGL), British Geological Survey, Nottingham, UK. Semiquantitative mineralogical XRD studies of all mudstone samples\nwere performed with a PANalytical X’Pert Pro model instrument at the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources (GPMR), China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). Bulkrock major element contents were determined on a PANalytical Axios X-ray florescence spectrometer at ALS Chemex (Guangzhou, China). The TOC (total organic carbon) and TN (total nitrogen) weight contents of mudstone samples were measured by an organic element analyser (Carbo-Erba model EA1110, Italy) at the State Key Laboratory of Marine Geology, Tongji University. The organic carbon isotopes of the mudstone samples were analysed using a Thermo Finnigan MAT 251 IRMS (isotope rate mass spectrometer) at GPMR, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). Analytical details are provided in the Supplementary file and data are listed in Tables S1–S5."

    "text": "The SIMS weighted mean 206Pb/238U age uncertainties are presented as ± X/Y, where X includes the analytical error and Y incorporates additional error from external reproducibility. Four analyses of Qinghu standard yield a weighted mean 206Pb/238U age of 159.2 ± 2.5 Ma (MSWD = 0.15), identical within error to the recommended age of 159.5 ± 0.2 Ma (Li et al., 2013). For CA-TIMS data, weighted mean date uncertainties are reported as ± X/Y/Z format, where X is the analytical error, Y includes both analytical and tracer calibration errors, Z incorporates additional uncertainties of U decay constant.\nZircons from sample PAP25 are mostly euhedral and range from 30 to 100 μm in length. All zircons show a clear oscillatory zoning (Fig. 3A). Thirty-two analyses of 32 zircons were obtained. They have U and Th contents and Th/U ratios of 62–943 ppm, 108–660 ppm, and 0.51–1.56, respectively. The measured Pb/U ratios are concordant within analytical errors (Fig. 3B). Apart from two spots with relatively high common Pb ( f 206 = 5.47 and 1.68), all other analyses have very low common Pb with f 206 values <0.60 and yield 206Pb/238U dates ranging from 262.0 Ma to 240.0 Ma. They give a weighted mean 206Pb/238U date of 252.5 ±\n2.0/3.2 Ma (n = 30, MSWD = 1.8; Fig. 3B), assuming an external reproducibility of ∼1% (Li et al., 2013) and no inherited/xenocrystic zircons.\nOf the SIMS dated PAP25 zircons, five crack-free, texturally uncomplicated grains from the youngest age populations with 206Pb/238U dates of 240.0–252.7 Ma were further dated by CATIMS (Fig. 3B). They yield 206Pb/238U dates ranging from 261.2 ± 1.4 Ma to 259.68 ± 0.34 Ma, much older than their respective SIMS dates (Fig. 3B). Except for one analysis (z7) with high common Pb and a slightly older 206Pb/238U age, the other grains have low common Pb and give a weighted mean age of 259.51 ± 0.19/0.21/0.35 Ma (n = 4, MSWD = 1.3).\nSample ZK3G1 collected from core Zk34381 is of small size. Very few zircon grains were separated from this sample and are quite small, less than ∼30 micros. Seven grains were chosen for CA-TIMS analysis, but only three analyses were successful and yield valid data with common Pb of 0.22–0.49 pg. They show consistent 206Pb/238U dates (Fig. 3B) and give a weighted mean date of 259.69 ± 0.72/0.72/0.78 Ma (n = 3, MSWD = 0.07) (Fig. 3B)."

    "heading": "4.2. Bulk-rock mineral, major element, TOC, TN and δ13Corg compositions",
    "text": "Analysed mudstones are mainly composed of clay minerals (40–63%), quartz (5–20%) and feldspar (0–13%). Calcite, pyrite, ankerite and siderite are also detected in most samples with contents generally <5% for calcite and pyrite, and <25% for ankerite and siderite. Illite, illite/smectite and chlorite are the dominant clay minerals. Clay/quartz ratio (CQR) varies in a range of 2.1–12.6 and clay/(clay + feldspar) (CCF) ratio changes from 0.80 to 1.00. The relatively high CQR (>6) ratios are due to the correspondingly low quartz content because CQR has a strong correlation with quartz content (r2 = 0.88) but no correlation with clay mineral content (r2 = 0.08).\nStudied samples have low content of SiO2 (35.33–47.37%), high content of TiO2 (1.89–3.66%) and variable contents of MgO (0.90–3.60%), Na2O (0.07–3.00%), K2O (1.0–4.99%), Al2O3 (8.59– 19.03%), Fe2O3T (3.96–16.00%) and CaO (1.73–11.77%). The high\nFe2O3T content corresponds with the presence of iron-bearing carbonate minerals (ankerite and siderite) and pyrite. Samples have low, relatively constant Al2O3/TiO2 ratios in the range of 4.54–6.93 with an average of 5.10. Their Al2O3/SiO2 ratio varies in a narrow range of 0.23–0.48 with an average of 0.38.\nContents of TOC and TN vary in the analysed samples and are mostly in the range of 0.73–3.87% and 0.16–0.39%, respectively. The TOC/TN ratio ranges from 4.3 to 15.0 (except one sample of 17.2) and is positively correlated with TOC content (r2 = 0.45). The δ13Corg value varies from −24.45 to −22.19 and has no co-varying relationship with TOC/TN ratio (r2 = 0.05). Through the succession, δ13Corg exhibit a striking positive shift from ∼−24.5 to ∼−22.5 at the bottom and then gradual decrease up section to ∼−23.5 with small fluctuations of ∼0.5 ."

    "heading": "4.3. Values of chemical weathering index: CIA, WIP and τ Na",
    "text": "Various chemical weathering indices were determined to quantify the intensity of subaerial chemical weathering. Of the widely used chemical weathering indices, Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA, Nesbitt and Young, 1982) is defined as Al2O3/(Al2O3 + Na2O + CaO∗ + K2O) × 100%, and Weathering Index (WIP, Parker, 1970) is expressed as CaO∗/0.7 + 2Na2O/0.35 + 2K2O/0.25 + MgO/0.9. Both are calculated using molecular proportions, and CaO∗ means the CaO in silicate minerals. Silicate CaO is corrected by first subtracting phosphate CaO based on P2O5 content (Fedo et al., 1995) and then making CaO∗ = NaO if the molar content of remaining CaO is higher than that of Na2O, otherwise using the remaining CaO as the CaO∗ (e.g., Yang et al., 2016). A third chemical weathering index, τ Na, denotes the chemical depletion of sodium in weathering materials relative to the fresh parent rocks using Zr or Ti as immobile elements (Rasmussen et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2016). It is calculated in this study as Namudstone/Timudstone/(NaSR/TiSR) − 1, where Namudstone and Timudstone represent the concentrations of Na and Ti in the analysed mudstones, and NaSR and TiSR mean the concentrations of Na and Ti in the average source rock (SR = 75% HTB + 25% RH, Yang et al., 2015). The calculated values range from 55 to 79 for CIA (Fig. 4A), from 0.32 to 0.55 for WIP, and from\n−0.96 to 0.43 for τ Na (Supplementary Table 4). The stratigraphic pattern of CIA shows a marked decrease (from ∼90 to ∼65) in the lower part of the core (1360–1260 m), large-magnitude fluctuations with two peaks (around 86–88) separated by a low (∼70) in the middle part (1260–1060 m), and constantly low values (ranging ∼70 to ∼55) in the upper part (1060–880 m) (Fig. 5). CIA values covary with CCF (positive correlation, r2 = 0.71), which measures the relative enrichment of clay minerals relative to feldspars and thus represents a mineral index of weathering intensity, WIP (negative correlation, r2 = 0.55) and τ Na (negative correlation, r2 = 0.96) in the sampled succession (Fig. 5)."

    "heading": "5. Timing of the Emeishan volcanism",
    "text": "The Emeishan volcanic rocks overlie the Middle Permian carbonates and underlie the Late Permian–Triassic clastic rocks, and thus their eruptions can be broadly constrained in the late Permian period (Xu et al., 2004; Chung and Jahn, 1995). Detailed conodont biostratigraphy of the underlying limestones constrains the initial eruptive unit to the late Guadalupian (mid-late Capitanian, Sun et al., 2010), corresponding to an absolute age of ∼262 Ma on the basis of the current Permian timescale (Henderson, 2018). For the Emeishan basaltic sequences, a simple normal-reverse magnetostratigraphic pattern has been confirmed across the province and indicates a short duration (<3 million years) of volcanism (Liu et al., 2012 and references therein). Based on 40Ar/39Ar dating, Emeishan HTB has been constrained to ∼251–253 Ma (Lo et al., 2002), or 260.1 ± 1.2 Ma (Li et al., 2017). Using LA-ICPMS and SHRIMP zircon geochronology, a volcanic tuff from the uppermost Panxian basaltic succession has been dated at 251.0 ± 1.0 Ma (Zhu et al., 2011), a basaltic andesite intercalated within the HTB from the Binchuan succession at 256.2 ± 1.4 Ma (Tang et al., 2015), and silicic ash beds bracketing Emeishan basalts at 260.4 ± 1.2 Ma and 260.4 ± 1.7 Ma, respectively (Huang et al., 2016). The most accurate and precise CA-TIMS zircon U–Pb dating gave an average age of 259.1 ± 0.5 Ma for the top ignimbrite in the Binchuan succession (Zhong et al., 2014). Our new CA-TIMS zircon dating on the top tuff from the Puan volcanic succession yielded an age identical within error to that of the Binchuan ignimbrite. This age is in agreement with the biostratigraphic constraints provided by the overlying Wuchiapingian strata and requires that the Emeishan LIP volcanism was of short duration and likely terminated by ∼259 Ma. This age is in agreement with the latest 40Ar/39Ar age for the HTB (∼260 Ma, Li et al., 2017) whereas the previous latest Permian 40Ar/39Ar ages for the HTB (∼252 Ma) are problematic as they occur below the dated Binchuan ignimbrite (∼259.1 Ma). The younger ages (Lo et al., 2002) might be a consequence of ra-\ndiogenic argon loss. Similarly, younger zircon U–Pb ages for the Binchuan basaltic andesite (Tang et al., 2015) and the Panxian tuff (Zhu et al., 2011) may result from partial radiogenic lead loss and have no interpretable geological significance.\nLead loss has long been recognised in zircon U–Pb geochronology and its pervasive effects, making discordant, younger and scatter dates, can be effectively mitigated, if not eliminated, by pretreating zircon factions through CA process before U–Pb isotope analysis (e.g., Mundil et al., 2004). This open-system behaviour can be cryptic with affected zircon domains hard to distinguish by CL imaging and resolve by micro-beam dating (Watts et al., 2016). Without CA pretreatment, the Puan tuff yields a SIMS zircon U– Pb age comparable to the LA-ICPMS zircon age for the Panxian tuff. However, CA-TIMS dating on zircons from the youngest SIMS population displays individual dates ∼3–8% older than the corresponding SIMS dates and gave an age that is reasonable with respect to biostratigraphic constraints from the enclosing strata. Our combined SIMS and CA-TIMIS U–Pb dating on the same zircon grains demonstrates the effects of lead loss and cautions geological age interpretations."

    "heading": "6. Influences of non-weathering factors on weathering index trends",
    "text": "Stratigraphic variations of mudstone CIA, WIP, τ Na and CCF values represent not only temporal weathering trends of source region, but also the influence of changing provenance, sedimentary recycling, hydraulic sorting, and diagenesis on mudstone compositions (Yang et al., 2016; Garzanti et al., 2013; Cawood et al., 2003).\nCarbonate minerals (calcite, ankerite and siderite) are present in the mudstones and indicative of carbonate precipitation and replacement during the conversion of muds into mudstones. Their formation may involve transportation of Ca2+ , Mg2+ and Fe2+ in pore waters and degradation of organic matter by microbiological or inorganic reactions to bicarbonate. This kind of diagenesis will not significantly influence the CCF, CIA, and τ Na values, but will increase WIP values by adding Mg or decrease WIP values by acquiring additional Fe and other elements not involved in WIP calculation (Garzanti et al., 2013; Parker, 1970). Illitization may also affect mudstones during diagenesis. This is shown by the predominance of illite and illite/smectite in the clay minerals of mudstones, and characterised by high K2O content and positive correlation (r2 = 0.76) of K2O/Al2O3 ratio with CIA value (van de Kamp, 2016). On the A–CN–K (Al2O3–Na2O + CaO–K2O) diagram analysed samples display a trend in which samples with low CIA (≤65) parallel the A–CN line, mimicking the ideal weathering trend of the average source rock (Fig. 4A; Fedo et al., 1995). Sam-\nples with higher CIA (>65) lie well below this ideal weathering trend, tending to be gradually more enriched in K2O than expected (Fig. 4A). Such an A–CN–K plot supports our previous estimate for the average source work composition of the Late Permian terrigenous sediments in northern Youjiang Basin (Yang et al., 2015), and also signifies potassium metasomatism especially for samples with CIA value >65 (Fig. 4B). This K-enrichment involves addition of K2O to aluminous clays forming authigenic illite (illite/smectite) and results in samples plotting toward the K apex of the A–CN– K triangle (Fedo et al., 1995). It results in lower CIA values and higher WIP, but should not influence the τ Na values.\nFollowing Fedo et al. (1995), the pre-metasomatized CIA (CIA∗) should be represented by the point, where the line emanating from the K apex and running through the analysed sample intersects the predicted SR weathering trend (Fig. 4B). We ascertain the CIA∗ values for samples based on the newly derived equation involving the compositions of analysed samples and the inferred average source rock, and the ideal SR weathering trend in the A–CN–K diagram (Fig. 4). Obtained CIA∗ varies from 55–91 and displays strong positive correlations with CIA (r2 = 0.96), suggesting that this correction eliminates the effects of K-metasomatism on CIA value without changing its temporal trend. A K2O molar content is then calculated from CIA∗ values for each sample and used to obtain a corrected WIP∗ value. All mudstones except one show a covariation between CIA∗ and WIP∗ along the inferred SR weathering trend (Fig. S1), indicating little or no influence from sedimentary recycling (Garzanti et al., 2013). This view is supported by the fact that the disconformably underlying Maokou carbonates cannot provide substantial silicate detritus.\nAl2O3/SiO2 ratio is a chemical indicator of hydraulic sorting and reflects the concentration of clay minerals in muds, and quartz and feldspar in sands (Lupker et al., 2013). Its poor correlations (r2 < 0.10) with CIA∗, WIP∗ and τ Na imply that the variations of these weathering index values are not controlled by the sedimentary sorting process. This conclusion is also supported by the poor negative correlation between CCF and CQR (in contrast to a sorting-induced covarying relationship), though some samples of the upper succession have much higher CQR ratios because of low quartz content. Al2O3/TiO2 ratio is used to monitor the potential changes in source rock composition. Its overall narrow range of 4.5–5.5 is slightly higher than that of the HTB, but markedly lower than that of Emeishan silicic volcanic rocks (Yang et al.,\n2015). This range is also slightly higher than that of the inferred SR (∼4.1) and, in consideration with the A–CN–K source determination, possibly reflects an enrichment of Al-bearing clay minerals over Ti-bearing heavy minerals in mudstones. Samples low in the section have Al2O3/TiO2 ratios higher than those from the upper parts of the section (Fig. 5), a stratigraphic trend also observed for the Late Permian terrestrial successions (He et al., 2007). Thus, it is likely that these sediments received more contribution from the Emeishan silicic volcanic detritus than the overlying deposits (He et al., 2007). Through the succession, however, CIA∗ , WIP∗, τ Na and CCF values have no explicit correlations with Al2O3/TiO2 ratio (r2 < 0.10), and this argues against an attribution of their temporal variations to sedimentary provenance. By either excluding or correcting the effects of non-weathering processes, CIA∗, WIP∗, τ Na and CCF document highly consistent weathering trends for the Emeishan volcanic source in the early Wuchiapingian (Fig. 5)."

Compiled dates with large uncertainties were excluded from plotting and calculating average age. It is clear that the felsic extrusions from the uppermost Emeishan volcanic successions are well constrained to ∼260–259 Ma, and overlap in age with mafic dyke and syenite intrusions (Fig. 6). It has been argued that the top felsic volcanic rocks in Emeishan LIP are in the same stratigraphic level as, and considered the dominate source for, the G–L boundary claystones in SW China (He et al., 2007; Zhong et al., 2014). The CA-TIMS age of the Binchuan ignimbrite (259.1 ± 0.5 Ma) is currently accepted by the International Commission on Stratigraphy as the G–L boundary age (http://permian . stratigraphy.org /per /per.asp). Such an age is relatively younger than adopted age of 259.8 ± 0.4 Ma by Ogg et al. (2016). Considering that the Puan tuff is also stratigraphically positioned at the top of Emeishan volcanic sequence, similar to the Binchuan ignimbrite whose age has been used to constrain the time of the bio-stratigraphically defined G–L boundary (Henderson, 2018;\nYuan et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2014), the CA-TIMS age reported herein for this tuff (259.51 ± 0.19/0.21/0.35 Ma) could provide another candidate for the G–L boundary age. Our new CA-TIMS dates have relatively smaller uncertainties and benefit from use of precisely calibrated EARTHTIME tracer solution of ET2535, new error propagation algorithms and improved data acquisition and reduction techniques (see methods). In this regard, we here tentatively set the G–L boundary at 259.5 ± 0.2 Ma in the following stratigraphic and climate correlations (Fig. 6). Claystone from the basal Longtan Formation in core Zk34381 contains volcanic zircons with CA-TIMS age (259.69 ± 0.72/0.72/0.78 Ma) well correlated with that of Puan tuff, though this age is only based on three zircon grains. Consequently, the sampled succession from this core section should represent the early Wuchiapingian deposits."

    "text": "During the Permian, SW South China occupied a passive margin of the Paleo-Tethyan Ocean with marine-terrestrial carbonate and siliciclastic deposition in a stable tectonic setting (Yang et al., 2014). For South China, a humid climate can be independently determined from intercalated coal seams and ever-wet paleo-floras in the Middle-Late Permian sequences (Glasspool et al., 2004; Tabor and Poulsen, 2008). Thus, the Emeishan volcanic landscapes should not suffer from rapid tectonically-induced physical erosion and the weathering regime in the source region is likely supply-limited instead of kinetically limited by moisture availability (Rasmussen et al., 2011). In supply-limited weathering regimes, landscape surface soil weathering intensity (soil WI) is primarily modulated by climate conditions (Rasmussen et al., 2011; Ferrier et al., 2016). For worldwide granitic landscapes with lowmoderate physical erosion rates and with no water deficit, surface soil WI (indexed as τ Na) is strongly correlated with mean annual air temperature (MAT) (Yang et al., 2016). Temperature has also been demonstrated as a dominant variable exerting control on the weathering extent of basaltic soils in moist Iceland (Óskarsson et al., 2012). Moreover, coastal estuary muds originating from land surface soils have CIA values largely controlled by MAT (Li and Yang, 2010). Given the moist climate in South China in the Middle-Late Permian, the sequential variation in mudstone WI could explain the temporal change in drainage MAT with higher/lower WI denoting warmer/cooler MAT (e.g., Nesbitt and Young, 1982). In this way, the acquired weathering trends indicate a rapid cooling followed by an overall cool climate state intercalated with two transient warm periods in the early Wuchiapingian. A cool-temperate climate for the Wuchiapingian in South China is in concert with low, possibly underestimated, MATs of 6.7–9.1 ◦C from foliar physiognomy of gigantopterids in the Longtan Formation (Glasspool et al., 2004).\nCA-TIMS zircon ages and latest calibrated tetrapod and conodont biostratigraphy provide a marked improvement on the stratigraphic resolution and correlation across the G–L transi-\ntion (Fig. 6 and Table S6). Using this high-precision stratigraphic framework, the indicated earliest Wuchiapingian terrestrial cooling in South China is correlated with a prominent increase of conodont δ18O in the eastern Tethyan Ocean (Chen et al., 2011), a slight decrease in apatite δ18O of therapsids in South Africa (Rey et al., 2016), and despite poor age constraint, a modest enhancement of paleosol salinization in Antarctica (Portal Mountain) (Sheldon et al., 2014). These climate proxy data indicate a consistent climate cooling event in the earliest Wuchiapingian (Fig. 7) and are consistent with an obvious lowering in taxonomic diversity of benthic foraminifers in North America shelves (Davydov, 2014). This cooling corresponds to the synchronous reoccurrence of glacially-influenced deposits after the late Capitanian non-glacial interval in eastern Australia (Fielding et al., 2008; Metcalfe et al., 2015). This glacial epoch has a series of cold pulses separated by warmer events (Fielding et al., 2008), resembling the WI-indicated climate pattern in South China (Fig. 5).\n7.3. Atmospheric pCO2 decline in the earliest Wuchiapingian\nThe analysed succession in South China reveals a primary positive shift of ∼2 in δ13Corg in association with the earliest Wuchiapingian cooling (Fig. 6). The δ13Corg and TOC/TN ratio are poorly correlated, and their ranges indicate a dominant source from marine algae with minor mixing of materials from terrestrial sources (Birgenheier et al., 2010). Sedimentologic and lithological features are also uniform through the analysed section indicating little or no change in sedimentary environment. These features argue against a relationship between temporal shifts in δ13Corg and changes in the source of organic matter. A similar δ13Corg-climate relationship has been reported from the Permian records in eastern Australia with positive excursions corresponding to cooling and initial glaciation (Birgenheier et al., 2010; Frank et al., 2015). From a global compilation of carbonate and organic carbon isotopic records (δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg) (Fig. 1; Baud et al., 1989; Retallack et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2013; Jost et al., 2014), there are distinct positive shifts of ∼3–7 for δ13Ccarb and ∼2–4 for δ13Corg in the earliest Wuchiapingian (within the first three conodont bio-zones of Clarkina postbitteri postbitteri, C. dukouensis and C. asymmetrica; Yuan et al., 2017; Fig. 8). Such a ubiquitous earliest Wuchiapingian δ13C positive shift cannot be explained entirely by local controls, like burial or diagenetic effects (Jost et al., 2014), without perturbation to the global carbon cycle. Thus, the increase in δ13C associated with the earliest Wuchiapingian climate cooling could indirectly reflect a decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration (Birgenheier et al., 2010; Frank et al., 2015) and illustrates a CO2-forced climate fluctuation (Montañez et al., 2007). This view is consistent with a moderately low atmospheric CO2 concentration (484–547 ppmv) for the early Wuchiapingian, similar to that proposed for the Oligocene-Miocene icehouse, but much lower than the Mesozoic greenhouse levels, using a leaf gas exchange based model (Franks et al., 2014)."

    "heading": "8. A cooling mechanism: post-eruptive Emeishan basaltic weathering?",
    "text": "The earliest Wuchiapingian climate cooling during the onset of the last LPIA glaciation has been attributed to an increase of organic carbon burial rate and resultant atmospheric pCO2 drawdown (Birgenheier et al., 2010; Frank et al., 2015). The synchronicity of Emeishan LIP emplacement with the earliest Wuchiapingian cooling has also led to models in which massive sulphur gas emissions associated with LIP volcanism have been linked to this climate event (Yang et al., 2015 and references therein). We here advocate a long-term causal mechanism involving post-eruptive weathering of the Emeishan continental flood basalts.\nContinental silicate weathering consumes and stabilises Earth’s atmospheric CO2, providing a negative feedback to maintain the homeostatic balance of the long-term (>∼105 yrs) carbon cycle (e.g., Gaillardet et al., 1999). With relatively high weathering rates, basalts, covering only ∼3.5% to ∼5% of the present-day global land surface, contribute some 30% to 35% of CO2 flux derived from continental silicate weathering (Gaillardet et al., 1999; Li et al., 2016 and references therein). Emplacements of Deccan Traps (Dessert et al., 2001) and Central Atlantic Igneous Province (CAMP, Schaller et al., 2012) were suggested to have an overall net-cooling effect by decreasing pCO2 to below pre-eruptive levels. A similar hypotheses was also proposed for the onset of Sturtian glaciation through the weathering of northern Rodinia flood basalts in the early-middle Neoproterozoic, which lead to accelerated atmospheric CO2 consumption and triggered global cooling (Cox et al., 2016).\nComparing with Deccan Traps (∼5 × 105 km2), CAMP (∼1.12 × 107 km2) and the combined northern Rodinia LIPs (>5 × 106 km2), the preserved area (∼2.5 × 105 km2) of the Emeishan LIP is quite small. However, we note that during the middle-late Permian, the great continental land mass of Pangea occupied an area of ∼1.5 × 107 km2 between 10◦N and 10◦S in the tropical belt (Fig. 1), and this region was characterised by widely developed evaporates and calcretes indicative of a semi-arid to arid climate (Tabor and Poulsen, 2008). Weathering of the granitic continental crust within this region would be virtually inhibited and cause low CO2-consumption rate probably analogous to that in the present day tropical Africa, where the average CO2-consumption rate is estimated at ∼3.87 × 104 mol km−2 yr−1 based on Nile, Congo–Zaire and Niger river data (Gaillardet et al., 1999). In contrast, South China had an equatorial humid environment during that time (Tabor and Poulsen, 2008). The post-eruptive weathering rate of\nthe Emeishan basaltic province would be relatively high as in modern basaltic islands in SE Asia, from which the CO2-consumption rates are estimated to range from 1.9 × 106 mol km−2 yr−1 to 3.6 × 106 mol km−2 yr−1 (Li et al., 2016 and references therein). Taking these estimated CO2-consumption rates and using the residual area for the Emeishan LIP, the post-eruptive weathering of Emeishan basaltic province would amplify the CO2-consumption effect of the equatorial continent silicate weathering by 1.8–2.5 times, and would likely have caused atmospheric pCO2 to decline below the pre-LIP levels, and thus climate cooling based on the geochemical modelling (Schaller et al., 2012). This calculated amplification of CO2-consumption effect of silicate weathering is probably a minimum estimate because the original area of the Emeishan LIP can be extended in excess of 5 × 105 km2 (Xiao et al., 2004). Although, some early Emeishan flows may be subaqueous and escape the post-eruptive weathering, the bulk terrestrial nature of the Emeishan volcanic sequences, the disconformable contacts with the overlying Late Permian deposits (e.g., Xu et al., 2004; He et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2016) and the development of extensive weathering crusts at these contacts argue for a substantial, post-eruptive exposure of the volcanic province during the earliest Wuchiapingian. This inference is strongly supported by the earliest Wuchiapingian onset of massive, Emeishan LIP derived, terrigenous detrital input into the terrestrial-littoral-offshore sedimentary system in SW South China (He et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2014, 2015), Therefore, the emplacement of Emeishan LIP in the equatorial humid belt would likely have had a significant impact in accelerating global silicate weathering, leading to lowered atmospheric pCO2 and climate cooling during the earliest Wuchiapingian. Our geochronological and climate-proxy data support this hypothesis, and provide robust evidence for climate cooling and pCO2 decline immediately following Emeishan volcanism."

    "text": "New high-precision CA-TIMS zircon U–Pb ages are reported for a volcanic tuff in the uppermost Puan volcanic sequence from the Emeishan LIP and from a basal claystone of the overlying Late Permian Longtan Formation in southwestern South China. By comparing with recently obtained CA-TIMS zircon ages for the Emeishan LIP and the late Capitanian-early Wuchiapingian clay/ash beds, our dating work gives a new age constraint of 259.5 ± 0.2 Ma for the G–L boundary. From the lower Longtan Formation, mudstone mineral-geochemical compositions are analysed and document a source weathering trends with a significant weathering intensity\ndecrease indicative of climate cooling in the earliest Wuchiapingian. This cooling is global in scale and corresponds with the onset of the last Permian glaciation in the eastern Australia. It is associated with positive shifts in both carbonate and organic carbon isotopic records and atmospheric pCO2 decrease. Such CO2-forced climate cooling is synchronous with the rapid post-eruptive weathering of the Emeishan basaltic rocks in an equatorial humid belt, and may indicate a causal relationship with the latter. This study underlies the importance of LIP emplacement to the secular climate change."
