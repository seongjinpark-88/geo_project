The diatomite accumulated in a small ~1.5 km diameter maar-floored lake that formed during basaltic volcanism. Except for exposures of basanite dated at 23.2 Ma by 40Ar/39Ar, and remnants of a Paleogene sandstone and conglomerate cover, the diatomite body is surrounded by Otago Schist. Geophysical profiles indicate that the total diatomaceous sediment thickness may exceed 100 m. Two depositional facies are described from 15.5 m of weakly-consolidated fresh diatomite accessible in two pits. A thinly laminated facies, comprising 60% of the section, consists of dark brown and white couplets of average thickness 0.5 mm. Both brown and white laminae are composed essentially of frustules of a single pennate diatom, along with 1–2% of siliceous sponge spicules. Dark laminae also contain abundant 5–7.5 µm diameter siliceous chrysophycean stomatocysts and organic matter. Decalcified complete skeletons of Galaxias, a southern hemisphere group of freshwater or diadromous fish, are found throughout. Diverse well-preserved leaves, some with attached scale insects, are dominated by Lauraceae. Rare flowers are also present. Trace fossils preserved in the laminated comprise 1–1.5 mm wide pale diatomaceous strings of probable faecal origin, and isolated 20–40 mm diameter sand lenses interpreted as faecal remains of swimming waterfowl. The second diatomite facies group comprises dark brown speckled beds, interpreted as sediment gravity flows. Up to 14 cm thick and interspersed throughout the study section, they incorporate abundant laminated diatomite flecks and leaves, and minor woody plant matter and terrigenous silt. Almost all are capped by 1–8 mm of white diatomite that is interpreted as post-flow fall-out of resuspended diatom frustules. Associated breccia and swirly beds up to 8 cm thick are composed of variably contorted clasts of laminated diatomite in a speckled matrix. Nodules, spheroids, and films of authigenic framboidal pyrite are commonly associated with plant and fish remains. As in modern lakes, white laminae likely formed from diatom blooms when light flux, temperature, or nutrients were optimal during spring–early summer; dark laminae accumulating during autumn–winter months. Laterally continuous pinstripe lamination, absence of bioturbation, and excellent fish and plant preservation indicate that the profundal lake and floor were anoxic. Periodic variations in couplet thickness of ~3–10 years compare with Quaternary records of El Niño–Southern Oscillation variability and indicate that the early Early Miocene low altitude New Zealand climate was seasonal and strongly ocean-influenced, as it is today.\n© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "Maar crater lakes are attractive sites for paleoclimatic research because of their small surface catchments, simple basin morphology, and rapid sediment accumulation (Lamb et al., 2000; Lamb, 2001). The purpose of this paper is to provide a first account of the sedimentology and cyclicity of an Early Miocene laminated, biogenically varved diatomite succession from Foulden Marr, Waipiata\nll rights reserved.\nvolcanic Field, southern South Island, New Zealand (Figs. 1, 2). Laminated sediments similar to those described here have been shown to provide exceptional high resolution records of proxy climate information (e.g., Vos et al., 1997; Lücke et al., 2003). On the basis of studies of nonmarine macrofauna, macroflora, pollen and spores (Pocknall and Mildenhall, 1984; Mildenhall and Pocknall, 1989; Pocknall, 1989; Molnar and Pole, 1997; Pole, 2003; Pole et al., 2003; Bannister et al., 2005), sedimentation patterns (Douglas, 1986; Isaac and Lindqvist, 1990), and coastal fauna, Miocene south-eastern New Zealand is considered to have been of low topographic relief and to have had a warm temperate to subtropical, humid but at times seasonally dry, maritime climate. The presence of Early Miocene\ncolonial corals in North Island (Campbell et al., 2004) also indicates that sub-tropical sea temperatures existed in the New Zealand region during this time."

    "heading": "2. Geological setting of Foulden Maar",
    "text": "The diatomite deposit is located on private farmland 45 km northwest of Dunedin near Middlemarch township (Figs. 1, 2). The lake basin, here referred to as Foulden Maar, is likely to have formed during phreatic eruption as groundwater in schist country rock and/or surface waters came into contact with rising basaltic magma. Foulden Maar is one of at least two diatomaceous sediment-filled maar craters in the region (Travis, 1965; Youngson, 1993). Its diatomitefill occupies a circular basin surrounded by regionally extensive Otago Schist (Jurassic) and remnants of Early Miocene basanitic plugs, dykes or flows that form part of the Waipiata Volcanic Field (Németh and White, 2003). A radiometric 40Ar/39Ar age of 23.2 Ma (C. Timms, pers. comm. 2007) has been obtained from one basanite outcrop at Holly Hill on the southwest flank of the basin (Fig. 2). Early Miocene radiometric dates from other volcanic samples within a radius of c. 10 km of the study area range from 19.0–23.3 Ma (Coombs et al., 2008). This is supported by studies of pollen and spores in the diatomite (Bannister et al., 2005).\nThe diatomite forms an asymmetrical closed synclinal structure with moderate (~10°) depositional onlap contact onto schist along the west and south boundaries, and steep, possibly faulted and overthrust contacts on the east and north margins (Fig. 2). Diatomite exposed in four test pits shows minor low-angle thrust faulting, kink folding, and some larger post-depositional fold structures. Shallow aircore drilling indicates that the diatomite body occupies an area of 0.85 km2. The original lake may have exceeded 1.5 km in diameter. Seismic reflection surveys (Gorman et al., 2006) suggest that the\npreserved thickness of diatomite exceeds 100 m but has yet to be confirmed by deep drilling. Almost-in-place blocks and boulders of silicified quartz and schist pebble conglomerate and sandstone also found on the margin of the diatomite deposit are remnants of Pakaha Group, a Late Cretaceous–Paleogene transgressive wedge of nonmarine and shallowmarine siliciclastic shelf sediments. The diatomite is overlain by west-dipping Late Quaternary alluvial fan gravels composed of locally-derived schist and minor volcanic boulders set in sandy silt matrix (Figs. 2–4)."

    "heading": "3. Study sections and sampling methods",
    "text": "For this study a composite 15.5 m thick stratigraphic column was logged from block samples collected from Pits A and B which are 125 m apart. Unequivocal correlation between the two sites is based on a 2 m thick overlap interval between the upper beds of Pit B and lower beds of Pit A (Figs. 5, 6).\nBoth pits were temporarily deepened with a mechanical digger. The diatomite is weakly consolidated and has a dry density of 0.35 g/cm3. Forty-five stratigraphically overlapping blocks of fresh diatomite between 40 and 80 cm high and 20×20 cm wide were cut from the pit walls and floor with a chainsaw equipped with standard steel-toothed chain. The blocks were protected from moisture loss and breakage with several coats of acrylic paint. After partially embedding each coated block in sand-cement slurry in a plywood tray, its top surface was trimmed flat with a chainsaw and smoothed by scraping and hand rubbing under water spray. The blocks were photographed in stratal increments of 10 to 25 cm with a digital SLR camera. Best photographic results were obtained with the use of a polarizing filter, low-angle direct sunlight, and with diatomite surfaces level and water flooded. A detailed facies analysis was carried out using fresh block samples and the photographic log."

    "heading": "4. Sedimentary facies",
    "text": "The available section is composed of two diatomite facies groups: (1), very fissile laminated diatomite, and (2), speckled beds. In addition, thin green diatomaceous clay laminae of possible volcanic ash origin, and several thin sand layers associated with speckled beds, were found near the base of the succession. Near-surface diatomite is oxidized to a yellowishwhite or orange-brown colour to a depth of 1 to 2.5 m. Details of sedimentary features are visible only on fresh exposures. No carbonates are known from the diatomite section."

    "heading": "4.1. Laminated diatomite facies",
    "text": "This facies, representing 60% of the 15.5 m succession, consists of thinly laminated dark brown and white lamina-pairs or couplets (Figs. 4C, 5, 6). Individual couplets are 0.1–3 mm thick, with a mean thickness of ~0.5 mm. White layers typically form 80–95% of the thickness of each couplet. Much of the laminated facies consists of\nsmall groups of between two and eight or more couplets of distinctly uniform appearance and similar or gradually changing thickness that form apparent depositional cycles. Examples of grouped laminae are shown in Fig. 6, between speckled beds SB1 and SB2, and SB2 and SB3 (see also Fig. 9). The thickest (b0.5 mm) dark divisions are usually distinguishable from very thin speckled beds by the absence of visible silt and homogenous black appearance.\nWell-preserved frustules of a single small pennate diatom Encyonema jordanii (Grunow) Mills [syn. Cymbella jordanii Grunow] (M. Harper pers. comm. 2003; Bannister et al., 2005) are the main component of both the dark brown and white layers (Fig. 7A). Very rare centric diatoms have also been found in a few samples (U. Kaulfuss, pers. comm. 2009). Siliceous sponge spicules comprise b1–2% of the diatomite (Fig. 7B), and siliceous chrysophycean stomatocysts b1%. Chrysophycean stomatocysts are very common in the dark brown laminae where they occur in small planar aggregates 1–5 stomatocysts thick in association with amorphous organic matter (Fig. 7C–E).\nFossil fish preserved as complete, but decalified and partly pyritereplaced skeletons in the laminated facies belong to a single species of Galaxias (Fig. 8). Individual fish appear to be irregularly preserved in low concentrations throughout the Foulden section (Lee et al., 2007). Modern galaxiids are confined to the Southern Hemisphere and include both freshwater and diadromous species (McDowall, 1966; Barriga et al., 2007). The only invertebrate fossils known from the diatomite are scale insects attached to leaves (Harris et al., 2007) and recently discovered adult and larval forms of free-living insects (U. Kaulfuss, pers. comm. 2009). Insect feeding traces on leaves preserved in the laminated facies have yet to be described (J. M. Bannister, pers. comm.).\nAlthough no trace fossils for which infer an infaunal origin have been identified from the laminated facies, two coprolite morphotypes are present (Fig. 9). Type 1 coprolites are elongate strings of pale diatomaceous sediment 3–15 mm in length, 1–1.5 mm in diameter, and 0.1–0.2mmdeep (Fig. 9A.). Thinly dispersed on bedding planes at irregular intervals, individual examples of this morphotype are either straight, gently curved, or show obtuse bending in plane view. Interpreted as faecal strings of fish or invertebrates, they have a weakly preserved segmented structure, elliptical cross section, and do not branch or crosscut laminations. Type 2 coprolites are isolated inclusions of fine-grained quartzose sand up to 3mm thick (Fig. 9B, C). Found throughout the laminated facies, the sand inclusions are lenticular in cross-section, up to 40 mm diameter, and subcircular in\nplan view. They show no evidence of erosion of the diatom ooze substrate during deposition and are identified as faecal remains of swimming waterfowl, possibly of ducks.\nLeaves derived mainly from forest trees and lianes are generally preserved in the laminated facies in concentrations of approximately one leaf per 1–5 m2 of bedding surface but are locally more abundant. The angiosperm leaves are generally thick, entire and only weakly carbonised, and commonly have very well preserved cuticle. Some are large, up to 20 cm long. While over 40% belong to three genera of Lauraceae, other families representedby leaves include Podocarpaceae (Pole, 1996), Araliaceae, Cunoniaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Myrsinaceae, Myrtaceae, and several monocots (J. M. Bannister, pers. comm. 2008; Conran et al., 2009). One fossil flower with in-situ pollen has been described (Bannister et al., 2005). Small pyritereplaced 2–5 mm diameter spheroidal seeds are found throughout.\nDistinctive dark green (10GY4/4) 1–2mm thick diatomaceous clay layers loggedwithin the lowermetre of section (Fig. 5) are considered to be altered volcanic ash laminae."

    "heading": "4.2. Speckled, breccia, and swirly beds",
    "text": "Speckled beds (SBs) are named after marine diatomaceous beds described by Chang and Grimm (1999). Comparable beds distributed throughout the FouldenMaar section decrease in proportion from 46% in the lower half of the section to 33% in the upper part (Fig. 5). Most\n(90%) are between 2 mm and 50 mm thick, with a maximum thickness of 140mm andmean thickness of 9.8 mm. SBs have a dark brown to black groundmass and commonly include up to 25% of white lenticular diatomite specks or flakes up to 2 mm thick and 5–30 mm diameter. They contain abundant leafy plant litter and a small amount (b1–2%) of fine quartzose silt. Bases of speckled beds are sharply defined and usually display little to no erosional relief. Many SBs display weak normal textural and colour grading, with the size and proportion of white specks diminishing upward concomitantly with darkening of the groundmass.Whilemost consist of a singlemain bed, some are composed of two or three divisions (Fig. 6). Almost all include a prominent topmost layer of clean white diatomite. The white layers, which served as a practical ‘way-up’ criteria during block sampling operations, are up to 8mm thickwhere they cap the thickest SBs but more commonly range from b1.5–4mm. The contact between each speckled bed and the capping white layer is usually planar, with a sharp gradation over b0.5 mm. A few contacts (e.g. above speckled bed SB5d; Fig. 6) show flame-like deformation structures. Thicker white layers commonly display distinctive diagenetic ‘bright spots’ (Fig. 6), a likely result of weak incipient cementation associated with inversion of opaline silica to cristobalite or quartz.\nChannelling, with erosional relief of 5–50 mm, is most evident beneath relatively rare speckled beds that include large intact rip-up clasts of laminated diatomite up to 50 mm across. The lamination pattern within clasts in these beds locally matches that of the immediately underlying substrate (Fig. 10). A further variant of this facies group, ‘swirly beds’ comprise 0.5–5 cm thick intervals of highly contorted laminated diatomite, a few of which are directly overlain by beds that display a typical speckled fabric and white capping diatomite layer. As in the laminated facies, speckled beds show high lateral continuity in outcrop. Within the stratigraphic overlap interval between the Pits A and B several reduce in thickness from south-tonorth but most maintain a near-constant thickness over this 125 m distance (Figs. 5, 6).\nThree tabular sand layers 6 mm, 8 mm, and 9 mm thick logged near the base of the composite section in Pit B (Fig. 5) are composed of moderately well sorted fine-medium grained schistose quartz grains. A further 5–8 mm thick sandy layer at 11.4 m in Pit A (Fig. 5) includes abundant elongate schist fragments up to 12 mm in length. Each sand layer forms the basal division of a speckled diatomite bed that is typically capped by a thin white diatomite layer. Rounded pale greenish grey clay grains up to granule size associated with the\nquartzose sandy base of a speckled bed from Pit C (Fig. 2) are considered to be altered volcanic lapilli. Yet to be studied in detail, they provide evidence of contemporaneous volcanic activity.\nPyrite is a minor but widespread diagenetic component in the diatomite, as nodules up to 5 cm diameter of coarsely crystalline pyrite cement within wood fragments, and as concentrations of 15–20 µm diameter framboids; spheroidal aggregates of ~1 µm pyrite euhedra associated with leafy plant litter. X-radiographs of 6–8 mm thick diatomite slices sawn normal to bedding indicate that diagenetic pyrite is mainly associated with organic-rich speckled beds, often showing a gradational upwards increase that probably reflects the upward increase in plant-derived organic matter (Fig. 11)."

    "heading": "5.1. Biogenic varves in the laminated facies",
    "text": "On the basis of their content, high lateral continuity, consistent thickness, and occurrence in lamina-sets of similar appearance and uniform or gradually changing thickness, dark brown and white couplets constituting the laminated facies are presumed to\nrepresent seasonally-mediated annual depositional cycles. They resemble lacustrine varves of biogenic origin described by many authors (e.g. Anderson and Dean, 1988; Livingstone and Hajdas 2001; Chu et al., 2005; Martínez-Mekler et al., 2007). Each pale layer within a couplet is inferred to be a result of seasonal diatom bloom, presumably during the spring-summer period; winter accumulation accounting for the dark organic-rich layer. Depositional rates of 0.25–2 mm/varve-year are within the range of modern diatom production (Chu et al., 2005). Our interpretation of the dark layers as representing a winter (ice free) period of reduced near-surface productivity is supported by abundance of chrysophycean resting cysts and amorphous organic matter in this part of each couplet.\nThe demonstrated high lateral continuity of sub-mm thick laminae in the overlap-interval between the two sample pits indicates that sedimentation of this facies was from fall-out from the water column with little or no bottom current involvement. The pennate diatom Encyonema jordanii that constitutes almost all of the diatomite, may have been functionally planktonic, possibly attached to floating or submerged aquatic plants such as Myriophyllum (water milfoil), which is represented in the pollen record (Bannister et al., 2005). Sponges may have encrusted plant material such as stems of water\nplants and dead leaves, or may have been anchored to soft sediment near the lake margins.\nThe exceptional preservation of entire Galaxias fossils (Lee et al., 2007; Fig. 8) indicates that no scavenging took place. There is no indication of postmortal decay or dislocation of any part of the fish, which appear to have sunk gently to the lake floor immediately after death. It seems possible that each fish expired on venturing into the anoxic zone. The sparse distribution of fish in the sequence indicates no seasonal turnover of lake water occurred that could have resulted\nin near-surface anoxia and mass mortality. Meromictic, low-pH conditions, and anoxia in the hypolimnion would account for the absence of traces of benthic organisms in the lake sediments, undisturbed fish remains, abundant leafy organic matter, and lack of carbonate.\nAlthough the presence of galaxiid fish indicates that Foulden Maar had at least short-term connection with a local river system, the dearth of coarse detrital sediment indicates that the lake was subject to little stream inflow other than runoff from the basin margins. Lake\nlevel was likely controlled by direct rainfall and groundwater interchange with the surrounding aquifer system. There is no evidence of drying out of the lake, and it is likely that it was relatively deep with respect to its diameter, perhaps exceeding 100–200 m in depth early in its history."

    "heading": "5.2. Mass flow events",
    "text": "Following the work of Chang and Grimm (1999) and Chang et al. (1998) on remarkably similar marine speckled diatomite beds from Monterey Formation, California, speckled beds in Foulden Diatomite are interpreted to have been deposited during episodic events that involved the failure and down-slope mass-flow transport of non-cohesive to weakly cohesive diatomaceous lake sediment. While turbiditic beds are not uncommon in maar fills (e.g. Drohmann and Negendank, 1993; Heinz et al., 1993; Pirrung et al., 2005), most reported examples appear to have high terrigenous sediment content.\nAside from depositional fabric, the only compositional differences between laminated diatomite and associated speckled beds from Foulden Maar are the greater abundance of leafy plant litter and an additional small amount of quartz silt in the SBs. The higher content of both plant detritus and terrigenous silt suggests that much of the sediment that eventually formed SBs initially accumulated closer to shore. The high proportion of leaves in speckled beds may be attributed to the tendency of floating litter to drift to shore and accumulate in the lake shallows (e.g. Hanlon, 1981; Smith, 2000). The quartz silt was wind-blown from the surrounding area, or alternatively may have been carried into the lake directly from the schist maar walls by surface flow.\nThe rate of recurrence of speckled-beds N2 mm thick in the study succession of approximately one depositional event per 27 mm of laminated sediment, is equivalent to one mass-flow depositional event every 30–60 varve-years. Possible triggers may have involved: (1), repeated failure of unstable accumulations of sediment around the steep maar walls, possibly associated with methane or carbon dioxide generation; (2), seismicity associated with regional volcanic activity; and (3), major storm events. The scarcity of pyroclastic sediment indicates that volcanism was perhaps not an important mechanism for initiating speckled bed depositional events. However, given the abundance of organic matter, the very small density difference between lake water and diatom ooze, and likely steep slopes of the maar lake, it is likely that any moderately large basinal disturbance would have triggered a flow. The survival of planar diatomaceous aggregates within the speckled beds and apparent absence of extensive lake-bed erosion associated with speckled bed mass-flow events indicates that the diatomaceous substrate may have been bound by microbial mats associated with bacterial decay of diatom-sourced organic matter (Harding and Chant, 2000).\nMultiple divisions within some speckled beds may indicate that basin margin failures sometimes occurred at several points around the maar walls at the same time, or that individual flows ricocheted around the maar floor, making several passes across the inferred central basin location represented by the study section (e.g., Németh et al., 2008, Fig. 11). The distinctive white diatomite layers that cap SBs are interpreted to have accumulated from post-flow fall-out of diatom frustules entrained and resuspended into the water column during the flow. Gradational contacts between the SBs and white layer, and local presence of flame structures support this interpretation."

    "heading": "6. Spectral analysis of varve thickness and solar-forcing",
    "text": "A preliminary spectral analysis of couplet thickness variation utilising the Fast Fourier Transformmethod (FFT) has been carried out on the 9.260–10.640 m interval in Pit A (Fig. 5). A time series of couplet thickness data was obtained from enlarged greyscale plots generated using ImageJ software, a public-domain image analysis package available from the National Institute of Health, USA. Greyscale data was acquired at a resolution of 12–15 pixels/mm of stratigraphic thickness. Couplet thicknesses were manually measured and recorded with a digitising tablet, and with reference to scaled photographs of the interval. A total of 1115 couplets, total thickness 0.771 m, were recorded over the 1.380 m thick interval examined. Speckled beds and their white capping layers account for the remaining 0.609 m. The time-series of couplet thickness is plotted in Fig. 12A. Smoothed FFT results, computed with SigView software, are illustrated in Fig. 12B.\nOf the ten pronounced peaks in the spectrum the highest frequency group of peakswith periods between 2.2 and 3.0 years include a strong peak at 2.6 years. Assuming that the dark brown and white couplets represent annual sedimentation cycles and that inter-annual climate change controlled lake diatom productivity and sedimentation, this group would appear to relate to the modern-day quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) (Baldwin et al., 2001; Breckenridge, 2007). Likewise, the group of three peaks with periods between 4.2 and 8.6 years, including a strong peak at 7.04 years, are consistent with El NiñoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) frequencies. The 11.0 year peak matches\nthat of modern Schwabe sunspot cycles that are related to a 22 year cycle for the reversal of the Sun'smagnetic field. The significance of the 16.9 year peak in the FFT spectra remains unidentified. Similar periods have been documented by Dean et al. (2002) and Livingstone and Hajdas (2001) and may represent multiples of the 7.04 and 8.6 year periods. Similarly, longer-period strong peaks at 41.7 and 61.2 years mimic 40–50 year cycles detected in a largely biogenic varve succession in Elk Lake, USA (Dean et al., 2002). This 40–60 year cyclicity, evident on cursory examination of the thickness data plot (Fig. 12A)may also be amanifestation of sunspot activity (Dean, 1997; Dean et al., 2002).\nAssuming that diatomaceous sediment deposition commenced soon after volcanic eruption, the short time span represented by Foulden Maar diatomite closely corresponds with the Oligocene– Miocene transitionwhichhas been variously placed at 22.92±0.04Ma (Shackleton et al., 2000), 24.0±0.1 Ma (Wilson et al., 2002), and 23.03 Ma (Ogg, 2004). Changes in global ocean circulation and solar orbit leading up to deposition of the diatomite include opening of the Drake Passage and establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Pfuhl and McCave, 2005), and a period of orbital congruence involving a low-amplitude variance in obliquity and a minimum in eccentricity (Zachos et al., 2001). Although this orbital condition is thought to have resulted in a period of low seasonality, favourable, along with establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, to icesheet expansion on Antarctica (Zachos et al., 2001), the biogenically varved diatomite indicates that a seasonal climate existed in southern New Zealand. Bannister et al. (2005) concluded that the plant\ncommunities represented by leaf fossils together with the paucity of epiphyllous fungi on leaves from Foulden Diatomite indicated a subtropical, seasonally dry climate."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "The presently-exposed 15.5 m thick post-eruptive fill of Foulden Maar consists of highly laminated biogenically varved diatomite composed of dark brown and white pale couplets, interspersed with speckled diatomite beds that were emplaced by sediment gravity flows. Spectral analysis of a 1115 year varved interval indicates that sedimentation was controlled by seasonal, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and sunspot-related lake productivity cycles. Well-preserved organic matter, framboidal pyrite and almost complete absence of bioturbation indicates that the diatomite accumulated in a stratified water column with low pH, anaerobic bottom conditions and no input of terrigenous sediment apart from quartz silt grains and minor sand carried from the basin margins in sediment gravity flows."
