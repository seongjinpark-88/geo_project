    "text": "Tephrochronology studies in the south polar region are reviewed and evaluated. There have been numerous investigations of tephra layers in ice cores, reflecting the continuing importance of ice cores as a principal source of palaeoenvironmental information. By contrast, tephra in marine sediment cores have been largely neglected. Chemical analyses of glass shards are not uniformly available across the region. In particular, they are currently unavailable for the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Few tephras have been dated directly, although potassic glass and minerals are commonly present and should be readily amenable to isotopic dating. Chemical ‘fingerprinting’ seems to have a high potential for successfully correlating layers and identifying source areas, but only a few studies have considered trace elements as well as major oxides. The effects of within-ash compositional variations and analytical imprecision limit the general utility of ‘fingerprinting’. The tephra record is locally much more complete than is preserved in the source volcanoes themselves. However, the effects of frequent eruptions on local depocentres may swamp other environmentally significant indicators and make the environmental record harder to interpret than in tephra-free successions. Linked studies of tephra and volcanically-derived aerosols in ice in the south polar region could be of critical importance for quantitative calculations of the volcanic contribution to atmospheric fluxes and attempts to assess the possible effects of volcanism on global climate. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

    "text": "Tephra layers are common in sedimentary sequences and in ice in the south polar region. Tephra are important because of their ability to provide isochronous time planes in sedimentary successions and ice sheets, which can be correlated across wide distances. Other benefits of tephra studies include: analysis of englacial deformation and flow directions in ice; reconstruction of the record of past volcanic activity for the Southern Hemisphere and identification of the volcanic sources; determining the rela-\ntionship between volcanism and climate, palaeoclimatic variability and dating phases of glaciationrdeglaciation.\nIn this review, the south polar region comprises continental Antarctica and off-lying islands, and the southern oceans south of 608S, except in the Scotia Searsouth Atlantic Ocean, where the area considered is extended to 508S between longitudes 108 and Ž .308W Fig. 1 . Within the defined region, studies focused on upper Cenozoic tephra have only taken place during the last 30 years, since when there have been )50 publications on the topic.

    "text": "The south polar region contains a significant tephra record of volcanic eruptions. Several factors specific to the region increase the value and utility of tephra studies compared with similar studies at lower latitudes and in the north polar region:\nŽ .1 The information contained in Antarctic ice may be more extensive than in equivalent Northern Ž .Hemisphere ice Greenland , possibly because volcanic eruptions were more common in the late Cenozoic around Antarctica than in the Greenland region. However, although Greenland ice has thus far appeared to be poor in tephra, there are indications that tephra microparticles may be more common than is Žgenerally believed De Angelis et al., 1985; Palais et .al., 1992; Fiacco et al., 1993 .\nŽ .2 Because atmospheric wind circulation patterns ensure that effects of large volcanic eruptions within the entire Southern Hemisphere, and up to ca. 208N, have a high potential for incorporation in the Antarctic record, the area of the globe capable of being Ž .sampled is very large Delmas et al., 1985 . Ž .3 Even small eruptions in Antarctica may be\ncapable of injecting material into the stratosphere. The tropopause above Antarctica is unusually low Ž .in the range 8–10 km: Weyant, 1966 and should allow a rapid and widespread distribution of tephra Ž .over the continent Kyle et al., 1981 . Thus, the preservation of the record of volcanic eruptions in Antarctica is likely to be more complete than in other parts of the world.\nŽ .4 Polar ice is an ideal medium to preserve glassy tephra essentially unaltered. The high accumulation rate of snow implies a high temporal resolution too, compared with most sedimentary succesŽ .sions Palais et al., 1988 . Ž .5 Ice is the only medium in which both soluble Ž . Ž .chemical aerosol and insoluble glass volcanic emissions are preserved together, thus providing a unique record of past volcanism and the potential for\nproviding quantitative estimates of aerosol loading and volatiles released by historical and pre-historical Žvolcanic eruptions Hammer et al., 1981; Delmas et .al., 1985; Palais and Kyle, 1988 .\nŽ . Ž .6 Very fine particles few microns in diameter are relatively easily detected by their phase contrast with the enclosing ice and their ease of extraction for Ž .analysis by melting the enclosing ice ; similar-sized particles of glass can be undetectable or are very hard to detect in normal clastic sediments."

    "text": "The Antarctic continent has more published studies on tephra than elsewhere in the south polar region. Most of the studies are concerned with ash Ž .layers within ice cores and blue ice areas Fig. 2 . Tephra occurrences in ice have been reported in\nMarie Byrd Land, Transantarctic Mountains and Ž .Yamato Mountains Dronning Maud Land . They\ninclude proximal deposits, mostly of Strombolian type, which were probably derived from eruptions at ŽMount Waesche McIntosh et al., 1990; Smellie et .

Kyle, personal commu.nication, 1995 . At Lewis Cliff, central Transantarc-\ntic Mountains, the presence of compositionally mixed fine ash layers, comprising basanite, K-trachyte and peralkaline K-trachyte glass fragments, was attributed to eruptions in The Pleiades, northern VictoŽria Land )1000 km distant, Koeberl et al., 1988; .Koeberl, 1989 ; the Lewis Cliff deposit was the first\nvolcanic ash discovered to be enriched in volcanogenic iridium. 40Arr39Ar chronology of multiple in situ and reworked ash layers in the western AsŽgard Range and Arena Valley Quartermain Moun.tains; southern Victoria Land indicates eruptions\nŽbetween 15.2 and 4.3 Ma Marchant et al., 1989, .1993a,b,c . Many of the ashes are phonolitic, and\nMount Discovery and Mount Morning may have been the eruptive sources. The presence and ages of the layers were used to support a model of a cold-desert climate and stable East Antarctic ice sheet, possibly enduring for the last 11–15 Ma. ConŽ .versely, Barrett et al. 1992 described a 2.8 Ma, Žmixed-composition phonotephrite–mugearite–be.nmoreite ash interbed within marine diamicton Ž .meltout till in core from the CIROS-2 drill-hole in\nŽ .Ferrar Fjord Victoria Land , which they interpreted as confirmation of a fluctuating East Antarctic ice sheet. A more distant source is identified for tephra Žlayers in ice in the Yamato Mountains Dronning Maud Land, Katsushima et al., 1984; Nishio et al., .1984, 1985 . The Yamato Mountains tephra are tholeiitic andesites which compositionally resemble low-K island arc tholeiites from the South Sandwich Islands, about 3000 km distant from the Yamato Mountains. The tephra from Yamato Mountains and Ž . Ž .another in the Vostok Ice Core VIC below were the first to be reported in Antarctica with a source Žoutside of the Antarctic continent Kyle et al., 1984; .Nishio et al., 1984 .\nIce cores, extending in age back to )100 ka B.P., have been obtained at a few, widely spaced Ž .localities Fig. 2 . All contain tephra layers. Twentyfive coarse ash tephra occur in the Byrd Station Ice Ž .Core BSIC and there are )2000 ‘dust bands’, Žwhich are considered to be fine ash tephra Gow et\nal., 1968; Gow and Williamson, 1971; Kyle and Jezek, 1978; Kyle et al., 1981, 1982; Palais, 1985; .Palais et al., 1988 . Glass shards from the coarse ash layers are peralkaline trachytes, with relatively little compositional variation. They have an inferred Žderivation from eruptions of Mount Takahe Marie .Byrd Land , mainly between 7.5 and 40 ka ago.\nInvestigations of the BSIC tephra are the most detailed for any polar region ice core so far and include Ž .shard morphology shape, vesicularity , grain size analysis, major oxides and trace elements, and ice Žchemistry see especially Palais, 1985; Palais and .Kyle, 1988; Palais et al., 1988 . Those studies have\nshown that the coarse and fine ash tephra were derived from magmatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions, respectively, and have enabled the construction of a tentative eruption history for Mount Takahe. Early investigations also speculated that the large numbers of eruptions represented may have triggered Žworldwide cooling identified by isotopic data for ice . Ž .from the same core Gow and Williamson, 1971 . Ž .Kyle et al. 1981 thought that this was unlikely because of the local nature of the eruptions responsible for the tephra, but suggested that ice build up during the last glacial may have triggered eruptions.\nBy comparison with the BSIC, visible tephra layers are much less common in all other Antarctic ice cores. Eight have been analysed in the Vostok Ice\nŽ . Ž .Core VIC , six in the South Pole Ice Core SPIC Žand one in the Dome C Ice Core DCIC; Kyle et al.,\n1981, 1982, 1984; De Angelis et al., 1985; Palais et .al., 1987, 1989a, 1989b, 1990, 1992 . However, the\nSPIC has been intensively examined for micropartiŽcles e.g., Moseley-Thompson, 1980; Thompson and .Mosley-Thompson, 1982; Delmas et al., 1992 , which are abundant and likely to be of volcanic origin. Peralkaline trachyte ash is present in the DCIC and is correlated compositionally with Mount Takahe. The VIC contains basanite, high-K dacite and tholeiitic andesite, and the SPIC contains several high-K andesites, dacites and rhyolites. The basanite is attributed to an eruption in south Victoria Land, tholeiitic andesite to a South Sandwich Islands eruption Ž .possibly Candlemas Island; Kyle et al., 1984 , and the varied high-K series to eruptions in South AmerŽ .ica. Palais et al. 1989b also identified a coarse Žpopulation of shards in a SPIC ash layer 1816–1821 .AD , which may have been derived from an eruption on Deception Island. Tholeiitic andesite tephra, correlated with the South Sandwich Islands, have now been identified in the Yamato Mountains, the VIC, Weddell Sea and south Atlantic Ocean, providing possible confirmation of the prediction that a prominent ash layer in the VIC, informally named the Vostok tephra, could be an important stratigraphical Žmarker in the south polar region Kyle et al., 1984; .Palais et al., 1987 . An eruption dated at 1259 AD, Ž .and correlated with the El Chichon volcano Mexico , is the only interhemispheric tephra layer discovered so far; it is found as tephra microparticles associated with a strong volcanic SO signal in ice cores in4 Ž .

    "text": "In this region, published tephrochronology studies date back to 1972, as a result of heightened interest following a spate of eruptions on Deception Island Ž .between 1967 and 1970 Baker et al., 1975 . Most of the eruptive activity on Deception Island is likely to Ž .be -200 ka Keller et al., 1991 and all of the post-caldera activity is characterised by small-volume Žeruptions varying from magmatic Strombolian-sub-\n. ŽPlinian to phreatomagmatic Surtseyan-phreato.Plinian , depending on the local hydrology of the Žeruptive sites Baker et al., 1975; Smellie, 1988, .1990 . At least 23 ash layers were exposed in fissure and crater walls in ice following the 1969 and 1970 eruptions on the island, although perhaps only half the likely number of actual eruptions are preserved Ž . Ž .Orheim, 1972a,b . Orheim 1972b constructed an important, very detailed tephrochronological standard for historical eruptions at Deception Island dating back to ca. 1780 AD. The study of Deception Ž .Island tephra by Orheim 1972a,b did not include chemical analyses, but samples of bombs from tephra produced during eruptions in 1842, 1967, 1969 and Ž .1970 were analysed by Baker et al. 1975 . Unfortunately, there are very few published analytical data for tephra elsewhere in the northern Antarctic PeninŽsula region; analytical data were used but not pub. Ž .lished by Matthies et al. 1988, 1990 and Bjorck et¨ Ž .al. 1991b . The identification of the volcanic source for tephra has been inferred to be Deception Island in most of the studies in the region.\nUnlike the other south polar areas included in this review, most of the published studies are focused on lacustrine sediments obtained by coring at five main Žlocalities: King George Island Fildes and Potter . Ž .peninsulas , Livingston Island Byers Peninsula , Ž .James Ross Island Ulu Peninsula and northern Ž . ŽGraham Land Hope Bay Matthies et al., 1990; .Bjorck et al., 1991a,b, 1993; Tatur et al., 1991 . In¨ addition, there are published investigations of ash Žlayers in ice on Livingston Island Calvet et al., in .press and in an ice core on James Ross Island Ž .Palais et al., 1989b; Aristarain et al., 1990 , tephra in marine piston and box cores from Bransfield Strait Ž .Matthies et al., 1988 , and tephra layers in a moss Žbank at Walker Point Elephant Island; Bjorck et al.,¨ .1991c; Fig. 3 .\nBecause of the presence of associated organic material, it has been possible to date the lacustrine and moss bank tephra by the 14C method; this has not been attempted for tephra-bearing sequences elsewhere in the south polar region. Eruptions from Deception Island are postulated, and are possibly Ž .dated back to ca. 8.7 ka B.P. Matthies et al., 1990 . However, the reliability of the oldest ages obtained Ž .by Matthies et al. 1990 has been questioned by Ž .Bjorck et al. 1991b because of inherent difficulties¨\nin interpreting 14C ages obtained from high-latitude, Ž .bulk-sediment samples cf. Bjorck et al., 1991d .¨ Only two volcanic sources other than Deception Island have been suggested: Penguin Island for a Ž .prominent, exceptionally thick up to 1.6 m ash in Žtwo lakes on King George Island Tatur et al., 1991; .no supporting chemical data ; and Bridgeman Island Ž .Bransfield Strait for part of one marine ash layer in Ž .Bransfield Strait Matthies et al., 1988 . An ice core recovered on James Ross Island,\nnorthern Antarctic Peninsula, contains a single tephra Žlayer at 154.3 m, dated as 1641\"2 AD Aristarain .et al., 1990 . The composition of the tephra resembles those from Deception Island and it was tentatively correlated with an ash layer identified in an ice core from South Pole Station. If this correlation is true, it illustrates vividly how eruptions from DecepŽtion Island which are characteristically quite small: .Baker et al., 1975 can be dispersed over a dispro-\nportionately large area of Antarctica and be preŽ .served and detected in Antarctic ice.\nŽ .Bjorck et al. 1991b have attempted to erect a¨ tephrostratigraphical standard for the northern Antarctic Peninsula region for the last 5 ka. The ashes were identified both visually and by magnetic analyses and a total of 14 ashes from all the localities studied were identified and named AP1-14. Several tephra layers were correlated between Elephant Island, Livingston Island, James Ross Island and Hope Bay. In the absence of analytical data from most localities, the correlations were based on tephra 14 Žages interpolated from C stratigraphies sum.marised in Bjorck et al., 1991b .¨\nThe oldest ages obtained from lake sediments on King George Island were also used to infer stages of Ždeglaciation at Fildes Peninsula Matthies et al., .

Conversely, tephra correlations were commonly found to be impossible in cores separated by only a few km, indicating that sedimentation conditions are not uniform in Bransfield Strait and may change rapidly over very short distances.

    "text": "Very few tephra studies have been undertaken in Žthe south Atlantic Ocean area including Scotia Sea .and Weddell Sea; only four publications so far . However, the ages of the tephra extend back to Early Miocene times and the pre-Quaternary tephra show a wide range of compositions consistent with contributions from several compositionally distinctive volcanic sources.\nNumerous ash layers were encountered in piston cores obtained from 12 localities extending to about 700 km east from the flanks of the South Sandwich ŽIslands Ninkovich et al., 1964; Federman et al., .1982; Fig. 4 . Because of relatively high pelagic Žsedimentation rates resulting in an expanded, high.resolution sediment-tephra record , up to 150 ka of\nvolcanic activity is potentially recorded in the cores. Ž .Ninkovich et al. 1964 used compositions calculated\nfrom refractive indices of glass and pumice particles to infer a source in the South Sandwich Islands, and Ž .this was confirmed by Federman et al. 1982 who identified mainly low-K tholeiitic andesites using chemical analyses. Both studies suggested that corre-\nlation of ash layers between widely spaced cores was possible, but different correlations were also sugŽ .gested, in some cases. Federman et al. 1982 also identified a major explosive eruption in two cores, which they suggested occurred about 30 ka ago.\nTwenty-one layers of tephra were encountered at four ODP drill sites in the northern Weddell Sea and\nŽsouth Atlantic Ocean Hubberten et al., 1991; Fig. .4 . The tephra layers were dated by studies of associ-\nated marine plankton and have a wide range of ages. Ž .Those in the Weddell Sea ODP Leg 113 are calc-\nalkaline basaltic andesites–rhyolites. They are all Pliocene in age and, although showing a compositional similarity to rocks from the South Shetland\nIslands, a better compositional match with Antarctic Peninsula samples favoured a correlation with the latter. By contrast, tephra in the south Atlantic drill Ž .cores ODP Leg 114 are Quaternary to Early Miocene in age and display at least three different fractionation trends, although there is clear scope for Žfurther subdivision acknowledged by Hubberten et .al., 1991 . The Quaternary tephra have the composi-\ntions of island arc tholeiites closely similar to those of the South Sandwich Islands. Tephra layers of Pliocene and Early Miocene age have the compositions of calc-alkaline basaltic andesite–dacite, resembling rocks analysed from the South Shetland ŽIslands and the submarine Discovery arc an intraoceanic, volcanic arc-precursor to the South Sandwich Islands, situated east of the South Orkney .Islands: Barker et al., 1982 ; the tephra layer of Early Miocene age has an unusually wide composiŽtional range for a single layer extending continu.ously between basaltic andesite and dacite . The\nUpper Miocene tephras follow high-potassium calcalkaline trends which have not been matched with any volcanic source. One of the Upper Miocene tephra layers is bimodal, and contains glasses with contrasting high-potassium and intermediate-potas-\nsium, calc-alkaline compositions. A correlation with volcanic centres in South America was thought to be Žunlikely because of the large distance involved ) .3500 km .\nThe potential for future studies of marine tephra in the south Atlantic Ocean region is high; for Ž .example, ash layers not yet analysed or correlated are abundant in six out of seven piston cores obŽ .tained in the northern Weddell Sea Pudsey, 1992 and in several ODP cores from Leg 113 in addition Ž .

Huang et al. 1973, 1975 recognised 30 dispersed volcanic ash zones and proposed a source in the Balleny Islands. The ages of the ash layers Ž .extending back to 2.45 Ma were obtained from a combination of palaeomagnetic measurements and palaeontological observations. Huang and Watkins\nŽ .1976 described microfeatures on glass shards extracted from the tephra layers and demonstrated a correlation between the development of these features and their calculated estimates of explosivity and tephra dispersal.\nŽ .Kyle and Seward 1984 presented three electron microprobe analyses of the south Pacific tephra.

Froggatt et al. 1986\nalso identified a south Pacific tephra with the compositional characteristics of New Zealand-derived rhyolite, but they also suggested that most of the ashes are phonolitic in composition. Using an expanded data set of analyses, Shane and Froggatt Ž .1992 demonstrated that the felsic ashes are mainly peralkaline trachytes and rhyolites, together with subordinate ashes of intermediate to basic alkalic compositions. Most of the ash layers analysed disŽplay a wide range of compositions e.g., SiO typi-2 .cally exceeds 15% within a sample , the most com-\nmon being trachyte to rhyolite. A few show an even wider compositional range and contain basaltic shards in addition to trachyte–rhyolite ones. Some of the Ž .ash layers correlated by Huang et al. 1975 were shown to be chemically heterogeneous and represent the products of multiple eruptions. The large stratoŽ .volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land )1500 km distant were identified as the most likely sources. However, the quality of the microprobe data, in particular the acknowledged unquantified compositional effects of Ž .hydration Froggatt et al., 1986 , do not preclude some of the felsic tephra being New Zealand rhyolites."

Because of inaccuracies intrinsic to the analytical methods used, together with compositional variations occurring in the tephra erupted from any centre, it is not possible to prove an exact compositional match with any of the eruptions proposed. ŽTrace element analyses obtained by instrumental .neutron activation are published for some tephra in\nthe BSIC but suffer from problems of correlation similar to the major oxide analyses. Although the provenance of the BSIC tephra is thought to be Ža single, relatively well-studied volcano Mount .Takahe , it has proved impossible to match the com-\npositions of any analysed tephra in the BSIC with tephra units mapped on Mount Takahe itself Ž .acknowledged by Palais et al., 1988 . In addition to trace element analyses of BSIC tephra, there are published analyses of ash samples from Allan Hills Ž Ž .and Yamato Mountains Fukuoka et al. 1987 , and Ž .Lewis Cliff Koeberl et al., 1988; Koeberl, 1989 ; Ž .Palais et al. 1989a also reported that trace elements\nhad been determined for two tephra layers in the VIC, but the results were not published. Thus, despite its high potential, the utility of chemical fingerprinting in matching deposits with specific tephra beds mapped at the volcanic sources is both poorly tested in general and has failed in the one, very Ž .detailed attempt to do so BSIC . Moreover, chemical diversity is very common in individual tephra layers in the south polar region. This may also limit the potential for widespread correlation, not only for correlation of tephra layers within the region itself but also with volcanoes identified as possible sources.\nDespite early attempts to correlate tephra in the south Pacific Ocean and the DCIC with eruptions at\nŽ . ŽTambora Indonesia and in New Zealand Kyle et al., 1982; Kyle and Seward, 1984; De Angelis et al., .1985 , no tephra from these volcanoes has yet been Žunequivocally identified e.g., see Shane and Frog.gatt, 1992 . The South Sandwich Islands were the first source volcanoes identified which were not situated on the Antarctic continent, but eruptions from volcanoes in South America have been linked Ž .tentatively with tephra in the SPIC and possibly the VIC. Tephra from the 1259 AD eruption of El Chichon volcano is identified in the SPIC and in Greenland ice, and is the only interhemispheric tephra layer suggested so far; this tephra layer may be a particularly important stratigraphical datum as the eruption represents one of the largest that has occurred in the last 10 ka and was associated with a Žmassive atmospheric input of H SO aerosol esti-2 4 mated to be ca. 300=106 tons; Langway et al., .1988 . Some of the published correlations are particu-\nlarly doubtful. For example, Pliocene tephra in the Weddell Sea were attributed to eruptions from the South Shetland Islands andror Antarctic Peninsula Ž .Hubberten et al., 1991 . However, arc volcanism ceased in the South Shetland Islands at about 20 Ma ŽPankhurst and Smellie, 1983; Smellie et al., 1984; .Birkenmajer, 1989; Smellie, 1990 , and no eruptions Žare known to have occurred in these islands or . Ž .Bransfield Strait during the Pliocene Smellie, 1990 . Pliocene eruptions of arc magmas in the Antarctic Peninsula are also virtually unknown. Those in eastŽern Antarctic Peninsula mainly Seal Nunataks and .the James Ross Island region; Fig. 3 have distincŽtive, mostly basaltic alkaline compositions Hole, .1988, 1990; Sykes, 1988; Smellie, 1990 , whereas\narc magmas seem to be entirely restricted to Brabant and Anvers islands. The latter are very poorly described, analysed and dated so far, but include anŽdesites dated at 3 Ma cf. Smellie, 1990; Ringe, .1991 .\nŽ .Hubberten et al. 1991 considered that volcanoes Ž .in South America were too distant )3500 km\nfrom sites of accumulation of high-K basaltic andesite–dacite tephra in the south Atlantic Ocean. However, tephra from the relatively mildly explosive Ž1991 eruption of Mount Hudson Chile; volcanic Ž .explosivity index VEI; Newhall and Self, 1982 : .-1–4; Naranjo et al., 1993 was dispersed widely\nsouth-eastwards, falling heavily in the Falkland IsŽ .lands several cm of accumulation and detected as a\nfine layer of reddish-black, silt-sized particles lightly Žcovering fresh snow on Bird Island South Georgia; .)2700 km from Mount Hudson; Fig. 4 , about 2 Žweeks after the main, mid-August eruption personal\ncommunications from M. Booth, J. Arnould and A. .Wood, British Antarctic Survey, 1991 and 1995 ; Žlight ashfall and a Bishop’s ring Meteorological .Office, 1982 were also observed in the Falkland\nIslands in late November, and atmospheric turbidity was greatly increased over two widely separated Ž Ž .Antarctic stations Halley 75834’S, 26820’W and Ž ..Faraday 65815’S, 64816’W during September–OcŽtober personal communication from J. Shanklin, .British Antarctic Survey, 1995 . The atmospheric\neffects were attributed to Mount Hudson by the Žobservers although another possible source could be .the June–September eruption of Mount Pinatubo , and the observations clearly suggest the potential for a significant contribution of South American tephra, Ž .from even moderately explosive eruptions VEIG4 , to be distributed over a wide area of the Scotia Sea and, potentially, the Antarctic continent. Moreover, the 1991 Mount Hudson eruption varied in composition from basalt to dacite in less than 1 week, although the basaltic tephra were dispersed northŽwards, away from the south polar region Naranjo et .al., 1993 .\nThe most detailed tephra studies in the south polar region are those of Palais, Kyle et al. on samples Žfrom the BSIC e.g., Palais and Kyle, 1988; Palais et . Žal., 1988 . The results of earlier work Gow and .Williamson, 1971 suggested that the peak abundance of ash layers indicated ash airfalls occurring at a rate of about 30 to 40 per century; this is comparable with the record of eruptions preserved as proximal tephra in ice on Deception Island, which indicates eruptions during several years in most decades Ž .of the 19th century Orheim, 1972a,b . Palais et al. Ž .1988 used the BSIC tephra to reconstruct an eruptive history for Mount Takahe. It comprised about 25 ka of alternating magmatic and hydromagmatic erupŽ .tions between ca. 40 and 14 ka B.P. . Caldera collapse was postulated between ca. 20–15 ka B.P., after a 7-ka period of particularly intense, near-continuous eruptive activity, and was possibly followed by development of an intra-caldera lake and mainly\nhydrovolcanic eruptions between 18 and 14 ka B.P; the record of eruptions is minor thereafter. This eruptive history is substantially more detailed than is possible to predict from examination of outcrops Žcurrently preserved at Mount Takahe McIntosh et .al., 1987; Palais et al., 1988 . Similarly, the record of\nexplosive silicic eruptions in Marie Byrd Land is much more complete in marine cores obtained from the south Pacific Ocean compared with that preŽ .served in the source area Shane and Froggatt, 1992 . Despite a good compositional match with Marie Byrd Land volcanoes, the apparent lack of field evidence for frequent, highly explosive eruptions in Ž .that region LeMasurier, 1990 is a problem for tephra correlation which has yet to be resolved. However, recent volcanological studies in Marie Byrd Land indicate that products of highly explosive erupŽtions are present on several volcanoes Palais et al., 1988; McIntosh et al., 1990; Smellie et al., 1990, 1993; Panter et al., 1994; McIntosh and Wilch, 1995; .Smellie, unpublished data . Although the mapped pyroclastic deposits are apparently minor compared to products of effusive volcanism, many of the Marie Byrd Land volcanoes are poorly dissected and the proportion of pyroclastic rocks is unknown but may be much greater than is observed.\nIf the eruptions from local centres are too frequent, they can cause problems by swamping the preserved record and obscuring other information. For example, the abundance of ash layers in lake sediments on Livingston Island, believed to be deŽrived from eruptions of Deception Island 40 km .distant , probably acts as a limiting factor for\npalaeoenvironmental change studies: the frequent tephra fallouts had such a significant influence on lake development that all other influences are subordinate by comparison; environmentally-significant variables cannot be clearly detected by multivariate analysis until the data set is screened to exclude the Ž .most tephra-dominated samples Bjorck et al., 1993 .¨ Similarly, the BSIC contains abundant ash from Mount Takahe and its microparticle record must be considered unrepresentative of the Antarctic continent. Because of the dominating influence of the local eruptions, explosive products from more distant volcanoes may be hard to distinguish in the BSIC Ž .and future cores obtained at this locality and any interpretations of climatic variations based on the\nŽBSIC record must be treated with caution Kyle et .al., 1982 . However, effects of local volcanoes are Žtypically represented by visible tephra layers Palais .et al., 1990 , which can be used to distinguish them Žfrom products of more distant eruptions identified Ž . .by glacichemical and other techniques . For exam-\nple, the GISP2 Greenland ice core contains frequent input from ‘local’ volcanoes in Iceland, yet a substantial record of global volcanism has also been Ž .distinguished Zielinski et al., 1994 . Ž .Gow and Williamson 1971 noted a correspon-\ndence in timing between the peak numbers of airfall Ž .ashes in the BSIC between 30 and 16 ka B.P. and\nan isotopically identified cold interval in Antarctica. They suggested that worldwide cooling may have been triggered by widespread eruptions in Antarctica, which intensified the existing glacial conditions. However, the BSIC tephra were derived from smallscale eruptions, the ash probably had a short atmospheric residence time and effects on world cooling Žwere probably negligible Kyle et al., 1981; Palais, . Ž .1985 . Kyle et al. 1981 and Kyle and Seward Ž .1984 suggested that particle size analyses and distributions could be used to deduce past stratospheric circulation patterns. The potential applicability of this suggestion has not yet been tested, despite the availability of ODP cores from localities scattered around more than half the circumference of AntarcŽ .tica e.g., see Barker et al., 1988, fig. 3 . A study of the south Pacific Ocean deep-sea cores by Kennett Ž .and Watkins 1970 also suggested an apparent correlation in timing between volcanic maxima, geomagnetic polarity reversals and faunal extinction. They suggested that the correlations were explained by volcanically induced climatic changes, but there have been no subsequent studies to test this hypothesis.\nTephrochronology of ash layers in southern Victoria Land has also been used in support of two exactly opposite hypotheses concerning the stability Žof the East Antarctic ice sheet Marchant et al., .1989, 1993a,b,c; Barrett et al., 1992 . In addition,\nphases of deglaciation were identified and dated using tephrochronology in lacustrine sediment seŽquences on King George Island Matthies et al., .1990 , and the redistribution of ash deposited on\nseasonal sea ice has the potential for mapping the former extent of sea ice cover and pattern of sea\nŽsurface currents e.g., Cooke and Hays, 1982; Smith .et al., 1983 .\nTephra time planes in the south Pacific Ocean may be useful for correlating the Pleistocene microfossil record over distances of 5000 km, based on Ž .identification of at least some of the tephra with Žvolcanic sources in New Zealand Kyle and Seward,\n1984; Froggatt et al., 1986; cf. Shane and Froggatt, .1992 and the hypothesis may be applicable in other Ž .areas e.g., Scotia Sea region . Similarly, tephra\nlayers in blue ice can be used to date the ice and provide information on ice dynamics and catchment areas for meteorites."

    "heading": "8. Conclusions",
    "text": "The study of tephra in the south polar region has advanced significantly over the last 30 years. However, the full potential of tephrochronology to glaciological, environmental, climatic and other problems Žof global concern has yet to be realised cf. Kyle et .al., 1982 . The best, if most time-consuming, way\nforward is for linked, multidisciplinary studies, foŽcusing simultaneously on glacichemistry in ice sec.tions and on an expanded range of major and trace elements, and morphometric parameters of the parŽticulate matter e.g., Kyle et al., 1982; Delmas et al., 1985, 1992; Palais and Kyle, 1988; Palais et al., .1988 . Rigorous control must be exerted on the analytical procedures, and non-subjective statistical methods used in the treatment of the analytical data Ž .Stokes and Lowe, 1988; Hunt and Hill, 1993 . By these means, precise and accurate quantification of tephra should be ensured, thus avoiding spurious analyses appearing in the literature and reducing conflicting correlations and interpretations based on Ždoubtful analyses cf. Kyle and Seward, 1984; Shane .and Froggatt, 1992 . Furthermore, it is recommended\nthat the use of formal or informal names for ash Žlayers e.g., Allan Ash, Yamato Ash, Vostok tephra; .Kyle et al., 1982; Nishio et al., 1984 should be discouraged unless there are unique characteristics that enable the unambiguous identification of the individual named layers. Existing, named tephra layers are poorly described and they occur in areas of multiple tephra, in which the named layers are virtually impossible to distinguish because of insufficient\ndistinguishing characteristics. In investigations of tephra sequences, it may be acceptable to use an informal, flexible notation for purposes of local corŽrelation e.g., the AP1-14 system adopted by Bjorck¨ Ž .et al. 1991b in the northern Antarctic Peninsula Žregion but note that some of the identified tephra\nare multiple layers at some localities; in itself, this could be a distinguishing characteristic in the defini..tion of a particular tephra . Tephra studies are the most important existing\ntool for precise correlations between atmospheric Ž .ice cores , marine and terrestrial records of global change. For example, it is now possible to make quantitative estimates of fluxes of certain volcanically-derived aerosols to the atmosphere, and concurrent studies of associated microparticles are capable Ž .in some cases, at least of identifying the likely Ž . Žvolcanic centre s responsible e.g., Langway et al., .1988; Palais et al., 1992 . These correlations are\nlikely to become increasingly important in Upper Cenozoic studies, particularly in enabling fundamental advances in our comprehension of feedbacks, time lags and processes operating in different sysŽ .tems especially the climate system . In this context, the environmental record preserved in ice cores remains of premier importance. New European and ŽAmerican initiatives the EPICA and WAISCORES .projects are aimed at obtaining deep ice cores at\nseveral sites in Antarctica. These cores should contain high-resolution glacial records expected to extend back several tens to hundreds of thousand years B.P. and would thus offer a high possibility for Žinterhemispheric correlations personal communicaŽ .tions from D. Peel British Antarctic Survey and K. Ž . .Taylor University of Nevada, USA , 1995 . By comparison, marine tephra are a largely neŽglected source of information fewer than 20% of tephrochronology publications for the south polar .region . Studies of south Pacific Ocean tephra sugŽ .gest that like the BSIC the record contains numer-\nous tephra derived from alkaline volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land and calc-alkaline volcanoes in New ŽZealand Kyle and Seward, 1984; Froggatt et al., .1986; Shane and Froggatt, 1992 . Similarly, the Ross\nSea probably contains many tephra layers from the numerous alkaline volcanoes of the McMurdo Volcanic Group, which were also active during much of Ž .the Neogene and Quaternary Kyle, 1990 . The po-\ntential for successfully fingerprinting and correlating these multiple layers has now been tested. Alkalic tephra contain potassic glass and phenocryst phases, and they are relatively easy to date isotopically Ž .Barrett et al., 1992; Marchant et al., 1993a,b,c . The Weddell Sea–Scotia Sea–south Atlantic region is also known to be rich in information on palaeoenviŽronmental changes e.g., Kennett and Barker, 1990; .Grobe and Mackensen, 1992 , yet it lacks rigorous\nage control over large areas, particularly the southernmost areas because of low biogenic productivity Ž .and corrosive deep water masses Pudsey, 1992 . Many of the tephra are K-rich and should be isotopically datable, although seawater alteration of samples could create problems. The combination of these characteristics suggest that the Weddell Sea–Scotia Sea–south Atlantic is a prime location for future tephrochronology studies. Thus, there continues to be a high potential for tephrochronology to provide a firm time framework for future palaeoenvironmental investigations within the south polar region."

  "abstractText": "Tephrochronology studies in the south polar region are reviewed and evaluated. There have been numerous investigations of tephra layers in ice cores, reflecting the continuing importance of ice cores as a principal source of palaeoenvironmental information. By contrast, tephra in marine sediment cores have been largely neglected. Chemical analyses of glass shards are not uniformly available across the region. In particular, they are currently unavailable for the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Few tephras have been dated directly, although potassic glass and minerals are commonly present and should be readily amenable to isotopic dating. Chemical ‘fingerprinting’ seems to have a high potential for successfully correlating layers and identifying source areas, but only a few studies have considered trace elements as well as major oxides. The effects of within-ash compositional variations and analytical imprecision limit the general utility of ‘fingerprinting’. The tephra record is locally much more complete than is preserved in the source volcanoes themselves. However, the effects of frequent eruptions on local depocentres may swamp other environmentally significant indicators and make the environmental record harder to interpret than in tephra-free successions. Linked studies of tephra and volcanically-derived aerosols in ice in the south polar region could be of critical importance for quantitative calculations of the volcanic contribution to atmospheric fluxes and attempts to assess the possible effects of volcanism on global climate. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
