    "text": "The stratigraphy of the alluvial sediments filling the Macquarie River valley, New South Wales, was investigated to test models of landscape evolution of the rifted margin Eastern Highlands of Australia. In the neighbouring Lachlan River valley, the stratigraphy of Neogene sediments has been incorporated into a model proposing denudation and episodic passive (denudational isostatic) uplift of the highlands throughout the Neogene. In this study, we aimed to test the regional extent of this model and the influence of sediment supply on the stratigraphic record and its interpretation. The sediments of the Macquarie River valley show three major changes in the depositional regime. First, erosion of the valley basement in the Late Miocene was followed by (and possibly synchronous with) deposition of a basal clay and sand unit in the Late Miocene. Second, the valley was filled with a wedge of sediment containing abundant gravel and sand in the Pliocene; and third, the older gravelly unit was eroded and reworked in the Quaternary, and a sandy clay unit, which forms the modern floodplain, was deposited. Deformation of the Middle Miocene basalt-filled valley provides good evidence for substantial uplift of the highlands in the Middle–Late Miocene, synchronous with or shortly after widespread volcanism, but continuing no later than the Late Miocene. The Pleistocene incision is best accounted for by climate change to drier conditions, triggering a sediment-starved response by the Macquarie River, rather than further uplift. While valley incision and subsequent infilling can be viewed as a response to tectonism, the internal sedimentology and stratigraphy of the sediments appears to respond to fluctuations in sediment supply brought about by extrinsic climate change and intrinsic catchment lithology. The first-order tectonic events are not synchronous with uplift in the Lachlan valley and are restricted to relatively local spatial scales. However, the secondary climatic forcing has a broader regional expression.\nKEY WORDS: Cenozoic, climate change, escarpment, landscape evolution, Macquarie River valley, New South Wales, Quaternary, rifted margins, sediment supply."

    "text": "Landscape evolution of the rifted east Australian margin, particularly the southeastern sector, has received considerable attention over the last century (Dulhunty 1973; Wellman & McDougall 1974; Jones & Veevers 1982). Numerous studies have interpreted the denudational histories of highland valleys to provide evidence for highland uplift and incision (Young 1977; Webb et al\n. 1991, 1992; Bishop & Brown 1992; Nott et al\n. 1996). Other models have been developed for the entire highlands (Ollier 1982; Ollier & Pain 1997).\nThere is now growing evidence and modelling to support the importance of pre-existing drainage patterns and the location of structural features on the denudational response to uplift (van der Beek et al\n. 2001) and hence the possibility of quite varied regional responses (Persano et al\n. 2002). At the broadest scale, apatite fission track ages suggest large-scale cooling (and hence erosional unloading) at or around the time of continental rifting in the Late Cretaceous along the continental margin, but declining rapidly away from the margin (O’Sullivan et al\n. 1995; Persano et al\n. 2002). Early Cenozoic tectonism is implicated in the uplift of the Blue Mountains and activation of the\nLapstone Structural Complex on the central eastern side of the highlands (van der Beek et al\n. 2001), whereas in the Lachlan River valley at the inland margin of the highlands, Bishop and Brown (1992) have found evidence of protracted episodic uplift continuing into the Neogene.\nThe Lachlan River valley is one of several large valleys flowing off the western side of the Eastern Highlands and draining into the inland Murray Basin (Figure 1). The valley has a bedrock-confined alluviated reach which acts to store considerable volumes of sediment transported from the highlands. Bishop and Brown (1992) investigated the geomorphology and stratigraphy of the section of the Lachlan valley at the change from bedrock to alluvial valley, termed the Transition Zone. Here they found evidence of a faulted basement with a highland-side-upwards offset of 70–80 m over 25 km, inset stratigraphic units (cut and fill) and the divergence of multiple alluvial terraces found up to 60 m above river level. The terraces quickly merge into the floodplain downstream. From this evidence they argued for episodic isostatic (passive) uplift of the highlands in response to denudational unloading and\n*Corresponding author: phesse@els.mq.edu.au\n274\nK. M. Tomkins and P. P. Hesse\nsubsidence of the Murray Basin in response to sediment loading. Bishop and Brown concluded that the offset in the basement was consistent with either short-wave\nflexure or faulting of the lithosphere, and the flights of terraces indicated an incisional response of the river.\nThe primary aim of this study is to test the regional application of models of uplift and denudation response determined for the Lachlan catchment in the neighbouring Macquarie River catchment. To proceed toward a general understanding of rifted margin evolution, where initial conditions and complex response have been proposed as important governing factors, requires examination of regional variability. We have examined evidence from the alluvial sediments filling the Macquarie River valley between Burrendong Dam (upstream of Wellington) and Narromine (Figure 1) and evidence from basalt flows to establish the rate, timing, and causes of valley\nincision and sediment accumulation."

    "heading": "BACKGROUND AND SETTING",
    "text": "The Macquarie River valley is located on the western margin of the Eastern Highlands in central New South Wales, between latitudes 32–34 S and longitudes 148–150 E\nand is a major tributary of the Darling River. The valley covers three major geomorphic provinces (Figure 1) defined by valley setting and discharge.\n1. Uplands characterised by a bedrock-confined valley within the highlands, extending from the headwaters to Burrendong Dam. This province includes the highest areas, reaching elevations of 1250 m (Bathurst and Mudgee areas) and 1379 m (Mt Canobolas), and provides nearly all the discharge to the Macquarie River.\n2. Bedrock-confined alluvial valley characterised by a low-relief, alluvial valley and hills at the highland margin between Burrendong Dam and Narromine providing ephemeral/episodic discharge. The total catchment\narea at Narromine (provinces 1 and 2) is 25 950 km 2\n. 3. Riverine Plain\ncharacterised by a very low-relief alluvial plain forming part of the Darling Basin, extending beyond Narromine towards the Barwon–Darling River. This province has minimal locally derived discharge and a well-developed distributary channel network connecting the lower reaches of the Macquarie, Castlereagh, and Bogan Rivers and including the Macquarie Marshes; a non-terminal floodout of the Macquarie River.\nThe catchment is formed of Palaeozoic volcanic, sedimentary and intrusive rocks of the Lachlan Fold Belt in the south (Figure 2) and Mesozoic sediments of the Gunnedah\nMacquarie valley Late Cenozoic history\n275\nand Great Australian Basins (Triassic Ballimore Formation and Jurassic Pilliga Sandstone) to the north and northwest as far as Narromine (Colquhoun et al\n. 1997; Sherwin 1997). Neogene and Quaternary sediments fill the alluvial valley (Late Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene: Martin 1991) and the Riverine Plain (Watkins & Meakin 1996). The Palaeozoic rocks have a strong north–south structural alignment causing prominent strike ridges and meso-scale control of the drainage in a north–south direction. Many faults occur in the Palaeozoic rocks in a narrow belt between Burrendong Dam and Ponto before they pass under the Mesozoic sequence. The Mesozoic rocks have a northwest dip which causes minor drainage systems on this sequence to flow in an overall northwest direction.\nRemnants of valley-filling basalt flows are found in the Macquarie valley between Ophir and Mookerawa, and at Brocklehurst, near Dubbo (Figure 2). The basalts at Mookerawa are underlain by coarse-grained\nalluvium and form a series of flat-topped hills within the deep, narrow Macquarie River valley, while those at Brocklehurst retain a channel-filling form inset into coarsegrained alluvium of a broader, gentler, but welldefined Macquarie valley. These observations show that the basalts flowed down a pre-existing Macquarie River and now lie elevated well above current river levels. The basalts at Mookerawa have been dated as Middle Miocene (12 ±\n0.3–11.6 Ma: Wellman & McDougall 1974). The basalts at Brocklehurst, near the confluence of the\nMacquarie and Talbragar Rivers, are found just above the current river level and have also been dated as Middle\nMiocene (14–12 Ma: Dulhunty 1973; Wellman & McDougall 1974). Basalts and trachytes to the southwest of Dubbo were previously thought to have been Tertiary in age\n(Geological Survey of NSW 1968), but recent dating has shown that many are Triassic and Jurassic (Colquhoun et al\n. 1997). These basalts are not readily distinguished chemically, physically, or in outcrop from the Miocene basalts, and so large areas of undated basalts in the area north and south of Dubbo may either be equivalent in age to the Garrawilla Volcanics further north, lying stratigraphically conformably in the Mesozoic sequence, or Miocene flow basalts disconformably overlying the Mesozoic sequence. Poor exposure prevents resolution of this issue. Similarly, basalts were encountered in the base of cores drilled into alluvium at Dubbo and under the Coolbaggie Plain at Minore (Pirard 1974) and may be related to the Middle Miocene flows at Brocklehurst but are more likely related to the nearby outcropping Mesozoic flows. Our reconstructions rely solely on dated and wellmapped Miocene basalts."

    "heading": "METHODS",
    "text": "The principal focus of this study is the bedrock-confined alluvial valley of the Macquarie River between Burrendong Dam and Narromine (Figure 3). Within the study area, 15 field sites were chosen based on the availability and quality of borehole data, location of bores with pollenbased chronology (Martin 1991; H. A. Martin pers. comm. 1997), and their morphological significance to the study (e.g. direct association with basalt and gravels and/or a terraced floodplain).\nWater Resources Commission (WRC) bores (mostly drilled 1950–1990) and topographic surveys [Pirard 1974; Sinclair Knight & Partners 1984; Water Resources Commission (no date) WCBL30 and WCB651] were used to\n276\nK. M. Tomkins and P. P. Hesse\no\nMacquarie valley Late Cenozoic history\n277\nconstruct cross-sections of the valley at Wellington, Ponto, Murrumbidgerie, Raymonds Falls, Butlers Falls, Dubbo, Brocklehurst, Terramungamine, Dickygundi, Minore, and Narromine (see Figure 3 for locations). A range of problems with the WRC bores limited our ability to interpret them. Terminology and classification schemes used to describe bore materials are occasionally inconsistent. Some bores do not reach bedrock and in some cases there are large gaps between bores so that in some cross-sections, such as Brocklehurst and Terramungamine, the valley depth and shape could not be determined. It is also possible to draw more than one interpretation from the stratigraphy in each of the cross-sections using the driller’s descriptions alone. Where possible, exposures of alluvial material, such as eroding banks and quarries, were used to check interpretations. Supplementary information was obtained by hand-augering the floodplain at Ponto and Minore (up to 6.5 m) and by field-logging a bore while it was being drilled to over 65 m in depth at Wrights Crossing, Minore.\nDepartment of Mineral Resources records of gold exploration were used to reconstruct the alluvial stratigraphy at Montefiores and Gobolion (Vahebzadeh & Kennewell 1987; Vahebzadeh & Boswell 1988; Vahebzadeh 1988). These records include detailed stratigraphies of the valley, reconstructed from bores, spaced at 50–100 m intervals. For this study, the detailed alluvial stratigraphy recorded for these sites was simplified (clay, sand, gravel, etc.) to be consistent with the other sites.\nThe alluvial stratigraphy of Gigmalerie and Dawns Beach was determined from seismic records and bore logs obtained from Valley Explorations, a private exploration company (Gilfillan 1991; Palmer 1985, 1986, 1987, 1991). The seismic records provided detail on the topography of the bedrock and changes in the alluvium across each site, whilst the bore logs indicated the nature of the alluvium.\nA longprofile of the bedrock base of the valley and the alluvial stratigraphy within, was reconstructed between Gigmalerie and the Riverine Plain beyond Narromine using the deepest bore to bedrock or bores containing pollen ages (Martin 1991; H. A. Martin pers. comm. 1997) where available. The elevations of terraces and the present river, determined from extensive field surveying tied to survey control benchmarks, were also plotted for each site."

    "heading": "RESULTS",
    "text": "Middle Miocene basalt-filled valley\nAt Mookerawa the Middle Miocene pre-basalt valley floor was broad (1–2 km) and covered by coarse alluvium (interbedded sands, gravels and boulders but with clay matrix in some beds) set at least 300 m below the plateau surface. Basalts flowed down Lewis Ponds Creek from near Ophir and then entered the Macquarie valley, forming a broad sheet across the valley floor (up to 130 m thick at Mookerawa). The flow extended at least 65 km from Ophir to Mookerawa, including a minimum of 48 km along the floor of the Macquarie valley. The modern Macquarie River in this reach lies in a narrow gorge set below remnants of the basalt flow, forming a V-shaped valley with low sediment storage between widely spaced bedrock bars. The basalt flow at Brocklehurst appears to have flowed from Talbragar Hill (undated) on the north side of the Talbragar River, 16 km from the quarry exposure at Brocklehurst, into the Talbragar River channel and then into the Macquarie. The flow (exposed in the Newell Highway cutting, Brocklehurst) filled a steep-sided Talbragar River channel formed in clays, with some gravel laminae. Downstream, the flow is underlain by extensive gravels, with a fine matrix, associated with the Macquarie River (exposures on Terramungamine Road and Newell Highway near Mogriguy Creek). The depth of the alluvium is unknown but the valley floor was at least 1 km broad, surrounded by gentle hills, as today. Quarrying and drilling of the flow in the Talbragar valley has shown the basalt filled a channel 18 m deep, 80 m wide and covered 6 m of gravel and sand (Boral Resources Ltd unpubl. data 2002). The modern Talbragar River has very similar dimensions, although the depth of sediment is much greater."

This is particularly evident at Montefiores, Ponto, and Butlers Falls. Downstream of Dubbo the valley widens significantly to 2 km at Terramungamine and to over 6 km at Minore.\nStratigraphy and sedimentology of the alluvial fills\nThree major distinctive stratigraphic units can be identified within the valley in the study area and are described below. These are likely to be the equivalent of formations, but are not formally designated. Approximate ages of the units were assigned from pollen associated with the sediments (Martin 1991; H. A. Martin pers. comm. 1997) (Table 1). The units are: (i) the basal Upper Miocene clays and sand (informally named the Eurombedah unit; a locality near Narromine); (ii) the ?uppermost Miocene – Pliocene gravel, sand, and clay unit (informally named the Mickety Mulga unit; the locality around Gobolion); the coarse fraction of this unit fines to sand downstream; and (iii) the surface Quaternary sandy clays (upstream) and\nclay (downstream) (informally named the Bunglegumbie unit; a locality including the floodplain upstream of Dubbo).\nDue to the limited description in the driller’s logs, the exact nature of all of the layers in each unit\n(e.g. colour, organics, sand characteristics) is unknown. Supplementary augering into the Bunglegumbie\nunit (Figure 5), combined with samples obtained from the bore at Wright’s Crossing, Minore (Figure 6), and\nexposures of the Mickety Mulga unit in a quarry downstream of Gobolion (Figure 7), provided limited details on\nthe nature of these sediments."

    "heading": "UPPER MIOCENE EUROMBEDAH UNIT",
    "text": "The Eurombedah unit, composed of layers of clays and some sand, is found in the base of the valley downstream of Ponto but is best shown at Narromine (Figure 4). The reconstructed longprofile stratigraphy (Figure 8) shows the unit forms a wedge, thickening downstream to more than 50 m at Narromine and 75 m beyond, although it is generally poorly sampled in the upstream transects making reconstruction uncertain. The age is defined as older than the Nothofagus phase (Miocene – Pliocene boundary) determined for the lower Mickety Mulga unit at Minore (Figure 4). It is not clear if the Lower Myrtaceae age for the deepest sample at Minore is from the lowest portion of the Mickety Mulga unit or the uppermost part of the Eurombedah unit (Late Miocene) because of the conformable nature of the Eurombedah and Mickety Mulga units. In either case, the Eurombedah unit is shown to be of Late Miocene age. Near Dandaloo, on the Darling Riverine Plain (Figure 1), gravels occur in the deepest part of the palaeovalley, beneath a stratigraphy otherwise similar to Narromine. However, pollen analysis of the gravel unit from two cores gave Nothofagus phase (Late Miocene/Early Pliocene) and Triporopollenites bellus\nMacquarie valley Late Cenozoic history 281\nphase (Early Miocene) ages (Haridharan 2003). The absence of a thick Upper Miocene clay unit at Dandaloo could indicate either a significant hiatus or a problem with the palynostratigraphy."

    "heading": "PLIOCENE MICKETY MULGA UNIT",
    "text": "The Mickety Mulga unit is found in the valley over the length of the study area. It is dominated by large rounded polymictic gravels and angular sand conformably separated by thinner clay layers. The gravels are up to boulder size upstream (> 10 cm) becoming smaller downstream, and are composed of sandstone, chert, jasper, and quartz in a sandy clay matrix. The bore at Wright’s Crossing revealed that the clays are mottled yellow and white, with abundant charcoal and organics (Figure 6). Mud (< 62.5 m) content of the clay layers is at least 80%. The sands at Wright’s Crossing are coarse, subangular to subrounded, and poorly sorted. The proportion of sand in the\ncoarse layers increases downstream, due to sorting. An exposure of this unit in a quarry, downstream of Gobolion, showed clear, stacked sequences of coarse gravel with inchannel deposits up to 5 m thick, flanked by, and conformably overlying, finer cross-bedded floodplain sequences (Figure 7). Gravel and sand terraces identical in composition and structure are found preserved in elevated positions upstream of Wellington at Nanima on the left bank, just upstream of Ponto on the right bank, and on the left bank from Ponto to Little River. High-level terraces downstream of Dubbo are poorly exposed but are likely to form part of the Mickety Mulga unit. Pollen ages for this unit obtained at Ponto, Butlers Falls, and Terramungamine are all Upper Myrtaceae pollen zone (Martin 1991; H. A. Martin pers. comm. 1997) [bore number 30890 (Ponto), 36442 and 36439 (Butlers Falls), and 36492 and 36491 (Terramungamine)].

    "heading": "QUATERNARY BUNGLEGUMBIE UNIT",
    "text": "The Bunglegumbie unit is composed mostly of massive red-brown sandy clay. Mottled clays and thin fine sand layers can also be found downstream beyond Minore. Augering into the Bunglegumbie unit at Ponto and Minore revealed that mud (< 62.5 m) content is generally between 60 and 80%, with medium subangular to subrounded sand of mixed lithologies making up the rest of the sediment (Figure 5). Organics are abundant. One pollen age, from a silt and sand layer assumed to be the base of the Bunglegumbie unit at Butlers Falls, indicated a Pleistocene age (H. A. Martin pers. comm. 1997) (Bore number 36439). However, it is possible that this layer is part of the Mickety Mulga unit, due to the difficultly in identifying exact boundaries between units from bore logs, in which case the transition from the gravel and sand unit to the sandy clay unit may have been later in the Pleistocene. Terraces composed of the sandy clay unit are found at Ponto, Butlers Falls, Dubbo (high), Brocklehurst, and Terramungamine at elevated positions well above the 100 year flood height (Sinclair et al. 1984). Terraces are extensive at the confluence with Coolbaggie Creek at Minore and at Narromine town where the floodplain is a narrow inset feature within the broader surface of the plain. At any site there is a maximum of two terraces (e.g. left bank from Ponto to Little River), one formed in the Mickety Mulga unit and one in the Bunglegumbie unit.\nStratigraphic relationship of the three units\nThe Mickety Mulga unit conformably overlies the basal Eurombedah unit indicating continuous deposition (Figure 8). The onlapping of the strata in the base of the inset valley suggests that sedimentation between Minore and Ponto was by backfilling. The headward limit of sedimentation appears to have progressively migrated upstream over time, such that this limit was located at Butler’s Falls in the Late Miocene and had reached Dawn’s Beach in the Early Pliocene. The conformity of the gravel and sand and clay layers in the Mickety Mulga unit suggests that the nature of infilling with this unit was by non-erosive vertical accretion of fine and coarse sheets of alluvium, through lateral migration of a fluvial system with an abundant sediment supply.\nThe Bunglegumbie unit shows an erosional base throughout the study area, for example, at Gigmalerie, Dawn’s Beach, Brocklehurst, and Narromine. Evidence of incision can be found in the modern Macquarie River from exposure of the Mickety Mulga unit in the lower parts of the concave river banks at Butler’s Falls, Murrumbidgerie, and Ponto. In the lower section of the study area, the modern Macquarie River is commonly at the level of the Mickety Mulga gravels even as far downstream as Narromine, indicating ongoing reworking of sediments. It is likely that this access to the gravel unit is a major mechanism for groundwater recharge and may be responsible for the dramatic loss of flow in the channel determined around Narromine (G. Salas pers. comm. 1997).\nThe presence of gravel and sand terraces, similar in composition to the Mickety Mulga unit, provides evidence of the extent of erosion of this unit and the disconformity with the Quaternary floodplain sediments. The elevation of the gravel and sand terraces is approximately 25 m and 30 m above present river level at Nanima and Ponto, respectively, which shows that the Mickety Mulga unit filled to a significantly higher level in the valley. Floodplain surveys at sites between Ponto and Terramungamine revealed the presence of sandy clay terraces as well as a ridge and swale floodplain, which in places becomes progressively lower towards the modern river. The river is incising into the Mickety Mulga unit, reworking it by lateral migration and redepositing a sandy clay floodplain. The gravels may be left as a channel lag deposit or transported downstream, as indicated by the presence of younger gravels downstream at Trangie (Watkins & Meakin 1996). Downstream of Terramungamine the terraces are lower and less easily distinguished, bounding a relatively broad floodplain surface with abundant evidence of lateral migration. Cutoff features are rare on the floodplain surface but increase downstream."

    "heading": "Longprofile gradients",
    "text": "Details from the 15 valley cross-sections were combined to reconstruct the longprofile stratigraphy (Figure 8). Both the erosional and depositional surfaces were found to increase in gradient with age (Table 2), although estimates vary in reliability due to the number of datum points available. Between Minore and Narromine and beyond, additional bores were included in the longprofile to provide greater information on the alluvial sediments and valley basement.\nA detailed longprofile of the sub-basalt valley floor between Mookerawa and Brocklehurst cannot be deter-\nMacquarie valley Late Cenozoic history 283\nmined because of the uncertainty of the ages of the undated basalts between these dated sites. However, the elevations of these two dated sites do give an indication of the overall Middle Miocene valley gradient (0.0027), which is considerably steeper than the valley basement, terrace, and modern river longprofiles (Table 2) but similar to the channel gradient at the knickpoint upstream (see below). This gradient is within the range commonly associated with bedrock incision for catchments of this size (Sklar & Dietrich 1998), rather than the coarse-grained alluvium observed beneath the basalts.\nThe longprofile of the bedrock valley floor between Gigmalerie and Narromine is difficult to determine with certainty as only Gigmalerie, Dawn’s Beach, Montefiores, Gobolion, Ponto, and Butler’s Falls have a sufficient number of bores which reach bedrock (or seismic transects at Gigmalerie and Dawn’s Beach) to reliably indicate the maximum valley depths. Even so, there is an apparent gradient reversal around Gobolion suggesting that Gobolion and Ponto may really be deeper than shown. Downstream of Butler’s Falls the true depth of the valley floor is not well-constrained due to the distance between bores. Overall, the gradient of the bedrock valley floor from Gigmalerie to Narromine is 0.00139, close to the valley gradient in the gorge upstream of Mookerawa (0.0012). It is also apparent that there is no steep offset, or discontinuity, in the bedrock profile near the upstream limit of the alluvium, as was found on the Lachlan River (Williamson 1986; Bishop & Brown 1992).\nThe longprofile of the highest preserved gravel and sand terraces of the Mickety Mulga unit can only be reconstructed from two datum points at Nanima and near Ponto. Nevertheless the height of these terraces correlates well with the sandy clay terraces.\nThe elevation of the highest sandy clay terrace decreases gently downstream except for the much higher terrace at Dubbo. If this sediment at Dubbo is also of Pleistocene age, and is not Pliocene or older, it would imply that there has been an even greater degree of bed lowering and sediment evacuation in the Quaternary than most other profiles suggest. There is no evidence to suggest that the terraces diverge at the upper margin of the alluvial valley near Burrendong Dam. Downstream, the terraces converge with the modern floodplain by 20 km north of Narromine on the Darling Riverine Plain.\nThe modern Macquarie River shows a gradient (determined either from valley distance or channel length) that is much gentler than both the valley basement and terrace gradients. At Burrendong Dam, the modern river flows on bedrock, while downstream at Nanima it flows below 25 m-high terraces, and by Narromine the river flows over sediments up to 120 m in thickness."

    "text": "The Middle Miocene basalts preserved high above the current river at Mookerawa and close to river level at Brocklehurst, combined with the ages of the basal sediments infilling the valley at Minore and Butler’s Falls, provide a control on the timing and magnitude of bedrock valley incision. Incision of the valley basement began after the Middle Miocene at Brocklehurst, and areas upstream,\nand had ceased by the Late Miocene at Minore and by the Early Pliocene at Butler’s Falls. Incision below the basalt surface was at least 275 m at Mookerawa and at least 70 m at Brocklehurst (from DGPS survey and the detailed predam topographic map at Mookerawa and bore depths at Brocklehurst).\nIncision was followed by deposition of the fine-grained Eurombedah unit in the Late Miocene and then by the conformable deposition of the Mickety Mulga unit in the Early Pliocene. Deposition of the Mickety Mulga unit occurred as alternating sheets of gravel and mud, continuous across the valley floor, typical of laterally migrating channels. Whether these were single channel or braided channel rivers is difficult to determine. The sheets continue downstream at least as far as Narromine (where the gravels fine to sand) collectively forming a wedge in the valley.\nThe surface sandy clay Quaternary (Bunglegumbie) unit again indicates a change in the nature of infilling of the valley. This unit incorporates much more sand (mixedload) than older clay layers in the valley, is more uniform downstream, and shows an erosional base. The river migrated laterally and began to incise, eroding and reworking sediments of the older Mickety Mulga unit. The transition to mixed-load sediment occurred throughout the length of the study area. Gravels and boulders were no longer being introduced to the system, even in the upstream reach."

    "heading": "Middle–Late Miocene incision",
    "text": "The elevated basalts at Mookerawa and Brocklehurst provide evidence of substantial vertical incision of the valley after the Middle Miocene. By the Late Miocene – Early Pliocene incision had advanced at least as far upstream as Butler’s Falls. Incision may have been concurrent with sedimentation of the Late Miocene Eurombedah unit downstream. The commencement of infilling by the Pliocene Mickety Mulga unit prevented further erosion of the valley basement between Wellington and Gigmalerie. Therefore, bedrock incision in the alluvial valley was a rapid, discrete event confined to the Middle to Late Miocene in the study reach.\nThe evidence of rapid vertical incision of the Macquarie River is consistent with a headward-eroding knickpoint beginning downstream of Brocklehurst at some time after the emplacement of the Middle Miocene basalts and before deposition of the Eurombedah unit late in the Miocene. A major knickpoint (or knick zone) is evident today in the Macquarie valley, upstream of the study area between the Turon River confluence and Freemantle (Figure 1), and on the major tributary streams, such as Lewis Ponds Creek, Summerhill Creek, Turon River, Winburndale Rivulet, and Bell River. All of these rivers exhibit steep-sided gorges downstream of the knickpoint. As discussed above, the gradient of the pre-basalt valley between Brocklehurst and Mookerawa is 0.0027, compared with the modern valley gradient of 0.0006 (Table 2). Allowing for channel sinuosity as high as the alluvial reach of the river today (1.48), the\n284 K. M. Tomkins and P. P. Hesse\ngradient of the pre-basalt channel could have been as low as 0.0018, well within the range generally associated with bedrock incision (Sklar & Dietrich 1998), and only seen at the knickpoint and headwaters of the Macquarie River today, and therefore steep enough to account for the initiation of knickpoint erosion. In the Macquarie valley, erosion by multiple knickpoints is suggested by the buried ‘valley-in-valley’ form found between Wellington and Dubbo. The narrow inset valley is possibly the result of a second knickpoint which became overwhelmed by deposition of the Eurombedah and Mickety Mulga units.\nNott et al. (1996) found that valleys along the eastern escarpment have eroded vertically (bed lowering) and horizontally (gorge extension) by knickpoint retreat and that knickpoint erosion is frequently 2–4 orders of magnitude more rapid than other forms of vertical erosion resulting in a highly dissected landscape. The Macquarie River knickpoint retreat rate can be determined in several ways. Assuming incision from a headward-advancing knickpoint began at Brocklehurst immediately after the basalt flow (ca 12 Ma) and had passed Wellington by 5 Ma (deposition of the Mickety Mulga unit) before eroding to its present position at Freemantle, the rates of knickpoint retreat are 8.5 km/106 y (Brocklehurst to Wellington) and 28 km/106 y (Wellington to Freemantle), or 16.7 km/106 y overall (Brocklehurst to Freemantle). If incision began later the rates would be correspondingly higher.\nThese retreat rates can be used to constrain the time of the initiation of knickpoint erosion downstream of Brocklehurst. The downstream limit of incision can be estimated by reconstructions of the palaeovalley from drilling beneath the alluvial plain near Dandaloo (Haridharan 2003). A shallow (40 m) valley can be identified incised into Upper Jurassic Pilliga Sandstone and covered by up to 100 m of alluvium of the unconfined riverine plain (Haridharan 2003) at a valley distance of 90 km from Brocklehurst. Assuming the same knickpoint retreat rates, incision of the valley from Dandaloo to Brocklehurst may have taken 5.4 million years (at 16.7 km/106 y) or as long as 10.6 million years (at 8.5 km/106 y), placing the onset of incision in the Early Miocene (22.6–17.4 Ma). Sediments near the base of the palaeovalley at Dandaloo have an Early Miocene (T. bellus) flora (Haridharan 2003), consistent with the projected erosion rates. On this evidence it is very unlikely that the incision of the Macquarie valley at Brocklehurst and upstream is a continuing or lagged response to either Late Cretaceous denudation or Early Cenozoic events.\nThe Macquarie River knickpoint retreat rates are substantially higher than those reported for coastal rivers of the highlands. Nott et al. (1996) gave gorge-extension rates on the Shoalhaven River of around 2.5 km/106 y and Weissel and Seidl (1998) give an average value of around 2 km/106 y for the Apsley/Macleay, assuming knickpoint generation at the continental margin at the time of rifting (100 Ma). Cosmogenic dating by Weissel and Seidl (1998) was used to determine vertical erosion rates at the escarpment of around 100 m/106 y but they appear to also imply much higher rates of horizontal knickpoint erosion. One of the problems concerning all estimates of knickpoint erosion rates is the scarcity of time control. Usually this is provided by a single dated basalt flow which, as for the\nMacquarie, can only give a maximum age of incision and therefore a minimum erosion rate. It may not be a coincidence that the relatively high rates determined for the Macquarie are a product of the relatively young age datum (12 Ma basalts) available compared to other sites. It should also be noted that the catchment area of the Macquarie is much greater (26 000 km2 at Narromine; 4580 km2 near Freemantle) than either the Shoalhaven (2770 km2 at Welcome Reef) or the Apsley (894 km2 at Apsley Falls). Under modern hydrological conditions this difference can still not account for the different erosion rates (given the relevant river discharges), although extrapolation of modern discharges back to the Miocene and Pliocene is hazardous given the evidence of climate change (see below). The missing piece of information may well be the sediment-supply rate and its effect on bed-erosion rates (Sklar & Dietrich 1998). Bedrock-erosion rates reach a maximum at intermediate sediment supply rates, where there is enough sediment to supply tools for scour but insufficient sediment to shield the bed. The long-term sediment supply to these Australian rivers can be crudely assessed by the depth and width of the valley carved by the knickpoint; this is much lower for the Macquarie than for either the Apsley or Shoalhaven or other coastal rivers and may help account for the rapid horizontal extension of the shallow Macquarie gorge.\nInitiation of incision by highland uplift\nA range of evidence suggests that knickpoint retreat along the Macquarie River and its tributaries was triggered by uplift of the highlands in the Middle–Late Miocene. The amplitude of post-basalt incision increases in an upstream direction from Brocklehurst to Mookerawa, which suggests that the upper part of the catchment, in the east, has been uplifted relative to the western lower catchment. The alluvium and morphology of the pre-basalt valley is inconsistent with the present steep grade and points to steepening of this reach of the river at or after the Middle Miocene. Highland uplift, and valley oversteepening, is the most credible cause of the Late Miocene incision and knickpoint development, consistent with these observations. A similarly dramatic change in the depositional regime of the Darling Basin (Darling Riverine Plain) occurred in the Miocene. Sedimentation in the basin began in the Early Miocene at Dandaloo, within the narrow palaeovalley, but the great volume of sediment, in the overlying basin, is Late Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary in age. At the downstream limit of the basin, near Bourke, sedimentation began earlier in the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene (Martin 1997), but rapid sediment accumulation began later. These coincidental changes in highland denudational regime and basin accumulation are similar in style, but smaller in scale, to earlier events in the Murray Basin.\nThe style of uplift is not well defined by the widely spaced basalt flows. Bishop and Brown (1992) inferred uptake of strain by faulting in the Lachlan River valley. Large faults run north–south along the Catombal Range between Wellington and Murrumbidgerie (Figure 2) (Colquhoun et al. 1997) and a fault is inferred at Narromine (Sherwin 1997). The faults running along the Catombal\nMacquarie valley Late Cenozoic history 285\nRange, however, are not expressed in the overlying Mesozoic rocks (Colquhoun et al. 1997) and therefore have not been reactivated during the Cenozoic. Uplift may have been by long-wave flexure of the lithosphere with the hinge point around Narromine, i.e. the margin of the confined, alluvial valley and the (now) Darling Riverine Plain.\nThe cause of Cenozoic highland uplift is contentious. Explanations range from denudation-induced isostatic rebound (Bishop & Brown 1992; van der Beek et al. 1999), uplift caused by downwarping of the rifted margin and upward flexure of the crust inland (Ollier & Pain 1997) to unspecified dynamic uplift (Webb et al. 1992) and uplift associated with volcanism (Jones & Veevers 1982) which may be explained by igneous underplating (Wellman 1987), following rifting (Lister & Etheridge 1989). The evidence that we have presented shows near-synchronous volcanism and incision, and the Late Cenozoic age and regional extent of uplift and volcanism fit the model of Lister and Etheridge. In this model, both the eruptive volcanism and the uplift are the product of deep lithospheric underplating, distinct from the very localised doming which has been shown to occur beneath the large central volcanoes of eastern Australia (Wellman 1987). Nevertheless, the ability to choose between the competing models requires greater consideration of the timing of the incision event and proposed uplift. The passive isostatic rebound model requires protracted uplift over a broad area of the highlands in response to denudational unloading (van der Beek et al. 1999). Even where strain is accommodated through long-wave flexure, rather than faulting, it should follow from this model that uplift would occur over tens of millions of years, either continually or through multiple small movements. The single, high-magnitude uplift and incision episode of the Macquarie valley appears to support the active uplift model, rather than the denudational isostatic rebound model. However, Bishop and Brown (1992) have argued for a large faulted (or shortwavelength flexure) response to isostatic, unloading stress delayed millions of years after the unloading trigger, which in its expression is difficult to distinguish from uplift induced by underplating or some other dynamic trigger, except perhaps by the association with volcanism. Without knowing a complete post-rifting history of uplift and incision it may not be possible to distinguish between uplift events of similar style and scale produced by these different mechanisms.\nAn alternative explanation for the massive erosion of the valley is Martin’s (1987, 1991) argument for erosion/ non-deposition in the Late Miocene in response to low sealevel. However, the rapid accumulation and conformable nature of deposition of the Eurombedah and Mickety Mulga units in the Late Miocene – Early Pliocene and the downstream thickening of the sediment unit demonstrates a rising local base-level on the alluvial plain beyond Narromine. The alluvial valley of the Macquarie River is approximately 1500 km valley distance from the coast and flows across the (now) Darling Riverine Plain and Darling Corridor, which is characterised by very low gradients with the capacity to attenuate the proposed amplitude of sea-level change. Therefore sea-level lowering would have had a negligible effect on incision in the Macquarie valley. Likewise climate change (specifically\nthat leading to greater runoff) is a possible cause of valley erosion. However, evidence from pollen assemblages showed that there was only modest climate change in the Late Miocene. Rainfall is inferred to have decreased slightly in the Middle Miocene such that wet sclerophyll (Lower Myrtaceae) became dominant over rainforest (T. bellus phase) (Martin 1987, 1991) i.e. in the opposite sense to that which would bring about greater runoff.\nInterpreting the Late Cenozoic deposits: controls on sedimentation\nIn the Lachlan River valley, cut and fill stratigraphy of the Upper Cenozoic sediments and flights of terraces were argued, by Williamson (1986) and Bishop and Brown (1992), to provide evidence of highland uplift. The gross stratigraphy and architecture of the Macquarie valley sediments are quite similar to the Lachlan valley (two main units with a disconformable contact near the Pliocene– Pleistocene boundary) inviting interpretation of a similar history of incisional response to Late Pliocene/Pleistocene uplift on the Macquarie. This would be evidence of a second, possibly multiple, uplift event on the Macquarie and possibly a continued isostatic adjustment to highland denudation.\nThe Quaternary Bunglegumbie unit sits disconformably on the Pliocene Mickety Mulga unit, in contrast to the previous long history of conformable vertical accumulation. This disconformable boundary is evident throughout the study area, from Gigmalerie to Narromine (Figure 4). Cut terraces of the Mickety Mulga unit are found in the bedrock-confined valley downstream as far as Little River and a lower terrace is found in the Bunglegumbie unit sediments throughout the length of the study area and downstream of Narromine. However, the terraces in the Macquarie valley are only up to 30 m above current river level, compared to 60–65 m in the Lachlan valley (Bishop & Brown 1992), there are at most two terraces (compared with up to five), and incision has occurred over a valley distance of tens of kilometres. Once again, base-level change seems an unlikely cause as sediments continued to accumulate conformably on the plain beyond Narromine while incision has been restricted to the upstream bedrock-confined valley. It is feasible that uplift of the highlands occurred (or is occurring) in the Macquarie River valley, which triggered incision into the Mickety Mulga unit and caused progressive lowering of the Bunglegumbie floodplain. Nevertheless, although uplift may be sufficient to explain the Quaternary incision in the Macquarie valley it is not necessary, nor is it sufficient to explain the shift in sediment calibre which occurred in the transition from Mickety Mulga unit deposition to the Bunglegumbie unit; a change in sediment load from coarse to fine-grained.\nTwo significant changes in sediment calibre are recorded in the Macquarie valley sedimentary record. We will consider both of these events to better understand the influences operating on the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Macquarie sediments. In the Late Miocene – Early Pliocene, sedimentation in the valley changed from suspended or mixed load (of the Eurombedah unit) to a large influx of bed load (of the Mickety Mulga unit). There\n286 K. M. Tomkins and P. P. Hesse\nappears to have been a sudden change in the nature of the sediment deposited along the entire alluvial reach, rather than a lateral shift in the locus of deposition of different sediment types that might follow from changes in stream power or progressive backfilling or infilling of the valley. The conformable nature of deposition of the Mickety Mulga unit indicates continuing base-level rise downstream during deposition, thereby discounting external base-level change as a possible explanation for the sudden change. Likewise the continued vertical accumulation shows that sediment supply was high both before and after the change in sediment load and therefore that a climate shift to wetter conditions and more competent transport may not be sufficient to explain the shift. Indeed, the palaeoclimatic conditions inferred from the pollen record point to only minor climatic fluctuations around this time (Figure 9) (Martin 1987, 1991).\nWe believe the most probable explanation of this change in sediment load is related to the lithology of the catchment. We have described the likely history of incision of the valley in the Middle to Late Miocene – Early Pliocene above by headward-advancing knickpoint retreat from a point around Narromine. Most sediment is generated at and below the advancing knickpoint on the trunk stream\nand its tributaries. From Narromine to around Murrumbidgerie the valley is eroded into Mesozoic sediments (Triassic and Jurassic) which include some thin conglomerate beds but are dominantly comprised of sandstones and finer rocks (Figure 2). Field exposure is usually very poor, although the soils formed on these sediments show that they weather to produce either sandy clay soils or heavy clays (the uppermost units particularly). Drilling beneath the alluvial plain (Haridharan 2003) has shown the Upper Jurassic Pilliga Sandstone sequence to be interbedded sandstone and thicker shale and mudstone units. This lithology contrasts dramatically with the Palaeozoic Lachlan Fold Belt lithologies of the valley upstream of Murrumbidgerie. While very diverse, and including a range of volcanic rocks, limestone and some intrusives, which weather to yield clays, a large area is comprised of highly resistant low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks which yield polymictic gravels and boulders and only thin soils. As the knickpoint advanced headward it would have passed from the Mesozoic to the Palaeozoic rocks and a change in the sediment load of the river from dominantly fine to dominantly coarse would have occurred as a result.\nThe second change in depositional regime was the erosion of the Mickety Mulga unit and deposition of the\nMacquarie valley Late Cenozoic history 287\nsandy clay Bunglegumbie unit, which now forms the modern floodplain. The change in sediment load is seen along the length of the alluvial valley and is, again, not the product of lateral relocation of sediment facies but rather the product of reduced transport efficiency or backfilling or infilling of the valley. There is no substantial coarsegrained Quaternary deposit in the alluvial valley, although the river has clearly been capable of eroding and removing the underlying gravels, at least periodically. The only age control on the sandy clay unit is one basal sample which yielded a Pleistocene age (H. A. Martin pers. comm. 1997) and it is possible that this was not Early Pleistocene but later. The coarse-grained Trangie Formation of the Darling Riverine Plain (Watkins & Meakin 1996) has been dated by thermoluminescence to the Middle Pleistocene (two dates) but Watkins and Meakin give a Pliocene–Pleistocene age for the unit. It is not clear if the Trangie Formation is an extension of the Pliocene Mickety Mulga gravels described in this paper or a deposit of gravels eroded from them in the Pleistocene.\nClimate change as a control on catchment runoff and river discharge may satisfy both the observed basal erosion and change in sediment calibre of the Bunglegumbie unit. Martin (1987, 1991) described a decrease in precipitation to current levels and a change in vegetation from wet sclerophyll forest to woodlands and grasslands from the Pliocene to the Quaternary, corresponding to a decrease in precipitation from humid (around 1200 mm/y) to subhumid (around 600–800 mm/y) (Martin 1987). Such a decrease in rainfall would have been reflected across the landscape in both hillslope processes and fluvial processes. Over this climate range, where protective ground cover is effectively complete, there is a positive relationship between average precipitation and sediment yield in eastern Australia (Douglas 1967). Higher sediment yields do occur where protective cover is low but this appears to require much more arid conditions than those considered here (Wasson 1994). The finer grained sediments of the Quaternary unit are perhaps explicable by lower discharge and catchment runoff, although the absence of stores of coarse-grained sediment in the upstream end of the alluvial valley or as colluvial deposits in the catchment, suggests that neither channels nor slopes have produced significant quantities of gravels in the Quaternary. Instead, sediment supply from the slopes has decreased and changed to more fine grained, particularly clays, as slope processes changed from mass wasting, which produced large lithic fragments from Palaeozoic metasediments, to weathering and diffusive transport, which is consistent with a subhumid climate. We suggest that the Macquarie River became sediment starved and as a consequence began to incise into the older units. Watkins and Meakin (1996) formed a similar conclusion based on evidence from the fluvial units on the Darling Riverine Plain in the Nyngan and Walgett areas. The Pleistocene Cowra Formation of the Lachlan River also shows the same transformation from abundant coarse-grained sediment deposition to the modern fine-grained deposition regime (Williamson 1986) and we have observed the same transition in Namoi River sediments.\nClimatic forcing on the time-scales of interest here is associated with tectonic events affecting the patterns of\nocean currents, the growth of ice sheets, global cooling (Zachos et al. 2001), and consequent drying of the Australian continent. The progressive drying of the interior of southeastern Australia is shown by the change from rainforest (T. bellus zone) to wet sclerophyll (Upper Myrtaceae zone) in the Middle Pliocene in the valleys draining west from the highlands (Martin 1987, 1991) and the subsequent shift to drier vegetation including grasses and Asteraceae in the Pleistocene (Figure 9). While the dating of the sediments of the Macquarie River valley leaves the timing of the transition uncertain, the global changes can be seen dramatically through the marine oxygen isotope record (Figure 9). The oxygen isotope ratio ( 18O) records the fluctuations of sea-level and ice volume and therefore the frequency and amplitude of global ice ages. Since ca 3 Ma there has been a slow drift to higher 18O as global ice volume has increased (Mix et al. 1995). Over the same period the frequency of fluctuations of ice volume has decreased as the ice sheets impose their own regulation on the response of the climate system to changes in insolation caused by orbital variations. At about 0.8 Ma the period of the glacial cycles increased to 105 y and the amplitude of fluctuations in ice volume also increased markedly. The primary effect on the Australian environment has been the long-term drift to drier climates, although the severity of arid glacial periods has also increased and may have had profound effects on both flora and fauna. True aridity in inland southeastern Australia, indicated by saline playa lakes and aeolian landforms, probably only occurred in glacial stages after 350 ka (Hesse 1994). This chronology provides a background to the likely causes of fluvial changes in the Macquarie valley and the region.\nThis interpretation of the Quaternary incision event in the Macquarie valley leaves only one identifiable uplift event in the Late Cenozoic history of the Macquarie valley. The similarities between Macquarie valley sediments and those of the Lachlan valley raise the question of the validity of the interpretation of events in the Lachlan (Bishop & Brown 1992). The Quaternary Cowra Formation has two members: an upper silty clay unit forming the modern floodplain and the terraces around Cowra, which is very similar to the Bunglegumbie unit of the Macquarie, and a lower sand and gravel unit disconformably overlying the Lachlan Formation (Williamson 1986). Bishop and Brown (1992) interpreted the erosional base of the Cowra Formation as evidence of incision induced by uplift near Cowra. The basal gravels of the Cowra Formation have no equivalent in the Macquarie valley, but could well be derived from reworking of the uplifted, and incised, Lachlan Formation sediments and renewed bedrock incision upstream of Cowra. The upper silty clay is very similar to the Bunglegumbie unit, and likewise, very different from the older Pliocene sediments. The Pleistocene river and floodplain have undergone a reduction in calibre of sediment, similar to the Macquarie, which is not readily explained by uplift and renewed incision. We suggest that this is a response to regional climate change which may be superimposed on the response of the river to tectonic uplift, and contributing also to progressive Quaternary incision and terrace formation.\n288 K. M. Tomkins and P. P. Hesse\nRegional correlations and models of uplift\nThe Pleistocene shift to accumulation of fine-grained sediments is common to the Macquarie and its neighbouring catchments. Nevertheless, there are some significant differences between the Macquarie valley and the Late Cenozoic events documented for the Lachlan valley which demonstrate the spatial scale of processes acting in the landscape evolution of the highlands. Uplift, incision, and depositional episodes have been identified in both catchments, yet the sequence of these events and their age is not consistent between catchments. In the Lachlan valley, deposition (Early Miocene to Late Pliocene) was interrupted by uplift (around the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary) followed by incision and renewed deposition (Quaternary) (Williamson 1986; Martin 1987; Bishop & Brown 1992) (Figure 9). These events followed an earlier (but less well-described) episode of valley incision (around or following 20 Ma?) and highland denudation proposed as the cause of isostatic disequilibrium and the subsequent (Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary) rebound uplift event (Bishop & Brown 1992). The trigger for this earlier incision event is not stated but could be assumed to be highland uplift again. The Macquarie record described in this paper is of the cycle of uplift, incision and deposition (Middle Miocene uplift; Middle–Late Miocene incision; Late Miocene – Quaternary deposition), although none of these events is synchronous with those in the Lachlan catchment. We can be confident that valley incision in the Lachlan catchment pre-dated basalts derived from the Canobolas volcano but post-dated basalts of the same age in the Macquarie catchment. Likewise, uplift in the Macquarie pre-dated deposition of the Nothofagus phase sediments but post-dated younger upper Myrtaceae phase sediments in the Lachlan.\nTherefore the Late Pliocene – Early Pleistocene uplift/offset event in the Lachlan was of relatively local extent. Similarly, the Middle Miocene uplift event in the Macquarie valley is not detected in the Lachlan valley. We can also point to differences in style of deformation between the catchments, with faulting or shortwavelength offsets in the Lachlan and long-wavelength flexure in the Macquarie and Murrumbidgee valleys (Bishop & Brown 1992). These observations tend to support the contention of van der Beek et al. (2001) and Persano et al. (2002) that local geology (lithology, structure) influences the detail of landscape evolution. In addition, it appears that some tectonic events are also only experienced over spatial scales of kilometres or tens of kilometres."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "The stratigraphy of the alluvial sediments filling the Macquarie River valley between Burrendong Dam and Narromine provides evidence of three major changes in the denudation history of the valley: (i) erosion of the valley floor post-Middle Miocene and deposition of the basal clays and sands in the Late Miocene; (ii) filling of the valley with a wedge of gravels and sands up to a level higher than the modern river and floodplain in the Pliocene; and (iii) erosion and reworking of the Pliocene\nunit concurrent with deposition of a sandy clay floodplain in the Quaternary.\nThe extent of valley incision post-Middle Miocene, followed by conformable deposition of the Late Miocene Eurombedah and Pliocene Mickety Mulga units, points to uplift of the highlands in the Middle–Late Miocene. Uplift appears to have been by long-wave flexure of the lithosphere, triggering valley incision by knickpoint retreat. There is no evidence in the Macquarie River valley to support Miocene sea-level change as the cause of valley incision. The observed uplift is consistent with dynamic uplift in response to igneous underplating, but we cannot easily eliminate or separate passive (denudational isostatic) uplift of the highlands proposed for the neighbouring Lachlan valley. Nevertheless, the contrast in timing of events between the Lachlan and Macquarie valleys shows that tectonic responses operate on scales of tens of kilometres and that neighbouring catchments can have quite different histories.\nThe change from deposition of sediments to incision and reworking of older units in the Pleistocene, however, can be accounted for by climate change to drier conditions. Greater weathering of hillslopes and transportation of finer material resulted in the Macquarie River becoming sediment-starved in the Quaternary. The modern river continues to incise and rework the older gravel and sand unit, redepositing a sandy clay floodplain with terraces preserved at the valley margins. The similarity in pollen assemblages in the Lachlan, Namoi and Macquarie valleys (Martin 1991) suggests that climate operates at greater than regional scales. Therefore, the findings of this study sound a cautionary note in the interpretation of tectonic events from terrace sequences within the highland – sedimentary basin transition zone. Terraces are one of the foremost examples of equifinality in geomorphology and climatic, as well as tectonic, processes and must be considered in their interpretation."

  "abstractText": "The stratigraphy of the alluvial sediments filling the Macquarie River valley, New South Wales, was investigated to test models of landscape evolution of the rifted margin Eastern Highlands of Australia. In the neighbouring Lachlan River valley, the stratigraphy of Neogene sediments has been incorporated into a model proposing denudation and episodic passive (denudational isostatic) uplift of the highlands throughout the Neogene. In this study, we aimed to test the regional extent of this model and the influence of sediment supply on the stratigraphic record and its interpretation. The sediments of the Macquarie River valley show three major changes in the depositional regime. First, erosion of the valley basement in the Late Miocene was followed by (and possibly synchronous with) deposition of a basal clay and sand unit in the Late Miocene. Second, the valley was filled with a wedge of sediment containing abundant gravel and sand in the Pliocene; and third, the older gravelly unit was eroded and reworked in the Quaternary, and a sandy clay unit, which forms the modern floodplain, was deposited. Deformation of the Middle Miocene basalt-filled valley provides good evidence for substantial uplift of the highlands in the Middle–Late Miocene, synchronous with or shortly after widespread volcanism, but continuing no later than the Late Miocene. The Pleistocene incision is best accounted for by climate change to drier conditions, triggering a sediment-starved response by the Macquarie River, rather than further uplift. While valley incision and subsequent infilling can be viewed as a response to tectonism, the internal sedimentology and stratigraphy of the sediments appears to respond to fluctuations in sediment supply brought about by extrinsic climate change and intrinsic catchment lithology. The first-order tectonic events are not synchronous with uplift in the Lachlan valley and are restricted to relatively local spatial scales. However, the secondary climatic forcing has a broader regional expression.",
