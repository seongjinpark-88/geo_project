    "text": "The Andes of Central Chile (33–35 S) are a high mountain area that presents a strong southward trend of climatic conditions and relief. The humidity regime changes southward from semi-arid to semi-humid as the influence of cyclonic winter precipitation increases. Summit elevations of the Andes decrease southward, reaching 6570 m ASL at Cerro Tupungato (Chile/Argentina), 6962 m ASL at Cerro Aconcagua (Argentina) in the north, and only 4107 m at Volcán Peteroa in the south (Figure 1). The importance of late Quaternary volcanic activity increases southward and becomes a dominant landforming process at the Planchón–Peteroa volcano complex.\nThe Andes of Santiago comprise the Andean part of the Maipo catchment, i.e. a 6600 km2 wide mountain area between 33 and 34 200S. Two thirds of the\nannual precipitation is concentrated in winter between May and August (Figure 2).\nBetween 32 300 and 35 300S, a strong southward increase in mean annual precipitation can be observed (IGM, 1985). Although climatic data are scarce and local variability is to be expected, it can be assumed that the southward change in precipitation is in the order of a factor of three to four. The modern equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of glaciers falls from 4300–4400 m north of 33 S to 3200 m ASL in the southern part of the area (Lliboutry, 1956, 1986). At the small Echaurren glacier (33 350S, 70 080W), the 25-year mean ELA is situated at 3800 m ASL.\nRock glaciers in the Andes of Santiago have been studied in detail in only a few instances (Lliboutry, 1961, 1986; Marangunic, 1976; Contreras and Illanes, 1992; Brenning, 2003, 2004; Brenning et al., 2005). They have also been mentioned in other works (Lliboutry, 1956; J. Borde, unpublished doctoral thesis, 1966; C. Marangunic, unpublished glacier inventory, 1977, Dirección General de Aguas, Santiago). However, no systematic analysis of their distribution and importance has been made so far.\nReceived 20 December 2003 Revised 1 March 2005\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

    "text": "Geomorphological mapping was carried out in six catchments in the periglacial and nival zones of the Andes between 32 450S and 35 150S (Figure 1). In the case of two study areas, the upper Rı́o Blanco catchment at Cerro Catedral, and the Cajón de la Casa de Piedra at Cerros Picos Negros, the vertical distribution of rock-glacier surfaces was quantified using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The upper Yeso catchment (617 km2), and its subcatchment Cajón de la\nCasa de Piedra (32 km2), feed the El Yeso reservoir (2500 m ASL, mean storage 193 mill. m3). This is of importance for the water supply of Santiago.\nIn addition, an estimate of rock glacier distribution in the Andes of Santiago between 32 480 and 34 370S was made. It was based on statistical estimators for a random sampling design using stratification with respect to elevation and aspect classes. The presence of an intact rock glacier, glacier, debris, thermokarst or exposed bedrock was distinguished at 1105 point locations using air photos (Instituto Geográfico\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

At 40 of these sampling locations, an interpretation was not possible (generally due to shadow in the air photo). At another 38 locations, no unequivocal classification could be made; a Monte Carlo approach was used in order to account for this uncertainty.\nAn estimate of the water equivalent of rock glaciers was based on the assumption of an average ice-rich permafrost thickness of 30 m within rock glaciers, a\nvolumetric ice content of 50% and an ice density of 0.8 g/cm3. In this work, areas always refer to the planimetric (2D) rather than ‘true’ (3D) surface area."

    "text": "In the Andes of Santiago (33–34 S), active rock glaciers exist sporadically above 3000 m ASL (Figure 3) and much more abundantly between 3500 and c. 4250 m ASL (Figure 4). Quantitative results are presented in Figure 5 and Table 1.\nIn many of the ‘medium elevation’ catchments west of the main range, where the highest elevations range between 4000 and 5000 m ASL, rock glaciers are the most significant geomorphological feature between 3500 and 3750 m ASL. One example is the Cajón de la Casa de Piedra catchment (Cerros Picos Negros, 33 330S; Brenning, 2003).\nIn the western Andes of Santiago, the ELA at Echaurren glacier varies between 3600 m in El Niño years to above 4000 m ASL in dry years (Escobar et al., 2000). In the surroundings, a number of active rock glaciers reach elevations above 4000 m ASL. Although active rock glaciers exist in the Andes of Santiago at 3000 m ASL, these occurrences are less frequent, and their coexistence with inactive and even relict features indicates that periglacial conditions belong to the past rather than the present. This is underlined by the fact that active rock glaciers near 3000 m ASL are often debris rock glaciers in proximity to thermokarst-affected debris-covered massiveice bodies, as observed in the Casa de Piedra valley (Figure 3) and further north at Cerro La Parva (32 450S; Figure 6).\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Permafrost and Periglac. Process., 16: 231–240 (2005)\nDue to the great abundance of rock glaciers above 3500 m ASL, they play a key role within the debris transport system. The presence of permafrost not only stabilizes the detrital material itself, but rock glaciers constitute a local base level for fast gravitational mass movements such as avalanches, rock fall and even small rock slides. The importance of this becomes even clearer if debris transport paths are analysed in a quantitative way. For example, in the Casa de Piedra catchment, almost one third (31%) of the total area above 3000 m ASL is either occupied by active rock glaciers or lies within their contributing area. Above 3500 m ASL, this proportion rises to 43% (e.g. Rı́o Blanco catchment at Cerro Catedral: 38% of the areas above 3300 m ASL). As a consequence, fast mass movements of detrital material produced within these geomorphological contributing areas are restricted either downvalley or downslope by the slow creep of active rock glaciers.\nFew measurements of rock glacier dynamics exist in the Andes of Santiago. Contreras and Illanes (1992) determined annual average surface displacement rates between 0.3 and 0.8 cm/d at Infiernillo rock glacier (Los Bronces mine, Disputada de Las Condes, 33 090S), and Marangunic (1976) measured up to 1.28 cm/d during 1 month in late summer (March) at Pedregoso rock glacier (32 310S). These values are considered rather high (e.g. Barsch, 1996a; Kokarev et al., 1997).\nA sub-sample of rock glaciers was statistically analysed with respect to its size distribution. Sizes vary between 0.01 and 2.0 km2, but generally do not\nexceed 0.7 km2. The distribution is extremely skewed, with a median of 0.04 km2 and a mean of 0.09 km2. These statistics take into account the fact that, in the context of the sampling procedure used, the probability of ‘hitting’ a given rock glacier is proportional to its surface area, and consequently a suitably-weighted mean and median is used.\nAn active rock glacier situated at 33 300S and 69\n580W in the Colorado catchment, of an approximate size of 2.0 km2, is the biggest in the Andes of Santiago, according to air photos. Its toe lies at 3600 m ASL, and the ‘rooting zone’ extends to approximately 4200 m ASL."

    "text": "The role of rock glaciers within the hydrological system has been studied by various authors (Corte, 1976, 1978; Buk, 1983; Gardner and Bajewsky, 1987; Giardino et al., 1992; Schrott, 1998; Burger et al., 1999; Trombotto et al., 1999; Croce and Milana, 2002). Rock glaciers are long-term stores of water, and their active layer and sub-permafrost layer act as aquifers that are variable in time (Burger et al., 1999). Furthermore, especially impermeable ice-rich permafrost may act as an aquiclude that enhances nearsurface runoff within the active layer. Although rock glaciers are much smaller than most glaciers of the highest summits in the study area, they contain a considerable amount of water due to their high number. The hydrological importance of rock glaciers in\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Permafrost and Periglac. Process., 16: 231–240 (2005)\nthe Casa de Piedra catchment (Cerros Picos Negros), a subcatchment of the Yeso river that feeds the El Yeso reservoir, was studied by Brenning (2003). In that area, more water is stored in rock glaciers than in glaciers, and its amount approximately equals the water content of a huge debris-covered ice body with thermokarst ponds indicating recent decay (Figure 3). The limited importance of glaciers in this subcatchment is due to the small portion of area above the ELA, which is representative for many catchments west of the main range. This relationshipbecomesevenmorestrikinginother, morphologically similar sub-catchments. This is the case, for example, west of Cerro Catedral in north- and west-exposed glacier-free cirques (Figures 4 and 5). On a regional scale, Table 1 summarizes the spatial extent and estimated water equivalent of rock glaciers in the Andes of Santiago. When\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Permafrost and Periglac. Process., 16: 231–240 (2005)\ncompared to the Swiss Alps (Table 2), in the Andes of Santiago this parameter reaches a value of 0.30 km3, with a 90% confidence interval from 0.23 to 0.37 km3, per 1000 km2. These estimates are much higher than an earlier estimate of 0.1 km3, which was based on the re-analysed glacier inventory (Brenning, 2003). Although there are uncertainties regarding bias in the estimate, the main conclusion to be drawn is that the absolute importance of rock glaciers as stores of water in the subtropical semi-arid/semi-humid high mountain area of the Andes of Central Chile is one order of magnitude greater than in temperate and more humid mountain areas such as the Swiss Alps. As regards the position of rock glaciers within the hydrological system, about one quarter (c. 21–28%) of\nCopyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Permafrost and Periglac. Process., 16: 231–240 (2005)\nthe area above 3000 m ASL is drained through intact rock glaciers, because rock-glacier contributing areas were determined to be, on average, two to three times larger than rock glaciers themselves.\nCLIMATIC IMPLICATIONS\nIf active rock glaciers are used as indicators of Andean permafrost (Garleff and 1986; Veit, 1991; Schrott, 1998), the abundant distribution of active rock glaciers in the Andes of Santiago suggests the presence of discontinuous mountain permafrost above 3500 m ASL (Figure 5). Between 3000 and 3500 m ASL, sporadic permafrost is represented by individual active (and inactive) rock glaciers.\nWhile it has been reported that a mean annual air temperature (MAAT) of up to 1 to 2 C is required for the development of active rock glaciers (and discontinuous permafrost) in the European Alps (Barsch, 1977, 1996b), this contrasts with observations from the Andes of Santiago. The 0 C isotherm in the study area is situated at c. 3600 m ASL. This estimation is based on data from Embalse El Yeso (MAAT þ8.4 C at 2475 m ASL; 1962–2000; source: Dirección General de Aguas), Cristo Redentor (MAAT 1.5 C at 3830 m ASL; 1941–1983; Leiva et al., 1989) and El Infiernillo ( 5.3 C at 4343 m ASL in 1969; Puig and Valdivia, 1977). These yield an average lapse rate of c. 0.7 C per 100 m. Data from the Los Bronces mine (MAAT þ2.7 C at 3519 m ASL; 1980–2001; Disputada de Las Condes) and an estimate made by Lliboutry (1986) (MAAT 0 C at 3700 m ASL) suggest even warmer conditions.\nConsequently, the abundant distribution of active rock glaciers at 3500 m ASL occurs with a regional MAAT of at least 0.5 C. At this altitude, these features are ubiquitous, even on northwest-exposed open cir-\nques with high solar radiation input (e.g. at Cerro Catedral, Figures 4 and 5). Furthermore, sporadic intact rock glaciers exist in the study area even at a regional MAAT of c. þ4 C at 3000 m ASL. Similar findings were locally described by Trombotto et al. (1997).\nFrom these observations it is concluded that active and inactive rock glaciers between 3000 and c. 3700 m ASL in the Andes of Santiago either reflect past thermal conditions, because the time scale for thermal response of permafrost is known to be in the order of decades to centuries (Haeberli, 1990; Osterkamp and Romanovsky, 1999), or meet thermal equilibrium due to favourable local conditions (Trombotto, 1991). The latter include: (1) Topographic shading, taking into account the great influence of solar radiation as energy source at mid and low latitudes (D. Vonder Mühll, unpublished doctoral thesis, 1993; Hoelzle, 1996; Schrott, 1998; Wegmann and Keusen, 1998); (2) cold air circulation through blocky material (Wakonigg, 1996; Harris and Pedersen, 1998; Delaloye et al., 2003; Ishikawa et al., 2003; Luetscher et al., 2003); and (3) massive-ice bodies as sources of cold air (e.g. Casa de Piedra valley, Cerro La Parva area). Protection by soil or vegetation, which is responsible for sporadic permafrost in Canada at þ1 to þ1.5 C (Smith and Riseborough, 2002), is not present in Central Chile at these altitudes.\nTurning to the discussion of relict rock glacier occurrences, the lowest and biggest relict feature is found at 2630 m ASL (altitude of the toe), at Cerro Catedral in a northwest exposition. The rock-glacier complex consists of three superimposed tongueshaped relict rock glaciers with a length of 2.2 km and approximate front heights of 150 m (lowest) and 80 m (middle and uppermost fronts). The altitudinal depression of the relict rock glacier with respect to active rock glaciers amounts to c. 800 m. This suggests a temperature depression of c. 5.5 C at the time of activity. The modern MAAT of c. 7 C at 2630 m ASL suggests a greater thermal depression. Consequently the position of the relict rock glacier probably corresponds to thermal conditions of the Late Glacial or possibly of the Last Glacial Temperature Minimum. For the latter, a temperature depression of 6– 8 C in Central Chile has been derived from the shift of the periglacial belt at 30 S (Garleff and Stingl, 1985; Veit, 1991, 1993) and palynological findings south of 34 S (Heusser, 1983, 1990)."

This lower limit is, according to air photo interpretation, also representative for the surrounding areas. However, above 3200 m ASL active rock glaciers are abundant in the glacier-free areas, especially in hanging valleys.\nFurther south, at the active Volcán Planchón (35\n130S, 3920 m; Naranjo and Haller, 2002), only one probably active debris rock glacier is found on its Chilean northern slope at 3060 m ASL. An embryonic rock glacier also exists at c. 3500 m ASL and a further active feature exists on the eastern, Argentinian, slope of Volcán Planchón at c. 3250 m ASL. The rock glacier on the north face of Volcán Planchón is, according to air photos, the southernmost active rock glacier in Central Chile.\nThis lack of rock glacier development can be attributed to several reasons: (1) Glaciofluvial processes are dominant on the west and south sides of the volcano complex, (2) the area is covered with late-Quaternary volcanic rocks, which are more resistant to weathering than the sedimentary and older volcanic rocks that prevail east of Santiago, (3) the direct impact of frequent volcanic activity (25 eruptions of Planchón– Peteroa, Descabezado Grande and Quizapu volcanoes during the last 200 years; Naranjo et al., 1999) and geothermal heating may inhibit the creep of permafrost, and (4) south of the Planchón–Peteroa complex, only the highest summits exceed 3000 m ASL."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "Active rock glaciers are the dominant geomorphological feature within the modern periglacial zone of the Andes of Santiago. They play an important role within the debris transport and hydrological systems of this semi-arid mountain environment. Their importance rapidly diminishes south of 34 150S. Young volcanism, modern glaciation and decreasing summit elevations lead to a southward limit of rock glacier distribution in the Andes of Central Chile at 35 150S. The lower limit of discontinuous permafrost, as derived from rock glacier distribution, is situated around 3500 m ASL. The sporadic permafrost belt (3000–3500 m ASL) is characterized by the coexistence of active, inactive and relict rock glaciers."

  "abstractText": "Rock glaciers in the Andes of Santiago de Chile occupy c. 10% of the total land surface between 3500 and 4250 m ASL. An estimated water equivalent of 0.3 km per 1000 km of mountain area is stored within them; this value is one order of magnitude higher than in the Swiss Alps. Climate data indicate that the lowest occurrences of active rock glaciers in the Andes of Santiago are not in equilibrium with modern climate. Relict features are found as low as at 2630 m ASL, implying a depression of the mean annual air temperature of at least c. 5.5 C. South of Santiago, active rock glacier distribution ends at 35 150S due to lower topography, young volcanism and increased humidity. Copyright # 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",
