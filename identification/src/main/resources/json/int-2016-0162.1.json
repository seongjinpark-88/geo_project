    "text": "The emplacement of large intrusive complexes into sedimentary basins can have profound effects on host sedimentary rocks including deformation, thermal aureole metamorphic reactions, alteration of fluid-flow pathways, and the formation of associated hydrothermal vent complexes (HVCs). These processes can in turn have major implications for petroleum systems on the local and regional scale, and can contribute to global climate change due to the production and outgassing of greenhouse gases, such as CH4 and CO2. Imaging these features and assessing their implications from seismic data beneath extrusive volcanic cover is challenging due to heterogeneities in the volcanic pile and at the basalt-sediment transition. We have evaluated combined field and laboratory petrophysical data from the Isle of Skye, Scotland, where we identify a seismic-scale example of extensive intrusions interacting with the base-basalt transition. We have also evaluated a unique onshore example of a linked sill and associated HVC cutting up through the lava sequence. We compare these field results with HVCs from reflection seismic data across the Vøring Marginal High, offshore Norway, where subbasalt saucer-shaped intrusions are also seen associated with HVCs cutting the lava sequence. Seismic imaging problems associated with the velocity heterogeneity of volcanic sequences, along with a historical lack of highquality 3D data in volcanic regions worldwide, is suggested as having largely precluded the identification of these features in the past. The under-representation of these hydrothermal vents in the literature has key implications for the future appraisal of intrusion-related outgassing effects on the global climate such as those related to the Palaeocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, along with subbasalt petroleum prospectivity where they may alter maturation and migration pathways."

    "text": "The emplacement of large volumes of predominantly mafic intrusions during the development of large igneous provinces (LIPs) (e.g., Jerram and Bryan, 2015), has many implications for understanding contemporaneous global climate change (e.g., Svensen et al., 2004, 2007; Ganino and Arndt, 2009) and petroleum exploration (e.g., Schutter, 2003; Delpino et al., 2009; Jerram, 2015). Large-scale intrusive complexes on continental margins can have global climatic implications related to the formation and outgassing of greenhouse gases, such as CH4 and CO2, into the oceans and atmosphere through\nhydrothermal vent complexes (HVCs) (e.g., Svensen et al., 2004, 2015; Aarnes et al., 2015). In addition, igneous intrusions may influence the maturation of source rocks and the production of hydrocarbons (Svensen et al., 2004; Aarnes et al., 2010, 2015; Witte et al., 2012; Iyer et al., 2013) along with the modification of migration pathways by compartmentalization and emplacement associated fracturing (Filho et al., 2008; Rateau et al., 2013). Moreover, intrusions may also form hydrocarbon traps, including forced folding (Schutter, 2003; Jackson et al., 2013) and may host intraintrusion hydrocarbon reservoirs (Witte et al., 2012; Barr and Cooper, 2013).

In the subsurface, large intrusions may often be easily imaged as the highest amplitude reflectors in a sedimentary package (e.g., Planke et al., 2005); however, imaging sills may become more challenging at greater depths, with poor-quality data and where the sill thickness reduces (e.g., Smallwood and Maresh, 2002; Schofield et al., 2015). In the case of extrusive volcanic sequences, their highly heterogeneous velocity structure can cause extensive scattering of seismic waves, and it is therefore notoriously difficult to image volcanic rocks along with the stratigraphy and structures present beneath the basalt cover (Gallagher and Dromgoole, 2007; Davison et al., 2010). In this context, the presence, significance, and implications of intrusions and associated HVCs (e.g., Svensen et al., 2004) within the basalt-covered basinal regions of volcanic rifted margins are to date poorly constrained. The identification of HVCs associated with intrusions is of particular importance because they provide direct evidence for the creation of migration pathways and the passage of potential greenhouse gases to the atmosphere (Svensen et al., 2004).\nAn associated challenge in basins with volcanic cover is the identification and interpretation of the basalt-sediment transition (Davison et al., 2010). Where variations in the eruption environment at the onset of volcanism occur, the physical properties of the volcanic facies, as well as the facies distribution, can vary markedly (e.g., Nelson et al., 2009; Watton et al., 2014; Jerram et al., 2016a, 2016b). Understanding the likely heterogeneities in volcanic facies and the associated physical properties at the basalt-sediment transition is therefore important for identifying the transition in seismic data and, by implication, interpreting subbasalt features such as intrusions and associated HVCs.\nWithin this study, we investigate key field- and seismic-based examples of intrusions and associated HVC features emplaced in close proximity to the base-basalt transition from onshore (Isle of Skye, Scotland) and offshore (Vøring Basin, Norwegian Margin). We present field-based examples of intrusion-induced forced folding, a process whereby magma emplacement locally uplifts overburden strata (e.g., Pollard and Jonhson, 1973; Trude et al., 2004; Hansen and Cartwright, 2006; Jackson et al., 2013) along with evidence for onshore and offshore occurrences of sills linked to HVCs cutting through lava sequences in the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP). Additionally, we present new petrophysical data profiles across the base-basalt transition in different onshore settings to help quantify the observed heterogeneities. We aim at improving characterization and integration of onshore examples with offshore remote\nsensing data to highlight the importance of intrusionrelated influences on petroleum systems and climatic forcing within basalt-covered basinal areas worldwide."

    "text": "North Atlantic igneous province\nContinental break-up in the North Atlantic region between northwest Europe and East Greenland during the Palaeogene was accompanied by widespread volcanism associated with NAIP (e.g., Saunders et al., 1997; Hansen et al., 2009). Extensive lava fields, hydrovolcanic sequences, and subsurface intrusive complexes were emplaced on either side of the developing continental rift zone from the Late Paleocene to the Early Eocene followed by seafloor spreading. Widespread voluminous volcanism in the region is widely attributed to excess mantle temperatures (Hole and Millett, 2016) associated with a proto-Iceland thermal anomaly (often termed the “Iceland plume”), which initiated the first main phase of volcanism at the peripheries of the NAIP province (e.g., Scottish Hebrides and West Greenland) from approximately 62 Ma (Hole et al., 2015). The main phase of volcanic activity was focused along the protorift zone from approximately 57–55 Ma accompanying continental break-up from approximately 55 Ma onward (Saunders et al., 1997; Jerram and Widdowson, 2005).\nOnshore: Isle of Skye, Scotland The volcanic rocks exposed on the Isle of Skye form part of the British Palaeogene Igneous Province, part of the larger NAIP (Saunders et al., 1997). The Isle of Skye comprises rock units ranging in age from Precambrian to the Quaternary and is situated between two major structural lineaments of the Outer Minch Fault and the Moine Thrust (Emeuleus and Bell, 2005; Figure 1).\nSedimentary accumulations on the Isle of Skye were deposited during several rifting episodes prior to the onset of volcanism during the Paleocene (England et al., 1993). Precambrian Lewisian basement outcrops on the Sleat Peninsula and are thought to underlie most of the area. Torridonian (Precambrian) sediments unconformably overly the basement rocks, which are in turn unconformably overlain by Cambro-Ordovician shelf deposits that outcrop on the foreland of the Caledonian orogeny andwithin theMoine Thrust belt (Trewin, 2002). Prolonged collapse of the Caledonian orogenic belt from the late Devonian through to the Carboniferous allowed for basin development and infilling of Permo-Triassic through to Late Cretaceous sediments within the Sea of the Hebrides (Stein, 1988). The sediments were deposited in a series of west-dipping half grabens controlled by the southwest–northeast-trending Minch and Camasunary Faults (Figure 1).\nThe onset of volcanism on the Isle of Skye began at approximately 62 Ma (Hamilton et al., 1998) comprising the eruption of lavas and hyaloclastites, as well as the emplacement of sheet intrusions (sills and dikes), followed a few million years later by the emplacement of large-scale intrusive complexes, such as the Black\nSK84 Interpretation / August 2017\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\n03 /1\n6/ 18\nto 1\n29 .2\n40 .1\n28 .1\n48 .

For this study, cliff exposures of the base-basalt transition at Neist Point in the far northwest and Camas Ban in the Isle of Skye have been investi-\ngated. At Neist Point, basalt lavas forming part of the Skye Main Lava Series were unconformably erupted onto a surface comprising mixed Jurassic sediments\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\n03 /1\n6/ 18\nto 1\n29 .2\n40 .1\n28 .1\n48 .

The contact is obscured by approximately 10 m of dead ground at Neist Point, but the first exposed eruptive deposits comprise subaerial sheet lavas. The sedimentary rocks below the subaerial lavas are dominated by Middle Jurassic shallow marine siliciclastic sediments (Searl, 1994; Morton, 1999; Hesselbo and Coe, 2000) and estuarine strata with many coarse-grained facies, crossbedding sedimentary structures, and nonmarine shales (Morton, 1983; Harris, 1989). The subbasalt sediments have locally been extensively intruded by dolerite sheet intrusions.\nAt Camas Ban, on the east coast of Skye, the basal contact between the Middle Jurassic Bearreraig Sandstone Formation and the Skye Main Lava Series is obscured by a dolerite sill. In contrast to Neist Point,\nthe oldest exposed volcanic succession comprises hyaloclastite breccias, sands, and silts, which are overlain by tabular sheet flows, representing the passage zone to subaqueous emplaced volcanics (Skilling, 2002). Therefore, at Camas Ban, subaqueous conditions prevailed at the onset of volcanism promoting the development of a lava delta.\nOffshore: Vøring Basin, Norwegian Margin Selected 2D lines from a larger 3D seismic survey (CVX1101, Figure 2) across the Vøring Marginal High (VMH), offshore Norway, were interpreted to compare the onshore study area from the Isle of Skye with a base-basalt sequence from offshore within the NAIP. Additional detailed interpretations of the CVX1101 3D cube are presented by Planke et al. (2017). The Vøring\nBasin was formed during an extensional tectonic regime in the Middle JurassicEarly Cretaceous (Bjørnseth et al., 1997). Major volcanic activity associated with the NAIP occurred during the Cenozoic resulting in the emplacement of extensive basalt-dominated sequences. However, the age of volcanic rocks within Vøring Basin are thought to be younger, e.g., approximately 56 Ma (Svensen et al., 2010), than those from the Isle of Skye, approximately 62 Ma (Hamilton et al., 1998). Key seismic lines were selected from the VMH, in an area where the lava cover is thin and comprises a sequence of dominantly mid-oceanic ridge basalt-type lavas as identified from Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Leg 104 Hole 642E (Viereck et al., 1989; Abdelmalak et al., 2016), and termed Landward Flows as a seismic facies (e.g., Planke et al., 2000). The lava sequence predominantly overlies subaqueous, prograding hyaloclastites in places where the volcanism erupted down the escarpment into standing water. The study sections were chosen because they show clear evidence for the base-basalt transition along with evidence for intrusions beneath the lava cover, and because the resolution from the 3D seismic study allows a good imaging of this base-basalt transition (see Planke et al., 2017).\nData and methods Fieldwork\nAs part of this study, detailed field mapping and logging were undertaken within the field areas on the Isle of Skye.

Intrusions were identified based on the presence of chilled upper and lower margins, stratigraphy transgression/cross-cutting relations, and emplacement features, such as broken bridges (e.g., Schofield et al., 2012, 2016)."

These measurements were performed to image the petrophysical responses of the base-basalt transition in the study area. The P-wave velocity was measured using an industry-standard desktop JSR ultrasonic pulser/receiver and an oscillator recorder. The setting of the receiver used a 35 MHz signal, with low- and high-pass filters of 3.00 and 0.0 MHz, respectively. The pulser\nwas set up under 900 V and 100 Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF) with energy pulse of 81.0 mJ. The porosity measurement method used the bulk volume of each core plug, which was calculated from the average of 10 repeated high-precision caliper measurements of length and diameter sufficient to calculate the grain volume and porosity (e.g., Farrell et al., 2014). Combining the porosity, bulk volume, and weight of the sample (scale precision to 0.01 g), the bulk density and grain density were calculated."

The data were acquired and processed by CGG Veritas. Acquisition was done using two 4980 in3 flip-flop air-gun sources, with a 25 m shot point interval and recorded on twelve 8 km streamers with 100 m streamer separation. Processing was completed in 2013, and time and depth cubes were available for this study. The cube covers 2500 km2, with a 25 × 12.5 m inline and crossline bin size. The data were released after the license was relinquished in 2015.\nThe extrusive rocks were interpreted by seismic volcano-stratigraphic analysis (Planke et al., 2000; Berndt et al., 2001). The subaerial sequences (Land-\nward Flows) are characterized by high-amplitude parallel continuous reflections, whereas the subaqueous lava delta facies sequences are characterized by mediumlow amplitude reflection with well-imaged delta foresets (e.g., Jerram et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2012). The inner flows facies domain are characterized by more chaotic mixed high- to low-amplitude reflectors indicative of the dynamic, partly intruded nature of the prodelta deposits (e.g., Planke et al., 2000).\nThe intrusive igneous units and associated HVCs were interpreted based on the approach of Planke et al. (2015). The intrusive bodies in the seismic reflection data are displayed by high amplitudes and typical “saucer-shaped” morphologies. It is important to note that the amplitudes of the intrusive facies are the brightest reflectors within the subbasalt domain; however, the peak amplitudes of intrusive facies that occur beneath the extrusive volcanic sequence are clearly reduced, due to energy loss through the volcanics, compared with similar scale intrusions not covered by extrusive volcanics. The associated HVCs are characterized by\nTable 1.

    "heading": "Base-basalt transition",
    "text": "The base-basalt transition at Neist Point is characterized by an apparently sharp unconformable transition from Jurassic sedimentary rock into a >200 m thickness of subaerial flood basalts (Figure 3b). The absence of hyaloclatites at the Neist Point transition suggests a subaerial environment at the onset of flood volcanism at this location, although a short interval of nonexposure (approximately 10 m) means that the presence of minor water interaction cannot be entirely excluded. The lava sequence is composed of interbedded compound braided and tabular classic flow facies indicative of low- and high-bulk-volume lava eruptions, respectively (e.g., Jerram, 2002; Single and Jerram, 2004).\nThe main phase of flood volcanism is marked by an upper tabular lava flow sequence comprising several stacked individual lava flows (>10 m in thickness, Figure 3b). Hiatuses between lava eruptions are inferred by the preservation of approximately 1–1.5 m thick, reddened paleosols. Evidence for prolonged intereruption hiatuses (e.g., Jolley et al., 2012) within the main tabular sequence is also recognized from the presence of deep erosional channels cut down (approximately 20 m) into the underlying flows, which have subsequently been filled by ponding of later lavas and require enough time to develop erosional drainage systems on the lava surface (e.g., Schofield and Jolley, 2013; Ebinghaus et al., 2014). The lava pile at Neist Point therefore presents a complex and typically heterogeneous lava sequence (Figure 3b), which would cause significant scattering and attenuation of seismic energy, and therefore create imaging challenges in the subsurface (e.g., Gallagher and Dromgoole, 2007; Davison et al., 2010).\nThe lava sequence at Camas Ban comprises a roughly similar range and heterogeneity to that observed at Neist Point with one key difference: The lower >30 m of the volcanic succession comprises mixed hyaloclastite facies emplaced into standing water (Figure 5b). Outcrops of weakly bedded to massive hyaloclastite facies (Figure 5c and 5d) are replaced upward by lavas with evidence for downslope migration of large lava lobes (lobes steeply inclined relative to the dip of the overlying lava sequence), a feature typical of high effusion\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\n03 /1\n6/ 18\nto 1\n29 .2\n40 .1\n28 .1\n48 .

The physical properties of the hyaloclastites are distinctly different from the lavas (Figure 3), with the hyaloclastites displaying much lower and more consistent Pwave velocities ranging from 1.97 to 3.18 km∕s, consistent with other studies from the NAIP (e.g., Nelson et al., 2009). The base-basalt transitions at Neist Point and Camas Ban are, therefore, demonstrated to be distinctly different in terms of their volcanic facies, but also in terms of their velocity structures as a consequence of the presence or lack of water during the onset of volcanism at each location. This simple observation, backed by new petrophysical results from laterally equivalent outcrops (similar age, burial etc.) in the same province, provides a firm basis for future characterization of heterogeneities in physical properties at the basalt-sediment transition. This has important implications for the way in which we attempt to interpret the base-basalt transition from remote seismic data because, as our data demonstrate, the transition may be distinctly different in terms of velocity and density depending on the volcanic facies, which should be taken into account when interpreting seismic data. Studies of other base-basalt transition sections in LIPs increasingly highlight that hyaloclastites can commonly be found (e.g., Pedersen et al., 1998; Jerram et al., 2016a, 2016b), and their occurrence and distribution is being recognised and mapped in offshore sections (Jerram et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2012; Abdelmalak et al., 2016)."

    "text": "A variety of intrusive morphologies are observed at Neist Point ranging from thin discordant sheets cutting the entire exposure to sill intrusions, which are a few cm to tens of meters thick (Figure 6). Complexity ranges from simple sheet intrusions to interconnected, stacked sill complexes. Sill intrusions, although not absent from the lava pile, primarily occur within the underlying Jurassic sedimentary rocks, and, in places, they comprise more than 50% of the rock volume within the upper few tens of meters of the subbasalt stratigraphy. Features preserved within the dolerite intrusions below the base-basalt transition include intrusion steps and broken bridge structures (Figures 4 and 6; e.g., Thomson and Hutton, 2004; Hutton, 2009; Schofield et al., 2012, 2016).\nThe emplacement of sill intrusions may deform or jack up surrounding sedimentary rocks forming forced folds, which have been clearly defined from field observation (e.g., Pollard and John-\nson, 1973) and imaged in seismic data (e.g., Hansen and Cartwrigth, 2006; Jackson et al., 2013; Magee et al., 2013). Evidence for forced folding at Neist Point is clearly recorded within the Jurassic strata surrounding the sill tip, where the sill abruptly thins from a thickness of > 30 m and dips beneath sea level (Figure 4b). The overlying sedimentary layers clearly follow the upper margin of the sill tip, which is inclined (approximately 20° dipping to the northwest) in comparison with the subparallel bedding within the Jurassic sedimentary rocks beyond the tip of the sill. This clearly indicates that they were displaced upward to accommodate the sill volume as opposed to being replaced or folded prior to intrusion. Numerous small inclined intrusive sheets emanate from the sill tip and cut through the sedimentary rocks folded around the sill tip (Figure 4d; e.g., Thomson and Schofield, 2008; Magee et al., 2016). The presence of chilled contacts between some of these sheets and the larger sill body suggests that additional magma charges occurred, subsequent to the main inflation stage of the large sill occurred (Figure 4d).\nFigure 4.

Above the sill tip, a chaotic vent breccia (see Figure 7) is observed cutting through the lava pile. An irregular dike was subsequently fed up through the weakness caused by the vent pipe breccia, potentially linked to renewed injection of magma from the same system that fed the larger initial sill. (c) Isolated sediment rafts are observed within the core of the large sill intrusion.

In the Neist Point section, we observe the first example to our knowledge of this setting, where the intrusion and an associated vent are observed cutting through the overlying basalt sequence (Figure 4b).

The apparent offset in Figure 4b is therefore simply an artifact of the position at which the photograph can be taken from, e.g., the lighthouse peninsula at Neist Point. Our interpretation (informed by numerous seismic examples), and without contrary evidence, is that the sill continues inland beneath the lava pile as a simple sheet intrusion, which would place the sill margin directly below the base of the vent structure <100 m below the current vent exposure.\nThe vent structure (Figure 7a) is composed of subangular to subrounded clasts of the host rock (basalt lava) ranging from a few tens of cm up to approximately 2 m in diameter, with oxidized brecciated volcanic material as the matrix (Figure 7b). At least some of the rounding of the basalt clasts appears to be the result of pervasive postemplacement alteration, evidenced by the deeply altered rims of many of the clasts (Figure 7c). The presence of large amygdales and vesicle layers within clasts, which display no spatial association to the geometry of the clasts (e.g., no concentric arrangements), precludes a primary origin of the clasts (e.g., pillows). The breccia is very chaotic and poorly sorted with no evidence for internal structuring. The irregular contacts between the breccia and the host lava flows differ significantly from the smooth erosional channel features identified elsewhere in the sequence (Figure 7a), which, along with the lack of any internal bedding features, argues against an erosion and infill origin for the breccia.\nThe 2D surface exposure of this vent and the fact that the breccia pipe conduit is preserved prevents comment on its 3D geometry as well as its crater type (e.g., circular; narrow features or dome, crater, and eye-type of Planke et al., 2005). The exposed width of the vent conduit is approximately 20 m in diameter. Within the central part of the\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\n03 /1\n6/ 18\nto 1\n29 .2\n40 .1\n28 .1\n48 .

It is unclear, without the addition of chemical analysis, whether the dike has the same composition as the underlying sill intrusion. There is evidence for at least two magma pulses associated with the intrusion tip (Schofield et al., 2015), and therefore it is possible that after the initial intrusion, incubation, and vent formation, a second pulse of magma along the same pathway intruded up the newly developed area of weakness formed by the vent.\nPetrophysical variations of the base-basalt transition: Isle of Skye\nCoherent and dense rock samples (lavas and intrusions) display the highest values of P-wave velocity and density (5.8–4.3 km∕s and 2.69–2.89 g∕cm3), and the lowest values of porosity (0.02%–2.79%) within the data set due to their tightly bound interlocking crystals. The P-wave velocities for hyaloclastites sampled at Camas Ban range from 1.9 to 3.6 km∕s, with porosities from 2.0% to 26% and density ranging from 2.27 to 2.47 g∕cm3. Petrophysical properties of sedimentary rocks at Neist Point (e.g., sandstone and limestone) were also sampled at varying distances from intrusions. The P-wave velocities for sandstone at 30 cm from contact range from 2.4 to 3.3 km∕s with porosity values of 6.2%–12%, whereas sandstones at the contact show 2.15–2.75 km∕s and 16.5%–26.2%, respectively. Moreover, the limestones sampled at the intrusion contact present low values of porosity (0.9%–2.0%) and high values of P-wave velocities (5.0–5.2 km∕s) similar to the dolerite samples. A broad relationship of increasing P-wave velocities and decreasing porosity of sediments toward the dolerite contact is seen (Figure 8a), which are indicative of the thermal aureole caused by contact metamorphism altering the velocity structure of intruded sediment host rocks.\nTo represent the distribution of volcanic facies identified on Skye in terms of geophysical responses (Figure 8b), pseudo wireline logs for P-wave velocity, porosity, and density were compiled for the Neist Point and Camas Ban sections (Figure 8c). The logs were constructed using the petrophysical measurements of volcanic rocks and sediments to give a representation of the variation that may be expected from wireline data through the separate sections. Detailed geologic observations, including the thickness of the flow structure in lava flows (core versus crust) and the distribution of basalt clasts in hyaloclastite facies, from the logged sections are used as a guideline to demonstrate the potential variations through the separate sequences. Wireline-log profiles through basalt flows (e.g., an asymmetrical bell shaped curve; Planke, 1994; Nelson et al., 2009) and those seen through hyaloclastites successions (e.g., Nelson et al., 2009; Watton et al., 2014) have also been incorporated to help conceptually populate the pseudologs away from the constrained measurements from this study (e.g., Single and Jerram, 2004)."

In the current study, identified facies include (1) Landward Flows, (2) Lava Delta, and (3) Inner Flows (e.g., Planke and Alvestad, 1999; Planke et al., 2000; Abdelmalak et al., 2016). Detailed mapping of the basalt sequences in the CVX1101 3D cube (Planke et al., 2017) allows the location of lines where the volcanic cover is thin, and therefore the subbasalt image resolution is best. The preserved Landward Flow thicknesses are around 500 m or less in the two example seismic lines chosen (Figures 9 and 10). In Figure 9, a prograding Lava Delta sequence is clearly imaged displaying a subaqueous to subaerial passage zone similar to those seen in other parts of the NAIP (e.g., Pedersen et al., 1998; Watton et al., 2013; Millett et al., 2015).

The amplitude of the forced-fold structure appears to diminish upward into the volcanic sequence from approximately 100 m at the base-basalt level down to approximately 0 m at the hyaloclastite to lava transition, an interval of approximately 500 m. It therefore appears to represent a shallow intrusion, emplaced prior to or during the overlying lava delta development, potentially also promoting differential compaction during rapid emplacement of the high-density volcanic overburden.\nIn Figure 10, a large high-amplitude saucer-shaped intrusion (Sørenssen et al., 2004; Planke et al., 2005) is clearly observed beneath the base of the high-amplitude flat-lying Landward Flows. Vertical zones of disrupted reflectors are observed emanating from the tip of the high-amplitude sill reflectors and cutting up through the volcanic pile. The pipe-like features show no offset of the host stratigraphy (e.g., sedimentary rocks and Landward Flows) and, thus, they do not appear to be associated with faults. We interpret these features as HVCs with a maximum vertical extent of approximately 1.3 km above the sill tip termination and a width of less than approximately 450 m. A clear crater-type morphology is not observed, but the overlying lava strata are clearly domed above the underlying disrupted strata (e.g., Planke et al., 2005)."

    "heading": "Discussion",
    "text": "Variability of the base-basalt transition within the NAIP\nThe onset of volcanism at the base-basalt transition may in simple terms occur either onto land (subaerial)\nor into water (subaqueous). Neist Point on the Isle of Skye displays a subaerial example, where the initial volcanism produced compound (low volume) and tabular (high volume) lava flow facies, occasionally interdigitated with reddened paleosols (e.g., Jolley et al., 2012). In other areas, such as at Camas Ban, subaqueous conditions were initially present, suggestive of a variable topography on Skye at the time. The pseudo wireline logs generated from the onshore Skye examples clearly demonstrate the large difference in velocity contrast between a subaqueous compared with subaerial eruptive transition. However, the presence of intrusions into the subbasalt sediments significantly complicates the wireline profiles and may significantly reduce the sharpness of the transition at the resolution of common seismic reflection surveys. The identification of characteristic intrusive signatures (e.g., Planke et al., 2005, 2015) at the basalt-sediment transition will therefore be important for a appraising the nature and the location of the basalt-sediment transition on seismic data.\nIn the offshore domain, hyaloclastites can often be found indicating that eruption into water at the onset of flood volcanism was widespread across the NAIP margins (Jerram et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2012; Abdelmalak et al., 2016). The studied examples from the offshore Vøring Basin clearly display subaerial and subaqueous base-basalt transitions relating to the topographic variations across the VMH (Abdelmalak et al., 2016). Similar to the onshore examples from this study, intrusions are clearly identified in close association to the interpreted basalt-sediment transition, especially in the Inner Flows domain. Our study forms an initial step toward better characterization and understanding of varia-\ntions in the volcanic facies and physical properties of the base-basalt transition in different settings. Future integrations of detailed onshore examples are critical steps for improving the imaging, identification, and characterization of the basebasalt transition in offshore sequences, especially where a thick basalt cover exists (e.g., Millett et al., 2015).\nMagma emplacement and host rock deformation\nExtensive dolerite intrusions were emplaced into the sedimentary sequences beneath the extrusive volcanic sequences in the onshore and offshore study areas. In both cases, examples of the host sediments being deformed upward to accommodate the intrusions and forming “forced-fold” structures have been identified (Figures 4c and 11b). A range of morphologies within the onshore Neist Point sheet intrusions are identified, including sediment bridges, broken bridges, intrusion steps, and sediment rafts (e.g., Schofield et al., 2016), which\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\n03 /1\n6/ 18\nto 1\n29 .2\n40 .1\n28 .1\n48 .

In the Vøring Basin examples, the sills are generally dominated by saucer-shaped morphologies (Planke et al., 2005; Polteau et al., 2008); however, many of the intricate emplacement features identified from onshore would be below seismic resolution (e.g., Schofield et al., 2015; Eide et al., 2016).\nHydrothermal vent formation process A key focus of this study has been the identification of hydrothermal vent structures emanating from the tips of large dolerite intrusions and cutting up through the preexisting erupted volcanic sequence (Figure 11). These intrusions were emplaced as magma into Jurassic host sediments at Neist Point and into sediments of unknown age on the VMH at temperatures in the range of approximately 1000°C–1200°C (e.g., Hole and Millett, 2016). The heat input associated with the emplacement of large volumes of magma into sill complexes can lead to metamorphic reactions around the sills and to conductive and convective heat transfer (e.g., Aarnes et al., 2015). In the case of the high-TOC Jurassic Lealt shales (Vincent and Tyson, 1999) equivalent to those present at Neist Point, the emplacement of large dolerite intrusions may have caused the production of large volumes of methane (CH4) and potentially subordinate volumes of CO2 and H2O from less\ndominant calcareous lithologies (Aarnes et al., 2011; Svensen et al., 2015). If the volume of generated fluids was large and the host-rock permeability was low (e.g., shale) and/or capped (e.g., by a lava pile with very low vertical permeability), significant overpressure would have built up in association with the metamorphic aureole of the larger intrusions (Aarnes et al., 2011; Iyer et al., 2013). If the buildup of pressure is great enough to exceed the overburden pressure above intrusions, catastrophic overburden failure and the development of HVCs can occur (Figure 11c; Planke et al., 2005; Aarnes et al., 2011, 2012). This process is envisaged to have occurred above the large dolerite intrusion within the Neist Point area, with pore-water boiling (see Jamtveit et al., 2004) and magma degassing potentially contributing to the generation of overpressure.\nHydrothermal vents are observed in association with sill intrusions in many localities around the world from field and seismic examples (e.g., Jamtveit et al., 2004; Svensen et al., 2004, 2006). The field examples recorded within this study, however, comprise, to our knowledge, the first documented occurrences of hydrothermal vents, closely linked to the intrusions responsible for their formation, breaching an overlying volcanic sequence. Given the challenges associated with imaging features and structures beneath the volcanic cover from offshore (Thompson [2007] provides some examples),\nSK94 Interpretation / August 2017\nD ow\nnl oa\nde d\n03 /1\n6/ 18\nto 1\n29 .2\n40 .1\n28 .1\n48 .

    "heading": "Implications for the PETM",
    "text": "It has been hypothesized that the gas release (CH4 and CO2) from intrusion-related venting along the Northeast Atlantic conjugate margins significantly contributed to the global warming associated with the Palaeocene Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) (e.g., Svensen et al., 2004; Arnes et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2016). This hypothesis was based on the imaging and analysis of intrusions, host rocks, and associated hydrothermal vents within the Vøring and Møre Basins, offshore Norway (Svensen et al., 2004). The areas mapped within this study were largely free from extrusive volcanics, partly due to poor imaging, and partly due to significantly fewer available seismic data from the volcanic covered areas. A key implication of the identification of hydrothermal venting beneath the volcanic covered areas of the NAIP is the potential role that these potentially large numbers of unidentified vents and their associated outgassing may have had on the PETM. Additional study into the vast offshore areas covered by volcanics within the NAIP and other LIPs coupled with new and improved seismic data coverage may therefore significantly influence our understanding of the links between large-scale volcanic episodes and the global climate. In addition, this onshore evidence may also have implications for petroleum exploration within these same regions. If large volumes of methane (>1150 Gt) were potentially produced by extensive intrusions into organic-rich sediments (e.g., Aarnes et al., 2015), beneath these offshore lava piles, then the potential for unconventional petroleum systems similar to those found within the Neuquén Basin, Argentina (Wiite et al., 2012), may be operational and exploitable in the future. The formation of focused breccia pathways cutting through what are generally regarded to be vertically very low permeability lava sequences (e.g., Millett et al., 2015), also has implications for hydrocarbon migration and the potential feeding of supra or intrabasalt prospects."

We compare this field example with offshore seismic examples from the Vøring Basin, Norway.

Developments in seismic data acquisition and improved subbasalt image processing are ongoing with incremental but tangible improvements. We therefore predict that with improving seismic data, a larger number and wider distribution of intrusion-induced HVCs will start to be identified within the subbasalt domain going forward with associated implications for climatic and petroleum systems.\nIn relation to the basalt-sediment transition, we also present new petrophysical data targeted at constraining the petrophysical variations that exist at the transition associated with variations in the style of volcanism and environment present at the onset of volcanism. The results from this study already clearly demonstrate the wide variations in these properties between dry and subaqueous settings, in turn highlighting that these transitions will look distinctly different in seismic data.

    "text": "In this study, we have presented new field, laboratory petrophysical, and seismic-based analysis of the complex interaction between dolerite intrusions and host sediments within the NAIP, with a focus on the basalt-sediment transition. From our investigations, we can draw the following conclusions:\n• The volcanic facies structure and associated physical properties of the base-basalt transition are widely different depending on the availability of water at the onset of LIP volcanism. • Due to the wide-scale velocity heterogeneity found within lava piles and their scattering effects on seismic waves, the identification of intrusions and associated vent structures beneath and within lava piles in the subsurface is significantly more challenging than in conventional sedimentary basin settings. • In this study, we have presented details on HVCs associated with the emplacement of large dolerite sills cutting through the extensive lava sequences of the NAIP from onshore and offshore settings. This provides the first documented example of venting through the lava sequences, and provides valuable information about the relative timing of volcanic events on Skye. • The onshore example from Neist Point on the Isle of Skye gives an exceptional example of the characteristics and structures from such vent breccias, and it will enable improved understanding of potential subsurface examples going forward. • Given the presented evidence for venting originating beneath the lava piles of the NAIP along with the known imaging problems associatedwith these settings, it is entirely possible that a far greater number of these features exist in the subsurface than have previously been appreciated. • The case for intrusion-related hydrothermal venting processes, such as methane outgassing on climate, e.g., the PETM and other global events, may be significantly strengthened by the future consideration of these huge unquantified areas. • Finally, the effects of intrusions and associated hydrothermal venting on source-rock maturation, methane generation, compartmentalization, and migration pathways within the subbasalt petroleum systems context may also be significant."

  "abstractText": "The emplacement of large intrusive complexes into sedimentary basins can have profound effects on host sedimentary rocks including deformation, thermal aureole metamorphic reactions, alteration of fluid-flow pathways, and the formation of associated hydrothermal vent complexes (HVCs). These processes can in turn have major implications for petroleum systems on the local and regional scale, and can contribute to global climate change due to the production and outgassing of greenhouse gases, such as CH4 and CO2. Imaging these features and assessing their implications from seismic data beneath extrusive volcanic cover is challenging due to heterogeneities in the volcanic pile and at the basalt-sediment transition. We have evaluated combined field and laboratory petrophysical data from the Isle of Skye, Scotland, where we identify a seismic-scale example of extensive intrusions interacting with the base-basalt transition. We have also evaluated a unique onshore example of a linked sill and associated HVC cutting up through the lava sequence. We compare these field results with HVCs from reflection seismic data across the Vøring Marginal High, offshore Norway, where subbasalt saucer-shaped intrusions are also seen associated with HVCs cutting the lava sequence. Seismic imaging problems associated with the velocity heterogeneity of volcanic sequences, along with a historical lack of highquality 3D data in volcanic regions worldwide, is suggested as having largely precluded the identification of these features in the past. The under-representation of these hydrothermal vents in the literature has key implications for the future appraisal of intrusion-related outgassing effects on the global climate such as those related to the Palaeocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, along with subbasalt petroleum prospectivity where they may alter maturation and migration pathways. Introduction The emplacement of large volumes of predominantly mafic intrusions during the development of large igneous provinces (LIPs) (e.g., Jerram and Bryan, 2015), has many implications for understanding contemporaneous global climate change (e.g., Svensen et al., 2004, 2007; Ganino and Arndt, 2009) and petroleum exploration (e.g., Schutter, 2003; Delpino et al., 2009; Jerram, 2015). Large-scale intrusive complexes on continental margins can have global climatic implications related to the formation and outgassing of greenhouse gases, such as CH4 and CO2, into the oceans and atmosphere through hydrothermal vent complexes (HVCs) (e.g., Svensen et al., 2004, 2015; Aarnes et al., 2015). In addition, igneous intrusions may influence the maturation of source rocks and the production of hydrocarbons (Svensen et al., 2004; Aarnes et al., 2010, 2015; Witte et al., 2012; Iyer et al., 2013) along with the modification of migration pathways by compartmentalization and emplacement associated fracturing (Filho et al., 2008; Rateau et al., 2013). Moreover, intrusions may also form hydrocarbon traps, including forced folding (Schutter, 2003; Jackson et al., 2013) and may host intraintrusion hydrocarbon reservoirs (Witte et al., 2012; Barr and Cooper, 2013).

There are increasing amounts of seismic data becoming available from volcanic margins that image volcanic stratigraphy and associated intrusions (e.g., Jerram et al., 2009; Planke et al., 2015). In the subsurface, large intrusions may often be easily imaged as the highest amplitude reflectors in a sedimentary package (e.g., Planke et al., 2005); however, imaging sills may become more challenging at greater depths, with poor-quality data and where the sill thickness reduces (e.g., Smallwood and Maresh, 2002; Schofield et al., 2015). In the case of extrusive volcanic sequences, their highly heterogeneous velocity structure can cause extensive scattering of seismic waves, and it is therefore notoriously difficult to image volcanic rocks along with the stratigraphy and structures present beneath the basalt cover (Gallagher and Dromgoole, 2007; Davison et al., 2010). In this context, the presence, significance, and implications of intrusions and associated HVCs (e.g., Svensen et al., 2004) within the basalt-covered basinal regions of volcanic rifted margins are to date poorly constrained. The identification of HVCs associated with intrusions is of particular importance because they provide direct evidence for the creation of migration pathways and the passage of potential greenhouse gases to the atmosphere (Svensen et al., 2004). An associated challenge in basins with volcanic cover is the identification and interpretation of the basalt-sediment transition (Davison et al., 2010). Where variations in the eruption environment at the onset of volcanism occur, the physical properties of the volcanic facies, as well as the facies distribution, can vary markedly (e.g., Nelson et al., 2009; Watton et al., 2014; Jerram et al., 2016a, 2016b). Understanding the likely heterogeneities in volcanic facies and the associated physical properties at the basalt-sediment transition is therefore important for identifying the transition in seismic data and, by implication, interpreting subbasalt features such as intrusions and associated HVCs. Within this study, we investigate key fieldand seismic-based examples of intrusions and associated HVC features emplaced in close proximity to the base-basalt transition from onshore (Isle of Skye, Scotland) and offshore (Vøring Basin, Norwegian Margin). We present field-based examples of intrusion-induced forced folding, a process whereby magma emplacement locally uplifts overburden strata (e.g., Pollard and Jonhson, 1973; Trude et al., 2004; Hansen and Cartwright, 2006; Jackson et al., 2013) along with evidence for onshore and offshore occurrences of sills linked to HVCs cutting through lava sequences in the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP). Additionally, we present new petrophysical data profiles across the base-basalt transition in different onshore settings to help quantify the observed heterogeneities. We aim at improving characterization and integration of onshore examples with offshore remote sensing data to highlight the importance of intrusionrelated influences on petroleum systems and climatic forcing within basalt-covered basinal areas worldwide. Study areas North Atlantic igneous province Continental break-up in the North Atlantic region between northwest Europe and East Greenland during the Palaeogene was accompanied by widespread volcanism associated with NAIP (e.g., Saunders et al., 1997; Hansen et al., 2009). Extensive lava fields, hydrovolcanic sequences, and subsurface intrusive complexes were emplaced on either side of the developing continental rift zone from the Late Paleocene to the Early Eocene followed by seafloor spreading. Widespread voluminous volcanism in the region is widely attributed to excess mantle temperatures (Hole and Millett, 2016) associated with a proto-Iceland thermal anomaly (often termed the “Iceland plume”), which initiated the first main phase of volcanism at the peripheries of the NAIP province (e.g., Scottish Hebrides and West Greenland) from approximately 62 Ma (Hole et al., 2015). The main phase of volcanic activity was focused along the protorift zone from approximately 57–55 Ma accompanying continental break-up from approximately 55 Ma onward (Saunders et al., 1997; Jerram and Widdowson, 2005). Onshore: Isle of Skye, Scotland The volcanic rocks exposed on the Isle of Skye form part of the British Palaeogene Igneous Province, part of the larger NAIP (Saunders et al., 1997). The Isle of Skye comprises rock units ranging in age from Precambrian to the Quaternary and is situated between two major structural lineaments of the Outer Minch Fault and the Moine Thrust (Emeuleus and Bell, 2005; Figure 1). Sedimentary accumulations on the Isle of Skye were deposited during several rifting episodes prior to the onset of volcanism during the Paleocene (England et al., 1993). Precambrian Lewisian basement outcrops on the Sleat Peninsula and are thought to underlie most of the area. Torridonian (Precambrian) sediments unconformably overly the basement rocks, which are in turn unconformably overlain by Cambro-Ordovician shelf deposits that outcrop on the foreland of the Caledonian orogeny andwithin theMoine Thrust belt (Trewin, 2002). Prolonged collapse of the Caledonian orogenic belt from the late Devonian through to the Carboniferous allowed for basin development and infilling of Permo-Triassic through to Late Cretaceous sediments within the Sea of the Hebrides (Stein, 1988). The sediments were deposited in a series of west-dipping half grabens controlled by the southwest–northeast-trending Minch and Camasunary Faults (Figure 1). The onset of volcanism on the Isle of Skye began at approximately 62 Ma (Hamilton et al., 1998) comprising the eruption of lavas and hyaloclastites, as well as the emplacement of sheet intrusions (sills and dikes), followed a few million years later by the emplacement of large-scale intrusive complexes, such as the Black SK84 Interpretation / August 2017 D ow nl oa de d 03 /1 6/ 18 to 1 29 .2 40 .1 28 .1 48 .

For this study, cliff exposures of the base-basalt transition at Neist Point in the far northwest and Camas Ban in the Isle of Skye have been investigated. At Neist Point, basalt lavas forming part of the Skye Main Lava Series were unconformably erupted onto a surface comprising mixed Jurassic sediments Figure 1. Map showing the regional setting of the Isle of Skye. The lava sequences extend offshore to the southeast, and the sill complex facies are widely distribute offshore. The subaerial base basalt at Neist Point is located in the northwest of Skye, and the Camas Ban hyaloclastites succession is located on the east coast. The stratigraphic section comprises Middle Jurassic sedimentary rocks of the Lealt Shale Formation. Cretaceous rocks are not present within the Neist Point and Camas Ban sections because of uplift and erosion within the study area.

The contact is obscured by approximately 10 m of dead ground at Neist Point, but the first exposed eruptive deposits comprise subaerial sheet lavas. The sedimentary rocks below the subaerial lavas are dominated by Middle Jurassic shallow marine siliciclastic sediments (Searl, 1994; Morton, 1999; Hesselbo and Coe, 2000) and estuarine strata with many coarse-grained facies, crossbedding sedimentary structures, and nonmarine shales (Morton, 1983; Harris, 1989). The subbasalt sediments have locally been extensively intruded by dolerite sheet intrusions. At Camas Ban, on the east coast of Skye, the basal contact between the Middle Jurassic Bearreraig Sandstone Formation and the Skye Main Lava Series is obscured by a dolerite sill. In contrast to Neist Point, the oldest exposed volcanic succession comprises hyaloclastite breccias, sands, and silts, which are overlain by tabular sheet flows, representing the passage zone to subaqueous emplaced volcanics (Skilling, 2002). Therefore, at Camas Ban, subaqueous conditions prevailed at the onset of volcanism promoting the development of a lava delta. Offshore: Vøring Basin, Norwegian Margin Selected 2D lines from a larger 3D seismic survey (CVX1101, Figure 2) across the Vøring Marginal High (VMH), offshore Norway, were interpreted to compare the onshore study area from the Isle of Skye with a base-basalt sequence from offshore within the NAIP. Additional detailed interpretations of the CVX1101 3D cube are presented by Planke et al. (2017). The Vøring Basin was formed during an extensional tectonic regime in the Middle JurassicEarly Cretaceous (Bjørnseth et al., 1997). Major volcanic activity associated with the NAIP occurred during the Cenozoic resulting in the emplacement of extensive basalt-dominated sequences. However, the age of volcanic rocks within Vøring Basin are thought to be younger, e.g., approximately 56 Ma (Svensen et al., 2010), than those from the Isle of Skye, approximately 62 Ma (Hamilton et al., 1998). Key seismic lines were selected from the VMH, in an area where the lava cover is thin and comprises a sequence of dominantly mid-oceanic ridge basalt-type lavas as identified from Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Leg 104 Hole 642E (Viereck et al., 1989; Abdelmalak et al., 2016), and termed Landward Flows as a seismic facies (e.g., Planke et al., 2000). The lava sequence predominantly overlies subaqueous, prograding hyaloclastites in places where the volcanism erupted down the escarpment into standing water. The study sections were chosen because they show clear evidence for the base-basalt transition along with evidence for intrusions beneath the lava cover, and because the resolution from the 3D seismic study allows a good imaging of this base-basalt transition (see Planke et al., 2017). Data and methods Fieldwork As part of this study, detailed field mapping and logging were undertaken within the field areas on the Isle of Skye. Lithological transects recording the volcanic facies and their dimensions were undertaken at Neist Point and Camas Ban (Figure 1). Focus was given to volFigure 2.

Intrusions were identified based on the presence of chilled upper and lower margins, stratigraphy transgression/cross-cutting relations, and emplacement features, such as broken bridges (e.g., Schofield et al., 2012, 2016). Petrophysical properties Petrophysical measurements including P-wave velocity and porosity were performed on a total of 26 dry core plugs at the University of Aberdeen (Table 1), collected from samples within the field study areas at Neist Point and Camas Ban on the Isle of Skye. These measurements were performed to image the petrophysical responses of the base-basalt transition in the study area. The P-wave velocity was measured using an industry-standard desktop JSR ultrasonic pulser/receiver and an oscillator recorder. The setting of the receiver used a 35 MHz signal, with lowand high-pass filters of 3.00 and 0.0 MHz, respectively. The pulser was set up under 900 V and 100 Hz pulse repetition frequency (PRF) with energy pulse of 81.0 mJ. The porosity measurement method used the bulk volume of each core plug, which was calculated from the average of 10 repeated high-precision caliper measurements of length and diameter sufficient to calculate the grain volume and porosity (e.g., Farrell et al., 2014). Combining the porosity, bulk volume, and weight of the sample (scale precision to 0.01 g), the bulk density and grain density were calculated. Seismic volcano-stratigraphy mapping The main data available for this study are the 3D seismic cube CVX1101 acquired in exploration license PL527 for Chevron (Figure 2; see also Planke et al., 2017). The data were acquired and processed by CGG Veritas. Acquisition was done using two 4980 in flip-flop air-gun sources, with a 25 m shot point interval and recorded on twelve 8 km streamers with 100 m streamer separation. Processing was completed in 2013, and time and depth cubes were available for this study. The cube covers 2500 km2, with a 25 × 12.5 m inline and crossline bin size. The data were released after the license was relinquished in 2015. The extrusive rocks were interpreted by seismic volcano-stratigraphic analysis (Planke et al., 2000; Berndt et al., 2001). The subaerial sequences (Landward Flows) are characterized by high-amplitude parallel continuous reflections, whereas the subaqueous lava delta facies sequences are characterized by mediumlow amplitude reflection with well-imaged delta foresets (e.g., Jerram et al., 2009; Wright et al., 2012). The inner flows facies domain are characterized by more chaotic mixed highto low-amplitude reflectors indicative of the dynamic, partly intruded nature of the prodelta deposits (e.g., Planke et al., 2000). The intrusive igneous units and associated HVCs were interpreted based on the approach of Planke et al. (2015). The intrusive bodies in the seismic reflection data are displayed by high amplitudes and typical “saucer-shaped” morphologies. It is important to note that the amplitudes of the intrusive facies are the brightest reflectors within the subbasalt domain; however, the peak amplitudes of intrusive facies that occur beneath the extrusive volcanic sequence are clearly reduced, due to energy loss through the volcanics, compared with similar scale intrusions not covered by extrusive volcanics. The associated HVCs are characterized by Table 1.
