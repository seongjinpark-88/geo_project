A three-channel technique has been proposed by Prata et. al. [Prata, A.J., Rose, W.I., Self, S., O'Brien, D.M., 2003. Global, long-term sulphur dioxide measurements from TOVS data: a new tool for studying explosive volcanism and climate.

Oppenhaimer.], which considers the difference in brightness temperature (BT) in the SO2 absorption band around 7–8 µm between an observed value and an estimated value interpolated from two other channels. The technique relies on the assumption that the interpolated BT value is a good approximation of the BT that would have been observed in the absence of SO2. In this study we use a sophisticated radiative transfer model in order to test this assumption and assess the sensitivity of this three-channel technique to the vertical profiles of temperature and water vapour, the surface temperature, the vertical distribution of the SO2, the viewing geometry, the presence of ash, and the presence of low- and high-level clouds. The capabilities and limitations of such a technique are discussed. An example is also shown as a proof of concept using data from the SEVIRI instrument onboard the MSG satellite.\nCrown Copyright © 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Typically more than 50 volcanoes erupt each year (Andres and Kasgnoc, 1998). They exhibit different behaviours ranging from continuous to very explosive emissions. During an eruption, a volcano can emit large amount of aerosols and gases. The most prevalent gases emitted by volcanoes are water vapour, carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). The global volcanic flux of SO2 is estimated to be around 7.5–10.5 Tg/year (Pugnaghi et al., 2006). This corresponds to 10–15% of the annual anthropogenic sulphur emissions (Halmer et al., 2002). Sulphur dioxide can cause significant damage to the local environment and, if present in high concentrations, to human health. It can also perturb the climate and the atmosphere through the action of\nce.gov.uk\n008 Published by Elsevier B.V\nsulphate aerosols (Lacis et al., 1992). Ash emitted by volcanoes also creates hazardous conditions for passing aircraft and they will avoid flying in volcanic plumes. For these various reasons, and because there are some limitations to volcanic ash detection using IR satellite data, it is important to monitor volcanic gas emissions as well. Direct measurements of emitted volcanic gases is a dangerous task, therefore remote sensing is a useful complementary tool. A good summary of volcanic plume detection from satellite remote sensing is made in Rose et al. (2000).\nThe composition of a volcanic plume can vary in time during an eruption phase. Rose et al. (2000) argue that a volcanic plume may have significantly higher SO2 content on the second day of eruption as compared to the first day, suggesting that early volcanic emission of H2S may be converting to SO2. They also state that in many cases volcanic plumes separate into a higher SO2-rich and a lower ash-rich portion. The vertical separation of ash and SO2 was also observed by Prata and Kerkmann (2007) for the 2005\n. All rights reserved.\neruption of the Karthala volcano. The two plumes may then follow similar or different trajectories. It is therefore important from an aviation perspective to track not only the ash plume but also the SO2 plume. SO2 as such is generally not very harmful to aviation. However being a corrosive gas, it can be dangerous at high concentrations. It also has an unpleasant penetrative odour. As discussed above SO2 can also (but does not have to) be associated with an ash plume. It is the responsibility of the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAACs) to inform civil aviation authorities about the hazards to air traffic caused by volcanic plumes."

    "heading": "2. Detection of SO2 from space",
    "text": "Sulphurdioxide absorbs solar radiation in the ultraviolet and this is being used to retrieve the SO2 atmospheric content using instruments such as TOMS and OMI (Krueger et al., 1995; Eisinger and Burrows,1998; Thomas et al., 2005). Herewe focus instead on thermal infrared (IR) techniques. Sulphur dioxide has three absorption bands in the IR: a weak absorption band betweenwavenumbers 2200 and 2550 cm−1 (wavelength near 4 µm), a strong absorption band between wavenumbers 1330 and 1390 cm−1 (wavelength around 7.3 µm) and a weaker absorption band between wavenumbers 1160 and 1290 cm−1 (wavelength around 8.7 µm). Different techniques have been developed which make use of these absorption bands to detect volcanic SO2 plumes (Realmuto et al., 1994, 1997; Realmuto and Worden,2000; Prata et al., 2003;Watsonet al., 2004). The threechannel technique presented in Prata et al. (2003) relies on the fact that in the absence of SO2 there is an approximate linear dependence of the top-of-atmosphere radiance (expressed in units ofWm−2 sr−1 (cm−1)−1) onwavelength in the range of 6.7– 7.0 µm to 10–11 µm. The radiance in a channel roughly centred at awavelengthof 7.3µm(channel 2) canbeapproximated fromthe two radiances roughly centred at 6.7–7.0 µm (channel 1, R1) and 10–11 µm (channel 3, R3) according to the equation:\nR42 ¼ R1 þ R3−R1ð Þ λ2−λ1 λ3−λ1\nð1Þ\nwhere R1, R2⁎ and R3 are in W m−2 sr−1 (cm−1)−1 at the central wavelengths λ1, λ2, and λ3 as already mentioned above. The observed radiance, R2, and the estimated radiance in the absence of SO2, R2⁎, are then converted to brightness temperatures (BT) using the Planck function and their difference is used as a proxy for the SO2 column. A difference in brightness temperatures, BT2⁎−BT2, positive or larger than some threshold is taken to indicate the presence of SO2 in the atmospheric column. It is noteworthy that the radiances in Eq. (1) should be expressed inWm−2 sr−1 (cm−1)−1 rather thanWm−2 sr−1 µm−1 because the linearapproximationbetweenwavelengths 6.8 and 10.8 µm holds for a larger rangeof blackbody temperatures in the former case.\nThe objective of this study is to ground the three-channel method on a more robust footing. As far as we are aware the proposed methodology has not been supported by accurate radiative transfer calculations. A range of infrared radiometers have suitable channels to apply such an algorithm, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) onboard the TERRA and AQUA satellites (Barnes et al., 1998) and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard the Meteosat Second Generation\n(MSG) satellites (Schmetz et al., 2002). TheMODIS instrument has 36 spectral bands in the visible and infrared (from near to thermal) region of the spectrum (0.4–14.4 µm). Two of its band operate at a nominal spatial resolution of 250m at nadir, 5 bands at 500 m and the remaining band at 1000 m. Table 1 shows the MODIS channels available for volcanic SO2 detection. SEVIRI is particularly attractive in the context of the VAACs because monitoring requirements for civil aviation demand near-real-time observations with high-temporal sampling that only geostationary satellites can provide at the moment. We will therefore present a case study using SEVIRI data for the Montserrat eruption as an illustration of the method."

Some of our sensitivity experiments include the presence of a cloud (either low-level or high-level) or an ash plume (either below, at the level of or above the SO2 plume)."

    "heading": "3.1. Radiative transfer model",
    "text": "We use the LBLDOM model which combines the Discrete OrdinateMethod (DOM, (Stamnes et al., 1988)) with a line-byline (LBL) discretisation of the electromagnetic spectrum (Dubuisson et al., 2005). The model does a spectral integration with a resolution of about 0.0001 cm−1 in the longwave domain in order to simulate the radiance over various MODIS or SEVIRI channels. The atmosphere is assumed to be vertically inhomogeneous and stratified into plane-parallel layers (40 layers are used in this study). Gaseous absorption is computedwith the LBL code (Dubuisson et al., 1996) using the last version of the HITRAN spectroscopic database (Rothman et al., 2005). The shape and intensity of each absorption line is calculated as a function of the pressure and temperature using the HITRAN database together with Lorentz, Doppler or Voigt profiles. CO2 and H2O absorption continua are computed using the CKD-2.4 parameterization (Clough et al., 1989). Emitting and scattering processes, as well as their interactions with absorption, are calculated with the DOM. Clouds are defined with their spectral optical properties: optical thickness, single scattering albedo and 12 moments of the Legendre polynomial decomposition of the phase function with a δ-m truncation (Wiscombe, 1977). The radiances computed at the top of the atmosphere with LBLDOM are converted into BTs using conversion tables in order to simulate MODIS or SEVIRI measurements. These tables are established by computing the radiance that would be measured by MODIS or MSG spectral filters for blackbodies with temperatures ranging from 150 to 350 K with a step of\n1 K. A standard spline interpolation of these tables allows the BT to be computed that would be observed for any atmospheric conditions simulated by LBLDOM with an accuracy of a few hundredths of Kelvin.\n3.2. Atmospheric profiles of temperature and humidity\nWe consider twelve different atmospheric profiles of temperature and humidity which are represented in Fig. 1, extracted from the TIGR database (Chevallier et al., 1998). Profiles SUB1 to SUB4 are representative of sub-Arctic conditions, which are typical for Icelandic volcanoes under\nthe surveillance of the London VAAC. Profiles MID1 to MID4 and TRO1 to TRO4 are representative of mid-latitudes and tropical conditions, respectively. The precipitable water column ranges from about 0.1 gcm−2 in SUB1 and MID1 to 3.8 gcm−2 in TRO3. Some profiles (SUB1, SUB2, MID1, TRO1) exhibit a temperature inversion in the lower troposphere. The specific humidity (kg/kg) decreases with altitude but some profiles do not show a steady decrease throughout the atmosphere with humidity peaking at various altitudes. Water vapour is known to be very variable on the vertical. While our twelve profiles have been chosen to encompass a large variety of atmospheric conditions and seasons, they do\nto SUB4: sub-arctic conditions; MID1 to MID4: mid-latitudes conditions, and dy simulations.\nnot sample the fine-scale variability of humidity on the vertical. However the impact of such fine-scale variations on the retrieval is expected to be small because each of the MODIS and SEVIRI channels sounds a thick atmospheric layer.\n3.3. Atmospheric profiles of SO2\nIt appears that there is no observed data for the vertical profile of SO2 in the atmosphere in the case of volcanic eruptions. We therefore created three synthetic SO2 profiles, with SO2 peaking at different levels of the atmosphere and a constant atmospheric column of 150 DU—one Dobson Unit or milli-atm cm corresponds to a gas column of 10−3 cm at standard temperature and pressure. These three vertical profiles are shown on Fig. 2 in unit of ppmv. For comparison, the ambient non-volcanic SO2 atmospheric column in our model is 0.1 DU with a profile that decays fairly quickly with height. An atmospheric column of 150 DU is large but not unrealistic: columns of 20, 90 and above 500 DU have been reported for an Etna eruption in 2002 (Carn et al., 2005), a Mount Hekla eruption in 2000 (Rose et al., 2003) and the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 (Guo et al., 2004), respectively. We also performed sensitivity experiments for SO2 columns of 15 and 50 DU,with the vertical profiles in Fig. 2 scaled accordingly."

The cirrus cloud is located at around 7 km height with two different optical thicknesses (0.5 and 5) at 550 nm. The low-level cloud is located at around 1 km height (between 900 and 850 hPa) and has an optical depth of 50 at 550 nm. The cirrus cloud is made of nonspherical crystals with spectral properties from Yang et al. (2005). We assume the low-level cloud consists of spherical droplets and Mie theory is used to predict the cloud optical properties and their spectral dependence (Stephens, 1979)."

The calculations and their interpretation are done in the context of the MODIS channels but the application to SEVIRI will be discussed in the next section.\nThe results for the 12 profiles are shown on Fig. 3. Eq. (1) has been used to estimate the BT for all wavelengths between channels 27 and 31, with the interpolated BT at 7.3 µm (channel 28) being highlighted. It can be seen that in many cases the interpolated BT is a reasonably good approximation for the actual BT. The difference between the interpolated and calculated BTs is in the range of −3 to +4 K. Further simulations also showed that, with the exception of profiles SUB1 and MID1, MODIS channel 31 at 11.06 µm is the best choice for channel 3 in Eq. (1) (figures not shown, see Section 4.3)."

    "heading": "4.2. Clear-sky conditions with SO2",
    "text": "The calculations have been repeated for the three SO2 profiles discussed above. A plume of SO2 centred around 600 hPa increases the brightness temperature difference (BTD=BT2⁎−BT2) by 0.6 to 4 K, except for the SUB1 and MID1 profiles where a decrease is observed instead (see Fig. 4). The different effect of SO2 for the SUB1 and MID1 cases can be explained by the presence of a temperature inversion and a corresponding peak in humidity in the lower troposphere in these two profiles. It should be noted that although the BTD is positive in all twelve cases, there is quite an overlap with the range of BTD values obtained for SO2 free conditions. This means that it may be difficult to detect an SO2 plume using this method, if it is too low in the atmosphere.\nIf the SO2 plume is centred around 400 hPa the BTD increases by 1.2 to 7.3 K from the SO2-free case and is now in the range of 0.9 to 8.4 K. For an SO2 plume centred around 300 hPa, the BTD increases further to a range of 4.5 to 13 K. This range does not overlap with the range of −3 to +4 K for SO2-free conditions. Therefore a BTD larger than 5 K for clearsky conditions and nadir viewing conditions can unambiguously be attributed to the presence of SO2. Such a threshold on the BTD would result in a fairly small false alarm rate. These results do not mean however that SO2 plumes below 300 hPa could not be detected by the three-channel method as they may still show enough contrast against the background BTD for the plume to show up. This would require the background BTD not to exhibit large spatial variations and automatic detection might prove to be more difficult."

    "heading": "4.3. Choice of interpolating channels",
    "text": "We also conducted interpolation of channel 28 using channels 27 and 29 on one hand and channels 27 and 30 on the other hand. Interpolating the BT of channel 28 from channels 27 and 29 leads to a very wide range of BTD, ruling\nout the possibility to detect SO2 at any atmospheric level (figure not shown). This is partly due to the SO2 absorption in channel 29 which masks the effect of SO2 absorption in channel 28 when computing the BTD. The use of channels 27 and 30 leads to smaller range of BTD but the ranges for the\nSO2 cases overlap more with the range for the no SO2 case, thus making SO2 detection only possible for high-altitude plumes (figure not shown). The choice of channels 27 and 31 initially proposed by Prata et al. (2003) appears to be therefore optimal."

    "heading": "4.4. Sensitivity to surface temperature",
    "text": "In our simulations we have chosen a representative (but not fully exhaustive) set of temperature and humidity profiles. To assess a possible relationship between the accuracy of the BT estimated in channel 28 and the surface temperature, we have performed two additional simulations for the TRO3, MID4 and SUB3 profiles but with surface temperature artificially increased and decreased by 5 K. These two additional cases are not expected to be realistic but can be used to estimate the sensitivity of the results to surface temperature. We could establish that the BTD is only moderately sensitive to changes in surface temperature. For the no SO2 case, the changes in BTD are ±1.1 K, ±1.36 K and ± 0.7 K for the TRO3, MID4 and SUB3 simulations, respectively (Table 2). These simulations suggest that the spread in BTD is due to both the spread in vertical profiles of temperature and humidity and varying surface temperatures.\nAs one would expect, the increase in BTD due to the presence of SO2 is slightly enhanced in the +5Kexperiment and\nslightly suppressed in the −5Kexperiment (Table 2). Overallwe can conclude that the sensitivity of the BTD to the SO2 column is hardly affected by changes in the surface temperature.\nVariations in surface emissivity may also affect the BTD. Surface emissivity is fairly constant over the ocean but shows more variation over land. From a radiative transfer point of view, varying surface emissivity or surface temperature have similar effect as long as surface emissivity does not vary spectrally. Our sensitivity study on surface temperature (±5 K) encompasses the variability in BT expected from the spatial variability in surface emissivity. However the effect of spectral variation in surface emissivity cannot be approximated by changes in surface temperature. This effect would need to be examined when more data become available on the spectral variation of surface emissivity in the infrared spectrum."

    "heading": "4.5. Impact of SO2 content",
    "text": "To test the impact of the SO2 content, we have performed simulations (not shown) for two additional cases with SO2 columns of 15 and 50 DU and for the TRO3, SUB3 and MID4 profiles and our three SO2 vertical profiles centered at 600, 400 and 300 hPa. As expected the change in BTD is less than for the 150 DU case. It is worth noting that the change in BTDwith and\nwithout SO2 does not scale linearly with the SO2 column. The change in BTD for an SO2 column of 15 DU is approximately 1/6 of thatwith an SO2 columnof 150DUalthough the column is 10 times smaller. The change in BTD for an SO2 column of 50 DU is approximately half of that with an SO2 column of 150 DU.With typical noise in the BTD of a few K in background conditions, these results suggest that a 15 DU plume is unlikely to be detected, but a 50 DU plume can. Again the higher the SO2 plume, the more likely it is to be detected."

The presence of ash decreases the BT in channel 31 which then translates in a decrease of the BTD. The results show however that this decrease is about the same in the presence and absence of SO2, and as a result, the change in BTD inducedby the SO2 plume is only slightly reduced (Table 3). The presence of ash therefore hardly changes the detectability of the SO2 plume using the three-channel technique."

    "heading": "4.7. Impact of viewing angle",

Same as Fig. 3 but for the cloud profile and two different low-le\n50 and 70° instead of the nadir viewing presented so far. The larger value would correspond to a pixel located on the edge of the MODIS swath or on the edge of the METEOSAT disc. Results are summarized in Table 4. There is a dependence of the BTD with the viewing angle. In the absence of SO2 the increase in BTD is less than 1 Kwhen the viewing zenith angle increases from nadir to 30°. It increases by 1 to 3 K when the viewing zenith angle increases from nadir to 50° and by 2.5 to 6 Kwhen the viewing zenith angle increases from nadir to the extreme value of 70°. However this dependence to the viewing angle is similar in the absence or in the presence of SO2. The contrast in BTD between the SO2 and the no-SO2 cases decreases only slightly with increasing viewing angle for the MID4 and the TRO3 profiles. It even increases with increasing viewing angle for the SUB3 profile when the SO2 plume is located at 400 and 300 hPa. For all three profiles investigated here the SO2 plume remains detectable against the background when it is located at 300 hPa. Given that the viewing angle changes smoothly in space we can conclude that the retrieval method is fairly insensitive to the satellite viewing angle. However the threshold of 5 K to detect the presence of SO2 in clear-sky conditions discussed in Section 4.2 has to be adjusted for the viewing angle."
  }, {
    "heading": "4.8. Impact of clouds",
    "text": "One potential problem in the detection of SO2 is the presence of clouds. We performed further simulations with our LBLDOM model to test the sensitivityof theSO2 retrieval scheme to clouds. It appears that low-level clouds have a small effect on the simulated BT (Fig. 5). The lack of sensitivity to low-level clouds is because their effect is masked by water vapour present higher up. Because low-level clouds slightly decrease the BTD, the above-mentioned threshold of 5 K could be reduced if the presenceof low-level clouds canbe inferred fromother channels.\nHigh-level clouds have more of an impact on measured BTs and SO2 retrieval. When a cirrus cloud is present in the column, the interpolated BT at 7.3 µm is larger than the observed one and this creates an ambiguity in the SO2 retrieval (see Fig. 6). This variation is not only due to the change at 7.3 µm but also to the decrease in radiances at 6.8 and 10.8 µm used for the interpolation. The effect of cirrus clouds on the three-channel algorithm is therefore comparable to that of SO2. We recommend that other channels (such as MODIS channel 20, 29, 30 and 32 or SEVIRI equivalent\nvel cloud optical depths (τ=1, left, and τ=50, right) and no SO2.\nchannels) should be used to discriminate between cirrus clouds and SO2 presence (Hansell et al., 2007)."

We have shown this to be a reasonable assumption although themethod requires a large enough columnof SO2 at a high enough altitude for the SO2 plume to be unambiguously detected against BTD variations due to the atmospheric profiles of temperature and\nhumidity. The method proved to be fairly insensitive to variations in the surface temperature and to the presence of low-level cloud and ash. The method is fairly insensitive to variations in the satellite viewing angle as well as long as the increase of the background BTD with the viewing angle is accounted forwhen setting a threshold for SO2 detection. Highlevel clouds have to be screened out because they can be\nFig. 8. Detection of an SO2 plume following the Soufriere Hills eruption using the displayed (K).

Our results also suggest that the relative effects of the SO2 column and plume height cannot be disentangled without further information. As such the threechannel method does not allow a simultaneous retrieval of SO2 columnandplumeheight. Yet the semi-quantitative retrieval of the three-channel method can be very useful in an operational context because it can be applied to instruments with hightemporal sampling and near-real-time data availability such as SEVIRI. The next section describes inmore detail how the threechannel method can be extended to SEVIRI and we present a case study for the Montserrat eruption on 20–21 May 2006."

    "heading": "5. SEVIRI retrieval",
    "text": "The SEVIRI instrument has channels at 7.3 µm (channel 6 in the SO2 absorption band) and 10.8 µm (channel 9) but does not have a channel at 6.7–6.8 µm. We have to use the channel at 6.2 µm (channel 5) instead. However the assumption of approximate linearity of the radiance (in unit of W m−2 sr−1 (cm−1)−1) doesnot holddown to6.2µmeven for a blackbody. To circumvent that problem, we emulate a 6.8 µm channel from the SEVIRI 6.2 µm channel assuming the BT is the same at both wavelengths. It can be shown from our simulations that the emulated BT is a good approximation of the BT at 6.8 µm (see Fig. 7). There is a bias of 2 K in the estimated 6.8 µm BT that should be kept in mindwhen interpreting the results. We have also looked at simultaneous measurements for particular\nSEVIRI instrument. The difference in brightness temperature, BT2⁎−BT2, is\nserved brightness temperature at 7.3 µm. The white star indicates the volcano\nscenes, which confirms that theMODIS and SEVIRI radiances at 7.3 and 10.8 µmcloselymatch. Thereforewe can apply the same three-channel algorithm to SEVIRI datawith the only provision that the 6.2 µm radiance has to be empirically converted to an “equivalent” 6.8 µm radiance rather than utilised as such.\nThe three-channel algorithm applied to SEVIRI will have the same limitations as for the MODIS instrument. However we show on a test case that it can be used for SO2 detection. There have been few strong volcanic eruptions in the METEOSAT area since the launch of the first MSG satellite in 2002. The Soufriere Hills volcano (16.7°N, 62.2°W) is located on the Island of Montserrat; it is in the METEOSAT disc with a viewing angle around 60°. Soufriere Hills started to erupt at 7.40 am local time (12:40 UTC) on 20 May 2006 and continued to erupt throughout 20 and 21 May 2006. The SO2 plume was injected into the stratosphere and was detected by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instruments (Prata et al., 2007; Carn et al., 2007). Fig. 8 shows the BTD in a region extending from 72°W to 60°W and 10°N to 20°N. The background BTD is in the range of 4 to 8 K. These large values are consistent with our calculations and can be expected because of the utilisation of the 6.2 µm SEVIRI channel, which adds 2 K as compared toMODIS, and the large viewing angle, which adds another 2–4 K as compared to nadir viewing. Nevertheless the SO2 plume is quite visible with BTDs as large as 20 K. The plume is shown to be advected southwestwards from 20 May 2006 22:15UTC to 21 May 2006 03:15UTC. It appears that the SO2 plume is not visible in the first hours after the eruption possibly because of contamination by ice clouds.\nIt is difficult to saywhether the BTD values in excess of 12 K north to the Hispaniola island originate from the eruption or are part of the variability in the background. Large BTD values can be expected because of the large viewing angle of the SEVIRI instrument for this part of the Meteosat disc. It is also unclearwhatmayhave caused the lowBTDvalues in the direct neighbourhood of the volcano. The presence of ash has been shown to decrease the BTD somewhat (see Table 2) but does not explain a decrease as large as 6 K."

    "text": "In this study we have examined the validity of the assumptions behind the three-channel technique of Prata et al. (2003) for detecting volcanic SO2. It has been shown that SO2 detection was possible in clear-sky conditions and in the presence of low-level clouds or an ash plume. The higher and the thicker the SO2 plume, the easier it is to detect, irrespectively of the surface temperature and atmospheric profile of temperature and humidity and their spatial variation. High-level clouds complicate the retrieval and a high-cloud mask is needed to limit the number of false alarms. However there is still an SO2 signal in the presence of cirrus cloud when the SO2 plume is high enough.\nThe three-channel technique can be applied to instruments such asMODIS and SEVIRI. Our results also suggest that the relative effects of the SO2 column and SO2 plume height cannot be disentangled without further information. Moreover a more quantitative technique is fraught with a significant uncertainty related to the inaccurate knowledge\nof the temperature and humidity profiles. It is nevertheless possible to use the temperature and humidity profiles analysed or forecasted from a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model to improve the SO2 three-channel retrieval technique. With their high spectral resolution, the AIRS and Infrared Atmospheric Interferometer Sounder (IASI) instruments have the potential for a more quantitative retrieval of the SO2 column. Unfortunately these instruments fly on polar orbiting platforms with up to 12 h between two consecutive overpasses of a given location, which does not meet the VAACs requirement of a very early detection of the volcanic plumes. In contrast SEVIRI has the tremendous advantage of being on a geostationary platformwith an image every 15min day and night. We have shown an example of SO2 detection with the SEVIRI instrument for the eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano."

  "abstractText": "Article history: Received 26 March 2008 Received in revised form 1 August 2008 Accepted 22 August 2008 Current infrared narrowband instruments, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) or Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), can be used to locate volcanic SO2 plumes. A three-channel technique has been proposed by Prata et. al. [Prata, A.J., Rose, W.I., Self, S., O'Brien, D.M., 2003. Global, long-term sulphur dioxide measurements from TOVS data: a new tool for studying explosive volcanism and climate. AGU Geophysical Monograph 139: Volcanism and the Earth's Atmosphere (pp. 75–92). Ed. by A. Robock and C. Oppenhaimer.], which considers the difference in brightness temperature (BT) in the SO2 absorption band around 7–8 μm between an observed value and an estimated value interpolated from two other channels. The technique relies on the assumption that the interpolated BT value is a good approximation of the BT that would have been observed in the absence of SO2. In this study we use a sophisticated radiative transfer model in order to test this assumption and assess the sensitivity of this three-channel technique to the vertical profiles of temperature and water vapour, the surface temperature, the vertical distribution of the SO2, the viewing geometry, the presence of ash, and the presence of lowand high-level clouds. The capabilities and limitations of such a technique are discussed. An example is also shown as a proof of concept using data from the SEVIRI instrument onboard the MSG satellite.
