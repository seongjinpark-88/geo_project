In this work, REE data from the FOREGS Geochemical Atlas of Europe database on solid sample media (topsoil, subsoil, stream sediment, and floodplain) and streamwater for Italy and Sweden are used to plot distribution maps, and Principal Component Analysis to identify patterns within the data set. The careful investigation of the spatial distribution of REEs in all sample media for both countries allowed us to identify the prominent role played by the geogenic component. Despite a similar REE content of bedrocks (alkaline igneous products, both intrusive and effusive in Italy, alkali granites and pegmatites in Sweden), several distinct differences emerged between the two countries. We identified factors like climate, geomorphology, age of deposits, presence of mineralisation, types of soil and presence of till, as responsible for the different REE enrichments in solid and aqueous sample media in the two countries. Italian palaeosols, developed in volcanic areas, were identified as a possible future source for REE extraction using low pollutant extraction techniques.\n© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "text": "Since the end of last century, geochemical research has been concerned with the identification of the effects of single chemical elements on human health, and many efforts were devoted to the assessment of natural background values and to the plotting of reliable geochemical maps for main solid and aqueous sample media. In 1996, the Forum of European Geological Surveys (FOREGS) decided to compile a large database of geochemical data covering different environmental media (soil, stream and floodplain sediments and water) from 26 European countries, with the purpose of compiling the geochemical atlas of Europe (Plant et al., 1996, 1997). The collected data were described in two volumes by Salminen et al. (2005) and De Vos et al. (2006), and are freely available (http://weppi.gtk.fi/publ/foregsatlas/) for further investigation by all interested researchers.\nWhile this project was being completed, rare earth elements (REEs) gained more relevance for industrial and commercial purposes, due to their increasing use in medicine as a contrast medium (Gd), in advanced technical fields such as the production of semiconductors, in Er doped fibres that function as laser amplifiers, and in high-strength\nlla Terra, dell'Ambiente e delle rcellino 10, 80138 Napoli, Italy.\no).\nrights reserved.\nREEmagnets that allowminiaturisation of numerous electronic components used in many appliances (video, computers, etc.). Several REEs are essential constituents of both petroleum fluid cracking catalysts and automotive pollution-control catalytic converters. As a consequence of the increased need, global production of REEs has increased enormously in recent years, paralleled by a fast growing interest in the identification of new ore deposits. Environmental contamination by REEs is expected to grow rapidly in the near future.\nUsing the data from the FOREGS database, Fedele et al. (2008) investigated anthropogenic sources of REE in Europe with a combination of REE spider diagrams, and interpolated maps showing REE distributions in floodplain and stream sediments, too. These authors concluded that the source of the large-scale distribution patterns of REE over Europe is entirely geogenic. No clear evidence has been found of historic or recent REE contamination from anthropogenic sources, such as the electronics or nuclear industry.\nREE distribution maps of Fedele et al. (2008) show that the highest content of REEs in Europe is found in solid media of Italy and the Fennoscandia region. They showed that REE ratios can be used to identify themajor plates of the Variscan orogeny and the distinctive granites emplaced after suturing. The Variscan granites caught up in Alpine nappes in Italy were also identified. In Sweden and Italy, similar REEs content occur in solid media related to alkali-rich intrusive rocks (granites and granodiorites) and to alkaline volcanic products of the Latial volcanic area and Campanian Volcanic Zone (Rolandi et al., 2003).\n177P. Petrosino et al. / Journal of Geochemical Exploration 133 (2013) 176–201\nThese volcanic products, mainly of Pleistocene to Holocene age, show REE concentrations comparable to the Swedish REE contents.\nHowever, despite the similarly high REE contents of these bedrocks, the geological context is very different in the two countries. In Sweden, the Ordovician–Devonian age of the alkali granite (emplacedmainly during the Caledonian orogeny) and more recent cryoclastic weathering, favoured the accumulation of REE-rich exploitable rocks. In Italy, the younger age and theMediterranean climate preserved the alkaline volcanic rocks from erosion, and these outcrops are found today, mainly in densely populated areas. For the time being, there are no plans for the commercial exploitation of REE from volcanic products in Italy, but this possibility cannot be excluded for the future, in response to possible changes in the raw materials market demand.\nThis work uses the FOREGS REE data for topsoil, subsoil, stream and floodplain sediments, and stream water to identify geogenic and anthropogenic components in young and old bedrock in Italy and Sweden. Notwithstanding the low density of the geochemical survey, it proved useful to provide data necessary to assess the potential mineral resources and anthropogenic influences and data that may be used to determine national-scale REE baselines.\n2. Data sources\nThe data used for the present paper were acquired in the framework of the project known as FOREGS (Forum of European Geological Surveys) Geochemical Atlas of Europe, a geochemical baseline project. The main purpose of the project was to generate a harmonised geochemical database for Europe by using the same sampling, sample preparation and analytical methods (Salminen et al., 1998, 2005). The field manual by Salminen et al. (1998) is the basis for a decade-long project, involving geochemists from 26 countries, which led to the publication of the Geochemical Atlas of Europe (De Vos et al., 2006; Salminen et al., 2005). In this framework, Italy and Sweden were divided into eight and eighteen GTN (Global Terrestrial Network) cells (160 km×160 km), respectively, following the recommendations of the International Geological Correlation Programme 259 ‘International Geochemical Mapping’ (Darnley et al., 1995). In Italy, at the end of the FOREGS project, the sampling grid has been extended up to a total of 28 cells, including new cells located in coastal areas. The Italian sampling teams, involving three research groups from Napoli, Padova and Siena Universities, collected a total of 50 floodplain sediments, 48 stream waters, 52 stream sediments, 52 topsoils and 47 subsoils. Details of the sampling and analytical methods are given in De Vivo et al. (2008), together with a summary of the main anthropic activities, which might have had an influence on the control of some geochemical anomalies for different elements. In Sweden, a geochemist from the Geological Survey of Sweden, collected 47 floodplain sediments, 51 stream waters, 51 stream sediments, 51 topsoils and 51 subsoils. Methods for planning, sampling, analysis, results and further information are given in the Geochemical Atlas of Europe (De Vos et al., 2006; Salminen et al., 2005).\n3. Rare earth elements\nThe REE series (lanthanides) is comprised of 15 elements ranging from 57 to 71 atomic number. They display similar chemical structures, low electronegativity (b1.2) and mostly exist in the trivalent state. Analogies in the physical and chemical properties are due mainly to the REE having the same configuration of valence electrons. The 4f orbitals are gradually filled as the atomic number increases, causing contraction of the ionic radius (also known as the lanthanide contraction), which decreases from 1.16 in La to 0.97 Å in Lu. The REEs are divided into two subgroups: LREE (light REE), from La to Eu, and HREE (heavy REE), from Gd to Lu. The overall high oxidation number and large ionic radius of the REE make it difficult for them to enter the lattices of common rock-forming minerals, so they generally are incompatible;\nhowever, the heaviest REE (HREE) have ionic radii small enough to make possible the limited substitution for Al3+. REE concentrations in igneous rocks are usually plotted in increasing atomic number order, normalised to chondritic abundance to eliminate the marked change in the concentration of REE of odd and even atomic number. A pronounced peak in REE pattern for Eu, known as the Eu anomaly, is observed due to its bivalent behaviour at low fO2, when it substitutes for Ca2+ in plagioclase (Eyring, 2006). The Eu anomaly can be positive or negative, in response to the removal or accumulation of plagioclase frommagma. Owing to their geochemical features, being relatively stable and insensitive toweathering and hydrothermal alteration, they can be used to determine the primarymagmatic history of rocks (Rollinson, 1993). REEs in sedimentary rocks are generally normalised to Post Archaean Australian Shales (PAAS) (Taylor and McLennan, 1985), and REE distribution patterns can be used to understand their sedimentary history. For example, the common 3+ state can be altered to 2+ for Eu, Sm and Yb under strongly reducing conditions, while Ce3+ can be oxidised to Ce4+, hence, highly oxygenated waters, such as seawater, tend to be depleted in Ce on REE plots.\nAlthough there are meaningful variations on the total REE content of igneous rocks with the same degree of evolution, on the whole the total REE content decreases from felsic to mafic terms, being the lowest in komatites (Henderson, 1984). The total REE content in sedimentary rocks is lower than in igneous rocks. As a general rule, elevated REE values are generally indicative of felsic rocks, especially intrusives, and of the sediments derived from them. Finally, since REE are almost insoluble and immobile, their concentrations generally do not vary much during the metamorphic process, and their patterns are overall related to the history of the rock prior to metamorphism.\nREEs were originally produced in minor amounts from small deposits in granitic pegmatite, the kind of rock in which they were first found. During the first half of last century, REEs were mainly extracted from placer deposits, particularly those of the southeastern United States, Australia and Russia. Since 1998, more than 80% of the world's REE raw materials have come from China, and most of this production is from the Bayan Obo deposit in Inner Mongolia (Castor and Hedrick, 2006)."

    "text": "Italy underwent many complex orogenic and tectonic phases during its geological history. Main phases are shown on the map of the tectonostratigraphic units (Fig. 1). The lithological map shown in Fig. 2 identifies the correlation between the geological setting and the solid sample media investigated in the present work. All the locations discussed in the text can be found either in Fig. 1 or 2.\nThe term ‘basement complexes’ (BCs) is used by Boriani et al. (2003) for the set of rock complexes underlying the post-Variscan unconformity. They show the effects of older deformational, depositional, erosional, metamorphic and magmatic events modified to a variable extent by younger deformational and thermal overprints. To the north, along the Alps, BCs occur as the deepest lithostratigraphic unit in each of the main structural complexes (or nappe systems) making-up the Alpine chain. On the peninsular and insular part of Italy, BCs are exposed in Tuscany (surroundings of Florence) and, more outcrops to the south, in Calabria and Sicily (Calabria–Peloritani Terrane). Finally, BCs dominate on the island of Sardinia, where they are classified into Axial Zone, Nappe Zone and External Zone. The Calabria–Peloritani Terrane is a tectonic juxtaposition of a N subterrane (the Sila and the Serre Massifs) and a S subterrane (Aspromonte Massif and Peloritani Mts.) (Boriani et al., 2003). Most rock types indicate a shallow crustal nature, but intermediate to deep crustal rocks occur both in the Alps (the so called Ivrea–Verbano Zone) and in Calabria. The shallow crustal sequences consist ofmetapelitic–psammitic rocks of variousmetamorphic\ngrade with lenses or intercalations of leucocratic gneiss, amphibolite, felsic and mafic metavolcanics and some marbles. All the BCs rocks, apart from those outcropping in southern Sardinia, were strongly affected by the Variscan metamorphism.\nBetween the Late Cambrian and the Early Devonian, the Caledonian orogeny occurred as a consequence of the collision, in Western Europe, of Baltica, Laurentia and Avalonia subcontinents. The fingerprints of this orogenic phase are doubtful in Italy, namely in Sardinia, because they are strongly masked by the Hercynian orogeny, known as Variscan in Europe. This phase took place between theDevonian and Early Permian, and led to the formation of a single supercontinent, the Pangaea. Variscan orogeny rocks can be found in the Alps, Sardinia, Calabria, north-eastern Sicily (Peloritani Mounts) and in scattered outcrops in western Tuscany (ApuanAlps). Crustal thickening and polyphasemetamorphism characterise the Variscan terrains in Italy. Typical lithotypes are phyllite, gneiss and amphibolite. The presence of a late orogenetic\nmagmatic phase that occurred between Late Carboniferous and Early Permian is confirmed by the granites and plutonites in western Alps (Monte Bianco and Monte Rosa, Monte Baveno), Cima D'Asta in the Dolomites, Barbagia and Gallura granites in Sardinia, and widespread ignimbrite flows in Trentino Alto Adige. Most of these granites were derived from high-K calcalkaline magmatism, and have been formed at a regime of lithospheric extension and attenuation affecting the whole domain of the European Hercynian belt (Rottura et al., 1998). On the whole, they display chondrite-normalised REE patterns characterised by variable LREE enrichment and moderate to pronounced negative Eu-anomalies, with no significant HREE fractionation (Rottura et al., 1997).\nThe end of Variscan orogeny was marked by the extensional reactivation of faults systems that produced new sedimentary basins. During the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic, a major transgression formed an open marine shelf covering most of present central Europe. Submarine\n180 P. Petrosino et al. / Journal of Geochemical Exploration 133 (2013) 176–201\nvolcanic products were emplaced as pillow lavas, the oldest (Early Jurassic) can be found at scarce outcrops in the southern Apennines and in Sicily, the youngest (Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous) make-up the ophiolitic complexes in the inner Alpine and Apenninic zones. The spreading movement forming Tethys was in the early Triassic, and sedimentation continued until the lower Caenozoic era. During the Alpine orogeny enormous stress was exerted on sediments of the Alpine Tethys basin, and its Mesozoic and early Caenozoic strata were pushed against the stable Eurasian landmass by the northward-moving African landmass. Most of this occurred during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. The pressure formed great recumbent folds, or nappes, that rose out of what had become the Alpine Tethys and pushed northward, often breaking and sliding one over the other to form gigantic thrust faults. In this framework, the Apennine chain represent a part of the Alpine orogen, experiencing a different evolution from the Alpine chain as a consequence of the complex geodynamic phases, firstly related to the opening of the Sardinia–Corsica basin (ca. 20 Ma) and then of the Tyrrhenian basin, which caused the anticlockwise rotation of the Italian Peninsula. As a consequence of the Alpine orogeny collisional phases, granitic and tonalitic intrusive rocks (Biella, Traversella, val Bregaglia, Adamello and Vedrette di Ries) were emplaced ca. 30 Ma ago.\nDuring the Oligocene, in response to the opening of the Ligurian– Provençal back-arc basin (Speranza et al., 2003), related to the subduction of African oceanic lithosphere under the European continental margin toward the NNW (Beccaluva et al., 1994 and references\ntherein), orogenic volcanism took place on Sardinia, with widespread lava flows and felsic ignimbrites in the Cagliari area, the Logudoro– Bosano area, and on San Pietro and Sant'Antioco islands.\nStarting from Pliocene, both insular and peninsular Italy became the site of intense volcanic activity. Plio-Quaternary magmatism in Italy exhibits an extremely variable composition, and petrological and geochemical data are used to group the activity in various magmatic provinces, mainly linked to different types of magma genesis (Peccerillo, 2005 and references therein). The Tuscanyprovince (14–0.2 Ma) displays anatectic silicic magmas and minor mantle derived calcalkaline to ultrapotassic mafic rocks. The Roman, Umbria, Ernici–Roccamonfina and Neapolitan provinces (0.8 Ma to present) are formed by mantle derived potassic to ultrapotassic rocks having variable trace element and isotopic compositions. The Aeolian arc (1 Ma to present) mainly consists of calcalkaline to shoshonitic rocks. The Sicily province contains young to active centres (notably Etna) with a tholeiitic to Na-alkaline affinity. Finally, volcanoes of variable composition occur on Sardinia and, as seamounts, on the Tyrrhenian Sea floor. Magmas in the Aeolian arc, and along the Italian Peninsula, have a subduction related geochemical character, whereas the Sicily and Sardinia provinces display intraplate signatures.\nFor the purposes of the present paper, we partially modified the classification scheme of Peccerillo (2005), and for Pliocene to Present in Table 1, we report the volcanic areas, the age and type of volcanism. As far as REE content is concerned, we used chondrite-normalised plots (Fig. 3) to compare the range of REE contents and patterns of volcanic\nPeccerillo, 2005).\n182 P.

The plots show that the Plio-Pleistocenic volcanic rocks from Italy are LREE enriched and have negative Eu anomalies which are more evident in the evolved members. On the whole, the highest REE content is shown by Roman (Vulsini and Vico) volcanic centres, Campania (Campi Flegrei, Somma Vesuvio and Ischia) volcanoes and at Pantelleria Island in the Sicily channel. A strong LREE enrichment is found in correspondence to the Vulture volcano, at Campi Flegrei and on Ischia Island. A slight negative anomaly is recorded for Yb at Campi Flegrei, Ischia Island and at Vico volcano."

    "text": "The Fennoscandian Shield comprises an Archaean nucleus in its north-eastern part to which Proterozoic terrains have been successively accreted along the southern and western flanks (Gaàl and Gorbatschev, 1987). Sweden is a part of the Fennoscandian Shield and composed of Archaean to Neoproterozoic rocks, and geographically, it can be divided into seven geological regions, each with a distinct tectonic history and geochemical character (Fig. 4). The oldest Archaean rocks are found in northern Sweden in the Kiruna area and between Luleå and Piteå, near Boden (Kathol et al., 2011), and towards Jokkmokk. Most of the Archaean units were generated during the Saamian orogeny (3.1–2.9 Ga), amalgamated by collision at ca. 2.0–1.9 Ga, then reworked during Proterozoic tectonic events to form collisional belts, such as the Lapland granulite belt (Hölttä et al., 2008). TheArchaean rocks, in general, consist of mafic and granitoid rocks.\nThe post-Archaean development started with periods of rifting of the craton interior and its margin between 2.44 and 1.96 Ga (Gaàl and Gorbatschev, 1987; Nironen, 1997). The majority of Sweden consists of rocks of the Svecokarelian Orogen, formed during the Palaeoproterozoic in two distinct phases, one between 2.44 and 1.96 Ga and the second between 1.96 and 1.75 Ga. After the accretion was completed, subsequent east- and northward subduction resulted in pervasive reworking of the newly formed crust during the late\nSvecofennian (ca. 1.85–1.75 Ga). This reworking resulted in the voluminous Trans-Scandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB) along the south-west margin, as well as penecontemporaneous, mainly granitoid magmatism and regional metamorphism further towards the continent, e.g., in Bergslagen (Andersson, 1991; Andersson et al., 2004; Patchett et al., 1987). The Trans-Scandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB) is situated to thewest of the Svecokarelian domain and stretches from southernmost Sweden northwards, beneath the Caledonian mountain chain and up to the coastal region in northern Norway (Högdahl et al., 2004; Sadeghi et al., 2013), and consists of largely undeformed granitoids and associated porphyries. The Bleckinge–Bornholm province is located in southern Sweden. Early amphibolites, felsic metavolcanics, mica schists, and gneisses (ca. 1.77–1.69 Ga) were intruded by tonalite– granodiorite plutons and were not affected by the Sveconorwegian orogeny. The Sveconorwegian orogen predominantly consists of bedrock originally formed during the Gothian orogeny (1.7–1.55 Ga), cut by late Mesoproterozoic igneous rocks (ca. 1.1–0.9 Ga), and subsequently deformed and metamorphosed under amphibolite to granulite–eclogite facies conditions into gneisses, granulites, eclogites, and migmatites. Rare supracrustal rocks (greywacke, quartzite, and shale) occurring with minor mafic to felsic volcanics in south-western Sweden have been metamorphosed under greenschist to amphibolites facies conditions. Neoproterozoic rocks in Scandinavia are represented by sedimentary successions of marine and fluvial sandstones, conglomerates, and carbonates occurring within the Caledonides. In Sweden, the current exposures are mainly composed of Neoproterozoic to Palaeozoic (mostly Silurian) marine to fluvial sediments and volcanoclastic successions, which were deposited at the continental margin of the Iapetus Ocean between ca. 700 and 400 Ma (Gee et al., 2008). Outside the Caledonides, the majority of Phanerozoic rocks are remnants of the Cambro-Silurian sedimentary cover (550–400 Ma old sandstones, shales, and limestones) that once covered much of central and northern Europe. These are found in southern and central Sweden and on the islands of Götland and Öland. Cambrian to Permian diabase\nlandscape map (b) of Sweden."

In the southern part of the country, displacement is more variable and can reach up to 60–80 km (Sohlenius et al., 2009)."

Enrichment is most evident for LREE (e.g., La and Ce). Anomalous REE enrichment is generally also found in soil samples from the eastern Sardinia, the Euganei Hills and Iblei Mounts. These values seem to reflect the presence of alkali igneous products in the bedrock. High REE contents are recorded also in soil samples where the arenaceous bedrock is mostly made-up of volcanic clasts (e.g., the Arenarie Val di Sabbia substratum, consists of andesitic clasts, corresponds to a topsoil and subsoil with high Dy content). As far as Swedish soil samples are concerned, the highest REE contents are generally correlated with the presence of evolved granites. For all REE, median and maximum contents are higher in Italy than in Sweden.\nBoxplots for Ce, La and Yb in topsoil and subsoil (Fig. 8) show that, mainly for LREE, Italian soil samples display overall higher contents with respect to their Swedish counterparts, and that the range of values for Italy is larger than what is recorded for Sweden.

Stream sediment samples tend to reflect the REE contents of the rocks outcropping in the areas crossed by the tributary rivers and streams, but they also correlate quite well with REE contents in residual soil samples.\nIn Sweden, the distribution of REE content in stream sediment samples is quite similar to that of residual soil and, besides the presence of alkali granite in the catchment basins, it often reflects mineralisation (e.g., Sm enriched stream sediment due to pegmatitic REE mineralisation in the northern part of Sweden) or secondary concentrations related to clay-rich stream sediment, mainly in the southern part of Sweden. Furthermore, a strong correlation of REEs with U and Th in granite–pegmatite rocks and felsic volcanics in the northern part of Sweden is recorded (Sadeghi et al., 2013). Boxplots comparing REE contents in stream sediments in Italy and Sweden (electronic Supplementary material) show the opposite situation with respect to soil.

However, the possibility that clay-rich sediments could be REE-enriched owing to secondary phenomena cannot be excluded.\nFloodplain sediment samples in Sweden are generally REE-enriched inmineralised areas (e.g., Ho enrichment of Västerbotten and Lappland, related to sulphide and iron apatite mineralisation, respectively), or where river beds have high concentrations of Al, K and are clay-rich, as in the south-eastern part of Sweden in Uppland, Södermanland, Belkinge, and Skåne.

The highest Ho concentrations occur in two parts of Västerbotten and Lappland, where they are related to sulphide and iron apatite mineralisation, respectively.

Moderately high La values are found along the Tyrrhenian coast, northern Sicily, central Apulia, eastern Sardinia and north-eastern Italy, with an anomalous high value in an area between Veneto and Trentino, where it reflects the occurrence of alkali basaltic rocks; the highest La values (>50 mg/kg) are recorded in northern Latium–southern Tuscany and in the Neapolitan volcanic area. The lowest La values occur over most of Calabria, in south-western Sardinia and over the whole of north-eastern Italy. An anomalous high values area is located north of the Roman alkaline province Very low La values characterise northern Italy and Sicily. High La concentrations (>0.023 μg/l) occur in the alkalic volcanic areas of Roman–Campania provinces, and at Vulture volcano in Basilicata.\nSweden The main La anomalies in Sweden occur in northern Sweden in Lapland associated with granite and pegmatite, and in central Sweden in Jämtland; some narrow anomalies occur in the southern part of Sweden in Öland, and are related to younger granitic rocks. La anomalies occur in the southern part of Sweden related to clay-rich stream sediments (secondary La concentrations); migmatised bedrock with well-developed leucosome is another possible source of high La in sedimentary cover in the northern part of Sweden (Sadeghi et al., 2013). La anomalies show a pattern similar to Ce. The weakest La anomaly occurs in Sveconorwegian bedrock units in the south-western part of Sweden. The highest Ce value occurs in the Västerbotten area in the northern part of Sweden where it is related to mineralisation. La is enriched in the south-eastern part of Sweden in Lapland, Småland, Skåne and Belkinge, where river beds have high Al and K concentrations and are clay-rich. High La values occur over most part of the Caledonian orogen. High La concentrations in the southern part of Sweden are associated with granites and felsic Proterozoic rocks.\nLu Italy In topsoil, high Lu values are predominantly found along the coast of Latium and Campania, where alkalic volcanic products occur, but also in several areas of northern Italy, where mainly flyshoid clay-rich deposits outcrop, and at a single point in northern Apennines (inner Tuscany), where the bedrock is mainly made-up of marly-limestones. Lu distribution in subsoil is very similar to the topsoil, with high and very high values in central and southern Italy, west of the Apennine chain, and in north-easternmost Italy, all soils mainly developed on alkaline igneous bedrock. The highest Lu contents (>0.4 mg/kg) are found associated with volcanic, crystalline and metamorphic rocks in the catchments basins of central Calabria, eastern Sardinia, eastern Sicily, central and northern Latium and southern Trentino. Low Lu concentrations occur in most areas of northern Italy and at few sites of central Apennine. The highest Lu values occur in the Swiss Alpine sector, eastern Liguria and southern Tuscany. Very low concentrations are found across many areas of central and southern Italy, in south-eastern Sardinia and in north-eastern Italy. Low Lu values characterise the whole of the Italian Peninsula, with only two anomalous values higher than 0.03 μg/l in the Neapolitan volcanic area.\nSweden Low Lu concentrations in soil occur in areas with metavolcanic rocks and younger granitoids in central and northern Sweden, reflecting the post Svecokarelian rocks in the western part of Sweden. High Lu contents occur in the Palaeoproterozoic granite–pegmatite series in northern and south-eastern Sweden (Sadeghi et al., 2013). The spatial distribution of Lu in stream sediment shows similar trends to soil, even if the anomalous area in the southern part of Sweden is narrower. The highest Lu concentration occurs in the Lapland area, related to palaeoproterozoic rocks. There are strong correlations among Lu, Yb, and Tm. The weakest Lu anomaly in floodplain sediments occurs in south-western part of Sweden similarly to the other REE distribution. The highest Lu concentration occurs in two parts of Västerbotten and Lappland where it is related to sulphide and Fe-apatite mineralisation, respectively. Caledonian bedrock shows also medium to high Lu concentration. High Lu concentrations in the southern part of Sweden are associated with granites and felsic Proterozoic rocks.\nNd Italy Topsoil and subsoil show very similar distribution patterns where the highest values (>50 mg/kg in topsoil and in subsoil) are recorded in the Latium and Campania volcanic areas. The highest contents (>60 mg/kg) occur in southern Latium and north of Napoli, while moderately high values (ca. 40 mg/kg) are found in eastern Sardinia, north-eastern Sicily and western Veneto, all related to the occurrence of Eocene alkali-basalts, whereas in central Calabria, they are related to metamorphic Variscan basement. The lowest values are found in northern Italy, mainly in Liguria and at a few scattered sites of northern Apennine. Lowest Nd concentrations are found in south-western Sardinia, over most of southern Italy, including southern Campania, where mainly limestone rocks outcrop. The highest values occur in the volcanic area of northern Latium. Moderately high Nd values (ca. 30 mg/kg) characterise northern Campania, southern Apulia, north-eastern Sicily and some scattered points of northern Italy. Low Nd values characterise stream water of most of northern and central Italy, Sicily and Sardinia. High Nd values are found in Roman–Neapolitan volcanic areas and at Mount Vulture.\n(continued on next page)\n187 P.Petrosino et al./ JournalofG eochem icalExploration 133 (2013) 176 –201\n188 P.Petrosino et al./ JournalofG eochem icalExploration 133 (2013) 176 –201\nREE\nCountry Soil Stream sediment Foodplain sediment Stream water\nSweden The Tb anomalies display the same distribution as those of Lu. The higher concentrations of Tb are found in regions with igneous rocks, mostly granitic to pegmatitic in composition. In the southern part of Sweden, some anomalies may be related to the glacial deposits overlying crystalline bedrock (Sadeghi et al., 2013). The lowest Tb concentration reflects younger Sveconorwegian granitic composition. The Tb distribution patterns show a strong similarity with those of Sm, Pr and Tm.\nThe highest Tb concentration in floodplain sediments occurs in Västebotten and Caledonian terrains. High Tb concentrations in the southern part of Sweden are associated with granites and felsic Proterozoic rocks.\nTm Italy Thulium topsoil distribution map shows high (>0.45 mg/kg) contents over the alkaline volcanic rocks in the Roman–Neapolitan alkaline province, in southern Campania, eastern Sardinia and in north-eastern Italy. The subsoil distribution map shows very similar distribution patterns with the highest values (>0.5 mg/kg) recorded throughout central and southern Italy, and in the Friuli area of NE Italy. In the Tm distribution map the highest Tm contents (>0.45 mg/kg) occur in the Latium volcanic area, central-southern Calabria and eastern Sicily volcanic area. The highest anomaly (0.63 mg/kg) occurs in north-east Sardinia. The lowest values are found in Friuli Venetia Giulia. Lowest Tm concentrations are found in south Sardinia, over most of southern Italy and north-easternmost Italy. The highest values occur in the volcanic area of northern Latium and eastern Liguria. Thulium values in stream water are very homogeneous throughout Italy, and the highest concentration is found in the Napoli neighbourhood.\nSweden Thulium distribution in Swedish soil is very similar to the other REE and the highest concentrations occur mainly in the Norrbotten County where they are related to the crystalline bedrock. The median Tm value in Swedish stream sediment is slightly higher than that of Italian stream sediments. A reason for this is the strong correlation of REE with U and Th in granite–pegmatite rocks and felsic volcanics in the northern part of Sweden (Sadeghi et al., 2013). High Tm values occur in south-western part of Sweden, similar to the other REE, reflecting Sveconorwegian granitic rocks. The highest Tm values occur in the Västerbotten and Lapland areas where they are related to sulphide and Fe apatite mineralisation, respectively. Caledonian bedrock shows also moderate to high Tm concentrations. High Tm concentrations in the southern part of Sweden are associated with granites and felsic Proterozoic rocks.\nYb Fig. 7a,b Italy In topsoil, high Yb values are predominantly found in the eastern Friuli area, and over the alkaline volcanic lithotypes of the Roman–Neapolitan province, in southern Campania and eastern Tuscany, where the highest value (4.14 mg/kg) is recorded. The distribution of Yb in subsoil displays very similar features, but high contents are found along the west coast of Italy and in central Apennines; the highest value (4.14 mg/kg), in the eastern territory, is recorded in the easternmost Alps, along the Austrian–Slovenian border. The highest Yb contents (>3.0 mg/kg) are found in the Roman volcanic area, over crystalline rocks of central Calabria, in the magmatic area of north-eastern Sicily, in the Alps along the border with Austria and at a single sampling point between Veneto and Trentino. The highest and widest anomaly is recorded in the western sector of Sardinia (>3.5 mg/kg), where the lithology is mainly represented by pre-Permian basement rocks. The distribution pattern of Yb shows the lowest values in southern Sardinia and most of southern Italy, including Sicily. High Yb values are found over the Swiss alpine sector pertaining to Italy, and at two scattered points in south-western Lombardy and southern Veneto. An anomalous high value is found in Apulia (2.31 mg/kg), possibly linked to intense agricultural activity. The highest Yb values (>2.5 mg/kg) occur in a narrow coastal belt from eastern Liguria to the north of the Roman alkaline province Very low Yb values characterise stream waters over the whole of the Italian Peninsula, including Sicily and Sardinia. The only few sites showing meaningful Yb concentration are located in central Italy and at Mount Vulture (Basilicata). The highest point anomaly (>0.23 μg/l) occurs in the Roman– Neapolitan alkaline volcanism area.\nSweden The spatial distribution of Yb is similar to that of Tm and Er, but areas with elevated values of these elements are generally narrower. High Yb values in soil are located mainly in regions underlain by the crystalline basement, mainly granitic in composition and in areas with high-grade metamorphic rocks (amphibolite, migmatite, granulite, and eclogite) with garnet as a common phase (Sadeghi et al., 2013); some anomalies occur in the Bergslagen area (Västmanland) where they are associated with Yb mining area. Palaeoplacer area in northern Sweden has higher Yb concentrations as well (Salpeteur et al., 2005). The concentrations of Yb in Swedish stream sediments are slightly higher than in Italian stream sediments. There are strong correlations of Yb with U and Th in stream sediments, possibly due to substitution of these elements in heavy minerals commonly found in stream sediments (e.g., garnet). The distribution pattern of Yb shows highest values in Västerbotten and Lappland, related to sulphide and Fe apatite mineralisation, respectively. There is also a positive anomaly over Caledonian terrain which, generally, shows higher REE concentration. High Yb concentrations in the southern part of Sweden are associated with granites and felsic Proterozoic rocks.\nTb\n189 P.Petrosino et al./ JournalofG eochem icalExploration 133 (2013) 176 –201\n190 P.

    "text": "The lowest total REE values in stream water samples are 0.02 and 0.076 μg/l, and the highest 5.26 and 29.31 μg/l for Italy and Sweden, respectively.\nItalian stream waters are generally REE poor, with the only exception of stream waters from the Roman–Neapolitan and Mount Vulture volcanic areas. The highest values recorded at Mount Vulture probably are due to mixing of stream waters with spring waters circulating in shallow water tables located in volcanic REE-enriched terrains.\nTwo anomalous high Gd values are found to the north of Napoli in Campania, and on the Ionian coast of Apulia. They could be linked to the contamination of stream waters with waste waters. Anomalies found in densely populated areas can be the result of usage of organic Gd compounds, such as the derivatives of the gadopentetic acid (Gd-DTPA), used as a contrast medium in magnetic resonance imaging. After excretion from the human body, the Gd complex enters the surface water mostly by the body effluents and is stable at least six months under natural conditions (Knappe et al., 2005).\nStream water samples show very different features between Italy and Sweden. In Italy, REE content is generally very low and shows a narrow variation range, with a few outlier for each element. In Sweden, stream waters are much more REE-rich and the variation range is much larger.\nIn Italy, the areas where the maximum REE contents in soil, floodplain and stream sediment samples are recorded coincide fairly well to the areas where stream waters are REE enriched. In Sweden, however, the behaviour of stream water with respect to residual soil is completely the opposite, because the highest values of all REE in stream water samples are recorded in southern Sweden, where the lowest values for both topsoil and subsoil occur. There is nevertheless correspondence of high REE contents in stream water that are located in southern Sweden to maximum REE values in floodplain and stream sediment samples. The distribution maps of all REEs in stream water over Sweden are very similar. The main anomalies occur in the southern part of Sweden, where most of the outcrops of the younger felsic rocks of the Fennoscandinavian shield can be found. High concentrations of REE in the southern part of Sweden generally dominate the dispersion patterns.\nThe areas of Småland and Hälsingland are characterised by the low pH in the stream water and high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOC). Mineralised regions are generally not discernible, though weak anomalies in Lapland (heavy REEs) and along the coast of Västerbotten (Varuträsk, light REEs) may reflect the presence of pegmatite-type mineralisations."

    "text": "Multivariate statistics can be used to evaluate a large amount of data in order to identify patterns within a data set that would otherwise be overlooked (Davis, 1986). Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces a large data matrix into two smaller matrices called principal component (PC) loadings and PC scores, which are produced using Eigen analysis. One of the main advantages of PCA is that data do not need to be normally distributed (Johnson and Wichern, 2002). Eigenvalues describe the amount of variation within the original data set explained by each PC. The PC loading, and the elements of the eigenvectors, indicate the relative contribution of each element to the PC score (Stetzenbach et al., 1999). A loading of zero would indicate no relationship between the PC and the original variable (element).\nWe performed PC analysis on different media (topsoil, subsoil, stream sediment, stream water and floodplain sediment) using the data from the FOREGS database for Sweden and Italy. Plots of loadings of REEs on PC 1, 2 and 3 for topsoil data sets in Italy and Sweden are given, as an example, in Fig. 9. The complete results on number and\nname of clusters, based on plots of loadings of REEs on PC 1, 2 and 3 are summarised in Table 4, which shows loadings, eigenvalues and cumulative variance for PC 1, 2 and 3 in the two countries. In order to showwhich sample belongs to which factor, PCs score plots in topsoil, as an example, are available as electronic supplementary material for both Italy and Sweden.\nIn topsoil, PC1 and PC2 explain 84.8% and 12.1% of total variance, respectively, in the data on Italian samples, and 82.6% and 12.8% of total variance, respectively, in the data on Swedish samples. For subsoil, PC1 and PC2 explain 83.0% and 13.6% of total variance, respectively, on Italian samples, and 83.7% and 12.1% of total variance, respectively, on Swedish samples. For stream sediment, PC1 and PC2 explain 90.2% and 7.67% of total variance, respectively, on Italian samples, and 86.5% and 11.7% of total variance, respectively, on Swedish stream sediment samples. In floodplain sediment, PC1 and PC2 explain 91.6% and 5.51% of total variance, respectively, on Italian samples, and 91.7% and 6.92% of total variance, respectively, on Swedish floodplain sediment samples. Finally, for stream water, PC1 and PC2 explain 74.3% and 19.6% of total variance, respectively, on Italian samples, and 96.7% and 2.06%, respectively, on Swedish stream water samples.\nAll REE have negative loading on PC1 of data for individual samplingmedia (Table 4). The LREE have strongest loadings on PC2 for individual sampling media. For topsoil data in Italy, Ce and Lu have the strongest positive loadings on PC3, whereas Eu has the weakest negative loading on this component. For topsoil data in Sweden, Ce has the strongest positive loading on PC3, whereas Eu has the weakest negative loading on this component. For subsoil data in Italy and Sweden, Ce has the strongest positive loading on PC3, whereas Eu has the weakest negative loading on this component. For stream sediment data in Italy, Lu and Ce have the strongest loading on PC3, whereas Eu has the weakest negative loading on this component. For stream sediment data in Sweden, Ce has the strongest loading on PC3, whereas Eu has the weakest negative loading on this component. For floodplain sediment data in Italy, Lu has the strongest positive loading on PC3, whereas Dy has the weakest negative loading on this component. For floodplain sediment data in Sweden, Ce has the strongest positive loading on PC3, whereas Eu has the weakest negative loading on this component. And finally, for stream water data in Italy, Gd has the strongest positive loading on PC3, whereas Eu has the weakest negative loading on this component. For stream water data in Sweden, Ce has the strongest positive loading on PC3, whereas Gd and Pr have the weakest negative loading on this component.\nThe results on plots of loadings of REE on PC1, PC2 and PC3 (Fig. 9) are summarised in Table 5. Italian and Swedish data sets for individual sampling media show slightly different multivariate structures (Table 5).\nIn Italian topsoil, the PC1 and PC2 loadings plot shows the contrast between LREE and HREE, which is similar to the Swedish data set. The Italian PC1 and PC3 show two distinct clusters (one comprising most REE and one Eu), which may be related to the occurrence of Eu2+, the concentration of which is mainly controlled by the content of organic matter and clay minerals during the stages of weathering. Whereas, the Swedish data set shows three distinct clusters (Eu, Ce and other REEs), which may relate to the origin for each element and any other weathering or mineralisation (Sadeghi et al., 2013). The principal component results for subsoil on Italian and Swedish data sets are similar to those of topsoil, and in Italy the stream sediment results are similar to those of topsoil and subsoil.\nWhereas in Sweden, stream sediment plots of PC2 and PC3 loadings of REE show two clusters (Eu and other REE). In the Italian floodplain sediment data set, the plot of PC1 and PC2 loadings shows two clusters, whereas in Swedish samples it shows three distinct clusters (Ce, LREE, and HREE), which may be related to weathering and mineralisation.

Petrosino et al. / Journal of Geochemical Exploration 133 (2013) 176–201\nData from Sweden show that REE content in soil is strongly correlated to pegmatitic rock and/or mineralisation. A peculiar difference between the two countries is the REE enrichment in topsoil and subsoil, which is completely reversed. In Italy, maximum enrichment is recorded in topsoil, and in Sweden in subsoil. The negative ratio topsoil/subsoil, typical of Swedish soils, testifies an overall leaching of REEs content in clay minerals during pedogenesis, which is more effective in organic matter-rich clay acidic soil (as it is the case of Fennoscandia soil). Acidity in the soil of northern Europe is related both to the overall absence of limestone rocks, and to cold climate (Wilding et al., 1984).\nHowever even in those regions of Italy where the bedrock is not made-up of limestone, but of granitoid crystalline rocks, Variscan carbonate-poor detrital sediments, or alkaline volcanic rocks (see Figs. 1 and 2), and an acidic soil could be expected, the REE topsoil/subsoil ratio is opposite with respect to Sweden. The results of our study make it possible to argue that climate and growing of coniferous forest are the main factor controlling the leaching of REE in Swedish topsoil. The role of organicmatter, in fact, is crucial for themobility of REE. The soil organic matter has many negatively charged groups per unit dry weight, and a high capacity to adsorb or chelate divalent and trivalent cations (Miao et al., 2008). Podzol-like Swedish soil shows a sharp transition between the decimetre-thick humus made topmost layer and the underlying mineral soil layer. Italian soil, on the contrary, has generally a thin highly decomposed well aggregated organic matter layer with rubber fibre content. REE concentration in Italian topsoil with respect to subsoil can be related to biological effects at the interface between the mineral soil and organic matter. In young active volcanic areas, such as the Roman–Neapolitan province, the possibility of new input of REE rich glass fragments to the topmost part of the soil, mostly wind-driven, cannot be ignored.\nAnother difference emerging between the two countries is the highest percentage of soil developed on in-situ rocks in Italy. In Italy, apart from few cases, mainly located in the Alpine pediment, where the soil developed on clastic sediments from weathering and degradation of granitic or dolomitic rocks making-up the mountain chain, most soil is developed on in-situ rock basement, so there is a close relationship between REE content of parent rock and soil, reflected by the correlation between REE distribution and the geological nature of the underlying rocks. In Sweden, there is abundance of soil developed on moraine deposits, which makes it more difficult to\n200 P. Petrosino et al. / Journal of Geochemical Exploration 133 (2013) 176–201\nidentify a direct relationship between REE distribution in soil and source rocks.\nStream sediment, both in Italy and Sweden, reflects the geological setting of the river catchment basins. In Italy, there is a more complex patchwork of REE distribution in stream sediment, possibly in response to the more varied geological setting and to the still highly active erosion processes on mountain terrains, due to the “young” geotectonic evolution of the country. PCA analysis on Italian stream sediment samples pointed out the different behaviours of Lu with respect to other REEs, for which we hypothesise the possible effects of anthropic activities. In Sweden, on the contrary, the occurrence of moraine remobilised deposits and mineralised areas play a more distinctive role.\nDispersion patterns of the light REE, compared with the heavy REE, show distinct differences in the south-eastern part of Sweden. Here, the light REE are enriched where river beds have high Al and K concentrations and are clay-rich. The heavy REE do not follow this trend except in Blekinge. Both light and heavy REE are anomalous (positive) in most part of the Caledonides. In Lapland, where REE mineralisation occurs, the river beds have high REE concentrations. High REEs dominate over light REEs east of the Kiruna mining district.\nIn Italy, floodplain sediments seem to mimic the REE distribution pattern in other solid media, with the exception of some anomalies for Lu and Dy, possibly related to an external input due to alteration that enhances the REE content of the clay-rich sediments. Some accessory minerals in granite containing heavy REE, as doverite— an yttrium fluorocarbonate, and volcanic glass (Christidis, 1998) are, in fact, more prone to chemical weathering and in warm and moist climates, as it is the case of Italy, they tend to be altered and the HREE are fixed onto clay minerals in the advanced stages of chemical weathering (Bao and Zhao, 2008).\nSweden has high REE concentrations in stream water and their median values are generally higher compared with the rest of Europe (De Vos et al., 2006; Salminen et al., 2005). The main source of such enrichment in stream water is the felsic rocks of the Fennoscandian Shield, which also explains the high acidity of stream water. Owing to the abundance of particulate and colloid-sized material they tend to be enriched, especially in the light REE (Åström and Corin, 2003). Heavy REE form more stable complexes, like carbonate and fluoride, than LREE. High REE contents in the stream water in the southern part of Sweden dominate the dispersion patterns. The low pH in the streamwater and the high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOC) are characteristic in the areas of Småland and Hälsingland. Mineralised areas are generally not clearly discernible, though weak anomalies in Lapland (heavy REE) and along the coast of Västerbotten (Varuträsk, light REE) may reflect mineralisation.\nIn this regard, the opposite behaviour in terms of REE content can be explained by exogenic factors in the two countries. In Sweden, cold climate and high acidity linked to Nordic vegetation and mostly low topography, cause REE enrichment in stream water. Whereas, in Italy, streamwater is moremineralised, its pH is higher, and the zone of contribution to surface water, both in the pre-Alpine and Apennine region, are mainly made of limestone and dolomitic rocks, causing the overall\nlow REE content in stream water. In Italy anomalies occur only in Latium–Neapolitan volcanic areas and at the Vulture volcano, where themixing of streamwaterwithwater from shallowwater tables, residing in REE-rich volcanic rocks, could be the source of REE anomalous contents."

    "heading": "8. Conclusive remarks",
    "text": "Both in Italy and Sweden, solid media show a REE content inherited from the local bedrock, and surficial processes acted locally to increase or reduce these contents. Anthropogenic contribution to REE concentrations in solid media is not evident, at least at the scale of the FOREGS database, with the exception of few examples found in Italian stream water and stream sediment samples.\nUnlike Sweden, in Italy extraction of REE from alkali-granite is not economically feasible due to the narrow extent of the outcrops. Associated placer-type deposits, where REE-bearing minerals, such as bastnaesite and monazite can be concentrated along with other heavy minerals, are almost absent in Italy, mainly due to the temperate climate that prevents the extreme effects of erosion. Vice versa, our results show that in many Italian areas REE concentrations in soil and sediments is notably high, particularly in soil developed on alkali volcanic products. In these areas, embedded within pyroclastic sequences, huge volumes of fossil soil (palaeosol) are available, which formed on bedrocks and under climatic conditions similar to those of the present soil. Because of this, our results allow us to quite confidently hypothesise that the palaeosol REE content is comparable to that of present soil.\nA particular type of REE deposit, the ion-absorption type, is formed by the leaching of REE from seemingly common igneous rocks and fixing the elements onto clay in soil (Bao and Zhao, 2008). Some projects are now being carried out in southern China to attempt extraction of REE from clay minerals of the weathered crust of alkali granite (Kazanawa and Kamitani, 2006), and new desorption mechanisms are being tested (Moldoveanu and Papangelakis, 2012). This is one of the ways to cope with the pollution linked to the extraction of REE from heavy minerals, such as monazite, which involves a huge production of radioactive waste. Italian palaeosol, developed on alkaline volcanic products could be further investigated to assess the potential extraction of REE formed by ion-adsorption processes. Future research should be focused on locating new REE deposits, and to develop less pollutant exploitation methods, in response to the increase REE demand on the world market. Development of new technological applications and commercial use of REEs should coincide with increased research aimed at the protection of the environment and human health."
