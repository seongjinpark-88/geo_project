    "text": "Terrestrial volcanism occurred extensively on Brabant Island, northern Antarctic Peninsula, during the Late Quaternary (b200 ka; probably entirely Late Pleistocene). Two compositionally distinct volcanic sequences formed three large shield volcanoes. The volcanoes were constructed in association with a b150 m-thick, non-ice stream glacial cover, although it was likely to be thicker (few hundred metres) where it extended onto the continental shelf. The glacial cover on the volcanoes was probably mainly permeable snow, firn and fractured (crevassed) ice. It was wet-based, erosive and sediment-forming, indicating either a temperate or, perhaps more likely, sub-polar thermal regime, and would have been more extensive than that present today. Such a thin ice sheet would have had a low surface gradient during periods of extension across the continental shelf. This is the first direct evidence for the thickness and thermal regime of the terrestrial ice sheet in the Antarctic Peninsula during any Quaternary period prior to the last glacial maximum.

    "text": "Numerous advances have been made recently in interpreting and understanding volcanic sequences formed in association with glacial ice (e.g., Smellie and Chapman, 2002, and papers and references therein). Such glaciovolcanic sequences are a valuable but still under-used proxy for a range of palaeo-ice sheet parameters (Smellie, 2000). Brabant Island (64817VS 62820VW) is a small mountainous island situated close to the northwest coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, from\n0031-0182/$ - see front matter D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Smellie).\nwhich it is separated by a narrow channel known as Gerlache Strait (Fig. 1). Furse (1986) has described its history of discovery and exploration. The island is dominated by a north-south ridge, which rises to 2520 m at Mount Parry. The west flank of the ridge descends precipitously to the sea, giving rise to high coastal rock and ice cliffs, whereas the gradients on the east flank are gentler and terminate in a coastline dominated by ice cliffs, with fewer rocky bluffs. Beaches are rare and narrow and the rocky headlands are only partially snow-free in summer. Access is therefore unusually difficult and our knowledge of the geology of the island is based on reconnaissance studies only. The few publications are conflicting in their details. However, all agree that a thick pile of volcanic rocks with a likely\nvery young age, thought to be b3 Ma, dominates the centre and northern parts of the island (e.g., Alarcón et al., 1976; Ringe, 1991). The volcanic period also coincided with glaciation in the Antarctic Peninsula (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). Therefore, the characteristics of the volcanic sequences on Brabant Island should contain information on their eruptive setting and the terrestrial palaeoenvironment during a glacial period. Data obtained from the terrestrial Brabant Island sequences should thus complement and improve on existing palaeoenvironmental information derived from marine sediments offshore (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002).\nThe results of our study of Brabant Island are reported here. Several headlands were visited in January 2002 and examined in much greater detail than previously. They are believed to be representative of a large part of the volcanic succession on the island. From our work, which should still be regarded as at a reconnaissance level, the volcanism is now known to be Late Quaternary in age (probably entirely Late Pleistocene) and most of the volcanic sequences show evidence for interaction with coeval ice. In this paper, the Quaternary terrestrial palaeoenvironment on the island is assessed for the first time, and the former morphology, thickness and thermal regime\nof the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet in this region are interpreted."

    "heading": "2. The Antarctic Peninsula: topography, climate and ice cover",
    "text": "The Antarctic Peninsula forms a long, narrow, dissected plateau largely covered by snow and ice that merges with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet at its southern extremity. Its elevation varies from N1000 to N2000 m asl in a southerly direction. The west coast is characterised by numerous deep fjords, islands and small ice shelves whilst extensive ice shelves fringe much of the east coast. A continuous ice sheet exists in southern parts of the Antarctic Peninsula, whereas northern parts (Graham Land) are dominated by an alpine glacier system that drains the narrow central plateau in steep, fast-flowing, mainly marine tidewater glaciers. The permanent ice cover is relatively thin today (typically 300–500 m; Lythe et al., 2001).\nThe region is characterised by strong climate gradients, both in temperature and precipitation. Mean annual temperatures vary from 0 to 17 8C (Morris and Vaughan, 2003) and meteorological stations have shown about 2 8C of warming over the past few decades (Vaughan et al., 2001). The elevation of the Antarctic Peninsula is a major orographic barrier to tropospheric circulation and, although it represents just 3% of the grounded ice sheet area in Antarctica, it receives about 13% of the total mass input; precipitation is typically three to four times greater than that of other parts of Antarctica (Reynolds, 1981; Drewry and Morris, 1992; van Lipzig et al., 2004). Thus, the Antarctic Peninsula can be described as a small-catchment,\nsmall-reservoir, high-throughput fully glacial regime (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). Because of these characteristics and its relatively northerly latitude, the behaviour of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet is particularly sensitive to climate change (Pudsey et al., 1994; Knapp et al., 1996). It may also react differently to other parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, but its history and physical characteristics are poorly documented.\nBecause of its small size, the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet has been considered unimportant in global terms (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). However, it supports 120000 km2 of grounded ice, of which 45000 km2 are below 200 m asl (DG Vaughan, personal communication, 2004). Observations of rapid changes of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet include: ice shelf decay and disintegration (Vaughan and Doake, 1996; Cooper, 1997; Lucchitta and Rosanova, 1998; Skvarca et al., 1998); reduction of permanent snow cover, ice thickness and retreating glaciers (Splettstoesser, 1992; Morris and Mulvaney, 1995; Fox and Cooper, 1998); and accelerated glacier flow (Rott et al., 2002; De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003). With measured temperatures rising rapidly, high rates of precipitation as snowfall and rapidly flowing glaciers, its potential contribution to sea level could be substantial and might occur rapidly. Complete melting would result in a sea level rise of about 30 cm (Peter Fretwell, personal communication, 2005).\nBrabant Island itself receives amongst the highest amounts of precipitation in Antarctica. van Lipzig et al. (2004) estimated mean annual precipitation minus sublimation to be about 2 m (water-equivalent), but N12 m of snowfall in 9 months was recorded in 1984 by Oakley (in Furse, 1986). The island is covered by a\nninsula is in the background and is separated from Brabant Island by\nsmall ice cap or highland ice field, which blankets the central ridge and from which numerous outlet valley glaciers and cirque glaciers descend in all directions to the sea and terminate as tidewater glaciers (Fig. 2). Ice thicknesses for valley glaciers on the island today may reach 100–150 m or more but are typically much thinner on the steep mountain flanks and ridges (30– 50 m). The glacial ice is free of debris, tills are rare and restricted, and sediment plumes at glacier outlets (signifying presence of basal glacial meltwater) are very uncommon. Moreover, most water entering glaciers on Brabant Island is probably meteoric, advecting through crevasses and moulins to the glacier bed, rather than formed by basal melting (Griffiths and Anderson, 1989). These observations suggest a broadly polar thermal regime. However, the presence of significant thicknesses of sediments in adjacent fjords was interpreted to indicate a sub-polar (i.e., polythermal) regime, with the sediment entering the fjords below sea level at tidewater glacier termini (Griffiths and Anderson, 1989). Data of Martin and Peel (1978) also suggest that true polar glaciers are unlikely to be present on the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula north of 728S. An expanded and thicker Pleistocene ice cover in the region are suggested by evidence of former ice streams in Gerlache Strait and on the continental shelf west of Brabant Island (Pudsey et al., 1994; Bentley and Anderson, 1998; Canals et al., 2000). However, the surface morphology of the Pleistocene ice sheet in northern Antarctic Peninsula—i.e., as one giant or several smaller ice domes—is unknown and currently not constrained."

    "text": "The oldest rocks exposed on Brabant Island are Cretaceous or older, hydrothermally altered tuffs, volcanic breccias and conglomerates intruded by Early Tertiary basaltic dykes, which are restricted to the southern half of the island (Alarcón et al., 1976; Ringe, 1991). Plutonic rocks also crop out widely and two have Miocene ages (24.0F0.7 and 11.9–8.9F0.5 Ma, by K–Ar; Ringe, 1991). These outcrops are unconformably overlain by unaltered Late Cenozoic volcanic sequences, with published K–Ar ages of 3.07F0.1 Ma and b100 ka (Ringe, 1991). Alarcón et al. (1976) suggested a bpre-glacialQ origin for one sequence, and a reconnaissance palynological study of the same sequence apparently yielded three gymnosperm genera (Araucariacites, Podocarpidites and Microcachrydites)\nand a single angiosperm species (Milfordia homeopunctata; Alfaro and Collao, 1985). If confirmed, their presence in such young rocks would have significance for atmospheric patterns of spores dispersal and/or persistence of plant communities in Antarctica. Conversely, Ringe (1991) regarded the unit as shallow marine or possibly subglacial, although his reasons were not given."

    "text": "Compositionally, there is evidence for two young volcanic sequences: an older sequence of ne-normative, sodic alkaline basalts (bsequence 1Q) and a younger hyand Q-normative, mainly basaltic sequence (bsequence 2Q) with broadly bsubduction-relatedQ characteristics resembling those seen in marginal basin lavas in Bransfield Strait to the north (Ringe, 1991; Keller et al., 2002; unpublished geochemical data of JLS). Sequence 2 also includes intermediate lavas (andesites). Because the distribution of the two sequences is not yet well known, they are not assigned stratigraphical names. At Claude Point, sequence 1 is overlain by sequence 2 across a prominent undulating angular unconformity (Fig. 3). Bedding at each of the visited localities dips radially away at moderate angles (c. 108) from a possible central source somewhere between Pasteur Peninsula and Mount Rokitansky, suggesting that the outcrops were once connected within a single large shield-like volcanic edifice situated in the north of the island (Fig. 4). The gently north- and south-dipping bedding (viewed from the west) in the higher central mountain range outcrops was probably formed in a separate volcanic shield, with a vent situated between Mount Parry and Harvey Heights. The strata resemble inaccessible volcanic units exposed at Mount Bulcke in the southernmost part of the island. However, the Mount Bulcke outcrop dips gently northward and is a likely outlier of another extensive thick volcanic succession exposed in the Osterreith Range of northern Anvers Island, which represents a third eruptive centre.\nEach of the volcanic centres is similarly heavily glaciated and they are the youngest volcanic units on both islands. The two main Brabant Island centres may be 1000–1500 m thick, with a reconstructed original combined volume of about 750 km3. The Osterreith Range succession exceeds 1200 m but less of the original volcano is preserved on Anvers Island and its volume is uncertain. Two localities in this range were visited by Hooper (1962), and they comprise interbedded intermediate lavas with red weathered surfaces, and tuffs deposited unconformably in deep steep-sided valleys cut in\nplutonic intrusions. Some of the material collected by Hooper (1962) strongly resembles the diamicts obtained during this investigation on Brabant Island. Scarce fragments of intermediate lavas similar to those on Anvers Island are also present in sequence 2 at Driencourt Point, and in situ bandesitesQ occur at Mount Parry (Ringe, 1991). Only the northern (Pasteur Peninsula) centre was sampled in our study, but it is suggested from the similar-looking strata, similar lithologies and compositions, and broadly comparable erosional state of the edifices, that all three centres were probably formed during the same eruptive period. The presence of an angular unconformity separating sequences 1 and 2 in the Pasteur Peninsula centre may not indicate a long time interval. Similar unconformities are common throughout the volcanic sequences on Brabant Island and relate to episodes of glacial erosion coeval with eruption (see later). Sequence 2 is apparently more widespread than sequence 1. It comprises most of the Pasteur Peninsula centre and may comprise most or all of the Mount Parry and Anvers Island centres.\nTable 1 Results of 40Ar / 39Ar isotopic dating on lavas from Brabant Island\nSample Locality Analy\nSequence 2: DJ.1701.3 Metchnikoff Point Platea DJ.1701.3 Metchnikoff Point Isoch DJ.1701.4 Metchnikoff Point Platea DJ.1704.1 Driencourt Point Platea BR.200.23 Claude Point, upper sequence Platea BR.200.23 Claude Point, upper sequence Isoch\nSequence 1: DJ.1702.2 bCairn pointQ, lower sequence Platea DJ.1703.4 #1 bAstrolabe pointQ Platea DJ.1703.4 #2 bAstrolabe pointQ Platea BR.200.20 Claude Point, lower sequence Isoch\nItalicised names are informal; ages given in bold are most reliable; italicised isochron ages are preferred over plateau ages for samples DJ.1701.3 and D *n =number of steps used in weighted mean age calculations; **weighted me variance; weighted mean errors (F2j) calculated using the method of ( Decay constants and isotopic abundances after Steiger and Jäger (1977).\nAnalytical methods: Sample preparation and irradiation Groundmass concentrates were prepared using standard separation techniqu Separate was loaded into a machined Al disc and irradiated for 7 h in Neutron flux monitor Fish Canyon Tuff sanidine (FC-1).

As expected for flat age spectra with a range of radiogenic yields, the data form well correlated linear arrays on isochron plots, which yield 40Ar / 36Ar intercepts near the atmospheric ratio (295.5) and intercept ages that agree within error with the weighted-mean ages. The two samples from Claude Point appear to be contaminated by excess argon. They yielded saddle-shaped spectra and had low radiogenic yields (b8%). However, a moderately well-defined isochron for one of the samples (BR.200.20) suggests an eruption age of 0.099F0.067 Ma, and it is included in Table 1. This is indistinguishable from the age of the dated sample from bAstrolabe PointQ (0.08F0.08 Ma), situated only 2 km from Claude Point and, from the field relations, demonstrably part of the same sequence."

    "text": "Five samples were analysed. None yielded flat age spectra and one failed similar to the failed samples from sequence 1. All four of the remaining samples have low-precision individual steps and low to very low radiogenic yields. For those samples, the age spectra appear relatively flat. However, this is largely a superficial consequence of the very poor precision. The calculated weighted-mean ages are 0.41F0.33, 0.61F0.98, 0.13F0.06 and 0.18F0.09 Ma. Isochrons are very poorly defined for the first two of these samples, with similar or even lower 2r precision. The other two yielded inverse isochron ages of 0.02F0.02 and 0.10F0.04 Ma, respectively, and these are our preferred estimates for the eruption ages of those two samples, although both ages should be regarded as maxima. All but one of the ages are effectively close to zero age. The anomalously low yields suggest the presence of considerable hydrated glass, although this is not evident in thin sections of the rocks. The presence of abundant alteration minerals such as zeolite or clay, is also unlikely; these minerals are absent except for traces of smectitic clay after olivine in one sample.\nIn summary, sequence 1 is moderately well dated with the likeliest eruption ages ranging between about 200 and 80 ka (Late Pleistocene). 2rprecision is c. 0.08 Ma and the ages are interpreted as the most precise and reliable obtained in this study. Sequence 2 is poorly dated so far and mostly yielded much younger (essentially bnear-zeroQ) imprecise ages that are consistent with their stratigraphical position, overlying sequence 1. However, a consequence of bzero ageQ for those strata should be the preservation of primary volcanic landforms, which is not the case. A latest Pleistocene or possibly Holocene age (b140 ka, probably mainly b40 ka) for sequence 2 is probably the best that can be inferred from the present data. All of the samples analysed from both sequences are extremely fresh and it seems unlikely that further 40Ar / 39Ar dating will resolve the ages of these rocks. Finally, the samples that proved undatable yielded total gas ages of 2.2 and 3.3 Ma, i.e., much older than the dated samples with undisturbed spectra. This suggests that the K–Ar age of 3.1 Ma for the summit sequence at Mount Parry published by Ringe (1991), without analytical details, is similarly unreliable."

    "text": "The older, lava-dominated volcanic sequence was examined at bAstrolabe PointQ, bCairn PointQ and Claude Point (Fig. 1). Other outcrops (undated) may include poorly described north-dipping lavas and palagonitised vitric tuffs above 200 m asl on Davis Island, lava(s) on a tiny islet immediately south of Harry Island, and an outcrop on Hunt Island (off the east coast of Brabant Island, at 64820VS 62809VW; cf. González-Ferrán and Katsui, 1970; Bell, 1984). The lavas at those outcrops are fresh alkali basalts similar to lavas in sequence 1.\nThe most spectacular section on Brabant Island occurs at Claude Point, where a thickness exceeding 150 m is exposed (base below sea level; Fig. 3). There and at bAstrolabe PointQ nearby, the outcrops consist of grey coarsely crystalline lavas, forming lobes with measured thicknesses varying from 2 to N40 m and extending several tens of metres laterally. The lobes are mainly structureless but the thickest show basal coarse columnar joints 1.5 to 2 m in diameter. They change up into prominent then poorly defined platy sheeting joints that fade out or become wider-spaced above. A thinner zone of smaller (c. 40 cm diameter) columns is com-\nmonly present at the top. Flow tops are thin, scoriaceous and often strongly oxidised, although boles are not present. Thick flows are doleritic, with diffuse schlieren-like patches composed of cm-sized, bladed decussate feldspar and prismatic pyroxene. The lavas are poorly and often coarsely vesicular, with vesicles either arranged in bed-parallel trails, confined mainly to the upper or lower few decimetres or dispersed evenly\nFig. 5. Schematic vertical profile sections through volcanic sequences of the and Metchnikoff points are formed entirely of sequence 2 strata. The upper capping the sequence at Metchnikoff Point and the two may be correlated.\nthroughout. Other than flow-top autobreccias, the only volcaniclastic rocks seen consist of a 6 m bed of dark grey coarse tuff with scoria layers near the base of the Claude Point sequence.\nAt bCairn PointQ, the sequence starts with a khaki brown-coloured gravelly-blocky volcaniclastic breccia or diamict up to 15 m thick (Figs. 5 and 6). The breccia contains up to 4% diorite pebbles, cobbles and blocks\nPasteur Peninsula centre, illustrating the lithofacies present. Driencourt most lava unit at bCairn PointQ is compositionally strikingly like that\n(to 50 cm), some with planar split faces that contrast with their other abraded surfaces, together with less common pink granitoids and green altered lavas. Platy clasts are roughly bed-parallel. The coarser clast population (N0.5 cm) mainly consists of subangular to angular lithic lava lapilli and blocks whilst finer clasts are dominantly angular grey and black moderately vesicular monomict(?) basalt glass and tachylite. Silty– sandy matrix is scarce but it varies patchily to about 25%, and is dominated by palagonite-altered glass. Zeolite cement is ubiquitous. A weak, crude, wavy planar stratification is present (Fig. 6), sometimes as\ncoarse sandstone lenses, but it is only continuous over a few metres and its orientation may be very irregular. The basal volcaniclastic breccia occupies a steep-sided (N258) valley carved in meladiorite, the surface of which is locally polished and striated.\nThe succeeding lava flow is at least 130 m thick and has a thin maroon-coloured vesicular autobreccia top. The lava extends for at least several hundred metres along the coast, and is overlain to the east by a 50 mthick deposit of maroon scoria fall. The lava is fine grained, even flinty in part, and is pervasively sheetjointed, the joints forming a large-scale cylindrical\npattern extending the full flow thickness. At the base of the lava, the hexagonal ends of numerous small-diameter prismatic joints are exposed on a subvertical lava surface. A second lava also overlies the basal lava. It is 12 m thick, similar in lithology and jointing to the basal flow but also contains a prominent lava tube and a coarse basal colonnade in places. It is overlain by lavas of sequence 2."

    "text": "The characteristic coarse grain size, thick columnar cooling joints and oxidised autobreccias in lavas of sequence 1 at Claude Point and Astrolabe Point indicate effusion and slow conductive cooling in a subaerial setting (cf. Long and Wood, 1986; DeGraff et al., 1989; DeGraff and Aydin, 1993). In addition, the succession of jointing structures and vesicle zones, lobe-like form and sharp to gradational contacts between lobes are characteristic of subaerially emplaced and inflated pahoehoe lavas (e.g., Thordarson and Self, 1998). Apart from the presence of vitric tuffs at Davis Island and bCairn PointQ (described below), which signifies coeval explosive phreatomagmatic eruption(s), outcrops generally lack evidence of effects of rapid cooling caused by interaction with water, snow or ice (cf. Lescinsky and Fink, 2000; Mee et al., in press). However, the bCairn PointQ succession begins with a volcaniclastic deposit with stratification and abraded polymict clasts indicating transport and deposition by water. The dominant fragments are variably vesicular glass and tachylite, and resemble those created in explosive phreatomagmatic eruptions, indicating abundant water involved in the eruption prior to lava effusion. The deposit rests on a polished and striated surface with an undoubted glacial origin, and features of the overlying lava (columnar joints perpendicular to a sub-vertical lava surface, and fine to flinty grain size) are consistent with rapid chilling in an icecontact setting (cf. Lescinsky and Sisson, 1998; Lescinsky and Fink, 2000). The thin oxidised autobreccia surface to the lava indicates that its upper surface cooled subaerially. However, the fine grain size in such a thick lava, and presence of a widespread underlying coeval water-lain sedimentary layer, suggest that the lava was not simply pooled and chilled locally against an ice dam in an otherwise entirely subaerial environment (cf. Lescinsky and Sisson, 1998). The thick succeeding deposit of oxidised scoria fall(?) is also indicative of subaerial conditions. It is a ventproximal deposit, probably erupted within a few km of bCairn PointQ from a minor satellite centre on the main volcanic shield.\nThe association of glacial unconformity, water-lain vitric tuffs and pooled water-cooled sheet lava flow strongly resembles those of subglacial sheet-like volcanic sequences emplaced within thin glaciers (Smellie et al., 1993; Loughlin, 2002). Thin glaciers (formed mainly of snow, firn and fractured ice; Smellie et al., 1993) are permeable to water flow and the combined thickness of the lava and sediment layer provide a guide to the approximate thickness of the associated glacier (i.e., V130–140 m). The evidence for glacial erosion and sediment deposition from water suggests a wet-based glacier and either a temperate or sub-polar thermal regime. A temperate thermal regime may be indicated from the substantial thickness (15 m) of water-lain sediments present at bCairn PointQ, since it is reasonable to presume that erosion, meltwater abundance and sediment production are probably less important beneath sub-polar glaciers (personal communication from MJ Hambrey, 2004), but the evidence may not be diagnostic."

    "heading": "5.2. Sequence 2",
    "text": "The upper, younger sequence 2 apparently dominates the Pasteur Peninsula centre. Compared with sequence 1, which is entirely basaltic, sequence 2 contains evolved lavas (andesites) and the presence of andesites in the Mount Parry and Anvers Island centres suggests that strata similar to sequence 2 may also be important or dominant in those two edifices. Because of their comparatively high elevation (above 400 m asl), unvisited north-dipping outcrops of volcanic strata on Liège Island (blavas and palagonitised tuffsQ; Bell, 1984) may also belong to sequence 2. Sequence 2 outcrops in the Pasteur Peninsula centre are well exposed at Driencourt Point, Metchnikoff Point, bCairn PointQ and in the upper part of Claude Point (Fig. 1). There are no published details of the outcrops examined and they are described separately below.\nAbout 300 m of section is exposed at Driencourt Point, consisting of at least three volcanic units (Fig. 5). The basal unit (unit A) is at least 75 m thick (base below sea level). It begins with 3 m of indurated (zeolite cemented) gravelly breccio-conglomerate and sandstone, with cobble-rich lenses and layers 10–25 cm thick extending over 20 m laterally. Stratification is faint, crude and planar, and the medium-coarse-grained sandstone interbeds are scarce and thin, with faint planar laminations. The sedimentary rocks are well sorted, dominated by angular and (fewer) abraded, palagonite-altered, polymict basaltic glass and tachylite, and minor fragments of fine-grained, crystalline basalt\nand intermediate (probably andesite) lava. The remainder of the unit consists of non-vesicular, relatively coarse-grained basalt lava, and lithic and hyaloclastite breccias derived from the lava. Basally, the lava has crude steeply-plunging columnar prisms 30–40 cm in diameter (possible colonnade), which transform up into finer entablature or irregular blocky jointing. The lava base has a 3 mm-thick glassy surface that rests directly on the sedimentary rocks, into which it has locally sunk a few dm, or else is transformed into hyaloclastite breccia that penetrates upward about 3 m. The hyalo-\nclastite breccias are essentially fines-free but contain a few small pockets of fine sand matrix, and are cemented by chalcedony(?). About 10 cm of jigsaw breccia separates the hyaloclastite breccia from massive lava. Lithic breccia occurs as large diffuse patches dispersed within the lava. The patches are chaotic, poorly sorted and coarse (clasts 1 mm to 80 cm), locally with up to 50% very fine sand–silt matrix, which is pervasively palagonite altered.\nUnit B is at least 60 m thick. It overlies unit A across a sharp undulating unconformity with small-scale relief\nn in Fig. 3). About 25 m of yellow-coloured, stratified water-lain vitric\nlikely cross stratification. The lava is prominently columnar jointed, rlain by a much thicker zone of chaotic columns (entablature). Such an . The underlying unconformity on subaerial lavas of sequence 1 is not\nof several dm. The unconformity shows faint striations and a poor bpolishQ. It is succeeded by 8 m of khaki brown, indurated diamict, which is massive but shows a weak, broadly bed-parallel parting fissility. The diamict is rich in silt matrix (at least 50–60%) and contains dispersed coarse sand and granules, and scattered angular cobbles and blocks up to 60 cm. Some of the blocks are faceted and show striations. The clasts include angular polymict non-vesicular crystalline basalt, uncommon basalt glass, oxidised lava, and a few fresh brown hornblende crystals. The diamict is overlain across an uneven erosional surface by 5 m of massive, khaki-orange monomict breccia. The breccia, which is essentially fines-free, is mainly formed of palagonitised, non-vesicular, angular to rarely abraded, blocky basalt glass (b1 cm; 70%), lithic lava blocks V10 cm (5%), and moderately vesicular glassy basalt and tachylite (25%). About 50 m of non-vesicular basalt lava overlies the massive breccia. The contact is sharp and uneven. The basalt is fine grained and has pervasive hackly joints and small patches of chalcedony-cemented breccia in the basal 2 m. Crude columnar joints up to 40 cm in diameter, with very variable orientations, are developed above 11 m.\nUnit C was inaccessible at the time of visit. It is about 150 m thick and has an undulating sharply unconformable base that is overlain by an 8–10 m thick sheet-like sedimentary unit, followed by two thin sheet lavas (V6 m thick each). The remainder of the section is a chaotic sequence of thin lava lobes and sheets separated by khaki-orange breccia. Large fallen blocks of unit 3 indicate that the breccias are formed of hyalo-\nclastite, some of which contain very thinly planar laminated silica. Some of the lavas have oxidised scoriaceous flow tops.\nStrata of sequence 2 at Claude Point are similar in appearance to those at Driencourt Point, but only the western tip of the section is accessible. The succession contains at least two spectacular erosional surfaces that undulate on a large scale (wavelength a few hundred m) and have a relief of 20–30 m (Fig. 2). The accessible strata are about 50 m thick and comprise about 25 m of buff-coloured crudely stratified tuffs with dark grey lava lapilli overlain by a similar thickness of fresh black andesite lava (Figs. 7 and 8). The stratification is predominantly planar but includes some cross stratification. The lava is conspicuously columnar jointed throughout, with a clear division into a thin basal colonnade and a much thicker overlying entablature.\nSequence 1 at bCairn PointQ is overlain by two lava flows of sequence 2 (Fig. 5). The lower lava (N89 m thick) is fine grained, with an unoxidised glassy basal autobreccia several metres thick (lava top unexposed), and shows well developed columnar jointing that consists of thin basal colonnade and much thicker entablature. The topmost lava is N30 m thick, comprising at least 3 crystalline lava lobes individually 6 m thick separated by red oxidised flow rubble. There are no interbedded volcaniclastic rocks. The section is spectacularly draped by khaki-orange, planar stratified, gravelly breccio-conglomerate possibly 10 or 15 m thick, which is similar to the basal unit in underlying sequence 1 and is smeared onto slopes that are sub-\nilli tuffs at Claude Point.\nvertical in places. The deposit is poorly sorted, with 50–60% fine and very fine sand matrix, dominated by abraded clasts of non-vesicular basalt glass and minor tachylite and crystalline lavas.\nThe rocky foreshore exposures at Metchnikoff Point are formed of Miocene diorite (c. 10 Ma; Ringe, 1991). Its upper surface is obscured but it is overlain unconformably by about 60 m of friable coarse hyaloclastiteand lithic breccia (Fig. 5). It is generally massive-looking in strike sections but elsewhere shows a coarse crude SW-dipping (20–358) stratification, which is much better seen in the unvisited first headland 1 km to the south (Fig. 9), and contains dispersed bed-parallel, heavily jointed lava lobes 30 cm to 10 m in length and up to 0.75 m thick. Some stratification is defined by thin coarse sandy or fine gravelly lenses extending a few metres, which may show planar dipping stratification. The upper parts of the breccia, in particular, are dominated by coarser lava clasts a few metres across or by numerous blocky-jointed, pillowed and lensoid lava lobes. The breccia contains a variable proportion of vesicular glassy clasts, and a 2 m-thick stratified unit of vesicular coarse and fine glassy scoria with fluidal shapes, many broken, and abundant dm-size bombs is present at the top of the volcaniclastic section. The bombs show a weak flattening parallel to bedding. A 35 cm-thick stratum of stratified fine scoria underlies the bomb-rich unit, and contains multiple thin reverse graded and normal graded lenses with faint planar laminations. It is fines-poor, formed of poorly to moderately vesicular glassy scoria and rare tachylite lapilli with angular and fluidal surfaces set in fine gravel matrix.\nSome 40 m of sub-horizontal compound lava succeeds the hyaloclastite breccia across a planar horizontal surface at a local elevation of c. 70 m asl (Fig. 9).\nEach lava lobe is purple-grey, vesicular, and has a thin (few dm) maroon-coloured coarsely vesicular top. Lobe thicknesses increase upwards irregularly from 1–2 m in the basal 25 m, through prominently sheet-jointed lobes 2–6 m thick, to 15–20 m above. In places, lava lobes extend short distances down into the underlying hyaloclastite bedding. The composition of the lava is strikingly similar to that which caps the sequence observed at bCairn PointQ. At the northeast end of Metchnikoff Point, the breccias are overlain sharply along a north-northeast-dipping unconformity by 40–60 cm of indurated diamict. The diamict is khaki brown, with polymict basaltic clasts up to boulder size set in up to 40% of brown silt matrix with a gently inclined platy jointing dipping slightly steeper than the basal surface. Clasts are mainly poorly or non-vesicular basaltic glass, extensively palagonitized, but include tachylite and crystalline basalt. They are typically angular but some are sub-rounded and show facetting and faint striations. A few elongate clasts are orientated approximately parallel to the dipping joints."

    "text": "The sequence 2 outcrops at Driencourt Point and bCairn PointQ show substantial evidence for water chilling, mainly as distinctive lava joint patterns (e.g., suppression of colonnade relative to entablature; e.g., Long and Wood, 1986) but also association with either water-lain volcaniclastic beds derived from phreatomagmatic eruptions (cf. sequence 1, above), or glacially modified unconformities and massive diamict with facetted and striated clasts (i.e., probably tillites). The Driencourt Point sheet lava in unit 1 also shows additional water-cooling features such as basal hyaloclastite and associated jigsaw breccia, and irreg-\nbreccias. Together the outcrop comprises a section through a lava-fed\nexposed in the foreground. The volcanic section is about 110 m high.\nular patches of sand-matrixed lithic breccia; the latter resemble the products of intimate explosive interaction between lava, water and water-saturated sediments trapped and overridden by lava (i.e., the bulk interaction explosivity of Kokelaar, 1986; cf. Smellie et al., 1998). Together, these features indicate eruptions in a water-rich, likely glacial environment and, like sequence 1, there is a strong similarity with volcanic sheet-like sequences emplaced in association with a thin ice cover. There is no evidence at either of these localities for effusion into ponded meltwater, suggesting that the associated glacier was quite thin and permeable (cf. Smellie and Skilling, 1994; Smellie, 2000). Minimum thicknesses of coeval ice are N60 to N89 m based on the thickness of the individual erupted units. They are poorly constrained since the units either lack a cogenetic subaerial caprock (Driencourt Point) or relationships with overlying rocks are unexposed (bCairn PointQ), but ice thicknesses are theoretically unlikely to exceed 150 m (Smellie, 2000, 2001). A glacial eruptive environment is consistent with the presence of several spectacular, large-scale, undulating erosional unconformities of likely glacial origin, extending several kilometres at least and with relief of a few tens of metres, which separate volcanic units at Claude Point (Fig. 3). By contrast, sequences at both localities pass up into units of subaerially emplaced thin lava lobes and flows generally lacking evidence for significant water chilling. However, the presence of thin interbeds of hyaloclastite in unit C at Driencourt Point suggests minor interaction with water, probably by melting a thin cover of either snow or firn (cf. snow-contact features described by Mee et al., in press).\nBy contrast, and uniquely for Brabant Island so far, the steep-dipping hyaloclastite and lithic breccias and sub-horizontal compound lavas at Metchnikoff Point together comprise a classical lava-fed delta, with a prominent subaerial–subaqueous transition (passage zone or bfossil water levelQ; Jones, 1969; Fig. 9) at 70 m asl. Lava-fed deltas are constructed when subaerial lava flows enter ponded water, whether the sea, lake or a glacial lake, with a depth corresponding to the difference in elevation between the base of the hyaloclastite breccias and the passage zone (e.g., Smellie, 2000, 2001; Skilling, 2002). In a glacial lake setting, the presence of impermeable ice is required since a lake cannot form in a cover composed of (permeable) snow, firn or fractured ice. However, the presence and local abundance of scoria dispersed within the hyaloclastite sequence, and as beds of unoxi-\ndised scoria and bombs, are unusual for a lava-fed delta. The scoria are glassy, with only minor tachylite. Their low vesicularity and the common occurrence of broken droplet shapes suggest an alternating influence of weakly explosive activity caused by lava overriding a wet substrate causing the water to flash to steam (to yield the fluidal shapes), and thermal shock and fracturing during quenching (yielding abundant sideromelane and broken droplet shapes, presumably after the particles fell into water and tumbled down the delta foresets). They are possibly products of local rootless cones (Fagents et al., 2002) or coeval subaerial littoral cones at the delta front, as exemplified by littoral cones associated with lava-fed deltas during eruptions on Hawaii (Jurado-Chichay et al., 1996). The low vesicularity and abundant fluidal shapes of particles are consistent with a very low water :melt mass ratio and a low transfer efficiency of thermal to mechanical (explosive) energy (Fagents et al., 2002). The activity could have been quite persistent as the coarse permeable nature of the hyaloclastite breccias would enable water to repeatedly and rapidly recharge the delta, and to interact with magma at the passage zone elevation. The scoria beds close to the passage zone were probably emplaced as a series of mass flows (bcohesionless debris flowsQ) that travelled short distances down the steep delta front.\nThe remarkable compositional similarity of the lava caprock at Metchnikoff Point with the uppermost lava at bCairn PointQ suggests that the two lavas were originally a continuous flow. As at bCairn PointQ, the volcanic rocks at Metchnikoff Point were extensively eroded prior to becoming overlain by thin massive diamict whose induration, fissile jointing, crude clast orientation and clast content suggest that it is a locally derived terrigenous basal tillite (lodgement?). The diamict occupies the same stratigraphical position and has similar clast types (especially the abundant non-vesicular basalt glass) as the epiclastic unit at bCairn PointQ. The occurrence of the latter smeared onto very steep rock faces also suggests confinement by ice during deposition and the two deposits may be coeval lithofacies related to the same glacial event. However, the stratification and abraded clasts in the bCairn PointQ unit suggest water transport and deposition, and a possible (glacio-)fluvial origin. The deposit also contains abundant fresh basalt glass and is laterally continuous over a few hundred metres, suggesting that the sediments may have been emplaced in a widespread eruption-related subglacial flood, which lifted the associated ice cover (i.e., a jökulhlaup; e.g., Björnsson, 2003)."

    "text": "Our principal source of information on Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet history is almost exclusively derived from offshore seismic and drilling studies on the shelf and rise (e.g., Larter and Cunningham, 1993; Pudsey et al., 1994; Larter and Vanneste, 1995; Canals et al., 2000; Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). Terrestrial studies are far less common (Smellie et al., 1993; Pirrie et al., 1997; Bentley and Anderson, 1998; Dingle and Lavelle, 1998; Ingólfsson et al., 1998; Troedson and Riding, 2002; Troedson and Smellie, 2002; Hambrey and Smellie, in press). Core recovery and dating of the coarse proximal (shelf) marine sediments are extremely poor but are significantly better for the finer-grained, more distal continental rise sediments (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). The ice sheet covering the shelf region may have had a low profile and been relatively thin (b700 m) at last glacial maximum (LGM), based on marine sediment studies linked to theoretical considerations (e.g., Pudsey et al., 1994), but the actual thickness and configuration of the source ice sheet in the Antarctic Peninsula remain poorly constrained (cf. Bentley and Anderson, 1998; Canals et al., 2000). Basal slip conditions, a function of ice thermal regime, dictate ice sheet profile. It may range from low profile in ice streams to high profile elsewhere. It is generally believed that the coarse shelf sediments were deposited directly from fast-moving ice streams, which migrated north and south on the shelf during periods of glacial maxima. Therefore the record contained in those sediments will only reflect ice stream processes and may not be representative of areas not traversed by ice streams, such as the terrestrial source regions. Moreover, much of the information on ice sheet reconstructions for the Antarctic Peninsula region is strongly biased to the LGM (e.g., Pope and Anderson, 1992; Pudsey et al., 1994; Bentley and Anderson, 1998). Assessing the state of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet at other times, compared to other parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, would inform the debate on ice mass responses to changes in forcing, such as atmospheric temperatures and sea level, and the synchroneity or otherwise of those changes across Antarctica, a debate that is poorly constrained from glaciological modelling studies (Bentley and Anderson, 1998).\nStudies of terrestrial volcanic outcrops are capable of preserving critical parameters of associated ice sheets\nand in favourable circumstances they may enable us to place robust limits on ice sheet thickness, surface morphology and gradient, and thermal regime in the source areas, for isotopically dated periods (Smellie, 2000; Smellie and Chapman, 2002, and papers therein). However, except fortuitously, they do not constrain periods of ice sheet maxima or minima and, under specific conditions (upwelling mantle; lithostatically pressurebalanced crustal magma chambers), there may be a bias toward eruptions occurring very soon after ice sheet thinning commences (e.g., within 1 ka: Jull and McKenzie, 1996; McLennan et al., 2002; Sigvaldason, 2002). Note that eruptions will occur interspersed throughout glacial and interglacial periods; it is simply that a greater frequency of eruptions is likely to occur during periods of rapid glacial thinning. By contrast, conventional alternative methods based primarily on elevational extent of former ice sheet surfaces (erosional trimlines and moraines) and former flow direction indicators (striations and roche moutonées) typically do not survive more than one glaciation as morphological features are erased during the youngest glacial event to pass through a region. Such features are also dependent on a suitable bedrock lithology and glacial thermal regime that can leave a distinctive geomorphological signature (e.g., trimlines are not formed by polar ice; cf. Cuffey et al., 2000; Waller, 2001). They are also not free of ambiguous interpretation and are often extremely hard to date (Bentley and Anderson, 1998). The history preserved in volcanic sequences on Brabant Island is the most detailed record of the Quaternary terrestrial palaeoenvironment from the Antarctic Peninsula obtained so far. It is a non-ice stream, ice-contact terrestrial record of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet, and is more proximal to source than any other published regional information.\nKnown outcrops of sequence 1 are fewer and thinner than those of sequence 2. Those at Claude Point and bAstrolabe PointQ are entirely composed of subaerial basalt lava, whereas sequence 1 strata at bCairn PointQ show ice-contact features, are associated with an underlying glacial surface and glacial sediments, and were clearly emplaced in a glacial environment. Because the bases of the subaerial sequences are not exposed, the environmental conditions during eruption of those outcrops are unknown. It may be important that the sequence 1 basal lava at bCairn PointQ was confined by ice during emplacement whilst its upper surface cooled subaerially (and it was succeeded by a relatively thick pile of likely strombolian fall, also emplaced subaerially). Thus, effusion of the bCairn PointQ lava was within a relatively thin glacier, which melted through\ncompletely. If effusion had continued, subaerial lavas like those at Claude Point and bAstrolabe PointQ would have formed. The character of the basal sediments at Claude Point suggest that the glacier was also permeable. The possible glacier thickness suggested (about 130–140 m) is close to the theoretical maximum for eruptions in this setting (150 m), which was based on maximum possible thicknesses of snow, firn and fractured ice in a glacier (Smellie, 2000, 2001). Thicknesses of 130–140 m are more likely associated with a (cold) sub-polar glacier, since the cumulative thickness of snow and firn in temperate glaciers is typically only a few tens of metres and may be as little as 10–15 m (Paterson, 1994), thus substantially reducing the total thickness of any permeable upper layer in a glacier.\nA similar emplacement history is possible for the Claude Point and bAstrolabe PointQ outcrops, but only the subaerial section is currently exposed. Since the subaerial lavas at those localities extend to below present datum, they were either emplaced during a period of lower sea level (consistent with eruption during a glacial period) or post-eruptive subsidence of the volcanic pile has occurred. The present-day ice cover is generally thin (30–50 m away from valleys), implying that the extent of the ice cover at the time of eruptions was significantly greater than today. A more extensive and thicker ice cover is consistent with the Late Pleistocene age for the volcanism determined radioisotopically, and a coeval lower sea level.\nSequence 2 outcrops are widespread and thick. They probably dominate each of the three original shield volcanoes. Although poorly dated, they crop out stratigraphically and unconformably above sequence 1. An age b140 ka is all that can be inferred from the 40Ar / 39Ar data and a Holocene age (b10 ka) cannot be precluded. However, the outcrops on Brabant Island show unequivocal evidence for eruptions in association with a thin permeable ice cover, probably mainly composed of snow, firn and/or fractured iceN60–90 m thick (probably b150 m). As in sequence 1, eruptions were initially phreatomagmatic, reflecting an abundance of meltwater early in each eruptive episode and presumably caused by melting through ice above the vent (which reformed between eruptions). The phreatomagmatic tephra were flushed through the ice system in rapidly flowing streams. Lava effusion followed and the abundant evidence for rapid lava chilling suggests effusion in ice tunnels or channels (cf. Walker and Blake, 1966; Smellie et al., 1993; Kelman et al., 2002; Loughlin, 2002). Ice thicknessesN60–90 m are also greater than under present conditions and were responsible for multiple wide unconformities (well exposed at Claude\nPoint). Therefore, a thicker and more extensive (and possibly sub-polar) ice cover is suggested, similar to arguments used for sequence 1. This, in turn, implies that, like sequence 1, eruptions took place in a previous glacial period, which presumably corresponds to the latest Pleistocene. That age cannot be confirmed until current methods of radioisotopic dating of very young, low-K volcanic sequences are improved.\nLavas of the youngest sequence 2 eruption preserved at bCairn PointQ and Driencourt Point have subaerial rubble surfaces and may have been associated with the thinnest biceQ cover for the period, possibly just snow. Alternatively, effusion of those final thin lavas took place soon after emplacement of the underlying much thicker lava flows, and before the local ice had time to reform. The uppermost lava at bCairn PointQ may also have fed the volcanic delta exposed at Metchnikoff Point. The latter has a passage zone elevation of 70 m asl, which represents a bfossil water levelQ, and is an indication of ponded water conditions. From the preserved evidence, it is impossible to determine whether that represents a former sea level, lake or glacially ponded meltwater. In view of the very young age of the outcrop, and position on the coast with no obvious topography that could have confined a lake, a lacustrine (non-glacial) environment is unlikely. Conversely, eruption of sequence 2 in a glacial period is intuitively likely (see above), when the coeval sea level would have been lower than present. Therefore, unless the island has undergone post-eruptive uplift, the Metchnikoff Point lava-fed delta may have been emplaced in a glacial lake, whose presence is indicative of a more substantive ice sheet (thicker, dominated by impermeable ice) than is suggested by the other volcanic outcrops examined. The delta surface (110 m) roughly corresponds to the elevation of the surface of the coeval ice sheet at the time of delta effusion (Smellie, 2000, 2001).\nThe Metchnikoff Point and bCairn PointQ outcrops underwent deep glacial erosion after they were formed (much deeper than the glacial unconformities observed within any of the exposed sequences). They were also draped by glacial diamict and glacifluvial deposits. Both observations indicate that ice reformed after eruptions had finished at those localities and that the ice was presumably significantly thicker than occurs today. Moreover, all three volcanic centres on Brabant and Anvers islands have been similarly eroded since eruptions ceased. The deep erosion and character of the sediments preserved in sequence 2 strata are consistent with a wet-based ice cover and prolonged erosional period, either in a temperate or sub-polar thermal re-\ngime. It is likely that none of the volcanic centres erupted in bpost-glacialQ (Holocene) times. The relatively thin Pleistocene ice cover, indicated by our interpretations of the volcanic sequences, would have draped each volcanic shield, forming three prominent ice domes presumably conjoined with the ice sheet in Graham Land by a low-lying ice stream flowing through the intervening Gerlache Strait (Canals et al., 2000). There is thus no indication that a very thick ice sheet once existed, with a single unified dome spanning Brabant and Anvers islands and northern Antarctic Peninsula.\nAverage thicknesses of ice piedmonts on Anvers and Adelaide islands today are about 400 m, compared with ice thicknesses of about 50 m on mountain flanks and ridges (Lythe et al., 2001). This is because of the much gentler slopes on the low-lying western bedrock platforms of both islands, on which the ice cannot drain away so rapidly. In Pleistocene times, when ice thicknesses were greater and sea levels much lower, ice sheets expanding onto the gentle gradients of the present shelf from Brabant and associated islands would also have been thicker than in their mountain sources. Thus, the theoretical thickness of about 700 m for the Pleistocene ice sheet during periods of expansion onto the continental shelf (suggested by Pudsey et al., 1994) seems a not unreasonable maximum for a wet-based ice sheet. Evidence for the palaeo-elevation and thickness of that ice sheet is constrained by the Metchnikoff Point delta surface (110 m) at the time of delta effusion. The sea bottom close inshore of Brabant Island is deep (N120 m), yielding a likely maximum ice sheet thickness of about 250–300 m (delta surface elevation plus sea floor depth) in its proximal region (present shoreline). Moreover, at other times in the Pleistocene, the ice sheet was less substantial, with a surface presumably below present sea level since other localities on Brabant Island show evidence for only a thin permeable glacial cover (b150 m) down to sea level at the time(s) of their\nemplacement. Thus, available evidence from Brabant Island suggests that the Late Pleistocene ice sheet was a dynamic feature, generally thin and with a variable thickness (and presumably extent) at different times, and it must also have had a very low profile (Fig. 10).\nFinally, because of insufficient analytical precision in the 40Ar / 39Ar method, it is currently impossible to demonstrate at what stage eruptions on Brabant Island occurred with respect to Pleistocene glacial–interglacial cycles. It is thus possible that some of our data may be biased toward periods of somewhat thinner ice cover, if those eruptions were triggered by rapid unloading during the earliest stages (b1 ka) of deglaciation. In the highest-resolution study conducted so far, St John et al. (2004) demonstrated that Pleistocene explosive eruptions in the north Atlantic region were strongly correlated with light d18O excursions and episodic shortduration deglaciations. However, the eruptions were not restricted to interglacial periods but also occurred during glacial stages, when ice thicknesses were presumably also generally thicker."

    "text": "Two compositionally defined volcanic sequences separated by a glacial unconformity were erupted on Brabant Island, off the west coast of northern Antarctic Peninsula, in Late Quaternary time (probably entirely Late Pleistocene). Both sequences were formed in association with a comparatively thin glacial ice cover, which was probably b150 m thick for both eruptive periods. The glacial cover on the volcanoes was permeable and probably formed largely of snow, firn and/ or fractured ice. It was also wet-based, and either a temperate or (perhaps more likely) sub-polar thermal regime is indicated. If the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet expanded to the shelf edge, our results imply that the ice sheet was thin there (few hundred metres) and had a low profile.\nof the ice cover on Brabant Island and offshore during the Late\nhave resulted in a thicker ice sheet compared to its extension on the\nry low."

  "abstractText": "Terrestrial volcanism occurred extensively on Brabant Island, northern Antarctic Peninsula, during the Late Quaternary (b200 ka; probably entirely Late Pleistocene). Two compositionally distinct volcanic sequences formed three large shield volcanoes. The volcanoes were constructed in association with a b150 m-thick, non-ice stream glacial cover, although it was likely to be thicker (few hundred metres) where it extended onto the continental shelf. The glacial cover on the volcanoes was probably mainly permeable snow, firn and fractured (crevassed) ice. It was wet-based, erosive and sediment-forming, indicating either a temperate or, perhaps more likely, sub-polar thermal regime, and would have been more extensive than that present today. Such a thin ice sheet would have had a low surface gradient during periods of extension across the continental shelf. This is the first direct evidence for the thickness and thermal regime of the terrestrial ice sheet in the Antarctic Peninsula during any Quaternary period prior to the last glacial maximum.
