Gupta National Institute of Oceanography, Dona Paula, Goa 403 004, India\nIntroduction\nOver much of the deep sediments of the Central Indian Basin (CIB), several preserved volcanogenic signatures (e.g., a vast pumice field, volcanic glass shards in surficial sediments, indurated volcanic tephra layers as substrate for Fe—Mn crusts, etc.) have been observed (Gupta 1988; Iyer and Sudhakar 1993a; Martin-Barajas and LallierVerges 1993). It is not clear at present whether these volcanogenic signatures are produced by an in situ source of suboceanic volcanism or result from an external source. One likely external source that has been suggested is the Indonesian Volcanic Arc (IVA) (Martin-Barajas and Lallier-Verges 1993). However, considering CIB bottom geomorphological features, such as the presence of a number of seamounts along N—S-trending fracture zones (Kamesh Raju 1993), the possibility of an in situ source for the volcanoclastic signatures observed cannot be ruled out. This study aims to examine the possibility of in situ suboceanic volcanism in the CIB.\nThe sedimentary record of intercalated volcanic ash layers in cores F200B and F88B from the CIB at different depth intervals has been examined. The downcore intercalated volcanic ash layers are composed primarily of glass shards (broken, common bubble, and pumiceous types) (Gupta 1988). The depositional ages of the ash layers have also been estimated to see whether a meaningful geological significance exists in their time of burial.\nCores F200B and F88B were collected from an area of siliceous ooze (water depth 5400 m) in the CIB (Fig. 1). These cores are 90 and 86 cm in length, respectively. Core F200B is from the flank of the 76.3°E fracture zone; core F88B is located about 50 km to the east of the fracture zone (Fig. 1).\nEstimated depositional ages of ash layers\nThe age estimates of the ash layer intervals were based on radiometric dates and on constraints from the radiolarian biostratigraphic datum levels. Radiometric ages were obtained from the down-core distribution of 230Th\n94 activity\n(Borole 1993a), assuming constant sediment accumulation and rain of 230Th to the core sites. The earlier interpretation of measured 230Th\n94 activity as a function of depth for\ncore F200B involved a single slope averaged over the entire core depth (0—76 cm). That yielded an average sedimentation rate of 0.2 cmka~1, despite a wide fluctuation in the slope of the 230Th\n94 data (Borole 1993a)\n(Fig. 3). However, a closer evaluation of the slope indicates three major changes in the rates of sedimentation (Fig. 2). Such changes are manifest even in the down-core 230Th\n94 /232Th activity ratio (Fig. 2). Further support\nfor changes in sedimentation rate in this core comes from radiolarian biostratigraphy (Gupta 1988). The first change occurs at 40 cm, where the 230Th\n94 slope is some-\nwhat flattened; it gives a rapid sedimentation rate of 0.47$0.15 cm ka~1 (N\"13; R\"0.66). The lowest rate of 0.063$0.007 cmka~1 (N\"4; R\"0.98) is observed\nFig. 1 Location of cores F200B and F88B in CIB, with reference to the Toba volcano. The dotted line indicates the probable area where Toba ash had been encountered (after Ninkovich et al. 1978). Also shown is the hatched area’s geomorphological features of seamounts (stars), along with the N—S trending 76.3°E and 79°E fracture zones (after Kamesh Raju 1993)\nfrom 40 to 54 cm, as can be seen from the steep slope of the 230Th 94 profile. Following the periods of slow sedimentation, the slope of the 230Th 94\nprofile progressively flattens up to 76 cm and the accumulation rate increases to 0.29$0.06 cm ka~1 (N\"7; R\"0.81). The ages at 40, 54, and 76 cm correspond to 94$30, 319$40 and 400$43 ka BP, respectively. These ages are plotted as\nFig. 2 Concentration depth profiles of 230Th 94 and 230Th 94 /232Th (activity ratio) showing varying sedimentation rates in core F200B\nFig. 3 Age-depth plots for cores F200B and F88B. 230Th 94 derived ages are shown as squares and biostratigraphy ages as circles, 1, 2, & 3 refer to the FAD levels of C. invaginata, C. tuberosa, and C. orthoconus, respectively (Gupta 1988)"

The slope of the 230Th 94 profile gives an average sedimentation rate of 0.08 cm ka~1 (Borole 1993a). This rate was used to estimate the age of the ash layer intervals.\nRadiolarian biostratigraphy\nThe Quaternary zonation of radiolarian index species for cores F200B and F88B were identified and tabulated (Gupta 1988). The first appearance datum (FAD) levels of Collosphaera (Buccinosphaera) invaginata 111 ka, Collosphaera tuberosa 222 ka, and Collosphaera Orthoconus 340 ka have been identified at the core section depths of 42, 52, and 76 cm in F200B, and 10, 20, and 30 cm in F88B respectively (Gupta 1988). These datum levels have also been used to plot the age versus depth (Fig. 3). The ages of the ash layer intervals were then estimated by interpolation assuming a constant rate of sedimentation between the FAD levels.\nResults\nTable 1 summarizes the estimated average ages of ash layers in the two cores along with their bio-stratigraphical ages. Although our results of ash layer accumulation are inadequate to define its depositional age precisely , there is some agreement between the 230Th\n94 dates and biostrati-\ngraphic ages (Table 1). A map showing the extensive dispersal pattern of Toba ash (after Ninkovich et al. 1978) is presented in Fig. 1. Also shown in Fig. 1 are the core locations and the observed bottom geomorphological features of seamounts and fracture zones. Note that the core sites are about 3000 km away from the land-based source, the Toba volcano.\nDiscussion\nTwo aspects concerning the source of the ash layers are discussed. The first relates to the geophysical and geochemical studies carried out in this basin (Kamesh Raju 1993; Iyer and Sudhakar 1993a,b) and the second stems from the observation of Martin-Barajas and LallierVerges (1993) that all volcanoclastic products in this basin are related to the Indonesian Volcanic Arc (IVA).\nChoosing between the two alternatives may not be difficult if one considers the information available on the intricate physiographic features in this basin (Fig. 1). We see the presence of a large number of seamounts (extinct volcanoes?) lying along the fracture zones (Kamesh Raju 1993). About 52 seamounts, with heights ranging from 500 to 1500 m have been reported (Kodagali 1989; Mukhopadhyay and Khadge 1990). The 76.3@E & 79@E fracture zones displace the South East Indian ridge (SEIR) and extend nearly parallel to the north almost up to the Equator (Kamesh Raju 1993). Our study area lies in the vicinity of these fracture zones (Fig. 1). The distribution pattern of the chains of seamounts probably indicates that during the early history of sea-floor spreading, the upper mantle might have been tapped at different parts in the rifting oceanic crust. The outpouring of these mantle materials has led to the genesis of the seamounts in the study area. This observation may substantiate the evidence for the in situ source near the core localities. Moreover, as suggested by Eichelberger (1978), the reactivation of faults due to isostatic effects is possible at any time, and such reactivations could trigger the outpouring of subcritical magma bodies.\nTo follow these lines of thought, it is necessary to recall the occurrence of a large pumice field (600,000 km2) in this basin, the abundance of pumice near fracture zones, and the presence of a large number of zeolitites in the surface sediments (Iyer and Sudhakar 1993a,b). It is well established that a volcanogenic precursor is essential for the development of zeolitites, and therefore extensive volcanic activity in this basin during the geological past is expected.\nBased on the mineralogy and chemical composition of the volcanoclastic materials recovered from this basin, the possibility of distal fallout from IVA has been suggested by Martin-Barajas and Lallier-Verges (1993). Although one sees the possibility of transport of volcanogenic products from IVA to this basin, either through currents or due to distal fallout, we regard it as extremely unlikely. The ash particles enriched with volcanic glass shards average 0.1—0.2 mm in size (Gupta 1988). Ash particles of 1 lm size cannot be carried away from the source over a distance of 3000 km by surface or deep-sea currents (cf. Huang et al. 1973). This, coupled with the northward constrained movement of the surface or deep currents of this basin (Warren 1982), rules out such current transport over a distance of about 3000 km from the IVA source. Another explanation comes from the SEM photographs of the\nglass shards that show typical gas vesicles, bubbles, and broken walls, and resemble hyloclastics, which can only be formed, when magma comes in contact with cooler media such as ice-cold water or ice (cf. Gupta 1988). They generally do not spread beyond 400 km from the volcanic source (cf. Gupta 1988).\nAlthough atmospheric transport under favorable conditions could be a possibility, it is very difficult to visualize that the ash layers observed from the southern part of this basin have also been produced by the IVA eruption. This is because the great distances of about 3000 km may not be favorable to having a very strong directional wind to carry the ash particles to such a distant area. The distribution of the IVA ash, particularly Toba ash layers, have been observed in sediment cores from the Bay of Bengal (Ninkovich et al. 1978), in the Son Valley (Rose and Chesner 1987), and in the central Narmada Valley basins of the Indian subcontinent (Acharyya and Basu 1993). This distribution pattern indicates the presence of a strong NW directional wind with respect to the source (Toba). This wind carried the Toba ash to the northwest, while the study area lies to the SW of the IVA (Fig. 1). Atmospheric circulation models based on sea surface paleotemperature for glacial conditions suggest that the westerlies had intensified by more than 50% during glacial times (Gates 1976). This negates any change in the wind direction to the SW. Thus we exclude the possibility of IVA as a possible source of volcanogenic products to our study area, as this region is largely outside the influence of NW winds.\nWhile the above arguments appear conclusive we do not completely dismiss the idea that the exclusive source of the volcanic material in this basin is from IVA. Consequently, in seeking an in situ origin for the observed ash layers, we believe, at least for the region under consideration, the observed bottom morphological structures are more subordinate to invoke a local in situ source of suboceanic volcanism.\nGlaciation and suboceanic volcanism: a possible relationship\nThe observed ash layers in the present cores (at depths of 6—7, 10—11, 30—31, and 46—47 cm in F200B and 21—26 cm in F88B) have depositional ages (Table 1) that seem to correspond to oxygen isotope stages 2, 4, 6, and 8. These stages represent the periods of deterioration of the global climate during the colder stages of cooling events (Martinson et al. 1987). The depositional ages of the remaining ash layers (sections 14—15, 20—21, and 49—50 in F200B) center around periods of glaciation (Table 1). Considering that our estimates of the depositional ages are not completely accurate, it is reasonable to suggest that the ash layer deposition periods are centered around the glacial events.\nThis observation presents an enigma in the deposition of ash layers during glaciation times in this basin. Such an observation is not surprising, given the fact that\na sequence of ash layers from the world’s deep-sea sediments is correlatable to periods of pronounced glaciation (Kennett 1982, and the references therein).\nWe envisage therefore that suboceanic volcanic episodes in this basin may have been related to periods of glaciation. This raises another important question, Does glaciation have an important role in triggering suboceanic eruptions? Recent investigations by Rampino and Self (1993) of the eruption history of Toba during the 5a—4 transition stage suggests that elevated glaciation triggers eruption. The detailed climatic record of this transition reveals that at the time of eruption, episodes of rapid ice accumulation and lowering of sea level (about 40 m) were taking place. Such changes in sea level created stresses, which triggered the Toba eruption (Rampino and Self 1993).\nIf glaciation should turn out to be a mechanism to trigger a land-based source such as Toba, then there is reason to believe that evidences related to the events of suboceanic eruptions require large and rapid global responses. The best explanation we see is something akin to the sensitivity of glaciation. However, the question remains as to what initiates the required glacial advances.\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to model the paleoglacial advances. One such is that they are driven by the explosive land volcanism, whereby the end of eruption marks the beginning of global cooling. We do not propose that every glaciation event in the earth’s history was triggered by land volcanism. However, if it is accepted that climatic changes can be driven by explosive volcanism, then the impact of these eruptions may be of global importance and may create conditions propitious for glaciation. Available evidence from terrestrial and marine records show that explosive eruptions in the past have reached the levels required to cause significant climatic cooling (Bray 1977; Lamb 1971). Furthermore, Rampino and Self (1993) suggest a possible general feedback coupling between explosive eruption and climatic change. With the Toba eruption and its aftermath occurring during the period of abrupt global cooling (stage 5a—4 transition), they point out that the perturbations caused by dense stratospheric dust and aerosol clouds could contribute to a period of brief dramatic cooling. This period of volcanic winter is conducive to snow and ice accumulation, which in turn accelerated the prevailing global cooling at 74 ka BP (Rampino and Self 1993).\nWe believe that such cases of intense and abrupt acceleration of ice sheet growth and accumulation during the low sea level stand have an impact on glaciation-sensitive regions such as the ocean basins. For example, in the aftermath of the Toba eruption, the north Atlantic surface temperature and global sea level dropped precipitously (cf. Rampino and Self 1993). The lysocline in the eastern Indian Ocean also became shallower during the time of its ash deposition (cf. Rampino and Self 1993). With this scenario in mind, and in accordance with the leading hypothesis of Rampino et al. (1979) and Rampino and Self (1992, 1993) on Quaternary climatic changes and volcan-\nism, we postulate that suboceanic volcanism could most likely be triggered by the onset of a volcanic winter. Considering the sequential response of the ocean system to the glacial epoch, and the possible mechanisms for climatic triggering of volcanic eruption (Chappell 1975; Anderson 1974), we suggest the following mechanism, initially proposed by Mathews (1969): Hydrostatic unloading of the ocean basins during glaciation favors upward movement of basaltic magma and thus leads to heightened volcanism. This could be the best possible explanation for the observed enigma during the onset of glaciation followed by suboceanic volcanism as described earlier. We suggest therefore, that elevated glaciation and suboceanic volcanism can also be related to the deep-sea environment.\nEnrichment of metals such as Mn, Cu, and Ni during glacial periods has been noted in cores F200B and F88B (Borole 1993b). The presence of widespread gaps (Gupta 1998) followed by distinct changes in facies and modification of the species of siliceous microfossil assemblages in these cores mark the cooling events of the glacial epochs. Thus, our observations may suggest significant volcanism during glacial times in CIB.\nSummary\nGiven the inadequacy of the data and the chronology of the depositional ages of the ash layers in the CIB, we propose the following interpretations as a guide to future research: The overall scenario that could explain an in situ source is drawn from the available bottom morphological structures, which may account for the observed ash layers found in the southern part of the CIB. We believe that the ashes cannot be conceptually related to any land-based source, because this region is largely outside the influence of wind-transported volcanic materials. Because of intensified westerlies during glacial times, we believe that there was no major change in wind direction.\nThe little conclusive evidence of the depositional ages of the ash layer horizons estimated from the dates of 230Th 94 and the radiolarian biostratigraphy suggests the possibility of deposition of ash layers during glacial periods. Given this tentative correlation, it seems likely that there could have been an initiation of a volcanic episode during the onset of glaciation in this basin.\nAcknowledgements We thank Profs. K.
