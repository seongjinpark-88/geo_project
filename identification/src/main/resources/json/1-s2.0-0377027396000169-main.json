    "text": "The systematic age progression of the Neogene/Quatemary volcanic chain in the Carpathians, manifested in progres-\nsively degraded stratovolcanoes from south to north, offers a great opportunity to calculate erosion rates and the factors that control degradation in a moderate continental climate. Using available and newly determined K/Ar ages for the cessation of volcanism of nineteen stratocones, a great number of morphometric variables, including crater diameter and perimeter, intracraterial valley length, valley order and density, dip of internal and external crater rim, cone diameter, relative height/cone diameter, height above and distance from base level, etc., has been examined by regression and factor analyses. On the one hand, the erosion rates which are calculated from the regression equations of a given characteristic versus age seem to answer the question of to what extent the stratovolcanoes are degraded: numerical values of crater enlargement (109 m/Ma), internal valley growth (1.3 km/Ma), average cone lowering (31.5 m/Ma), etc., are given. Moreover, using multiple regression equations as “age equations”, the age of any volcano in the same climate can be estimated from the measured characteristics. On the other hand, there are morphometric characteristics (e.g., dip of crater rim, crater circularity, intracraterial valley density) which are not functions of time. Three major factors, i.e., the “time factor” (about 40%). the “size-depth” factor (about 24%), and the “erosional distance” factor (about 10%) account for about 75% of the stratovolcano characteristics variance, and two additional factors (eruption style-magma viscosity, and the central manifestation of volcanism) may be responsible for a further 13%.\nKeywords: volcano morphometry; stratovolcano degradation; erosion rates; erosion factors"

(The negative coefficients mean that the value of the given variable decreases in time.) The most highly correlated variable is crater diameter (I = 0.911, the ones that follow it are crater perimeter (r = 0.89). relatiue height/ cone diameter ratio (r = - 0.88), intracraterial valley length (r = 0.88) and ualley number (r = 0.84), and crater diameter/ relative height ratio (r = 0.82). The regular temporal change of the measured ratios reflects the increase of cone and crater diameter rather than the decrease of relative height, since the change of relative height seems not to be dependent on time. [Obviously, the dependence - i.e., the decrease of relative height in time - is a matter of course for same-sized volcanoes. For example, Scott and Trask (1971) found that cinder cones of Lunar Crater volcanic field (Nevada, western USA), with similarly decreasing height/diameter (radius) ratio in time, are progressively lowering. However, in the Carpathians, the original stratovolcano volumes were not the same and follow local patterns, cf. Szakacs et al. (19941.1\nHow does a morphometric variable change in time? For the six variables with highest correlations, the answers are given in Table 2b where the regression equations are shown. The equations of the regression lines are in the form y = ax + b (where a and b are the slope and the intercept of the line, respectively); the slope values equal the average change of the given variable per unit time. For example, a = 109.00 for crater diameter: this equals the crater enlargement (m> per million years. Similarly, valley length has grown by 1.32 km/Ma, and valley number by 1.39/Ma, etc. Three of the regression lines are displayed in Fig. 3a-c. [Note that even the dimensions of the most enlarged craters are far from those of “erosion calderas” as they only have\nabout half the diameter of the youngest real (collapse) calderas in the Carpathians (Karatson, 1994j.l\nApart from the quantitative values given by the method, the type of the regression is also worth emphasizing. The best regression method is linear; this fact has two important implications.\n(1) First, it may indicate that climate changes have been counterbalanced in the studied area for over 11 million years. During this time - since the Late Miocene - erosion processes have operated in the Carpathians first, for a short time, in a subtropical-moderate continental transitional climate, then in a moderate continental climate with occasional drier (sometimes semiarid) and moister periods, and with periglacial regime in the Pleistocene with minor glaciation. Average annual temperature is now about 10°C annual precipitation does not exceed 800- 1000 mm. The whole time interval can be characterized with only a 4-W temperature drop in average (cf. Kordos, 1979). Obviously, a real subtropical or tropical climate influences degradation differently. Suzuki (1969) found that (a) degradation is much more intense on Japanese volcanoes and (b) erosion rates are reciprocally decreasing functions of time (derived from the observed logarithmic change of erosion). In that area, the humid climate (up to 3000 mm precipitation per year) is clearly the major factor of the rapid erosion, whereas the smaller time span ( < 2 Ma) of the studied volcanoes with continuously expanding vegetation as well as the rapidly lowering elevation may be responsible for the decreasing degree of degradation. Starting from high but abruptly decreasing erosion rates, also supported by other studies, e.g., Ruxton and McDougall (19671, Ollier and Brown (197 1) and Drake (19761, we can assume that after some hundreds of thousands or one million\nNotes to Table 1: 1 = height above sea level (m); 2 = relative height Cm); 3 = crater depth (ml; 4 = crater diameter cm); 5 = depth/diameter; 6 = intracraterial valley length (km); 7 = intracraterial valley density (l/km); 8 = cone diameter (m); 9 = relative height/cone diameter; 10 = crater diameter/relative height; 11 = intracraterial valley order act. to Strahler (19.52); 12 = intracraterial valley number act. to Shreve (1967); 13 = crater perimeter (m); 14 = youngest age calculated from K/Ar datings (Ma); 15 = maximum slope of crater wall (‘?; 16 = slope of outlet valley C’); 17 = calculated original slope of cone in the site of the outlet valley c); 18 = relative height above erosion base level (ml; 19 = distance from erosion base level (km); 20 = dip of internal crater rim c); 21 = dip of external crater rim C’); 22 = crater circularity; 23 = crater diameter/cone diameter; 24 = crater depth/cone diameter; 25 = surface texture (number of maximum contour crenulations in the crater/crater perimeter; Strahler, 1957); 26 = internal and external crater rim dip difference (“1. - = data lack because of map insufficiency or for other reasons.\nyears of the cessation of volcanism (depending on\nthe actual climate), erosion may have slowed down\nto operate at a linear or quasi-linear rate in the\nCarpathians.

This conclusion seems to be supported by Fig. 3a-c where the regression lines intercept the y-axis (i.e., zero time) higher than the typical morphometrical characteristics of active volcanoes. For example, the regression line of the crater diameter intercepts the y-axis almost at 1500 m, whereas this value of active\nTable 3 Crater diameter of some active stratovolcanoes in the world (data based on topographic maps with scale 1:25,000 and 1:50,000)\nVolcano Country Crater diameter\n(m)\nAkagi Japan 700 Cotopaxi Ecuador 450 Fuji Japan 520 Miharayama (Izu-Oshima) Japan 7.50 Ontake Japan 480 Mt.

This suggests that the first part of the regression may be not linear but a logarithmically increasing curve starting from lower values of the y-axis. In other words, it seems that erosion rates in a continental climate decrease grad-\nually during the initial intense degradation until they\nreach a “steady state”.\n(2) The linear-type regression also implies that elevation changes (lowering) did not have a considerable effect on erosion rates. However, this implication will be dealt with in Section 3."

    "heading": "3. Calculation of cone lowering by simple regression",
    "text": "The best morphometric variable, crater diameter, helps in calculating cone lowering. As Fig. 4 shows, one can complete the present, eroded shape of the cone by using the original slopes and original crater diameter of recent, active stratovolcanoes. Then, with a simple trigonometric relationship, approximate lowering can be calculated from crater diameter differences and original slope value. But what is the present diameter of a given age? I have considered the average, “typical” diameter determined by the regression line in Fig. 3a. And how great is the original diameter? If calculating with the values of recent, active stratocones (which have a typical crater diameter of 600 m, see Table 3), we do not consider the previously mentioned, initial intense erosional stage after cessation of volcanism, when debris flows\nand “normal” mass movements enlarge the crater rapidly (cf. Francis, 1983; Moriya, 1987). Therefore, I assume a quasi-original “postvolcanic” diameter, from which a “quiet”, linear degradation may have started. For the mentioned reason of crater diameter/age correlation (i.e., the interception of the regression line in the y-axis is greater than the primary crater diameter), I calculated with a 1500 m quasioriginal diameter. However, in this way, initial lowering should also be taken into account. On the basis of the trigonometric relationship in Fig. 4, initial lowering can be calculated as [(1500-600)/2] * tan 30”, that is = 260 m. This value should be added in every case. The result of cone lowering calculations - i.e., the age-degradation correlation-is shown in Fig. 5.

The good fit with these data may also\ninvolve the reliability of other erosion rates given in\nSection 2, e.g., growth of valley length and valley\nnumber, enlargement of crater etc. On the other hand, it must be emphasized that my results refer to\nthe summit region; erosion rates may be smaller in\nlower elevations (Corbel, 1964; Ruxton and Mc-\nDougall, 1967; Ahnert, 1970; Chorley et al., 1984). This statement does not contradict the calculated\nlinear type of the rates (see Section 21, because: (1) the given erosion rates represent an average of dif-\nferent elevations from 700 to 1800 m (cf. Table 1);\nand (2) lowering has been compensated by Cenozoic\ntectonic uplift in the Carpathians. It should be emphasized again that this order of\nrates is much higher in fresh volcanic terrains (up to lOOO-10,000 mm/ka, Ollier, 1988) where loose material as well as lack of vegetation cover accelerate erosion processes. Francis (1983) concludes that over l-2 Ma, the proximal, highest near-vent stratocone area would be removed, leaving the core complex only. This may be the case in highly precipitated or\nglaciated areas (e.g., Japan, Aleutian Islands, High\nCascades, etc.) but not in the Carpathian volcanic arc\nwhich, with well-recognizable craters of up to 11\nMa, seems to be a unique locality."

    "text": "Multiple regression shows how one variable de-\npends on other variables. The most interesting corre-\nlation is that of morphometry and time - in geological terms, how morphometry is determined by time. Table 4a shows two multiple regressions: first, the correlation between age and crater diameter and valley length; second, the correlation between age\nand the six “best” variables. For comparison, the morphometrically and the radiometrically determined\nK/Ar ages are also given (Table 4b). The correla-\ntions of the multiple regression are over 0.90, and the maximum error - the difference from K/Ar ages - does not exceed 1.5-2 Ma. So the regression equations as age equations can be used for calculating age in case of same volcanological and\nerosional history. As discussed above, the latter factor, i.e., erosion, is highly influenced by climate. In order to clarify the role of climatic control, the age-morphometry\nTable 4 (a) Multiple regression of volcano age and different morphometric characteristics\n(A) Variables: Correlation coefficient: Regression equation:\nage, crater diameter and intracraterial valley length r = 0.9070 age = 0.0057 * crater diameter + 0.1695 * intracraterial valley length + (- 7.6165)\n(B) Variables:\nCorrelation coefficient: Regression equation:\nage, crater diameter, crater perimeter, relative height/cone diameter, intracraterial valley length, valley number act. to Shreve, and cone diameter/relative height r = 0.9266 age = 0.0140 * crater diameter + (- 0.0028) - crater perimeter + ( - 46.8275) - relative height/cone diameter + (- 0.2928) f intracraterial valley length + 0.4073 - valley number act. to Shreve + ( - 0.1288) - crater diameter/relative height + (-3.1534)\n(b) Comparison between K/Ar ages (cf.

    "heading": "5. Factor analysis",
    "text": "With regression analysis, we have been able to\nexamine how morphometric characteristics are influ-\nenced by time. But time is not the only dimension\nthat determines the shape of the volcano because, as\nseen before, there are characteristics which are not\nfunctions of time. To identify the underlying vari-\nables of present volcano morphometry, I have ap-\nplied factor analysis. This is a statistical method\npointing out background variables or factors which\naccount for the measurable variables (Morrison,\n1976; Dillon and Goldstein, 1984). The factors can\nbe obtained as linear combinations of the measured\ncharacteristics. The importance of a given factor is\nshown by the percent of variance that means how\ngreat part of the variance of the measurable variables\ncan be explained (reconstructed) by the factor. If one\ndetermines the proportion of the reconstruction, the\nmethod gives the minimum number of the factors. In\napplied statistics, it can be regarded satisfactory that the measurable variables - or, more precisely, their\ntotal variance - can be accounted for by about\n80-90% (cf. “cumulative percent” in the tables)\nwith a relatively small number of factors. Because of\nthe complicated iterative character of the calculation process, one has to apply a computer program. A number of statistical programs has factor analysis option; I worked with SPSS/PC + .\nIn the calculations, the morphometric characteristics as variables have been completed by time (volcano age) as a further variable. If time is really an important factor, it should be indicated by factor analysis.\nThe results of factor analysis is presented in Table\n5. In the table, all morphometric characteristics and\nfice important factors that were found are shown.\n(When factor analysis is applied for the single - not\nratioed - variables, one can find the same five\nfactors.) In the factor pattern matrix, we can see the\n@tar loadings that express to what extent a given\nfactor accounts for the characteristics (more pre-\ncisely, with what percentage the factor contributes to\nthe total variance of a measurable variable). A factor\nloading of more than 0.75 (absolute value) is considered high. Factor loadings of over 0.75 (or the\nhighest values in the columns) are printed in bold in\nthe table.\nWhat is the geological meaning of the factors? In\ntrying to identify them, one must be aware of the fact\nthat their relative importance are different: factor 1 has a fundamental role since it accounts for 40% of\nthe variance of the measured variables; factor 2 has a\n24% participation, factor 3 has a 10% participation,\nwhilst the other two factors are of less importance. In\naddition, one must know that if using other morpho-\nmetrical data base, one may find the role of the\nfactors different.\nFactor I: This factor accounts for five variables\n(including age) with factor loadings > 90% and further six with > 75%. These morphometric charac-\nteristics are those which are highly correlated with\ntime, and the decreasing factor loadings are approxi-\nmately reflect the decreasing morphometric charac-\nteristic/time correlations (cf. Table 2a). Factor 1\nmay therefore be the time factor. (Interestingly, age\nas a variable does not have the highest factor load-\ning, but this can be attributed to radiometrical errors\nand/or age data insufficiency for the youngest activity.) If the first factor is really the time factor, a factor analysis which considers only time-dependent\ncharacteristics must have a single, extremely strong\nfactor. This is fulfilled: in Table 6, an additional\nfactor analysis (with volcano age and morphometric\ncharacteristics dependent on time to more than 0.70) points out only one factor which accounts for timedependent characteristics to 0.80-0.90 and has as much as 78% contribution to their total variance.\nFactor 2: Fewer characteristics are accounted for\nby this factor with a loading over 0.75. These characteristics are related to volcano size (absolute and relative height, etc.) and, by implication, crater depth\nTable 5 Factor analvsis of morohometric characteristics and age\nFactor Percent of total variance Cumulative percent"

In the above, we could see that volcano volume does not depend on time along the Carpathian arc (there may be a number of distinct arcs and corresponding along-arc variations); it seems that volume is an independent feature which, on the basis of its manifestation, can be referred to as the “size-depth” factor.\nFactor 3: Two morphometric characteristics are accounted for by this factor: the calculated original slope of cone on the site of the outlet valley and, of negative sign, the distance from erosion base level.\nIn the case of a volcano under degradation, the two characteristics are obviously inversely related: the greater the distance from base level, the smaller the external slope angle. [The correlation (r) between the two variables is -0.8916 in the case of the studied Carpathian volcanoes.] Thus, one can speak of an “erosional distance” or “erosional possibility” factor: the lesser the distance from base level, the ‘ ‘stronger’ ’ the factor.\nFactor 4: Only one characteristic is important - the external dip of crater rim which is accounted for with a factor loading almost 0.90. The factor which\nhides in this characteristic, however, is of great\nimportance: it may be eruption style and/or magma\nviscosity - this is the factor which determines the\nexternal dip of the original crater rim. The rim is\nbuilt up, as seen before, of intermediate (andesitic),\ntalc-alkaline lava flows in the case of the studied\nvolcanoes and, according to the outcropping platy\njointed lavas, seems to preserve the original dip.\nFactor 5: Similarly to the former one, a single\ncharacteristic (crater circularity or roundness) is ex-\nplained. However, it is accounted for with a factor\nloading of under 0.70. The background factor may\nbe the point-like or central manifestation of uolcan-\nism which, like diapirs, seems to be a feature not\nrelated to any other factors.\nIn order to investigate to what extent the variables\ndetermined by the three major factors belong to distinct groups, I constructed a three-dimensional\ndiagram (Fig. 6). The axes of the tripod inserted into\nthe cube represent the three factors, and the scales on\nthe edges show the factor loadings of the morphome-\ntric variables. In the cube, all variables are displayed;\nthose belonging to factors 1, 2 and 3 are marked by\ncircles, squares and triangles, respectively. The other variables are marked by crosses. It can be seen quite\nwell that the marked variables are gathered into three\ndistinct groups.

With the regression method, numerical values for the change of different morphometric characteristics\nin time can be given. The calculated erosion rates seem suitable in worldwide comparison (in case of similar, i.e., moderate continental climate) since the cone lowering rate, 31.5 m/Ma, fits well with global denudation rates inferred from other methods.\nWith factor analysis, the background variables of the present stratovolcano shape can be identified. If the 11 million years time span of the studied volca-\nnoes is taken into account, it is not surprising that time is the most important factor, explaining the morphometric characteristics by about 40%. Adding two more major factors (size-depth and erosional distance), we can describe the stratovolcano morphometry by 75%; and if considering five factors, we have a clear picture of stratovolcano shape and size as almost 90% of the measurable characteristics can be explained. Last but not least, the presented statistical methods, with other data bases, may also serve for determining rates and factors of degradation either of other volcano types or of those in other climate conditions.\nChorley, R.J., Schumm, S.A. and Sugden, D.E., 1984.

  "abstractText": "The systematic age progression of the Neogene/Quatemary volcanic chain in the Carpathians, manifested in progressively degraded stratovolcanoes from south to north, offers a great opportunity to calculate erosion rates and the factors that control degradation in a moderate continental climate. Using available and newly determined K/Ar ages for the cessation of volcanism of nineteen stratocones, a great number of morphometric variables, including crater diameter and perimeter, intracraterial valley length, valley order and density, dip of internal and external crater rim, cone diameter, relative height/cone diameter, height above and distance from base level, etc., has been examined by regression and factor analyses. On the one hand, the erosion rates which are calculated from the regression equations of a given characteristic versus age seem to answer the question of to what extent the stratovolcanoes are degraded: numerical values of crater enlargement (109 m/Ma), internal valley growth (1.3 km/Ma), average cone lowering (31.5 m/Ma), etc., are given. Moreover, using multiple regression equations as “age equations”, the age of any volcano in the same climate can be estimated from the measured characteristics. On the other hand, there are morphometric characteristics (e.g., dip of crater rim, crater circularity, intracraterial valley density) which are not functions of time. Three major factors, i.e., the “time factor” (about 40%). the “size-depth” factor (about 24%), and the “erosional distance” factor (about 10%) account for about 75% of the stratovolcano characteristics variance, and two additional factors (eruption style-magma viscosity, and the central manifestation of volcanism) may be responsible for a further 13%.",
