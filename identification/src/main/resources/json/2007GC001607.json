The highest 87Sr/86Sr values occurred in the earliest Paleocene at 65 Ma and generally decreased throughout the Paleocene, reaching minimum values between 53 and 51 Ma in the early Eocene before beginning to increase again at 50 Ma. A plausible explanation for the 87Sr/86Sr decrease between 65 and 51 Ma is increased rates of hydrothermal activity and/or the eruption and weathering of large igneous provinces (e.g., Deccan Traps and North Atlantic). Strontium isotope variations closely parallel sea level and benthic d18O changes during the late Paleocene and early Eocene, supporting previous studies linking tectonic reorganization and increased volcanism to high sea level, high CO2, and warm global temperatures.\nComponents: 8671 words, 9 figures, 3 tables.\nKeywords: strontium isotopes; Paleogene; volcanism.\nIndex Terms: 4912 Paleoceanography: Biogeochemical cycles, processes, and modeling (0412, 0414, 0793, 1615, 4805);\n1030 Geochemistry: Geochemical cycles (0330); 4948 Paleoceanography: Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum.\nReceived 13 February 2007; Revised 5 June 2007; Accepted 27 June 2007; Published 7 September 2007.\nHodell, D.

    "text": "[2] The history of seawater 87Sr/86Sr variation is well known for the Oligocene and Neogene when marine 87Sr/86Sr was increasing at a relatively rapid rate. Comparably less effort has been devoted to developing a high-resolution 87Sr/86Sr record for the Paleocene and Eocene because the rate of 87Sr/86Sr change was low and therefore of limited stratigraphic value. Strontium isotope data are especially sparse between 45 and 64 Ma [McArthur et al., 2001]. In an effort to refine the 87Sr/86Sr seawater curve for this period, we measured samples from the continuous Paleocene to middle Eocene sections recovered during ODP Leg 208 to the Walvis Ridge (Figure 1).\n[3] The strontium isotope composition of seawater is controlled by variations in the flux and isotopic ratio of Sr to the ocean from continental weathering, hydrothermal circulation, and carbonate dissolution. Consequently, the strontium isotope seawater curve has been used to infer changes in global tectonics related to orogenic uplift and rifting [Brass, 1976]. The late Paleocene-early Eocene includes some of the lowest 87Sr/86Sr values of the Cenozoic and may be significant geochemically because one possible cause for the low values is increased hydrothermal activity and/ or weathering of volcanic rocks. The early Paleogene was a time noted for increased seafloor hydrothermal activity [Owen and Rea, 1985; Rea et al., 1990], formation of the North Atlantic igneous province [Thomas and Shackleton, 1996], and increased explosive volcanism in the Caribbean [Bralower et al., 1997a]. Furthermore, it has been proposed that metamorphic and volcanic outgassing of CO2 may have been an important source to the atmosphere during the late Paleocene and earliest Eocene ( 60 to 52 Ma). Boron-based pH reconstructions suggest that pCO2 concentrations were more than 2,000 ppm [Pearson and Palmer, 2000]. High atmospheric CO2 contributed to an enhanced greenhouse effect resulting in the warmest temperatures of the Cenozoic during the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO) [Zachos et al., 2001]."

    "text": "[4] During Ocean Drilling Program Leg 208, six sites were drilled at water depths between 2500 and 4770 m to recover complete Paleogene sequences on the northeastern flank ofWalvis Ridge (Figure 1) [Zachos et al., 2004]. One of the main objectives\nwas to establish a cyclostratigraphy for the upper Maastrichtian through lower Eocene because this period lacked an orbitally tuned timescale. To obtain samples from the best-dated Paleogene sections possible for strontium isotope analysis, we identified a composite section made up of several Leg 208 sites spanning the time from 65 to 45 Ma (Table 1). These sections were determined to be the most promising for developing a Paleogene cyclostratigraphy for their respective time intervals.\n[5] The site-to-site shifts in the composite section occur at easily recognizable events in the sediment record (Table 1). Floating orbital timescales were developed for the Paleocene and most of the early Eocene up to 53.2 Ma for Site 1262 and 1267 (Röhl et al. [2006] and U. Röhl et al. (manuscript in preparation, 2007) for the Paleocene – Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM); Westerhold et al. [2007] for the C24r/C25n interval; T. Westerhold et al. (The first comprehensive orbital chronology for the Paleocene: Implications for the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale and the age of the K/Pg boundary, submitted to Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 2007) for the Paleocene). Ages from 55 through 65 Ma were orbitally tuned and tied to an assumed age of 55 Ma for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum [Zachos et al., 2005]. For Sites 1265 and 1263, we relied upon the shipboard age-depth models for the interval younger than 53 Ma [Zachos et al., 2004]. Given the long residence time of strontium in the oceans ( 3 Ma), the relatively minor adjustments to sample ages that will result from orbital tuning and future definition of absolute ages will not affect the conclusions of this paper."

    "text": "[6] Mixed species of planktonic foraminifera were picked from the >150 mm fraction of the sediment. Foraminifer test chambers were gently crushed and fine-grained carbonate and clay removed by ultrasonic cleaning in deionized water. Samples were dissolved in 1–2 mL of 1M HCl, centrifuged, and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness under laminar flow conditions. Samples were then dissolved in 100 ml of 3.5 M HNO3, and loaded on to cation exchange columns consisting of strontiumselective crown ether resin (Eichrom Technologies, Inc.) to separate Sr from other ions [Pin and Bassin, 1992]. Following Sr separation, all foraminiferal samples were loaded onto degassed tungsten filaments and 87Sr/86Sr was measured with a\n2 of 15\nMicromass Sector 54 thermal ionization mass spectrometer in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida (UF) (Table 2). Each sample was run for 200 ratios at 1.5 V whenever possible, and the isotope ratios were normalized to 86Sr/88Sr = 0.1194. The analytical precision of the 87Sr/86Sr measurement in multidynamic mode is ±0.00001 (internal precision) and repeated analysis of NBS-987 yielded a mean 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.710240 with a 2s uncertainty of ±0.000015 (external precision). Pore water samples were also eluted through Sr-selective resin and 87Sr/86Sr was measured using a Nu\nPlasma MC-ICP-MS by time resolved analysis [Kamenov et al., 2006] (Table 3)."

At these times, 87Sr/86Sr values measured on Leg 208 samples are significantly higher than the LOWESS-fit curve [Howarth and McArthur, 1997] (Figure 5). Either the McArthur curve is too low during these periods or the 87Sr/86Sr values measured on Leg 208 samples are too high. Given the scarcity and scatter of measurements used to define theMcArthur seawater curve between 47 and 65Ma, it is difficult to choose between these options.\n[12] We also compared our results to data from Hess et al. [1986] which were not used in the McArthur compilation (Figure 6). Hess et al. [1986] used SEM, Sr/Ca, and pore water 87Sr/86Sr to evaluate whether foraminifer strontium isotope values had been affected by diagenesis. Most of the Paleogene samples were unaltered or showed minor evidence of recrystallization. In the latter case, pore water 87Sr/86Sr ratios were close to those of coexisting foraminifera and minor diagenesis should not significantly alter foraminiferal\n7 of 15\n87Sr/86Sr ratios [Hess et al., 1986]. Our results from Leg 208 sites are in excellent agreement with those of Hess et al.

    "text": "[13] The burial depths of the Leg 208 sites used in this study range from 140 to 280 m (Table 1). Partial recrystallization of foraminiferal tests is possible at such depths. For example, Sexton et al. [2006a, 2006b] showed evidence of micronscale secondary calcite, dissolution of primary calcite and broad etching of pores in foraminiferal tests from DSDP Sites 522 and 523 on the northern flank of the Walvis Ridge. We found similar evidence of diagenetic alteration as that described by Sexton et al. [2006a, 2006b] on the tests of planktonic foraminifera at Site 1267 (Figures 7 and 8). Abundant neomorphic calcite occurs as rounded crystallites that form mainly on interpore ridges, thereby obscuring the original surface wall texture (Figure 7). Diagenetic alteration is not limited to the test surface and SEM images of\nbroken wall cross sections also show evidence of weathering/dissolution and neomorphic replacement of calcite within the test interior (Figure 8). This type of diagenetic alteration of Paleogene foraminifera is apparently ubiquitous in deep-sea sediments for specimens that appear ‘‘frosty’’ under reflected light [Sexton et al., 2006b]."

    "heading": "5.3. The 87Sr/86Sr of Pore Water and Secondary Calcite",
    "text": "[14] The source of pore water Sr is the dissolution of carbonate in the upper part of the sediment column and diffusion of this strontium into the pore waters of the sediments above and below the zone of maximum dissolution [e.g., Baker et al., 1982]. For Site 1262, pore water strontium concentrations are low and suggest that some carbonate dissolution has occurred in the upper 75 mcd of the sediment column (Figure 4) [Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004a]. At Site 1267, strontium concentrations are higher than Site 1262 and indicate carbonate dissolution between 50 and 111 mcd [Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004b]. At Site 1265, the strontium pore water profile indicates a source of strontium to the interstitial waters below 148.7 mcd and diffusion of this strontium into the sediments above [Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004c].\n8 of 15\n[15] Because pore water Sr is derived from the dissolution of carbonate that is younger than the period studied, the 87Sr/86Sr values of interstitial water are higher than ratios measured on PaleoceneEocene foraminifera from the same sites (Figure 4). This implies that secondary calcite will likely have a greater 87Sr/86Sr ratio than the original foraminiferal test. As a result, secondary calcite overgrowths will tend to raise the 87Sr/86Sr of altered foraminifera above the Paleocene-Eocene seawater values.\n[16] The presence of some secondary calcite does not necessarily mean that 87Sr/86Sr ratios have been altered significantly because the magnitude of the change will depend upon the depth of diagenetic alteration in the sediment column and the amount and Sr concentration of secondary calcite added. For example, if neomorphic recrystallization occurred early in a near-closed system, then the secondary calcite will have a similar 87Sr/86Sr as the original foraminiferal shell. Numerical modeling indicates that carbonate diagenesis occurs predominantly at an early stage during shallow burial [Rudnicki et al., 2001]. In addition, the Sr content of recrystal-\nlized calcite is significantly lower than original foraminiferal calcite because the distribution coefficient is much less for inorganic than biogenic calcite [Baker et al., 1982]. Agreement among strontium isotope records from many deep-sea sites (Figure 6) suggests that diagenesis has not obscured the major trends in the strontium isotope composition of seawater. In addition to diagenesis, leaching of strontium from clays, which may not have been completely removed during vigorous sonic cleaning of foraminiferal tests, can also potentially raise the 87Sr/86Sr of samples above Paleocene-Eocene seawater.\n[17] To test whether clay-rich sediments yielded higher 87Sr/86Sr values compared to carbonate-rich sediment, we measured weight percent CaCO3 (Table 2). The deepest Site 1262 has the lowest %CaCO3 values (as low as 50%) and is the only site that shows a significant negative correlation (r = 0.79) between 87Sr/86Sr and %CaCO3. The most clay-rich samples occur just above the K/Pg boundary and give the highest 87Sr/86Sr values. Samples at the other sites generally have %CaCO3 values\n9 of 15\ngreater than 85% and show no significant correlation with 87Sr/86Sr."

    "text": "[18] Because of the potential for both diagenesis and unremoved clay to raise the 87Sr/86Sr above Paleocene-Eocene values for some samples, we approximated the strontium isotope seawater curve by fitting a weighted line through the lower 87Sr/86Sr values (Figure 5). A reasonable agreement is obtained with the long-term features of the McArthur seawater curve [McArthur et al., 2001]\nand excellent agreement is achieved with the data of Hess et al. [1986] (Figure 6).\n[19] In addition to long-term trends, several periods of particularly high 87Sr/86Sr values (i.e., ‘‘spikes’’) are recorded in the Leg 208 data between 65 and 45 Ma. These values are suspect because they are in the direction expected from diagenetic alteration or clay leaching and occur on timescales significantly shorter than the residence time of Sr in the oceans ( 3 Ma). Two high 87Sr/86Sr values (with an intervening lower value) occur in Site 1262 during the earliest Paleocene just above the K/Pg boundary (Figures 2 and 3). High values have been\n10 of 15\nreported near the K/Pg boundary in other sections [Hess et al., 1986; Martin and Macdougall, 1991; Vonhof and Smit, 1997; MacLeod et al., 2001], but McArthur et al. [1998] have argued these spikes result from analytical and diagenetic effects. Two samples with high 87Sr/86Sr also occur at 60 Ma in the middle Paleocene that rise above neighboring samples (Figure 3).\n[20] A cluster of high 87Sr/86Sr values straddle the Paleocene-Eocene boundary at Sites 1262 and 1267, but the increase in 87Sr/86Sr precedes the P/E boundary at both sites. At Site 1262, the two uppermost samples (140.75 and 143.02 mcd) measured with elevated 87Sr/86Sr clearly occur below the PETM as defined by the abrupt decrease in carbonate content and bulk d13C at 140.16 mcd [Zachos et al., 2005]. At Site 1267, the lowermost sample (231.98 mcd) with high 87Sr/86Sr also falls below the P/E boundary at 231.54 mcd (Figure 2). Increased continental weathering has been associated with the PETM on the basis of an increase in osmium isotopes [Ravizza et al., 2001] and a peak in kaolinite abundance [Kelly et al., 2005], but these changes occur above the boundary whereas the increase in 87Sr/86Sr values begins below. Furthermore, two relatively low 87Sr/86Sr values (229 and 227.5 mcd) at Site 1267 are interspersed within the cluster of high values near the PETM (Figure 2). Because the increase in 87Sr/86Sr values straddling the PETM at Sites 1262 and 1267 may be the result of diagenesis, determining whether this a genuine feature of the seawater curve must await high-resolution strontium isotope results over the PETM in other sections [Griffith et al., 2006]."

    "text": "[21] Variations in the strontium isotope composition of seawater are controlled by the relative inputs of Sr to the ocean from continental weathering (rivers), hydrothermal circulation, and carbonate dissolution on the seafloor [Brass, 1976; Palmer and Edmond, 1989]. Continental silicate rocks exhibit high 87Sr/86Sr values (averaging 0.716) whereas mantle-derived volcanic rocks have low 87Sr/86Sr values (averaging 0.704). Consequently, continental weathering generally acts to raise the 87Sr/86Sr of seawater, whereas hydrothermal exchange and weathering of volcanic rocks generally tend to lower it. The dissolution of carbonates on the seafloor acts as a buffer by adding old marine strontium to the oceans whose 87Sr/86Sr is not very different from seawater.\n[22] The decrease in 87Sr/86Sr values during the Paleocene and early Eocene ( 65 to 51 Ma) may be explained by a decrease in the mass flux of riverine Sr to the ocean, a decrease in the global average riverine 87Sr/86Sr value, and/or an increase in the mass flux of hydrothermal strontium from mid-ocean ridges. Changes in the global average riverine 87Sr/86Sr value are controlled mainly by the relative 87Sr/86Sr of exposed rocks undergoing weathering on the continents (e.g., ‘‘granitic’’ versus ‘‘basaltic’’) [Brass, 1976] and global weathering kinetics [Li et al., 2007]. Strontium isotope data alone do not allow distinction between these potential causes, but comparison of strontium isotope variation with other indicators of hydrothermal, weathering, and climatic processes can help constrain plausible explanations [Lear et al., 2003].\n[23] Several studies have proposed marked changes in volcanic and hydrothermal activity during the early Paleogene [Eldholm and Thomas, 1993; Bralower et al., 1997a; Rea et al., 1990; Thomas and Bralower, 2005]. The emplacement of the Deccan Traps near the K/T boundary and their subsequent weathering may have contributed to the Paleocene 87Sr/86Sr decline between 65 and 55 Ma [Vonhof and Smit, 1997; Dessert et al., 2001; Ravizza and Peucker-Ehrenbrink, 2003; Das et al., 2006]. In addition, massive volcanism associated with the emplacement and weathering of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) may have also contributed to decreasing 87Sr/86Sr values of seawater. NAIP magmatism occurred in two distinct phases. The first phase occurred in the middle Paleocene (62–58 Ma) when a large volume of flood basalts were erupted [Saunders et al., 1997; Knox, 1996, 1998]. The second phase started near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary and continued for ca. 1.5 to 2 m.y. during the early Eocene ( 56– 53 Ma) [Saunders et al., 1997; Knox, 1996, 1998; Jolley et al., 2002].\n[24] Rea et al. [1990] hypothesized enhanced seafloor hydrothermal activity occurred during Chron C24R (53.81–56.67 Ma) associated with a major tectonic reorganization. Although spreading rate has often been used to estimate the intensity of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal activity, tectonic reorganization, such as ridge jumps or changes in ridge orientation, may substantially increase hydrothermal activity by fracturing oceanic crust and providing seawater access to deep-seated heat sources [Lyle et al., 1987]. Such processes can decrease the 87Sr/86Sr of seawater even in the\n11 of 15\nabsence of a large increase in spreading rate, which may not have varied significantly during the Cenozoic [Rowley, 2002; Cogné and Humler, 2006].\n[25] Slightly greater rates of ocean crust production during the late Paleocene and early Eocene have been suggested as the cause for long-term sea level variations during this period [Miller et al., 2005]. Rising sea level between 65 to 52 Ma has been attributed to increases in ridge length, tectonic reorganization, and extrusion of 1–2 106 km3 of basalts of the Brito-Arctic province [Miller et al., 2005]. Alternatively, Cogné and Humler [2006] found that spreading and production rates at ocean ridges have been relatively constant for the past 180 Ma. If so, then sea level variations may be related to climate change rather than a response to changes in oceanic crustal production. Nonetheless, long-term changes in sea level and 87Sr/86Sr variations closely parallel one another during the Paleocene and early Eocene (Figure 9). From 65 to 52 Ma, there is a clear relationship between rising sea level and decreasing strontium isotope values. At 51–52 Ma, sea level begins to fall as 87Sr/86Sr starts to increase.\n[26] We propose that the 87Sr/86Sr decrease between 65 and 51 Ma was related to increased rates of hydrothermal activity and/or the eruption and weathering of large igneous provinces (e.g., the Deccan Traps andNorth Atlantic Igneous Province).\nThe mechanism is similar to that invoked for parts of the Cretaceous when low 87Sr/86Sr values of seawater have been linked to increased ocean crust production associated with the eruption of large igneous provinces [Ingram et al., 1994; Bralower et al., 1997b; Jones and Jenkyns, 2001].\n[27] Volcanic processes may have also affected climate through atmospheric CO2 feedbacks. Over long timescales, atmospheric CO2 is controlled by volcanic and metamorphic outgassing and consumption of CO2 during silicate weathering and organic carbon burial [Berner et al., 1983; Berner and Kothavala, 2001]. Mantle outgassing of CO2 during tectonic reorganization and the eruption of the NAIP has been proposed to explain the longterm warming trend that began at 59 Ma and peaked at 51 Ma [Rea et al., 1990; Zachos et al., 2001; Thomas and Bralower, 2005; Miller et al., 2005].\n[28] The high sea levels and low 87Sr/86Sr values of the late Paleocene and early Eocene are also associated with the decreasing benthic foraminiferal d18O values, indicating increasing deep-water temperatures that culminated in the warmest period of the Cenozoic during the EECO [Zachos et al., 2001]. Oxygen isotopes and 87Sr/86Sr closely parallel one another from 59 to 52 Ma when both records decrease reaching minimum values during the early Eocene when sea level is at a maximum\n12 of 15\n(Figure 9). This 1.5% decrease in d18O between 59 and 52 Ma represents the most pronounced warming trend of the Cenozoic [Zachos et al., 2001]. At 51 Ma, benthic d18O begins to increase indicating cooling at the same time as 87Sr/86Sr starts to increase and sea level begins to fall (Figure 9).\n[29] The close correspondence between sea level, 87Sr/86Sr, and benthic d18O changes during the late Paleocene and early Eocene is consistent with previous studies relating tectonic reorganization and increased volcanism to high sea level, high CO2, and warm global temperatures [Rea et al., 1990; Zachos et al., 2001; Thomas and Bralower, 2005; Miller et al., 2005]. The exact nature of the link between volcanic activity, such as the eruption of a large igneous provinces (LIPs), and global climate change remains uncertain, however. For example, Self et al. [2005] argued that the amount of CO2 released during a flood basalt eruption is too small to have had a significant impact on atmospheric CO2. In the case of the NAIP, however, intrusion of voluminous mantle-derived melts into carbon-rich sedimentary strata may have led to the release of significant amounts of greenhouse gases [Svensen et al., 2004; Storey et al., 2007].\n[30] Kastings and Richardson [1985] pointed out that the BLAG model predicts only a weak connection between hydrothermal activity and atmospheric CO2, but Eocene warming could be explained if the rate of carbonate metamorphism increased proportional to total mid-ocean ridge length. The largest change in ridge length of the Cenozoic occurred between 60 and 50 Ma [Cande and Kent, 1992] associated with a significant global reorganization of spreading ridges and initiation of seafloor spreading in the NorwegianGreenland Sea during Chron 24r [Tsikalas et al., 2002]."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "[31] Multiple hypotheses have been put forth to explain the long-term increase in temperature during the early Paleogene that culminated in the EECO ( 55 to 52 Ma). One mechanism is enhanced rates of volcanic activity associated with tectonic reorganization and eruption of the NAIP, which provided a source of atmospheric CO2 that led to global warming [Rea et al., 1990]. Our strontium isotope results are correlated with both long-term variations in sea level and benthic d18O during the Paleocene-early Eocene (Figure 9). If sea level rise in the late Paleocene-early Eocene is\ncaused by changes in ocean basin volume related to increased seafloor spreading rates and/or ocean ridge lengths [Miller et al., 2005], then a plausible explanation for decreasing strontium isotope values is increased hydrothermal activity and/or increased weathering of volcanic terrains between 65 and 51 Ma. Increased rates of ocean-crust production and emplacement of the NAIP may have led to increased rates of volcanic-CO2 outgassing and contributed to the long-term warming trend that began at 59 Ma and peaked at 51Ma [Rea et al., 1990; Zachos et al., 2001; Thomas and Bralower, 2005; Miller et al., 2005]."

  "abstractText": "[1] We refined the strontium isotope seawater curve for the Paleocene and early Eocene by analysis of samples recovered from the Walvis Ridge during Ocean Drilling Project (ODP) Leg 208. The highest Sr/Sr values occurred in the earliest Paleocene at 65 Ma and generally decreased throughout the Paleocene, reaching minimum values between 53 and 51 Ma in the early Eocene before beginning to increase again at 50 Ma. A plausible explanation for the Sr/Sr decrease between 65 and 51 Ma is increased rates of hydrothermal activity and/or the eruption and weathering of large igneous provinces (e.g., Deccan Traps and North Atlantic). Strontium isotope variations closely parallel sea level and benthic dO changes during the late Paleocene and early Eocene, supporting previous studies linking tectonic reorganization and increased volcanism to high sea level, high CO2, and warm global temperatures.",
