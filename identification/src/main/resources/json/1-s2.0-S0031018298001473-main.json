Within this publication, we present our results for the Adriatic key sites, Malo Jezero and Veliko Jezero, two coastal lakes on the island Mljet, Croatia (Fig. 1). These two lakes were selected because former studies indicated that these lakes were influenced by climate as well as the Adriatic Sea.\n0031-0182/99/$ – see front matter  1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nThe first studies of the sediments of Malo Jezero focused on laminae and their origin (Seibold, 1958; Seibold et al., 1958; Seibold and Wiegert, 1960), followed by reconstructions of the Holocene vegetation history via pollen analysis (e.g. Beug, 1961, 1962). From the latter, however, doubts arose as to whether the 1956 cored sequence was complete. Therefore, in 1986, additional long cores were taken from Malo Jezero and for the first time also from Veliko Jezero, with the aim of combining vegetation and lake history. Jahns (1988, 1991) performed pollen analyses on the sediment cores of both lakes and found four main pollen zones (cf. Fig. 6): Quercus pubescens, Juniperus=Phillyrea, Quercus ilex, and Pinus zone. The climatic implications were a\nwarm and dry climate, combined with mild winters during the Juniperus=Phillyrea zone (ca. 7.1–5.5 kyr B.P.). The subsequent expansion of Quercus ilex at ca. 5.4 kyr B.P. was explained by immigration dynamics and not by climate change. Additionally, the Malo Jezero sediment core was dated by conventional 14C dating on total organic matter of bulk sediment samples of 2.5 cm core sections; contamination by dissolved carbon due to water inflow through karst (see Fig. 2a) cannot be excluded.\nConcerning lake development, Jahns (1991) found marked changes in the aquatic pollen assemblages that indicated an early freshwater period in contrast to the present marine environment. Referring to the phenomenon of the Holocene transgression in the\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 253\n254 S.

However, based on the pollen stratigraphy, Jahns (1991) could not present a more detailed description and dating of the sea level dynamics. Based on diatom analysis, Schmidt (1993) dated a freshwater period in the time interval from 7.5 to 5 kyr B.P. in Malo Jezero. Pigment analysis of the Malo Jezero core by Schultze (1988–1989) revealed a pigment concentration maximum between 7.1 and 5.4 kyr B.P. that was interpreted as period of high in-lake productivity under warm and dry climatic conditions.\nOur new investigations are based on diatom, geochemical and mineralogical analyses of the sediment cores taken in 1986. They focus on core sections with freshwater and brackish influence; pure marine sections were omitted from the analyses. For a better interpretation of salinity preferences of diatom taxa found in the cores, recent diatom assemblages of Adriatic=Mediterranean coastal lakes were investigated with respect to salinity."

    "text": "Malo and Veliko Jezero are two doline lakes within highly permeable limestone of Cretaceous age (Schubert, 1909). Veliko consists of three basins, the deepest being 46 m. The lake is connected by a shallow channel (Soline) with the Adriatic Sea. Its present depth at the entrance to Veliko is about 2.5 m. The connection to Malo Jezero (29 m maximum depth) is via an artificial channel (less than 1 m deep). Both channels exhibit distinct tidal currents. According to Buljan and Špan (1976), the surface water of both lakes shows a gradient from high salinity in Veliko Jezero (1951: 30.03–36.20‰), because of direct influence by the Adriatic tidal currents, to lower salinity in Malo Jezero (29.18–34.23‰). For Malo Jezero they assumed a direct subterranean connection with the sea. Seibold (1958) observed in Malo Jezero increasing salinity with depth, forming a chemocline and an oxygen-depleted monimolimnion rich in H2S. Echographs indicate freshwater incursions in Malo by subaquatic karstic springs (see Fig. 2a).\n3. Material and methods\n3.1. Coring\nIn 1986 sediment echo soundings were performed prior to site selection for the coring. In Figs. 1 and 2 the location of cores and selected echo sounding profiles are illustrated. The sediment cores were taken with a modified Kullenberg piston corer (Schultze and Niederreiter, 1990). The core from Malo Jezero (MJ1) was 485 cm long, the core from Veliko Jezero (VJ2) was 442 cm.\n3.2. Diatoms\nThe diatom subsamples were prepared according to standard techniques as described in Battarbee (1986). At least 500 valves per sample were counted with a Leitz Diaplan light microscope, ð100 oil immersion objective. Photographs were taken with a ð100 oil objective (n.a. 1.32) and bright field illumination. Magnification of the photographs was standardised to ð1500. Scanning electron microscopy was performed with a Jeol JSM-35. For the stratigraphic plots, the program TILIA 1.12, written by E. Grimm was used. Only taxa with the highest abundances and important indicator species were graphed. An age scale was derived by linear interpolation of the 14C dates obtained from MJ1 (Jahns, 1991). The calculated ages for the pollen zone boundaries were transferred to the pollen zones in VJ1 and VJ2. Based on the transferred ages, an age scale was calculated for VJ2.\nTo infer past salinity changes in Malo and Veliko, the recent distribution of selected key taxa of MJ1 and VJ2 was analysed from sediment surface samples taken with a gravity corer from 26 Adriatic=Mediterranean coastal lakes. Simultaneously, salinity and conductivity were measured in the surface water of these lakes. Missing data were taken from the literature. Species identification followed Hustedt (1930, 1961–1966), Prasad et al. (1990), BMB/WG 27 (1993, 1994, 1995, 1996), Witkowski (1994) and Wunsam et al. (1995).\n3.3. Numerical methods\nCanonical correspondence analysis (Ter Braak, 1987) was used to identify which environmental\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 255\nparameters were correlated with the modern distribution of selected taxa that were important in the fossil records.\nThe reconstruction of past environmental changes was supported by an analog-matching procedure. Using the squared chi-squared dissimilarity coefficient (compare Birks et al., 1990), the most similar coastal lake in respect to diatom composition was listed for each fossil sample. The calculations were performed with the computer programs CANOCO (Ter Braak, 1987) and ANALOG 1.6 written by J.M. Line.\n3.4. Geochemistry=mineralogy\nSediment analysis included bulk mineralogy by X-ray diffraction. Total-sulphur, inorganic carbon and organic carbon were analysed by IR-spectrometry as SO2 and CO2 after combustion in an induction furnace. Carbon analysis proceeded in two steps: determination of total-carbon was followed by acid leaching of inorganic carbonates and subsequent combustion of organic carbon. Quantification of the carbonate phases calcite, Mg-calcite, and aragonite was done by combining results of C-inorganic determinations with peak-area measurements of respective phases from the X-ray diffraction pattern using calibration curves for mixtures of calcite=aragonite and calcite=Mg-calcite (Müller and Müller, 1967; J. Müller, 1969).\n4. Results\n4.1. Core descriptions\nBased on colour, texture and lamination type, core MJ1 can be divided into the following units (Fig. 3).\nThe lowermost unit reaches from the base of the core to a core depth of 245 cm. This unit is characterised by dark hues ranging from black to brown. The unit appears structurally homogenous except for a section (355–310 cm) containing abundant plant remains and a light brown intercalation at 322–317 cm. A tephra layer is found at core depth 300–295 cm.\nThe following unit (245–160 cm) contrasts to the lower section by the onset of a fine lamination on a millimetre scale. Dark hues dominate in the lower portion (245–190 cm); within the subsequent section (190–160 cm), light laminations are dominant.\nThe next unit (160–138 cm) differs from the proceeding section by the lack of a distinct lamination and dark hues.\nThe uppermost unit (138–0 cm) starts with light colours and the onset of lamination, which appears less distinct than in the lower second unit. Intercalations of dark laminae are irregular and different in thickness (millimetres to centimetres).\nLaminations become diffuse in the subunit 110– 75 cm and become more pronounced, with the sediment getting darker, in the next section (70–50 cm), which contains centimetre-thick light intercalations (62–58 cm, 55–53 cm). Above, dark laminations get rare and more diffuse and grade into a light homogenous section of the uppermost core portion.\nCore VJ2 from Veliko Jezero exhibits a partially comparable pattern with respect to the sequence of units.\nThe base of the core (442–330 cm) appears roughly homogenous and no diatoms are detected. The lowermost section that contains diatoms (330– 235 cm) shows similar dark colours like the lowermost section in MJ1, but contains more and thicker brown intercalations and less plant remains. A thick homogenous dark subunit is topped by a tephra layer as in the core of Malo Jezero.\nIn contrast to the situation in Malo Jezero, lamination on a centimetre scale starts right above the tephra layer at the base of the next unit (235–113 cm). Above 190 cm the thickness of laminae decreases and brownish light hues appear. At 150 cm, a second tephra layer occurs.\nThe uppermost section (113–0 cm) is dominated by a light colour; intercalations of dark laminae are irregular and less pronounced.\n4.2. Diatoms\nBased on diatom and siliceous cyst assemblages of the sediment core samples of MJ1 the following zones were distinguished according to their dominant elements (Fig. 4).\n(1) Siliceous cyst zone (360–335 cm; interpolated age 8.8–8.3 kyr B.P.)\nSiliceous cysts were the most abundant microfossils in the lowest sediment section (2–300% of the diatom sum). Most of the diatoms valves present were badly preserved and could not be classified\n256 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\ninto genera or species. Hence, many of the counted diatom valves were grouped in the category of unidentified pennate diatoms (4–23%). Clearly identifiable and abundant pennate taxa were Caloneis silicula (4–18%), Diploneis smithii var. dilatata (7– 14%), Epithemia adnata (6–27%), Mastogloia braunii (16%), Navicula oblonga (5–27%), and Tabularia fasciculata (2–18%). The centric forms were represented by Cyclotella meneghiniana (2–8%).\n(2) Fragilaria brevistriata zone (335–295 cm; interpolated age 8.3–7.4 kyr B.P.)\nFrom this zone towards the top of the core, valves were generally preserved well. While siliceous cysts decreased to low numbers (from 39 to 1% of the diatom sum), Fragilaria brevistriata became the most abundant diatom species (6–77%). Aside from Caloneis silicula (0.2–4%), Navicula oblonga (0.4–14%) and Cyclotella meneghiniana (0.2–25%),\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 pp. 257–258\npp. 259–260 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 261\nwhich were already present in the lower zone, new subdominant species like Amphora commutata (2– 19%), Mastogloia braunii (2–5%) and Nitzschia scalaris (1–27%) characterised this zone.\n(3) Fragilaria brevistriata=F. sopotensis zone (295–275 cm; interpolated age 7.4–7.3 kyr B.P.)\nAfter a short invasion of Fragilaria sopotensis (0.2–25%) and Diploneis smithii var. dilatata (0.2– 36%), F. brevistriata regained dominance (8–75%). The accompanying periphytic diatom assemblage composition changed completely compared to the former zones; Amphora pediculus (1–6%), Cymbella microcephala (1–9%), Navicula capitata var. hungarica (2–23%) and Mastogloia smithii var. lacustris (0.2–11%) appeared. C. meneghiniana almost completely disappeared from the assemblage (0.2%); instead Cyclotella ocellata s.l. (C. ocellata, C. aff. ocellata) and C. aff. krammeri were detected in low abundances (0.2–11%).\n(4) Cyclotella ocellata s.l. zone (275–251 cm; interpolated age 7.3–7.2 kyr B.P.)\nCyclotella aff. ocellata (2–53%) and C. aff. krammeri (0.2–25%) became the dominant taxa towards the top of this zone (for taxonomy cf. Wunsam et al., 1995); in contrast, Fragilaria brevistriata gradually disappeared (from 13 to 0.4%).\n(5) Achnanthes minutissima=Cymbella microcephala zone (251–235 cm; interpolated age 7.2–7.1 kyr B.P.)\nThe centric diatoms, which characterised the former zone, almost completely vanished except for a few valves of C. ocellata (0.2–6%). Instead, Achnanthes minutissima (8–30%) and Cymbella microcephala (14–23%) prevailed. Additionally, Brachysira aponina (1–16%), Cymbella caespitosa (1–8%), C. pusilla (4–10%), and Mastogloia smithii var. lacustris (3–14%) became abundant and the number of siliceous cysts temporarily increased (3–33% of the diatom sum).\n(6) Cyclotella ocellata zone (235–210 cm, interpolated age 7.1–6.3 kyr B.P.)\nThe most abundant diatom in this zone was C. ocellata (56–90% relative abundance). Cyclotella distinguenda var. unipunctata (2–11%) and Cyclotella morphotypes with two punctae, called C. cretica var. cyclopuncta by Schmidt (1993), were present in low abundances (1–3%).\n(7) Cyclotella distinguenda var. unipunctata zone\n(210–158 cm; interpolated age 6.3–5.0 kyr B.P.) Compared to the lower section, the abundance of Cyclotella ocellata declined from 50 to 10%. In contrast, C. distinguenda var. unipunctata increased to high abundances (17–87%). Additionally, Cyclotella cretica morphotypes sensu Schmidt (1993) were observed with percentages about 10%; towards the top of the zone F. brevistriata increased slightly (maximum 5%).\n(8) Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana zone (158–125 cm; interpolated age 5.0–4.3 kyr B.P.)\nThe centric C. choctawhatcheeana was the predominant taxon with at least 70% relative abundance. The former dominant centric taxa completely disappeared; only a few valves of C. distinguenda var. unipunctata remained within this zone (lower than 5%). Chaetoceros spp. (1–17%; represented by resting spores) and Achnanthes fogedii (2–6%) were detected for the first time, other taxa like Diploneis smithii var. dilatata (3–9%) or Fragilaria pinnata (1–4%) reappeared within this sediment section.\n(9) Diploneis=Chaetoceros zone (125–86 cm; interpolated age 4.3–3.5 kyr B.P.)\nDiploneis bombus (5–17%), Diploneis smithii var. dilatata (1–9%), D. coffaeiformis (3–19%) became abundant and Navicula pseudocrassirostris (1–12%) appeared. Resting spores of Chaetoceros (2–17%), Paralia sulcata (1–2%), and C. choctawhatcheeana (1–8%) represented centric taxa.\n(10) Achnanthes spp. zone (86–61 cm; interpolated age 3.5–2.7 kyr B.P.)\nAchnanthes fogedii (1–10%), A. submarina (1– 49%), and, towards the top of the zone, A. minutissima (1–70%) became dominant at the expense of the former taxa. Actinocyclus octonarius (1–14%) appeared in the uppermost sample.\nCore VJ2 was divided in the following stratigraphic zones and subzones (Fig. 5):\n(1) Fragilaria zone (330–235 cm; upper boundary 7.4 yr B.P.)\nThis interval was dominated by Fragilaria spp. By changing abundances of the latter and accompanying taxa it was subdivided into:\n(1=1) Fragilaria brevistriata subzone (330–285 cm)\nAs in the ‘siliceous cyst zone’ of MJ1, most of the diatoms were badly preserved and many of\n262 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nthe valves could only be classified as unidentified pennate (1–41%). However, in contrast to MJ1, the amount of siliceous cysts in the respective zone of VJ2 remained comparably low (1–30% of the diatom sum).\nThe most important diatom genus throughout this sediment section was Fragilaria spp. F. brevistriata with approximately 50% abundance. F. construens f. venter (1–29%), F. aff. elliptica (7–35%), and F. sopotensis (5%) were accompanying taxa. Other subdominant pennate taxa were Achnanthes fogedii (maximum 5%), Epithemia adnata (maximum 3%), and Navicula oblonga (2–12%). Towards the top of the zone, single valves of Cyclotella ocellata, C. aff. ocellata and C. meneghiniana appeared in the diatom assemblage and Chaetoceros resting spores were occasionally observed.\n(1=2) Fragilaria aff. elliptica subzone (285–260 cm)\nF. aff. elliptica (5–46%) and Navicula oblonga (1–44%) strongly increased at the expense of F. brevistriata (minimum 2%). From the centrales, a slight increase of Cyclotella aff. krammeri (1–2%) and Cyclotella ocellata s.l. (1–10%) compared to zone (1=1) could be recorded; C. meneghiniana and Chaetoceros resting spores were only occasionally found, as in the previous zone. New subdominant taxa appearing in this zone were e.g. Amphora libyca (maximum 7%) and Campylodiscus clypeus (2–15%).\n(1=3) Fragilaria brevistriata=Cyclotella meneghiniana subzone (260–235 cm)\nAt the beginning of this subzone, F. brevistriata regained dominance (maximum 85%), followed by the prevalence of C. meneghiniana (1–37%) and N. oblonga (1–49%). Towards the top of the zone, siliceous cysts (4–215% of the diatom sum) and taxa belonging to the genus Chaetoceros (1–23%) became the most important parts of the assemblage; this phenomenon is evidenced by the presence of their resting stages.\n(2) Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana zone (235–100 cm; transferred age 7.4–3.1 kyr B.P.)\nFrom 235 to 100 cm, a predominance of Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana, with 44 to 99% relative abundance, was observed. Variability in the fine structure of C. choctawhatcheeana and additionally the presence of some subdominants enabled five subzones to be distinguished.\n(2=1) Diploneis spp.=C. choctawhatcheeana ‘large’ subzone (235–205 cm)\nDiploneis bombus formed a marked peak in the beginning and in the end of the zone (25%, 13%) with C. choctawhatcheeana ‘large’ in between (18– 26%). Campylodiscus clypeus, D. coffaeiformis, D. pseudovalis, D. smithii var. dilatata and Navicula capitata var. hungarica were observed in low percentages (generally lower than 1%).\n(2=2) Brachysira aponina subzone (205–170 cm) Whereas C. choctawhatcheeana continued to be the most abundant taxon (66–95%), a remarkable change in the subdominant diatom flora was observed. New subdominant taxa were Brachysira aponina with a maximum of 26% and a few exemplars of Navicula aff. cryptotenella (maximum 5%), Navicula perminuta (<1%), and Nitzschia elegantula (maximum 8%). Some Diploneis taxa, which were already found in the previous zone were still present, however, only occasionally (Diploneis coffaeiformis 1%, Diploneis smithii var. dilatata 1–3%).\n(2=3) C. choctawhatcheeana ‘small’ subzone (170–120 cm)\nA small morphotype of Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana (called C. hakanssoniae f. atomoides by Schmidt, 1993) replaced C. choctawhatcheeana ‘large’ towards the top of the zone (8–80%). Furthermore, numerous new taxa like Actinocyclus octonarius (1–2%), Amphora coffeaeformis (ca. 1%), Fragilaria elliptica (1–6%), Thalassiosira sp. (1– 3%), Navicula clamans (1–6%), and Paralia sulcata (1–2%) were observed in very low abundances. Achnanthes fogedii (1–5%) and Fragilaria sopotensis (1–3%) reappeared.\n(2=4) C. cf. choctawhatcheeana subzone (120– 105 cm)\nA fine-structured morphotype of C. choctawhatcheeana (possibly C. caspia) displaced the former C. choctawhatcheeana morphotypes and became dominant (71–93%). The composition of the accompanying diatom flora was very similar to the former subzone (2=3).\n(2=5) Chaetoceros=Dimeregramma spp. subzone (105–100 cm)\nC. cf. choctawhatcheeana disappeared and C. choctawhatcheeana regained dominance (44–49%). In addition to subdominant taxa characterising the former zone, Chaetoceros resting spores (4–6%)\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 263\nwere recorded again and Dimeregramma spp. appeared (6%).\n4.3. Analog matching\nFrom the 159 diatom taxa found in the Malo Jezero sediment core, 73 were found again in the recent samples of the Mediterranean coastal lakes. From the 154 taxa found in VJ2, 66 were observed in the recent data set, which contained 366 taxa in total.\nCanonical correspondence analysis of the 73 recent analog diatom taxa of MJ1 and lake environmental parameters (Table 1) selected depth and salinity as factors correlated with the distribution of these taxa. The same result was obtained for the 66 recent analog taxa of VJ2. Light microscopic photographs (Plates I–IV, Appendix A) and relative abundances of selected diatom species with respect to salinity (Figs. 7–10) are provided.\nThe results of analog matching based on the squared chi-squared dissimilarity coefficient and performed with the program ANALOG 1.6 are summarised in Table 2 for MJ1, in Table 3 for VJ2.\nIn MJ1, dissimilarity coefficients lower than 0.5 were obtained for the core section 232–205 cm; in the interval 235–270 cm, the highest dissimilarity coefficients (up to 1.7206) were calculated.\nIn VJ2, dissimilarity coefficients lower than 1 were only calculated for the core section below the deposition of the lower tephra (235 cm). In the Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana zone, dissimilarity coefficients higher than 1 were obtained.\n4.4. Mineralogy\nThe proportions of selected sediment components (Mg-calcite, aragonite, calcite, Corg, S-total) are illustrated in Fig. 5.\n4.4.1. Malo Jezero (Fig. 5a) From all the elements measured, sulphur was high in the lowermost section, at 440 cm, followed by an increase in Corg at 400 cm. The latter peaked in the section 350–300 cm (maximum 21.5%), together with a peak of calcite at 315 cm. Calcite deposition continued with lower values up to 240 cm. Corg strongly fluctuated up to 60 cm within a range of\n2.5 to 12%. Deposition of Mg-calcite started at 230 cm depth, forming a maximum at 160 cm. In the uppermost core section it was replaced by aragonite formation.\n4.4.2. Veliko Jezero (Fig. 5b) Maximum values of Corg were observed at 330, 310, 250, and 160 cm. Mg-calcite deposition started at 340 cm, peaking at 290 cm and 260 cm. After a gap between 250 and 210 cm, the deposition started again with a smaller peak at 200 cm, continuing with low values up to 100 cm. Aragonite started at 310 cm, peaking at 270 cm. After a short gap where calcite peaked (250 cm), the aragonite values rose again up to a level of about 50 to 80% in the interval 170 to 100 cm. Sulphur exhibited a peak at 330 cm core depth."

    "text": "Diatom zones and pollen stratozones (Jahns, 1991) of Malo Jezero (MJ1) and Veliko Jezero (VJ2) and core dating of MJ1 (Jahns, 1991) are summarised in Fig. 6.\nWe discussed the lake evolution in four time intervals. They are delimited by the deposition of the lower tephra, by the presence of freshwater incursions, and by changes to a brackish–marine environment.\n5.1. Section older than 7.3 kyr B.P. (below the tephra)\nVransko Jezero (Biograd) was selected as the most similar recent coastal lake for the oldest lake period in Veliko Jezero (corresponding to the Fragilaria brevistriata zone). Vransko Jezero is a shallow lake (4 m) and shows a slightly brackish environment (2.59‰ salinity). Fragilaria brevistriata, one dominant diatom taxon in this period, occurs over a wide range of salinity values in the analog set. Additionally Fragilaria brevistriata is known as a species characteristic for the late-glacial lake periods, tolerating rapidly changing environmental conditions and allochthonous input (e.g. Lotter and Hölzer, 1994). Pollen of Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Sparganium indicate the existence of a shallow lake with high produc-\n264 S.W unsam et al./Palaeogeography, Palaeoclim atology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nS.

The increasing electrolyte content, as inferred from the Mg-calcite curve, could be caused either by evaporation conditions (G. Müller, 1969) or marine influence. The latter is likely because of findings of Hystrichosphaeridae, cysts of probably marine algae, in the respective sediment section (Jahns, 1991). However, since the lake bottom of Veliko lies within the sea level range expected by Correggiari et al. (1996) for the Holocene=Pleistocene boundary ( 42 to 52 m), distinctly below the threshold of the Soline channel, seawater could be only transmitted through the karstic bedrock. Since elevated sea\n266 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nsurface temperatures and salinity mentioned for the Thyrrenean (Kallel et al., 1997) indicate an increase in evaporation for the early Holocene, evaporation\nmay also be responsible for the increased salinity in Veliko Jezero.\nThe second stage in lake development in Veliko Jezero (Fragilaria aff. elliptica subzone) is characterised by a rapid increase in aragonite. Mg-calcite and aragonite precipitate due to changes in water composition (i.e. Mg=Ca-ratios, alkalinity, salinity) or due to mixing of water bodies of different salinities (Müller et al., 1972; Jones and Browser, 1978).\nLow numbers of planktonic freshwater Cyclotella (Cyclotella aff. ocellata and C. aff. krammeri) indicate the presence of a weakly stratified lake. Symptoms of increasing salinity are two subdominant species, aside from Fragilaria aff. elliptica: C. clypeus, which is considered a ‘lagoonary form’ found in ion-rich freshwater and slightly brackish waters (Cleve-Euler, 1952) which corresponds to occurrences in the analog set; and N. oblonga, which occurs in alkaline water and tolerates oxygen depletion and higher concentrations of H2S (Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1986). The two observations in the analog set range between 2 and 6‰ salinity. The observation of changing salinity was also supported by ostracod analyses of the respective core section, which revealed taxa tolerating increasing salinity, e.g. Candona angulata, Cyprideis torosa, Cypridopsis vidua, Cypris bispinosa, Darwinula stevenssoni, and Heterocypris salinus. As a result F. aff. elliptica replaced F. brevistriata. The decrease of pollen from swamp vegetation (Jahns, 1991) indicates an increasing lake depth. Lake level rise could be caused by an upward migrating sea level.\nThe most similar recent lake for this zone was Stagno di Platamona, a shallow, eutrophic lagoon completely separated from the sea with 90% Campylodiscus clypeus. The salinity of this lagoon was low (3‰), however, high dissimilarity coefficients demonstrate the limited comparability of Stagno di Platamona with the respective lake period in Veliko Jezero.\nIn the last stage of lake development before the deposition of tephra ca. 7.5–7.3 kyr B.P. (Cyclotella meneghiniana subzone 1.3), massive freshwater incursions were inferred from the marked peak of calcite, the disappearance of Mg-calcite and aragonite, and the fact that Fragilaria brevistriata regained dominance. The peak of C. meneghiniana, a species common in freshwater of high ion content (cf. Krammer\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 267\nand Lange-Bertalot, 1991), occurred in the period of calcite deposition. Just before tephra deposition, peaks of Chaetoceros resting spores and siliceous cysts indicate a sudden increase in salinity and hence environmental stress. This is supported by the results of analog matching, which selected Vransko Jezero (Biograd) as the analog for the freshwater-influenced\nperiod (2.59‰ salinity) and Bellóccchio for the period rich in Chaetoceros resting spores and siliceous cysts (13.1‰ salinity). It is interesting that the formation of cysts and resting spores occurred just before the deposition of tephra. Possibly, floods or earthquakes accompanying the volcanic eruption led to seawater input into Veliko Jezero.\n268 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nThe onset of lake development in Malo Jezero was inferred to be earlier than 8.4 kyr B.P. (a value of 8.8 kyr B.P. was calculated by extrapolation). Jahns (1991) assumed that the lake development of Malo Jezero started later than that of Veliko Jezero, because the initial period of higher Pinus and Betula pollen contents and lower contents of Corylus and Ulmus observed in VJ1 could not be distinguished in\nthe Quercus pubescens section of MJ1. According to Jahns, the rising sea level led to a high groundwater level and consequently the filling of the lake basins. Because the depth of Malo Jezero (29 m) is less than that of Veliko Jezero (46 m), the latter could have filled up earlier.\nThe initial stage of Malo Jezero development was marked by a peak of siliceous cysts (siliceous\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 269\ncyst zone). Findings of chrysophycean pigments in the respective sediment section (Schultze, 1988– 1989) suggest that these cysts originated from chrysophytes. Because of their short generation period, chrysophytes are generally considered to be competitive in short-term limnic systems. The low diversity of epiphytic diatoms, as well as the lack of pollen suggest the existence of a very shallow, temporar-\nily filled lake basin. The occurrences of Diploneis smithii var. dilatata and Tabularia fasciculata indicate at least brackish influence. In the analog set, the former was found only once, at brackish conditions; the latter showed a wide range from slightly brackish to brackish conditions, as did Cyclotella meneghiniana, to which most of the corroded centric valves of this zone belong. Analog matching\n270 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nsuggested Bellócchio and Fossa piave 1 as the most similar recent analogs for the siliceous cyst period. Both lakes show elevated salinity (13.1 and 17.6‰, respectively), confirming the ecological interpretation of diatom remains. The increased salinity was correlated with the upward migrating sea level.\nThe development of an environment rich in macrophytes (Fragilaria brevistriata zone) was dated at ca. 8.3 kyr B.P. Increasing freshwater influence was\ninferred from pollen records of the Sparganium type, the Typha latifolia type, Potamogeton (sect. Eupotamogeton and Coleogeton), the Myriophyllum verticillatum=spicatum type, Nymphaea (Beug, 1961; Jahns, 1988, 1991), the periphytic diatom assemblage, and the peak in calcite. This is supported by the recent analogs for this period: Vransko Jezero (Biograd) and Valle Mandriola, showing a remarkably lower salinity compared to the preceding zone (2.59 and 0.1‰).\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 271\nThe high values of organic carbon were probably caused by increased organic production (mainly macrophytes). Probably the Fragilaria brevistriata zone in Malo Jezero corresponds to the same time period as the Cyclotella meneghiniana subzone in Veliko Jezero, when freshwater incursions predominated. In this case, the water of both lakes showed a corresponding environmental change from a higher to lower salinity.\n5.2. Section 7.3–7.1 kyr B.P. (end of Quercus pubescens zone)\nAn important correlation marker in both lakes was the deposition of a 1–2 cm thick tephra layer, dated at 7365 š 190 yr B.P. Geochemistry and mineral components indicate a Campanian provenience (J. Müller, in prep.). However, at 7 kyr B.P. a tephrachronology for the Southern Adriatic (core\n272 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\nKET8216, Fontugne et al., 1989) revealed only rhyolite from the Eolian islands (E1). Paterne et al. (1988) found in other cores from the Thyrrenian an additional Campanian tephra layer (C0) at 7 kyr B.P.\nWithin the relatively short period of 200 years, between the deposition of tephra and the onset of the Juniperus-Phillyrea zone, ca. 7.1 kyr B.P., both lakes underwent remarkable changes. In Veliko Jezero a sudden increase in salinity could be reconstructed. A peak of Diploneis bombus and Navicula capitata var. hungarica was followed by the predominance of Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana. The analog matching showed a change from Bellócchio to Fiume Reno, with 13.1 and 24.8‰ salinity, respectively. Since the diatom plankton characterising the present marine environment in Veliko Jezero (Pucher-Petkovič, 1957) was lacking, we assumed a brackish lake stage caused by the transport of seawater through the karstic bedrock rather than by superficial input through the Soline channel. Our hypothesis is supported by Correggiari et al. (1996) and Lambeck (1995), who reconstructed the relative sea level in the Adriatic and eastern Mediterranean for the time interval 7 to 6 kyr B.P. to be ca. 10 m below the present level, significantly lower than the depth of the Soline channel ( 2.5 m). Tectonic movements related to the volcanic eruptions may have opened subterranean passages that led to sudden seawater input into the lake.\nC. choctawhatcheeana continued to be the dominant diatom taxon in Veliko until 100 cm core depth. This taxon tolerates salinity fluctuations, which are common in brackish estuaries (Wendker, 1991). Abundance distribution in the analog set, as illustrated in Fig. 8, shows that C. choctawhatcheeana occurs at a broad range in salinity from 8 to 30‰. Schmidt (1993) assumed that different morphotypes of C. hakanssoniae (synonymous with C. choctawhatcheeana, according to Håkansson et al., 1993) found in VJ2 depend on the range in salinity. Larger morphotypes (C. choctawhatcheeana large) with more than one central strutted process were more frequent in less saline environments, while smaller ones (C. choctawhatcheeana small) with only one strutted process (called f. atomoides) were more common under higher saline conditions. The establishment of the brackish environment corresponds to an increase in aragonite.\nAn increasing content of taxa preferring a brack-\nish environment in Veliko Jezero was related to the temporary expansion of these taxa in Malo Jezero. Raised proportions of e.g. Diploneis smithii var. dilatata, F. sopotensis, and of Navicula capitata var. hungarica were attributed to high salinity in Malo Jezero. In contrast, a change in salinity was not reconstructed either by analog matching or by mineralogy. Since F. sopotensis tolerates salinity fluctuations and occurs with Diploneis smithii in salt marshes (Witkowski, 1994), the existence of a shallow lake with low salinity is more likely.\nThe subsequent change in the diatom assemblage was accompanied by the appearance of Fragilaria spp. The Fragilaria-dominated zone was followed by the expansion of Cyclotella ocellata s.l. and increasing values of calcite. Analog matching suggested that the lake water salinity during this time was low. An increase in precipitation best explains the establishment of freshwater flora, higher autochthonous freshwater production, higher allochthonous input, and consequently the higher accumulation rate observed within this section. This fact is supported by studies in other Mediterranean regions, where a pluvial period from 8 to 4.5 kyr B.P. was reconstructed (Kallel et al., 1997). Conversely, in Veliko Jezero, no significant reduction in salinity was inferred from the analog matching within this time period. Probably a strong marine influence masked the effect of freshwater input.\n5.3. Section 7.1–5 kyr B.P.\nAfter the onset of the Juniperus–Phillyrea zone ca. 7.2 kyr B.P. in Malo Jezero, the planktonic freshwater species suddenly were replaced by benthic pennate diatom species for a short interval (Achnanthes minutissima=Cymbella microcephala zone 5 ca. 7.2–7.1 kyr B.P.). According to the analog set there existed freshwater taxa that tolerated increasing salinity (e.g. C. microcephala), taxa prevailing under slightly brackish conditions (Mastogloia smithii var. lacustris), and taxa with a wide range of tolerance (Brachysira aponina). This zone was also correlated with a peak in Mg-calcite and the onset of distinct laminae in Malo Jezero, indicating meromictic conditions. In Veliko Jezero, brackish Diploneis spp. temporarily increased before the onset of the Brachysira aponina subzone.\nS. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281 273\nThis change could have been triggered by enhanced summer evaporation and the disappearance of the freshwater in Malo Jezero. Analogs for this period in fact chose the highly saline, shallow channel ‘Valle Zignano’ as the best match for this period in MJ1. No changes in analogs took place in Veliko Jezero. However, in the corresponding core section of VJ2 a hiatus of 18 cm sediment could be detected.\nIn Malo Jezero, the benthic pennate diatom community disappeared approximately 7.1 kyr B.P. and a planktonic freshwater Cyclotella assemblage established again, beginning with a dominance of C. ocellata until ca. 6.3 kyr B.P. According to Wunsam et al. (1995), C. ocellata mainly occurred in freshwater preferring eutrophic conditions. An increased phytoplankton productivity was also indicated by the highest pigment concentrations (Schultze, 1988– 1989) in this core section. Higher nutrient availability caused by freshwater influx from the catchment might have been responsible for the increased phytoplankton biomass. The decrease of Mg-calcite in MJ1 and a change from aragonite to Mg-calcite in VJ2 support the finding of decreasing salinity.\nCa. 6.3 kyr B.P., in Malo Jezero, C. ocellata was replaced by C. distinguenda var. unipunctata and Cyclotella morphotypes ‘with two punctae’. Schmidt (1993) compared the latter with C. cyclopuncta Håkansson=C. cretica John and Economou-Amilli. In the ALPTROPH data set Cyclotella distinguenda var. unipunctata was mainly found in oligotrophic freshwater lakes (Wunsam et al., 1995). Re-oligotrophication could be also marked by a distinct decrease of pigments (Schultze, 1988–1989), indicating decreasing phytoplankton production. The reasons are assumed to be complex: lower input of nutrients from the catchment or their trapping in the monimolimnion caused re-oligotrophication. An increase in electrolyte concentration is visible in the peak of Mg-calcite towards the top of this zone. This indicates a decrease in precipitation and=or a decrease in the thickness of the freshwater layer. Vransko Jezero (Cres) was the most similar modern analog lake for the C. distinguenda var. unipunctata zone 7. In comparison to analogs of the preceding C. ocellata zone (e.g. Akumulacije Jezero 0.45‰), Vransko Jezero (Cres) has a comparable salinity value (0.4‰). The sediment, at least in the upper\npart of this zone, shows distinct laminae, suggesting a preservation of the seasonal production.\nIn Veliko, Brachysira aponina became the most important pennate taxon ca. 6.7 kyr B.P. (beginning of the B. aponina subzone). In the recent data set, B. aponina showed a wide tolerance with respect to salinity.\n5.4. Section 5–3 kyr B.P.\nIn Malo Jezero, C. choctawhatcheeana abruptly replaced C. distinguenda var. unipunctata ca. 5 kyr B.P. This correlates with the change from Mg-calcite to aragonite deposition, but concentrations remained low (evident from the brownish sediment colour), both indicating increasing salinity. Approximately at the same time in Veliko Jezero, Brachysira aponina was replaced by mesohalobous taxa (e.g. Amphora coffeaeformis, Diploneis sp. 1, D. bombus, Navicula clamans, Paralia sulcata), which appeared for the first time. The planktonic taxa Actinocyclus spp. and Thalassiosira spp. were also observed. The analogs for this zone show short peaks with elevated salinity. It indicates the onset of ingression through the Soline channel and the influence of tidal oscillations.\nAbout 4.2 kyr B.P., C. choctawhatcheeana decreased in Malo Jezero at the expense of Chaetoceros (represented by resting spores), whereas aragonite deposition increased (cf. Fig. 5a, zone 9). Aside from β-mesohalobous Diploneis spp., N. pseudocrassirostris temporarily became abundant. This taxon was observed in recent and fossil brackish environments around the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean (Hustedt, 1961–1966; Simonsen, 1962; Håkansson, 1981). In the analog set this taxon showed a wide tolerance. Probably both a progressive sea level dynamic and the decrease of the freshwater influence may be responsible for the environmental changes. Unstable conditions were inferred by analog matching, which alternatingly selected either lakes with marine or with brackish salinity values. This indicates the existence of tidal currents around the threshold of Malo Jezero. These results fit the model, proposed by Lambeck (1995) for the eastern Mediterranean, of a sea level gradually increasing to the present value during 5 to 4 kyr B.P.\nIn the time interval 3.5 to 3 kyr B.P., A. fogedii and A. submarina and, later, A. minutissima ex-\n274 S. Wunsam et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 146 (1999) 251–281\npanded. Simultaneously with the expansion of A. minutissima, a temporary decrease of aragonite, with a change in sediment colour, took place. Schultze (1988–1989) observed increasing pigment concentrations in this part of the profile. This could be an indication of a freshwater influx that was missed by analog matching.\nThis event in MJ1 was correlated with a brownish sediment sequence (because of increased Corg at the expense of aragonite) in Veliko Jezero (121–113 cm). The overlying white sediments (aragonite) in Veliko Jezero indicate a change back to increasing marine influence. Marine taxa like Dimeregramma sp., which appeared in Veliko, were recently found in a lake with 36.7‰ salinity. At this time, environmental conditions comparable to the present situation prevailed."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "We suggest that lake formation was influenced by the rise of the Adriatic Sea and, at least temporarily, by an increase in precipitation. It was possible to ascertain the sea level rise because the shallow lake basin of Malo Jezero was filled up later than that of Veliko. The initial brackish conditions in Malo Jezero in the time interval 8.8–8.4 kyr B.P. correspond in Veliko to a change from a slightly brackish swamp to a lake with higher salinity. It may be due to both the transmission of seawater through the permeable karst (caused by the Adriatic sea level rise from approximately 50 to 30 m) and enhanced evaporation. In both lakes the brackish environment was followed by the onset of distinct freshwater incursions about 8.4 kyr B.P., indicating increased precipitation. It correlates with climate and environmental changes detected for the Mediterranean: in the Italian crater lake Albano, marked biostratigraphic changes were observed by Manca et al. (1996) for this time; these were interpreted as climatic deterioration. From foraminiferal oxygen isotopic records, Kallel et al. (1996, 1997) observed a cooling of the spring sea surface temperature (up to 2.5ºC) and a salinity decrease in the Thyrrenean Sea, corresponding to the onset of sapropel deposition. They considered a pluvial phase lasting from approximately 8 until 4.5 kyr B.P. In the southern\nAdriatic a change to sapropelithic sedimentation was recorded at 8.6 kyr B.P. by Fontugne et al. (1989). The observation of pluvial periods extends also to Northern Africa, where Adamson et al. (1980) detected a mid-Holocene moisture interval, with an upper boundary of 5 kyr B.P.\nA tephra layer of probably Campanian provenience was deposited at 7.3 kyr B.P., being an excellent stratigraphic marker in both Mljet lakes. Tephra deposition was accompanied by environmental changes. Presumably, tectonic movements related to Italian volcanism caused a sudden seawater transmission through the more permeable karst system into Veliko Jezero.\nAbout 7.1 kyr B.P. a short dryer phase was detected, separating an older and a younger pluvial phase. Corresponding indications are widespread in the Mediterranean, and observed in different environments: in Spain, from low lake levels and expansion of sclerophyllous vegetation (Jalut et al., 1997); and in the Thyrrenean (Kallel et al., 1997) and Adriatic Sea (Fontugne et al., 1989), from oxygen isotope fluctuations measured in foraminifers. This dry phase as observed in Malo Jezero was followed by a phase with indications of increased precipitation between ca. 7.1 and 6.3 kyr B.P. A transition to a Mediterranean climate followed (6.3–5.5 kyr B.P.), with the main precipitation during winter, but with less summer drought. The latter is indicated by the time lag of the expansion of Quercus ilex. In the aquatic environment in Malo a gradual decrease of summer precipitation was inferred from oligotrophication probably due to reduced nutrient input from catchment erosion during the growth period. However, if the dating is correct, the onset of the Mediterranean climax vegetation and summer drought in Mljet was approximately 1000 years earlier than inferred by Jalut et al. (1997) for the area in Spain north of 40ºN.\nThe marine ingression into Veliko Jezero over the Soline channel, with a modern elevation of 2.5 m, took place about 5 kyr B.P. From 5 to 4 kyr B.P. the oscillating sea level approached the present value.\nIn conclusion, the unique situation of coastal lakes embedded within a karstic system made it possible to get valuable new information about the Adriatic sea levels and timing of the Holocene transgression. Simultaneously, distinct climatic periods could be iden-\nS.

  "abstractText": "Within the Austrian IGBP=PAGES project “Palaeolimnology of Adriatic–Alpine Lakes” (PAAL), geochemical and diatom analyses were performed on sediment cores of Malo and Veliko Jezero, two karstic coastal lakes on the island Mljet, Croatia. Combined with diatom calibration, they provide evidence of remarkable environmental changes during the Holocene. The formation of the lakes in the early Holocene was triggered by a rise in the Adriatic sea level from approximately 50 to 30 m, which resulted in the transmission of seawater through karst, and by a temporary increase in precipitation. The onset of this pluvial period was dated in Malo Jezero at 8.4 kyr B.P. and had its maximum approximately 7–6 kyr B.P. It was briefly interrupted by a dryer episode from about 7.2 until 7.1 kyr B.P. Between 6 and 5.5 kyr B.P., a transition to the present Mediterranean climate occurred. The marine ingression into Veliko Jezero through the Soline channel, with a present depth of 2.5 m, took place about 5 kyr B.P. From 5 to 4 kyr B.P., the oscillating sea level gradually approached the present value. A tephra layer at 7.3 kyr B.P. in both lakes was related to sudden environmental changes that were probably caused by tectonic movements accompanying Italian volcanism.  1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
