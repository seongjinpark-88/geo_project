Our analyses indicate the renewal of surface carbonate production in the Blue Lias Formation (early Hettangian) after the end-Triassic mass extinction. Based on the high abundance of surface carbonate producers (schizosphaerellids), which occurred in phase with development at sea-floor of calcareous hyaline benthic foraminifers, we deduce that a benthic–pelagic coupling resulted in both the initial restoration of the biological carbonate pump, and also a more efficient export production. The presence of monospecific phytoplankton assemblages and benthic foraminiferal assemblages typical of poorly oxygenated environments suggest that the environmental stress continued after the end-Triassic maximal perturbation. Complete environmental recovery was prevented by a succession of alternating dysaerobic and anoxic phases that favoured the deposition of black-shale sediments. The hypothesis of a methane-release mechanism as a trigger for the global carbon cycle perturbation and greenhouse conditions during the early Jurassic is discounted, based on evidence from the decoupled carbon isotope records of carbonate and organic matter. Apart from local control of a high amplitude sea-level change across the Tr–J boundary, the succession and nature of events at Doniford are consistent with a scenario of global environmental and biotic changes triggered by the physical and chemical effects of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) volcanism. A super greenhouse climate in the aftermath of the end-Triassic mass extinction appears to be the results of the combination of the long-term CO2 accumulation in the atmosphere system due to the CAMP volcanic activity, as well as the inefficiency of the biological pump due to reduced export production.\n.-E.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "The Triassic–Jurassic (Tr–J) transition was one of the “big five” mass extinctions that occurred at the end of Rhaetian (Newell, 1963; Raup and Sepkoski, 1982). This event was characterised by major biological and environmental events, and was accompanied by a global crisis of carbonate production in neritic and pelagic environments (Hautmann, 2004, 2008; Lathuilière and Marchal, 2009; Clémence et al., in press). Additionally, data suggests that dramatic sea-level changes occurred in many areas (Newell, 1963; Hallam, 1981, 1990; Hallam and Wignall, 1997; Hallam, 2002). The geodynamic data suggest that this period was further affected by active plate tectonics related to the early stages of the break-up of Pangaea,\nand the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province emplacement (CAMP; McHone, 1996; Marzoli et al., 1999). Recent precise radiometric age estimations indicate a possible causal correlation between the major phase of CAMP volcanism and the Tr–J crisis (Marzoli et al., 1999; Hames et al., 2000; Pálfy et al., 2000, 2003; Marzoli et al., 2004; Knight et al., 2004; Schaltegger et al., 2008; Schoene et al., 2010). Geochemical studies indicate that global carbon cycle was perturbed across the Tr–J transition (Ward et al., 2001; Pálfy et al., 2001; Hesselbo et al., 2002; Galli et al., 2005). In particular, the ™13Corg profile shows two distinct negative excursions from several sections from all over the world. Guex et al. (2004) found that a first negative CIE (or “initial excursion”) was coincident with the sea-level fall and the major biological crisis of the end-Triassic. This is particularly evident in sections from Austria, where data suggests that this endTriassic excursion was coincident with the crisis of the biological carbonate pump (demise and extinction of surface carbonate producer P. triassica; Clémence et al., in press). The first negative CIE at\nthe base of the Jurassic was subsequently followed by a positive carbon isotope excursion, which was concurrent with a sea-level rise and the beginning of a radiation of several marine organisms, such as the ammonites (Guex et al., 2004). This positive trendwas interrupted by a second negative CIE (or “main excursion”; Hesselbo et al., 2002) associated with the lower Hettangian black-shale deposition (Guex et al., 2004). This negative C-isotope excursion records a global change in organic carbon burial rates, probably in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 levels at a time of massive volcanic activity in the CAMP, responsible possibly, the sudden release of methane from gas hydrate.\nAt present, there are very few studies that document the complex palaeoenvironmental change that characterised the aftermath of the end-Triassic crisis, and the subsequent recovery of carbonate producers (Barras and Twitchett, 2007; Mander et al., 2008; Kiessling et al., 2009). Our aim is to examine the data related to the restoration of the carbonate pump at the base of Hettangian and its impact on the marine ecosystem in the Wessex epicontinental basin (west Somerset, SW England). We present a multi-proxy study that combines results from calcareous nannofossil, benthic foraminifer, organic matter, bulk organic and carbonate carbon stable isotope records. These data allow us to track the functioning of the carbonate pump, and to examine in particular the links among calcareous phytoplankton, trophic chain complexity, nutrient cycling, export production (transfer of organic matter from surface waters to sea-bottom) and sea-bottom oxygen levels."

    "text": "The Triassic and Early Jurassic sedimentary succession of SW England (Fig. 1A) has a thickness of nearly 200 m in its entirety. These sediments were deposited in a series of extensional basins with a dominant east–west orientation (Fig. 1B). These basins are halfgrabens that are bounded by faults whose dip and down-throw are predominantly orientated southwards (Hesselbo et al., 2004). On the west Somerset coastline in SW England, cliff and foreshore outcrops between Blue Ben and Helwell Bay show a similar continuous sedimentary record across the Tr–J boundary (Fig. 1A). Although most previous studies on the Tr–J boundary have concentrated on the St Audrie's Bay section (Richardson, 1911; Whittaker and Green, 1983; Warrington et al., 1994; Page and Bloos, 1998; Hesselbo et al., 2004; Hounslow et al., 2004; Barras, 2006), the Doniford Bay record contains a well-preserved aragonite ammonite fauna with similar lithological patterns. The excellent ammonite record allows better biostratigraphical control, compared to other sections in the same region, such as St Audrie's Bay, which lacks well-preserved fauna. Doniford Bay [ST 0765 4362] is located 1 km east of former Watchet harbour and only 3 kmwest of St Audrie's Bay (Fig. 1A). The section is located in the western part of the Doniford Bay and on the foreshore north of the Watchet Fault (Fig. 1A).\nThe sedimentary sequence has been described in detail by Whittaker and Green (1983). Above a basal condensed “bone-bed” that rests on the non-marine dolomitic and gypsiferous mudstones of the Blue Anchor Formation of the Mercia Mudstones Group (Norian), there is a unit of laminated organic-rich shales (Westbury Formation, Penarth Group)with coarse “bone-beds” near the basewhich contains both typical elements, such as marine fish teeth and scales, but also very rare elements, such as terrestrial dinosaurs and freshwater fossils (Martill, 1999). The base of the overlying Lilstock Formation (Penarth Group) is characterised by pale-grey marls of the Cotham Member that were deposited in restricted, freshwater-influenced lagoonal to tidal environment. These marls exhibit a modest local erosion surface at the base. In the lower Cotham Member, the Late Rhaetian sea-level fall is evident (Wignall, 2001; Hesselbo et al., 2004; Allison and Wright, 2005). This Member is a shallowing upward succession, capped by a surface characterised by deep desiccation cracks that\nmarked a dramatic fall in relative sea-level during this period. Sedimentary structures in the upper Cotham Member include waveripples, indicating that water-depth was at only a few centimetres (Hesselbo et al., 2004). The overlying Langport Member of the Lilstock Formation contains micritic limestones with a variety of shallowwater features, locally capped by amud-crack horizon, which contains truncatedDiplocraterion burrows known as the Sun Bed. This has been interpreted as an interval of immersion and erosion (the first of two sea-level lowstands) before the deposition of the overlying Blue Lias Formation (early Jurassic) (Hallam, 1960). Sedimentary features located at the top of the Langport Member include a pseudo-breccia which has been the focus of differing interpretations. Several studies report a phase of relative sea-level fall (the second of two sea-level lowstands) (Radley and Carpenter, 1999; Wignall, 2001; Radley, 2002; Simms, 2003; Hallam andWignall, 2004; Simms, 2007; Wignall and Bond, 2008). This event was considered responsible for the creation of the breccia, in a low energy setting with anomalous salinities, such as schizohaline lagoon (Arzani, 1997; Swift, 1999). Other authors, such as Hesselbo et al. (2004) however, disagree with\nthe hypothesis of a second sea-level fall as interpreted at the top of Langport Member, and they consider that the upper part of Cotham Member, the Langport Member and the lower part of Blue Lias Formation was deposited during a phase of relative sea-level rise (a transgressive system tract). The overlying Blue Lias Formation (Jurassic) represents an offshore sedimentary setting and contains a fully-marine fauna (Water and Lawrence, 1987; Wright et al., 2003), but this depositional environment was prone to anoxia, as well as the formation of laminated, organic-rich shales (Hallam, 1995, 1997; Wignall, 2001; Allison and Wright, 2005)."

    "heading": "3. The Triassic–Jurassic boundary at Doniford",
    "text": "Defining the exact position of the Tr–J boundary is of paramount importance in order to establish global correlations and describing possible scenarios to explain the biotic crisis. Historically, in Great Britain the base of the Jurassic was first placed according lithostratigraphical criteria at the base of the Blue Lias Formation (Richardson, 1911; George et al., 1969). Thereafter the Jurassic Working Group of the Geological Society of London suggested that the first occurrence (FO) of ammonites of the genus Psiloceras should be used to define the base of the Hettangian, and by doing so, facilitate correlations between inter-continental sediments (Cope et al., 1980; see also Warrington et al., 2008). The abundant, and the easily identifiable taxon Psiloceras planorbis (J. Sowerby), was the most commonly used marker for the basal Jurassic of Great Britain. The Blue Lias Formation lies several metres below the base of the FO of P. planorbis (Bed 13 in Figs. 2 and 3), and so the lowest beds of the Blue Lias Formation (termed “Pre-planorbis Beds”) were assigned to the Triassic. The FO of Psiloceras planorbis at the base of Bed 13 in St Audrie's Bay was also proposed as the “golden spike” for the GSSP of the base of the Jurassic System (Hodges, 1994; Warrington et al., 1994, 2008). Older, but more poorly preserved Psiloceras spp. inarguably occur in St Audrie's\nBay, Bed 8. In contrast, better-preserved ammonites from the corresponding Bed 8 at Doniford Bay allowed Page and Bloos (1998) to identify Psiloceras erugatum (J. Phillips) andNeophyllites sp. in Bed 9 (see also Bloos and Page, 2000). Unequivocal specimens assigned to P. planorbis are abundantly represented in Beds 13 to 19. The base of Bed 23 and upwards stragraphically is comprised of at least 2 m of hard, laminated mudstone that contains abundant crushed iridescent specimens of P. planorbis, as well as specimens assigned to P. plicatulum (Quenstedt) and P. sampsoni (Portlock) (Fig. 2; Page, 2005). The Planorbis Chronozone extends up to the base of Bed 25.\nWe apply an integrated stratigraphical approach using ammonite and organic carbon isotope data to locate the Tr–J boundary (Fig. 2). Guex et al. (2004) define the base of the Jurassic at New York Canyon (Nevada, USA) using the FO of the oldest known Jurassic-like ammonites, belonging to the genus Psiloceras, i.e., Psiloceras spelae (Guex). These occur 20 cm below Bed N-9 in the New York Canyon (Guex et al., 2004). This species has not been found in England, probably due to more pronounced shallow-water conditions that made environments unsuitable for this taxon during this timeinterval, or alternatively, this could suggest the presence of a hiatus. The organic carbon isotope curve has been calibrated with highresolution ammonite biostratigraphic data for New York Canyon. The beginning of the first CIE is approximately located at the top of the Choristoceras crickmayi Zone (Rhaetian) and ends 4 m below the FO of P. spelae. The FO of P. spelae occurs within the positive CIE between the two negative CIEs. The second negative CIE begins close to the FO of the species Psiloceras marcouxi (Guex, Taylor, Rakus, Bucher) and genus Odoghertyceras, and some extremely evolute Psiloceratinae close to “Neophyllites” (Bed M-2). These taxa are accompanied by rare and tiny survivors of the genus Choristoceras, Choristoceras minutum. Bed M-2 at New York Canyon can be tentatively correlated to Bed 8 of Doniford section (Guex et al., 2004), and therefore, the integrated stratigraphy between δ13C curve and ammonite fauna facilitates the\nay (SW England; Hesselbo et al., 2002), Doniford section (SW England; this study) and established by Bloos and Page (2000).\n105 M .-E.Clém ence et al./ Palaeogeography,Palaeoclim atology,Palaeoecology 295 (2010) 102 –115\ncorrelation of the Tr–J boundary in Doniford Bay to the interval corresponding to Beds 1 and 2, where the highest values of δ13Corg occur (Blue Lias Formation; Figs. 2 and 3)."

The method evaluates the quality of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content of rocks, namely the “thermal maturity” of samples, and the type of organic matter (Espitalié et al., 1985a,b,c).

Carbon isotopic compositions on bulk sedimentary organic matter were measured via an Elemental Analyser-Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (EA-IRMS, GV Instruments). Carbon isotope ratios were measured against a laboratory organic standard (δ13C=−29.6± 0.2‰ with n=87) and reported using the standard delta notation versus the PDB standard. The majority of samples were duplicated, and standards were intercalated with the samples. Reproducibility was better than 0.1‰ for standards and 0.25‰ for samples (1Σ)."

    "text": "The nannofossils dataset comprised 100 smear slides prepared from marlstone and calcareous marls lithologies using standard preparation techniques (Bown and Young, 1998). Samples were prepared as homogeneously as possible; to maintain comparable particle density across different slides. Nannofossils were observed along three longitudinal transverses on smear slides under a light polarizing microscope, at 1575× magnification. Because of monospecific assemblages entirely composed of schizosphaerellids, we used a number of specimens per field of view (number of schizosphaerellids in 200 fields of view) instead of relative abundance (i.e., percentage) to derive the abundance pattern of calcareous nannofossils.\nSelected samples were examined using a preparation technique that allows the same nannofossil specimen to be viewed first in the light microscope (LM; Zeiss Axioplan optical) and later in the scanning electron microscope (SEM; FRE 3206 CNRS/MNHN and\nCR2P 7207 CNRS/Paris 6 units). This analytical technique is based on methods by Gallagher (1988) and Pirini Radrizzani et al. (1990), which we have further modified and adapted for the purposes of this study: a copper grid (Maxtaform) (φ=3.05 mm) with coordinate grid system was fixed on a circle glass cover (φ=10 mm) with a fine layer of optical glue. A small drop of sample suspension was placed on the grid and dried, before being placed on a glass slide and covered by a rectangular glass cover. Cityfluor (CFM-1 Mountant Solution) was used as mounting media, as it allows good light penetration, but can be easily removed. The marked fields of the grid allow the precise position of specific calcareous nannofossils to be documented by means of photographs and grid maps in the LM. After removing the rectangular glass cover, the circle glass cover and grid was washed with ethanol to remove Cityfluor and subsequently fixed on a SEM stub. Using the coordinate grid system, photographs and grid maps taken in the LM, every specimen could be easily located in the SEM."

Material larger than 63 μm was sieved, washed and dried at 50 °C. After the drying and sieving through meshes of various sizes (1 mm, 500 μm, 250 μm, 125 μm and 63 μm) the foraminifers were picked up, counted and identified under a binocular microscope. Species and genera were identified according to the established classifications (Loeblich et al., 1987).

    "text": "Fig. 3A illustrates the geochemical data from the Doniford section. Low values of δ13Corg at around −29‰ are present in the Cotham Member, which correspond to the “Initial Isotope Excursion” (IIE; Hesselbo et al., 2002) or first “Carbon Isotope Excursion” (CIE; Guex et al., 2004). The occurrences of Triassic dinoflagellate cysts and terrestrial palynomorphs in Doniford and St. Audrie's sections confirm the latest Triassic age for this first negative CIE (Orbell, 1973; Hesselbo et al., 2002; van de Schootbrugge et al., 2007). Additionally, Triassic fauna, such as conodonts, remain present in the majority of the Langport Member in the Watchet area. We observe an increase of δ13Corg values in the Langport Member up to −26‰. Values remain relatively high in the lowermost part of the Blue Lias Formation between Beds 1 and 2. From Bed 2 to Bed 6, δ13Corg decreases again to the “Main Isotope Excursion” (Hesselbo et al., 2002) or second negative CIE (Guex et al., 2004). This starts ∼2.5 m below the Psiloceras cf. erugatum and Neophyllites horizons (Bed 8). The organic carbon isotope values remain low from Bed 6 to Bed 25, with fluctuations between −30‰ and −28‰.\nThe carbonate (δ13Ccarb) curve differs quite substantially from the shape of the organic carbon istope curve (δ13Corg). In the lowermost Cotham Member, the δ13Ccarb values are low (around −5‰) concomitant with the first organic negative CIE. Along the Langport Member δ13Corg values steadily increase, while those of δ13Ccarb fluctuate markedly from −5‰ to −1‰. In the uppermost Langport Member we observe a sharp δ13Ccarb positive shift from −5‰ to 1‰. Then, δ13Ccarb values remain stable and relatively high (around 2‰) in the lowermost part of Blue Lias Formation (Bed 1), before decreasing again to a negative peak from Bed 2 to Bed 4. From Bed 4 upwards, the δ13Ccarb values tend to increase to 3‰ and remain relatively high,\nshowing fluctuations from 1‰ to −1‰ while concominant δ13Corg values decrease to the second negative CIE.\nThe δ18O curve shows marked fluctuations, and this is particularly evident in the Lilstock Formation. While the values are relatively high in this formation, we observe fluctuations of large amplitude (−1 and −2 to −5‰). These decrease sharply from −2‰ to −6‰ in the lowermost part of Blue Lias Formation (from Bed 1 to Bed 2), and are accompanied by high inorganic and organic carbon isotopes. Up to the top of the section, less negative values with fluctuations between −4‰ and −6‰ are recorded.\nThe OM from Doniford displays specific features in terms of distributions and types according to the analysed lithology. Rock-Eval results are plotted in a HI vs. Tmax diagram (Espitalié et al., 1985a,b,c; Fig. 4) and in Fig. 3A (TOC curve). The Lilstock Formation is characterised by very low values of TOC and HI, and these are typical features of recycled organic matter, probably of continental source (OM of Type III; Fig. 4). At the transition between the Langport- and Blue Lias Formations, we observe a dramatic shift in TOC values, from less than 0.3 to 4.6%, accompanied by a HI of 742 mg HC/g TOC that is associated with the positive CIE (Tr–J transition; Figs. 3 and 4). These data support the presence of OM of Type I (marine unicellular algae and/or bacterial material). Upward section, associated with the second negative CIE, TOC values largely fluctuate between 2 and 12% (Fig. 3). The highest TOC values present in Beds 6 (7.3%), 7 (6.1%), 14 (9.7%), and 24 (11.5%) are characterised by a very high HI, up to 800 mg HC/g TOC and by OM of Type I (Fig. 4). The lowest TOC values (2–3%) present in Beds 20–24, 15–17 base, 8–14a and 7 (middle part) are defined by changes in the OM quality (HI of ∼600 mg HC/g TOC; Fig. 4) with Type II features (mixed marine and continental OM).\nCarbonate (CaCO3) values show significant variations (from 100 to 25%), corresponding with the limestone–marl alternations (Fig. 3). In the Blue Lias Formation, CaCO3 values are generally inversely correlated to TOC and δ18O values (Fig. 3)."

After Bed 6 upwards, pulses in abundance of calcareous hyaline benthic foraminifers can be observed. Additionally, a slight diversification trend in the assemblage is apparent along the section. However, assemblages are almost monospecific with a peak in abundance of Eoguttulina liassica (Strickland) at the base of the middle of Bed 6. In the lower part of the Bed 7, a peak of foraminiferal abundance is observed with the notable development of aragonitic trochospiral Robertinida. Particularly, small Oberhauserellidae (quasi-planktic foraminifers; see Hart et al., 2002) occur in association with the dominant benthic Reinholdella sp. A second pulse in abundance of benthic foraminifers occurs, in the uppermost part of Bed 7, mainly as a result of the development of Lagenida Paralingulina tenera (Bornmann) and, to a lesser extent, by E. liassica. Towards the top of the section in the Beds 8–9, 18–23 and 24 to the top, the species P. tenera remains dominant in the assemblages, associated with E. liassica, Prodentalina pseudocommunis (Franke), Prodentalina zlambachensis (Kristan-Tollmann) and Pseudonodosaria simpsonensis (Tappan), which are all recorded in significant proportions. Only in Bed 20, is the abundance of E. liassica greater than that of P. tenera."

    "text": "All organic matter samples display low thermal maturation indices (Tmax; Fig. 4),well below the oilwindow, thereby excluding a significant alterationdue toburial or thermal diagenesis. Based on this,we consider the OM to be indicative of primary environmental conditions.\nWhen carbon versus oxygen isotope values of samples from Lilstock and Blue Lias Formations are plotted, these fall into two distinct clusters (Fig. 5), which reflects the presence of lighter δ13Ccarb values for the Lilstock samples relative to those of the Blue Lias. For the oxygen values, the δ18O data indicate that Lilstock samples are either heavier, or overlapping with the Blue Lias samples. If diagenesis had altered the primary geochemical signature, then wewould expect that the two clusters would converge in a unimodal cluster of δ13Ccarb and δ18O (Marshall, 1992). Since this is not the case, we interpret the bimodality as a consequence of different environmental conditions occurring during deposition of the two formations. Alternatively, the data could suggest that an early diagenesis took place that did not completely obliterate the palaeoenvironmental signal. We consider the latter to be a more likely scenario.\nAs Lilstock formation sediments were deposited during the Rhaetian sea-level fall, these sediments were probably influenced to a significant extent bymeteoric diagenesis. The decreasing carbon and oxygen trend shown in Fig. 5 for the Lilstock samples could be interpreted as the consequence of a meteoric diagenesis, even if the correlation between δ13Ccarb and δ18O is not significant (r2=0.08). Meteoricwater is enriched in light oxygen (16O) and the dissolvedCO2, if soil-derived, is enriched in 12C (Brand and Veizer, 1981). The very low values of δ13Ccarb recorded in this formation occur together with a type III OM (recycled material probably of main continental origin), which is easily oxidised in very shallow-waters. Its degradation and recycling during early diagenesis may have added light carbon isotopes (12C) to the composition of both early cements and recrystallized bioclasts and grains. At the Tr–J transition and the lower Hettangian, sedimentary environments (Blue Lias Formation) are represented by deeper facies (limestone–marl alternations and the presence of black-shales; Hallam, 1997). Carbon versus oxygen isotope values do not show significant co-variation (r2=0.2; Fig. 5), however, the observed wide range of δ13Ccarb values and especially, of δ18O values (down to −5 and −7.5‰) indicates a diagenetic overprint.\nThere is no correlation between δ13Ccarb, and CaCO3, or TOC values (r2=0.08 and r2=0.05, respectively; Fig. 6A–B). Thus, in Doniford Bay, δ13Ccarb values from the sediments of Blue Lias Formation do not appear to have been strongly influenced by lithological variations. Conversely, when comparing the δ18O and CaCO3 values (Fig. 6C), a clear diagenetic trend is observed where the lowest δ18O values are found in the limestone beds. This is particularlymarked in the interval fromBed 6 up to the top of the section, where regular marl–limestone alternating are observed (Fig. 3). We therefore agree with the interpretation by Arzani (2006) that the Blue Lias limestone beds are more intensely affected by diagenesis than the marly beds."

    "text": "In general, poorly preserved calcareous nannofossil assemblages are characterised by etching and overgrowth. Additionally, the presence of diagenetic calcite/dolomite rhombohedra indicates that the original sediment was altered by dissolution and re-precipitation.\nSeveral approaches have been used to evaluate the preservation state of calcareous nannofossils: those of Roth and Thierstein (1972) and Roth (1984), are based on the identification of etching and overgrowth as well as on the presence of micarbs and calcite rhombohedra. These approaches are commonly used during optical microscopy analysis. Optical microscopy does not offer sufficient resolution to analyse the impact of diagenesis on microfossil assemblages, necessitating a thorough SEM analysis to evaluate how dissolution and overgrowth have modified the original assemblage. The SEM analysis revealed that pervasive recrystallisation affected the monospecific assemblages of schizosphaerellids by alteration of its ultrastructure (Plate 1). The poor- to-moderate levels of calcareous nannofossil preservation at Doniford have therefore probably caused the original Early Hettangian species richness to be reduced in the fossil record.\nAlthough aragonitic preservation occurs in Doniford Bay, foraminiferal tests are generally moderately well-preserved. However, SEM observations reveal clear indications of aragonitic tests dissolution. If dissolution occurred, foraminiferal absolute abundances would probably be under-estimated. The majority of the calcite tests show infilling with secondary calcite, with visible recrystallisation and overgrowth on the walls. Importantly, there does not appear to be an enrichment of the most dissolution-resistant taxa (e.g., Lenticulina) in the assemblages. On the contrary, the foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by relatively fragile taxa, such as aragonitic Reinholdella and Oberhauserella, or the thin, calcitic species P. tenera. This pattern of preservation argues against strong selective dissolution having affected the foraminiferal assemblages.\nOur palaeoenvironmental interpretations concentrate on only the major trends and significant shifts in assemblage composition of the two groups, partly due to the impact of diagenesis on nannofossil and foraminiferal records. These major changes cannot be uniquely driven by diagenesis, since preservation, although relatively poor, does not vary dramatically along the section. In the case of fluctuations exclusively driven by diagenesis, we would expect a correlation between low abundance of carbonate microfossils and low oxygen isotope values. However, high peaks in abundance of both calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers are generally correlated with low\nvalues of oxygen isotopes, while low abundances of these microfossils are correlated with high δ18O values (Fig. 3)."

    "text": "At Doniford, a remarkable result is the differing trends and, at some levels, the negatively correlations between the δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg\ncurves in the early Hettangian period (Fig. 3). The reproducibility of the shape of the δ13Corg curve has been reproduced from different sediments from around the world, confirming that these observed δ13Corg variations record global perturbations of the carbon cycle across the Tr–J boundary (McElwain et al., 1999; Pálfy et al., 2001; Ward et al., 2001; Hesselbo et al., 2002; Guex et al., 2004). The carbonate carbon isotope signal (™13Ccarb) across the Tr–J boundary has received less attention than the organic carbon isotope signal (™13Corg) and published data for this curve are limited to Austria, Hungary and Northern Italy (McRoberts et al., 1997; Pálfy et al., 2001;\nGalli et al., 2005). The general shape of δ13Ccarb curves documented fromWestern Europe is very similar, despite the fact that the Doniford curve is offset towards lighter values. At Doniford, the absolute values of δ13Ccarb are influenced by local parameters such as depth, salinity, redox conditions and early diagenetic processes. This disparity between the δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg curves is not observed in recent studies where δ13Ccarb was measured using well-preserved oyster shells from others SW Britain sections (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2007; Korte et al., 2009). The Doniford δ13Ccarb curve from bulk sediment samples indicates a continuous record of alternating dysoxic and anoxic phases, with better carbonate preservation during anoxic phases. During these phases, pore water alkalinity may have been increased by bacterial sulphate reduction, thereby enhancing CaCO3 test preservation (Walter and Burton, 1990; Martin, 1999). Generally higher values of δ13Ccarb and δ18O in our dataset confirm that dissolution of carbonates was reduced during the anoxic phases (Fig. 3). As oysters could not develop in anoxic conditions, the oyster δ13Ccarb curve at Lavernock Point and at St Audrie's Bay in all likelihood records only phases of re-oxygenation. During these phases, dysoxic conditions occurred and, as light carbon was released in the environment due to the oxidation of organic matter, 12C was likely incorporated into the oyster shells during biomineralisation. Therefore, the δ13Ccarb signal from the oyster shellsmight have been strongly influenced by localised sea-bottom conditions. Vital effects have also likely occurred, as suggested by thewide intra-sample range of carbon isotope values reported by vande Schootbrugge et al. (2009) andKorte et al. (2009). At Doniford, the general patterns of δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg curves from the Blue Lias Formation, reflects a combination of local (sea-bottom conditions) and global (sea-surface recovery of primary productivity) signals. Thus, the relatively high values of δ13Ccarb at Doniford represent the primary palaeoenvironmental signal, while the short-termfluctuations of the δ13Ccarb curvewere drivenby local redox variations mainly controlled by early diagenetic processes. If the diagenetic impact was strong, all the δ13C values of carbonates would have shifted towards more negative values, but this is not observed."

    "text": "The Uppermost Triassic deposits of Doniford Bay are almost completely devoid of calcareous nannofossils. This lack of fossils is probably due to the aftermath of the end-Triassic crisis, or may be attributed to very shallow-water environments that were unfavourable to nannoplankton development. Poor preservation of the carbonate fraction in the sediment, due to strong meteoric or early diagenetic alteration must also be considered. At the Tr–J transition, the calcareous nannofossil assemblages are quite scarce and are composed exclusively of schizosphaerellids. From the Early Hettangian (Blue Lias Formation), the schizosphaerellids occur in high proportions from Bed 5 at the top of the CothamMember (Fig. 3). The depositional environments of that part of the section were probably characterised by high condensation levels or by a sedimentary gap, generated by the abrupt regression–transgression cycle. Van de Schootbrugge et al. (2007) reported the first appearance of Schizosphaerella punctulata at St Audrie's Bay in Bed 8, slightly before the\nPlate 1.\nFigs. 1–9.

We observed that major peaks in abundance of schizosphaerellids occur in concert with a carbonate content increase during the second δ13Corg negative excursion (Fig. 3). Each peak of schizosphaerellids is generally correlated with low TOC values, high CaCO3 values, and peaks in abundance of hyaline benthic foraminifers (Fig. 3). Black-shales are characterised by a strong reduction of the schizosphaerellids and a reduced abundance of benthic foraminifers (Fig. 3). We interpret this pattern as indicative of alternating phases of intensified vertical mixing or, conversely, stratification of the water column (Ivimey-Cook et al., 1999; Hodges, 2000; Wignall and Bond, 2008), in a continued environmental stress after the end-Triassic crisis.\nThe Schizosphaerella palaeoecological preferences during the Jurassic have received much in-depth attention and debate, with some studies documenting high abundances of this taxon in oligotrophic environments (Claps et al., 1995; Cobianchi and Picotti, 2001; Pittet and Mattioli, 2002). Certain authors have suggested that Schizosphaerella inhabited the lower photic zone and flourished when the nutricline was deep and surface waters were characterised by enhanced oligotrophy (Claps et al., 1995; Tremolada et al., 2005). Recent studies of pelagic as well as periplatform successions in the Southern Alps support this interpretation (Cobianchi and Picotti, 2001; Erba, 2004). A different interpretation of Schizosphaerella palaeoecology suggests that this taxon was essentially neritic, mesotrophic and opportunistic, flourishing during intervals of intensified vertical mixing in the surface water column (Mattioli, 1997; Walsworth-Bell, 2001). Mattioli and Pittet (2004) have argued that Schizosphaerella spp. probably benefitted from sporadic nutrient pulses. These pulses could have been related to storm events and unstable conditions in surface waters. This interpretation is supported by the observation of high abundances of Schizosphaerella spp. in proximal settings characterised by high carbonate production and possibly low fertility in surface waters. Our results show that in Doniford Bay the peaks of Schizosphaerella spp. occurred during reoxygenation phases, when recycling of organic matter and nutrients occurred, thus confirming the latter hypothesis."

    "text": "The Doniford Bay stratigraphic distribution of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages accurately mirrors the environmental changes produced by sea-level fluctuations, documented by sedimentological evidence. The lower part of the Cotham Member could not be sampled, because of the presence of faults (Fig. 3C), however, for this interval Copestake (1989) reports in England (St Audrie's Bay) foraminiferal assemblages characterised by low diversity, agglutinated foraminifers with similarities to abundant Glomospira and Glomospirella and subordinate Ammobaculites. These assemblages are suggestive of a coastal environment, further confirmed by the presence of sedimentary structures such as ripple marks and mud cracks. Moreover, Copestake (1989) identified abundance peaks of Eoguttulina liassica, which is a characteristic component of the Langport Member rocks throughout southwest Britain. In an analogy with the modern day distribution of Guttulina, the foraminiferal assemblages of the Langport Member indicate the presence of shallow marine hypersaline environments. The lack of benthic foraminifers at\nmear slide, optical microscopy. 2.

Unfortunately, Copestake (1989) did not provide detailed stratigraphical distributions of foraminifers for each section studied. At Doniford, we recovered abundantly present E. liassica at the base of the Blue Lias Formation (Fig. 3C). The Blue Lias Formation shows an abundance peak of taxa typically documented during transgressive phases, namely: Reinholdella sp., Oberhauserellidae, in the lower part of Bed 7 and of Paralingulina tenera in the uppermost part of it (Brouwer, 1969; Hesselbo et al., 2004; Gräfe, 2005; Fig. 3C).\nThe most important factors that control the benthic foraminiferal distribution are food and oxygen availabilities (Jorissen et al., 1995; Van der Zwaan et al., 1999). In Doniford Bay, evidence suggests that extreme anoxic conditions alternated with more ventilated seabottom environments, which correspond to an outer-shelf environment in the lowermost Jurassic, during the second negative CIE (Fig. 3). These anoxic conditions are indicated by the presence of the highest TOC values (5–10%) and an almost total absence of benthic fauna (Fig. 3). Better-ventilated conditions are suggested by lower values of TOC correlated with a significant development of benthic foraminifers (Fig. 3). However, at the sea-bottom, conditions remained stressful and dysaerobic, as indicated by very low diversified hyaline foraminiferal assemblages (Fig. 3). Aragonitic Oberhauserellidae and Reinholdella sp. characterise the first foraminiferal acme abundance (Fig. 3). Reinholdella sp. was probably a surface-dwelling species and opportunistic phytodetritus feeder, that most likely benefitted from short periods of bottom-water reoxygenation (Mailliot et al., 2009). In the same manner, Hylton and Hart (2000) and Hart et al. (2003, see their Fig. 1) describe Oberhauserellidae as disaster or opportunist taxa, recorded in times of rapid sea-level change and very poorly oxygenated conditions during the early Toarcian Anoxic Event. Paralingulina tenera (a deepinfaunal taxon) is primarily responsible for the second foraminiferal abundance peak. This development of this peak was probably favoured by high fluxes of organic matter to the sea-bottom, combined with tolerance to dysoxic conditions (Bartolini et al., 1992; Mailliot et al., 2009). The assemblage dominated by P. tenera therefore indicates that infauna calcitic foraminifers were established, and that these were adapted to trophic conditions characterised by abundant and high quality, labile organic matter. The crossover between epifauna-dominated and infauna-dominated foraminiferal assemblages may indicate the restoration of export production. However, the very low diversity and marked development of opportunist taxa indicate that sea-bottom conditions remained stressful, probably as a result of oxygen-depletion. An incipient, slow restoration of sea-bottom oxygenation is suggested by changes at the top of the section, where benthic foraminifers are less abundant, combined with a more diversified infaunal fauna. Similar evidence for oxygen-depleted conditions in the shales of the lower Pre-Planorbis Beds at St Audrie's Bay has been identified by Wignall (2001). Shelly macrofauna (Hallam, 1975) and trace fossils (Twitchett and Barras, 2004; Barras and Twitchett, 2007) of the PrePlanorbis Beds suggest a causal link between the reduction in body size of various taxa and low oxygen concentrations (e.g., Rhoads and Morse, 1971), although changes in food supply and productivity cannot be ruled out as possible causes of these body size changes (Mander et al., 2008)."

    "heading": "7.3. The re-activation of the carbonate biological pump in Doniford",
    "text": "Calcareous nannoplankton supports both primary and carbonate production. They are themain drivers of the carbonate pump and, due to the ballasting effect of coccoliths on marine snow, calcareous nannoplankton also drive the organic pump, accelerating the transfer of organic matter from surface waters to sea-bottom (i.e., export production). The organic and inorganic carbon pumps are therefore\ntightly coupled (Barker et al., 2003; Ridgwell, 2003; Rost and Riebesell, 2004; Sarmiento et al., 2004). At Doniford, the peaks in abundance of schizosphaerellids, which represent both primary and carbonate producers, coincide with calcareous hyaline benthic foraminiferal peaks (E. liassica, Oberhauserellidae-Reinholdella sp., P. tenera), which are mainly controlled by the export production (particularly high flux of OM) as well as by oxygen levels in bottom waters (Jorissen et al., 1995; Thomas, 2003; see paragraph 6.2.2). This benthic–pelagic coupling probably indicates the activity of the carbonate biological pump.\nAfter the end-Triassic crisis, the initial recovery of the surface carbonate production started with the development of schizosphaerellids that occurred at the same time as the positive CIE (Bed 1), while the total absence of benthic foraminifers and high values of TOC could indicate anoxic sea-bottom conditions. The occurrence of hyaline benthic foraminifers started during the second negative CIE (Bed 6), probably triggered by phases of ventilation of the water column. From the upper part of Bed 6, a coupling between increasing abundances of both calcareous phytoplancton and benthic foraminifers is observed. Intervals where major peaks of schizosphaerellids and benthic foraminifers occur correlate with Type II OM and indicate dysaerobic conditions. Type II OM might express a better recycling of nutrients and a more complex trophic chain, also indicated by the benthic– pelagic coupling. Conversely, the low abundance of schizosphaerellids and absence of benthic foraminifers co-occurs with the record of Type I OM. This could be related to sea-bottom anoxia due to persistent stratification in the water column. Type I OM might reflect an ecosystem characterised by a simple trophic chain, dominated by organic primary producers (high development of organic phytoplankton and picoplankton). In summary, the benthic–pelagic coupling becomes more efficient during more ventilated conditions, characterised by an increase in pelagic carbonate production and efficient export production. During the periods when stratification occurred, stressful anoxic conditions would have prevailed. Sea surface carbonate production and flux would have decreased dramatically, while primary productivity was probably supported mainly by organic-walled phytoplankton.We tentatively correlate the abundant organic-walled phytoplankton in the Blue Lias Formation across the Tr–J boundary at St Audries's Bay, reported by van de Schootbrugge et al. (2007), to the major peaks of schizosphaerellids recorded at Doniford according to the shape of the δ13C curve, which is very similar in both sections. The dinoflagellate peaks (“F”; Fig. 3) seem to correlate with a positive excursion of δ13Corg and δ13Ccarb and very low abundances of schizosphaerellids. During the main organic CIE (or second negative CIE), peaks of prasinophytes (“G”, Bed 4) and acritarchs (“H”, Beds 7 and 17) preceded the main peaks of schizosphaerellids (Fig. 3).\nThe micropalaeontological results from Doniford presented in this study allow us to implement and better interpret the pattern of biocalcification crisis proposed for St Audrie's section by van de Schootbrugge et al. (2007). As a matter of facts, new recent data for calcareous nannofossils show that the major carbonate crisis coincides with the first “initial”, end-Triassic, negative carbon excursion (Clémence et al., in press). The second “main” early Hettangian excursion, e.g. the interval examined by van de Schootbrugge et al. (2007), is more closely associated with the initial restoration of surface carbonate production, in water column conditions that remained stressful."

    "heading": "7.4. Global scenario of the aftermath of the end-Triassic mass extinction",
    "text": "The succession and the nature of the events described here for the Doniford section are consistent with a global environmental scenario and for the biotic changes triggered by the CAMP volcanism. This important volcanic phases probably caused both physical effects, e.g. the major sea-level changes documented across the Tr–J boundary\n(Hallam and Wignall, 1999; Tanner et al., 2001) and chemical effects, namely the volcanic gaseous emissions that acted as a major trigger for climate changes (McHone, 2002; van de Schootbrugge et al., 2009).\nThe spectacular, high amplitude regressive–transgressive cycle observed in SW England could, therefore, be explained at least in part by its proximal palaeogeographic position to the CAMP province. At the end-Triassic, Western Europe regions were subject to an abrupt tectono-eustatic sea-level fall, and hiatus occurred in several settings, during the acme of the CAMP volcanism. Subsequently, the earliest Jurassic period was characterised by isostatic re-adjustment, and by an important sea-level rise (Hallam and Wignall, 1999).\nThe role of CAMP volcanism as climate change trigger may be due both to the emission of CO2 and SO2 gases. Authors have speculated that the climatic impact of the CAMP could have been twofold: first a short-term repeated releases of SO2 (cooling) during the end-Triassic paroxysmal phase, and second a long-term CO2 release (warming) during the early Hettangian post-crisis (Guex et al., 2004). An inefficient biological CO2 pumpingmechanism due to the productivity crisis, coupled with volcanogenic accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere resulting from the CAMP activity, could have produced a super greenhouse effect during the early Hettangian (McElwain et al., 1999, 2009). This global warming promoted a more humid climate that accelerated continental runoff and increased the input of continental-derived nutrients into the ocean. This may have, in turn, promoted biotic radiations in marine environments stimulating primary productivity as well as the recovery of zooplankton and nekton (Guex et al., 2004). The pattern observed at Doniford is interpreted as an incipient recovery of the carbonate biological pump, interrupted by episodic stratification and anoxia within the water column, conditions that proved favourable to organic phytoplankton and picoplankton development (Type I OM). A decrease in surface water salinity seems to be consistent with a scenario of increased greenhousewarming and runoff that promoted seawater stratification and the development of anoxia (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2007).\nThe Hettangian anoxic event recorded in Doniford Bay appears to be a widespread phenomenon; lower Hettangian black-shales occur globally, as demonstrated by records from Nevada (USA), Peru (Guex et al., 2004), and Italy (Ciarapica, 2007). The restoration of marine primary production sustained by elevated CO2 levels in the aftermath of amass extinction, can inducewater anoxia, a pattern also suggested for the aftermath of the Permo-Triassic crisis (Wignall and Twitchett, 1996; Grard et al., 2005).\nThe negatively correlated carbon isotope records of carbonate and organic matter found at Doniford in the lower Hettangian remain highly intriguing, but further work is necessary to better understand the organic and inorganic carbon isotope records during this crisis interval. That notwithstanding, these results argue against the methane-release as a trigger for the earliest Jurassic greenhouse climate (Marzoli et al., 1999; Wignall, 2001; Hesselbo et al., 2002, 2004). We would expect a parallel co-evolution of both δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg curves in a methane-release scenario, which is not supported by the evidence from England (this study), Italy (Galli et al., 2005) or from Austria (Clémence et al., in press)."

    "text": "The benthic–pelagic coupling in the early Hettangian Blue Lias Formation (Doniford Bay) records the intermittent restoration of the carbonate biological pump after the end-Triassic mass extinction. The pelagic surface carbonateproductionwasprimarily drivenby themassive development of schizosphaerellids, which were one of the major carbonate producers in the Jurassic ocean. The pattern of benthic foraminifers indicates that continuous low oxygen conditions prevailed at the sea-bottom. During the aftermath of the end-Triassic mass extinction, the water column at Doniford remained unstable due to\nalternating phases of ventilation and stratification that prevented the full restoration of the marine ecosystem.\nWe propose that the long-term CO2 accumulation due to CAMP volcanic degassing, coupled with inefficient biological pumping caused by primary productivity crisis, could have been themechanism responsible for the early Hettangian greenhouse warming. The Doniford carbon isotope records of carbonate and organic matter are negatively correlated and are therefore are not compatible with a methane-release hypothesis."
