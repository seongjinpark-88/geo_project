    "text": "Soils in the highlands of north-eastern Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) show dark-coloured topsoils which are light and very rich in organic matter. They are distributed in a mosaic of grassland, forest with Araucaria angustifolia and several anthropogenic vegetation forms. The climate is humid and temperate without marked dry periods. We characterized and classified 27 soils to investigate the relationships between present and past vegetation pattern and soil properties. All soils are strongly acidic with high clay contents, low bulk densities and most of them show high phosphate retentions. X-ray diffraction indicates the presence of quartz, kaolinite, secondary chlorite and gibbsite. Selective extractions with pyrophosphate (p), dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate (d) and acid oxalate (o) give in most horizons the following relationships: FedNFepNFeo and AlpNAldNAlo. Despite the possible Al release from gibbsite, we attribute the high Alp concentrations mainly to high amounts of Al–humus complexes. The absence of allophane and imogolite was confirmed by the very low Sio and Sid concentrations. 21 soils have andic properties according to World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) [IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006. World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2006. World Soil Resources Reports, 103. FAO, Rome.] at least for some depth range, 15 of them fulfil the minimum thickness and depth requirements of Andosols. They belong to the aluandic type and are the first detected Andosols in South America outside the areas of recent volcanism in the Andes. The other soils are Umbrisols (11) and Cambisols (1). In grassland soils, andic properties start at or near the soil surface, in forest soils they are only present in subsurface layers, especially in buried A horizons. The latter differ from their actual topsoils by some characteristics which they have in common with the grassland soils like deep black colours and low melanic indexes. It is known from pollen analyses that the Araucaria forests are invading the grasslands since about 1000 years. In this environment a grass vegetation seems to favour formation and permanence of Andosols whereas a change into the forest starts a process of losing andic properties. Most soils without andic properties or with andic properties of insufficient thickness only fail the required minimum concentrations of Alo and Feo. On the other hand, they all show similar concentrations of Ald and Fed. Therefore we conclude that the loss of andic properties with forest proliferation is caused by crystallization of Al and Fe oxides which seems to be easier under forest. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Andic properties show low bulk densities, large variable charge and high phosphate retentions which are linked mainly to the accumulation of various reactive forms of Al in the solid phase. Andic properties are distinguished between allophanic, where Al is present mainly in short range order minerals like allophane or imogolite and nonallophanic, where Al in organic complexes predominates (Shoji and Fujiwara, 1984; Dalhgren and Saigusa, 1994). Both types commonly show considerable amounts of ferrihydrite and a\n159A.

However, soils with andic properties which developed from other parent material are reported worldwide (Loveland and Bullock, 1976; Hunter et al., 1987; Garcia-Rodeja et al., 1987; Hewitt and Witty, 1988; Alexander et al., 1993; Bäumler and Zech, 1994; Aran et al., 1998; Caner et al., 2000; Delvaux et al., 2004, Bäumler et al., 2005). Their development was attributed to various types of parent materials and climatic conditions with or without short range order minerals.\nIn the highlands of southern Brazil occur soils with blackcoloured, humus-rich and thick topsoils, many of them having andic properties. They did not develop from volcanic ash but from rhyodacite under humid climate. According to the Brazilian system for soil classification (Bertoletti and Teixeira, 1995; Streck et al., 2002) these soils belong mainly to the order “Cambissolo Bruno Húmico Alumínico”, which indicates acid soils with high saturation of Al (≥50%) and the presence of brown B horizons below humus-rich A horizons. The thickness of A and B horizons varies widely. Some of the soils are “Neossolos” with an A–C sequence and a thickness b50 cm. The soils are distributed within a vegetation mosaic of grassland, deciduous forest with Araucaria angustifolia and shrubland (Fig. 2). We studied 27 soils to investigate the relationships between soil properties and genesis as well as present and past vegetation types. For soil classification we applied the second edition of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006). Compared to the first edition an important alteration is the identification of Andosols by andic or vitric properties instead of andic or vitric horizons. Contrary to a diagnostic horizon, a diagnostic property does not have a minimum thickness, and the thickness requirements are given in the key. This allows to comprise within the Andosols soils with several layers with andic or vitric properties (even interrupted by other layers) which in combination fulfil a thickness requirement. The relevant definitions are given here (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006). Andic properties require:\n1. an Alox+1/2Feox value of 2.0 percent or more; and 2. a bulk density of 0.90 kg dm−3 or less; and 3. a phosphate retention of 85 percent or more; and 4. if occurring under tephric material that meets the require-\nments of an albic horizon, a Cpy/OC or a Cf/Cpy of less than 0.5; and\n5. less than 25% (by mass) organic carbon.\nCriterion 4 is obviously irrelevant for our soils. The other requirements have to be checked.\nThe definition of the Andosols in the key is: Other soils having\n1. one or more layers with andic or vitric properties with a combined thickness of either a. 30 cm or more within 100 cm of the soil surface and\nstarting within 25 cm of the soil surface; or\nb. 60% or more of the entire thickness of the soil when continuous rock or a cemented or indurated layer starts between 25 and 50 cm from the soil surface; and 2. no argic, ferralic, petroplinthic, pisoplinthic, plinthic or spodic horizon (unless buried deeper than 50 cm).\nVitric properties and the entire point 2 do not apply for the soils presented here.\nThe characterization of these soils and their classification led to the first detection ofAndosols in SouthAmerica outside the active volcanic areas in the Andes. These Andosols are associated with Umbrisols and to a lesser extent with Cambisols, which mostly show andic properties for at least some depth range, too.\nThe present vegetation is a mosaic of grassland (campo) and forest with Araucaria angustifolia together with several anthropogenic vegetation forms. Pollen analyses indicate that grassland dominated the highlands in the early and middle Holocene during a drier and warmer climate with presumably an annual dry season of about three months (Behling, 1997). On the highlands a replacement of grassland by Araucaria forest started since about 1000 years and A. angustifolia itself became more frequent about 850 years ago. It is assumed, that these vegetation changes reflect the shift to a more humid climate with no or only very short dry periods (Behling et al., 2001). Our question in this context is: Which present or past vegetation favours the genesis and permanence of Andosols?"

    "text": "The study area belongs to the northern highlands of the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul (29°28′–29′ S, 50°10′–13′ W). Our soils are located in and around the forest reserve CPCN Pró-Mata (Centro de Pesquisas e Conservação da Natureza), which is about 35 km East of the city of São Francisco de Paula (Fig. 1). All soils lie in a smoothly undulating land surface at 900–950 m a.s.l. and developed from rhyodacite (Jurassic–Cretaceous volcanism), which has a SiO2 content of N63% (Roisenberg, 1989) and high contents of weatherable minerals, above all plagioclases and pyroxenes (Roisenberg, 1989; Ebner, 2001). Soil temperature and soil moisture regimes are thermic and udic, respectively (USDA, 1999).\nThe high precipitation (annual mean 2252 mm), the moderate temperature (annual mean 14.5 °C), the relative humidity of 84% (Bertoletti and Teixeira, 1995) and frequent fogs (92 fog days per year) (Moreno, 1961) indicate a humid character without a pronounced dry period. Climate data are documented from the São Francisco de Paula station (912 m a.s.l.). The local climate of Pró-Mata probably shows even higher precipitation and more frequent fogs, because Pró-Mata is directly located at the steep brink of the highland and the transport ofmoist tropical air masses against the brink by the South Atlantic anticyclone leads to relief rainfall the entire year.\nThe present vegetation is a mosaic of grasslands and disturbed Araucaria forest (deciduous forest with the conifer Araucaria angustifolia). In the forest reserve Pró-Mata all\n160 A. Dümig et al. / Geoderma 145 (2008) 158–173\nforms of land use, for example tree felling or grazing and burning of grassland, terminated in 1992. This led to diverse types of successions by shrubs and pioneer trees on grassland. In addition, areas with secondary forest and shrubland, established after forest clearing, can be found. Sphagnum bogs with grasses and with or without shrubs are common in basins and sinks. Even outside the reserve area agricultural and pastoral activities are low, but recently afforestation of pastureland with Pinus (mainly Pinus taeda and elliottii) is increasing."

Litter samples (Oi and Oe horizons) were collected with a 0.2 m×0.2 m rack at eight places in regular distances adjacent to each soil pit, except for some grassland soils without marked litter accumulation. All samples were oven-dried at 40 °C, soil samples passed through a 2 mm sieve, litter and plant samples finely ground in a rotor beater mill. In addition, aliquots of all soil samples were oven-dried at 105 °C to determine the water content for the correction to oven dry soil values of mass balanced parameters.\nFrom the b2 mm fraction an aliquot was ground in a planetary ball mill for C and N analyses. The litter samples were also dried at 105 °C and finely ground in a rotor beater mill. Undisturbed 100 cm3 ring samples were collected at field capacity from the centre of 137 horizons (Oa, A and B horizons) in triplicate for bulk density measurement."

    "text": "All analytical determinations, except for bulk density, were made on material b2 mm. For particle size analysis organic matter was oxidized with H2O2 (30%). Afterwards the sample was dispersed with a solution of 200 ml of 0.025 M Na4P2O7 solution and 200 ml of H2O and shaken for 16 h, followed by wet sieving for determination of the fractions 2000–630 μm, 630–200 μm and 200–63 μm. The residue was washed and freeze-dried. For dispersion 40 ml of 0.025 M Na4P2O7 solution and 40 ml of H2O was added to an aliquot of the freeze-dried sample (3–4 g) and the suspension was treated by ultrasound for about 3 min (75 J ml−1) (Branson Sonifier). Afterwards the fractions 63–20 μm, 20–6.3 μm, 6.3–2 μm and b2 μm were determined using the X-ray attenuation method (Sedigraph 5100, Micromeritics).\nTotal carbon (Ctot) and nitrogen (Ntot) were determined by combustion (Elementar Vario EL). As all soils were carbonatefree the measured C is completely organic. Soil pH was measured in water (pH H2O) and in 1 M KCl (pH KCl) at a soil: solution ratio of 1:2.5. Phosphate retention was determined according to Blakemore et al. (1987) as described by Van Reeuwijk (2002) and the P concentrations were measured photometrically (Photometer Spectronic 601). We conducted three analyses of Al, Fe and Si fractions: with dithionite– citrate–bicarbonate (DCB: Ald, Fed, Sid) according to Mehra and Jackson (1960), with oxalate (Alo, Feo, Sio) using the method of Schwertmann (1964) and with pyrophosphate (Alp, Fep, Sip) as described by Van Reeuwijk (2002), which is based on Blakemore et al. (1987) and USDA (1972). Superfloc was added to avoid flocculation in the pyrophosphate extracts. The Al, Fe and Si concentrations were measured with an ICP-OES (Varian Vario-Pro). The melanic index was determined according to Van Reeuwijk (2002), who modified the method of Honna et al. (1988). The optical extinctions were measured photometrically (Photometer Spectronic 601). For cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable cations several procedures had to be done. The exchangeable base cations were removed with 1 M NH4OAc at pH 7 (USDA, 2004), the sample was then washed with isopropanol (ethanol which has been often used in the past removed some adsorbed NH4 + ions from\nthe exchange sites and therefore underestimated the potential CEC) and after that rinsed with 1 M KCl. In the leachate the NH4\n+ ions were measured (Segmented Flow Analyzer) to calculate the potential CEC. Al and H were determined in a different aliquot by the method of Bertsch and Bloom (1996) with 1 M KCl. All cation concentrations were measured with an ICP-OES (Varian Vario-Pro). Mineralogy was assessed on the clay fractions from two topsoil and two subsoil horizons by Xray diffraction (XRD) after Moore and Reynolds (1989). The samples were preliminary treated with dithionite–citrate– bicarbonate (DCB) (Mehra and Jackson, 1960) to remove Fe oxides. XRD was performed on random powder samples and on oriented samples (Co-Kα; Philips diffractometer PW1830) after saturation with Ca2+ and glycerol (room temperature) and K+ (room temperature and stepwise heated to 560 °C)."

Depending on the inclination and the relative position within the relief (Table 1) different types of horizon sequences developed. Soils with A–C sequence and shallow depth (25–32 cm) are located on hilltops or upper slopes (G3, GS1, PP1, F5). On lower to middle slopes and in basins as well as on large plateaus deeper soils up to 160 cm depth with A–C and A–B–C sequences are found.\nAll soils but one (F9) in Araucaria forest and the two pedons in patches of Araucaria forest get darker with increasing topsoil depth and become black like grassland topsoils. The two shrubland (S1, S2) and four Araucaria forest soils (F6, F7, F8, F10), predominantly located on middle slopes, have buried A horizons, which are darker than the overlying ones and which indicate severe erosive processes in the past. We neither observed evidence of cutanic features nor of illuviation of clay, Fe or organic matter in the field. Furthermore no thixotropy was detected. However, we found macroscopically visible charcoal in six soils with Araucaria forest (F1–3, F6–8), four grassland (P1, GS2, GS4–5) and both shrubland pedons (S1, S2) (Table 1). In forest soils the charcoal pieces were mainly located in surface horizons, while they were found in deeper horizons in the grassland soils. In soils with shrubland vegetation charcoal was distributed among the whole pedon."

The lowest and highest OC contents of the uppermost horizons (Oa or Ah) are with forest vegetation 61.7– 307.8 g kg−1. With the exception of the buried horizons they decrease almost regularly with depth. The weighted averages\nof OC in the top 50 cm (OCwa50) comprising Oa and mineral horizons and excluding Oi and Oe horizons show a wide variation for grassland (G, GS and P) and forest soils (F) with 70–177 and 30–178 g kg−1, respectively. Both shrubland pedons (S1, S2) have relatively low OCwa50 with 80 and 96 g kg−1, the two soils in forest patches (FP1, FP2) contain\n168 A. Dümig et al. / Geoderma 145 (2008) 158–173\n126 and 175 g kg−1 and the bog-like soil (B) 155 g kg−1. It should be noted that the four soils with thicknesses ≤32 cm have relatively high weighted averages of OC with 128 (PP1), 148 (G3), 153 (GS1) and 178 g kg−1 (F5). The C:N ratios of the topsoil horizons increase with depth and vary between 13 and 47.\nAlmost all soil samples have pH (H2O) 4–5 and pH (KCl) 3.5–4.5. Values of ΔpH (pH H2O–pH KCl) mostly vary from 0.4 to 0.9. The moderate to strong acidity is in accordance with very small concentrations of exchangeable bases (Ca: 0.1– 2.8 cmolc kg−1, K: 0.1–0.9 cmolc kg−1,Mg: 0.1–2.6 cmolc kg−1, Na: 0.1–0.5 cmolc kg−1). The values for the sum of exchangeable bases (SEB) are low, and in the uppermost horizons (Oa or Ah) (0.6–5.7 cmolc kg−1) they are higher than in the lower ones (0.1– 1.1 cmolc kg−1) because of the liberation of bases by the mineralization of organic matter. Consequently the effective cation exchange capacity measured at field pH (CECeff = sum of KClextractable Al and H, and SEB) is very low (2.9–19.8 cmolc kg−1) and dominated by KCl-extractable Al, as indicated by the Al/ CECeff ratios of 0.55–0.94 in the uppermost horizons (Oa or Ah) and 0.83–0.97 in the lower horizons. Compared with that, the potential CEC (CECb) values are much higher (18.3–155.2 cmolc kg−1) and closely related to the OC content. Only in deep subsoils relatively high CECb values are found despite having low OC contents (e.g. Bw4 and Bw5 of P1 and Bw2 to Cw of PP2).\nPhosphate retention ranges from 34.7% to 99.5%. It is N82% in the uppermost horizons (Oa or Ah) of grassland (G, GS, P) and shrubland (S), whereas in uppermost horizons of forest soils (F, FP) a variation of 50 to 87% is noticed.\nThe values of Al fractions (Alo, Ald and Alp) are lowest in the uppermost horizons. Then they increase with soil depth, which is particularly strong for Alp, and decrease again in the lower subsoil horizons. Most uppermost horizons have AldNAlp and Alo, whereas most lower top- and subsoil horizons show the following relationships: AlpNAldNAlo. Only three soils (GS2, PP2, B), which are located in basins, and a few subsoil horizons of other pedons have AloNAld. The concentration of KCl-extractable Al (0.02–0.13%) is low in relation to Alp, Ald and Alo.\nFor Fe, the extractions with pyrophosphate (p), dithionite– citrate–bicarbonate (d) and acid oxalate (o) result for most soils in the following relationships: FedNFepNFeo. The uppermost horizons contain the lowest values for all fractions. Most soils show both, increasing values for Fep and Feo as well as higher Fep/Feo ratios with increasing soil depth. In contrast, the Fed value is not related to soil depth. The Feo/Fed ratios regularly decrease with increasing soil depth, except of some soils with buried horizons. Topsoils of Araucaria forest have clearly lower Feo and Alo concentrations as well as lower Feo/Fed ratios than those of the grassland soils. All soils have very low concentrations of Sio (b0.4%) and Sid (b0.6%), whereas values of Sip (b3.5%) were higher (data not shown)."

Both were detected to be well-developed. We neither found large differences in the clay-mineral composition between the four analyzed samples nor between the upper layers (A horizons) and subsoils (B horizons).

    "heading": "4.1. Soil classification",
    "text": "All soils were classified according to the second edition of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006). The identified diagnostic horizons and properties are listed in Table 1. Table 3 shows the soil groups with ranges of phosphate retentions, Alo+0.5 Feo values and organic carbon contents of uppermost (Oa or Ah) and lower topsoil horizons and of the uppermost buried horizons. 21 of the 27 soils have andic properties in at least some layer. In 15 of them the andic properties reach the required thickness and start within the required depth for Andosols (see Introduction). In seven Andosols covered with grassland, shrubland and Pinus plantation the andic properties start directly at the soil surface without a litter layer (G2, G3) or below a litter layer (Oi and Oe horizons) (GS1, GS4, S1, S2, PP2). In the grassland Andosol GS2 the andic properties start below an Oa horizon which fulfills all the criteria of andic properties except the maximum OC content. The other seven Andosols are under Araucaria forest (F1, F2, F5, F6, F8, F10, FP2). Above the andic properties they all have Oa and/or Ah horizons with lower Alo+0.5 Feo values (1.0–1.9%), six of them having also lower phosphate retentions (66–84%).\nThe melanic index (MI) was used to differentiate melanic from fulvic characteristics (see Table 1). Both reflect highly humified organic matter, but the melanic characteristics differ from the fulvic ones by a lower ratio of fulvic acids to humic acids and by the presence of a higher amount of A–type humic acids. Melanic characteristics are typically formed under grassland and fulvic under forest (Honna et al., 1988). The melanic horizon (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) requires in addition to aMIb1.7Munsell values and chromas, moist, of 2 or less. For the fulvic horizon it is sufficient to have a MI≥1.7 or a chroma or value of more than 2. Moreover, the melanic and fulvic horizons require a weighted average of 6% or more organic carbon (OC) and 4% or more OC in all parts as well as a cumulative thickness of 30 cm or more with less than 10 cm of non-melanic or non-fulvic material in between, respectively, and, of course, the presence of andic properties throughout. Following these criteria, three Andosols have a melanic horizon (GS4, FP2, PP2) and seven have fulvic horizons (G3, S1, S2, F1, F2, F6, F8). The remaining five Andosols have too low thicknesses for a fulvic horizon (F5, GS1), alternating MI values (G2,\n169A. Dümig et al. / Geoderma 145 (2008) 158–173\nGS2) or too low OC contents (F10). Moreover, all Andosols are qualified as aluandic (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) due to low oxalate extractable Si (Siob0.6%) and high ratios of pyrophosphate extractable to oxalate extractable Al (Alp/ Alo≥0.5). For each soil, lists of all applying prefix and suffix qualifiers according to WRB are given in Table 1.\nEleven soils are classified as Umbrisols having an umbric horizon with an OC content ≥0.6%, a base saturation b50%, a Munsell chroma ≤3 and value ≤3 when moist as well as a value ≤5 when dry, well-developed structures with mostly granular or subangular blocky aggregates and a sufficient thickness. Six of them have andic properties for a certain depth range (G1, GS5, P2, FP1, F4, F7) starting in forest soils at greater depth than in grassland soils. Five are missing andic properties throughout (GS3, P1, F3, PP1, B), all failing the required concentrations of Al and Fe in acid oxalate. The watersaturated bog-like soil B, situated in a small basin, additionally fails the required phosphate retention and shows very small concentrations of oxalate, dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate and pyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al. On the other hand, every Andosol in our area has an umbric horizon. If the definition of Andosols were restricted to soils from recent volcanic materials all the Andosols presented here would key out as Umbrisols.\nThe soils of our area do not have spodic horizons. Some A horizons which belong to a second geological stratum (buried soils or not) have Alo+0.5 Feo contents which are more than the double of what is observed in an overlying horizon (F2, F3, F7, F10). But this is an effect of sedimentation and not of podzolization. Overlapping characteristics of Andosols and Podzols are well-known in the literature (Alexander et al., 1993; Aran et al., 2001; Bäumler et al., 2005).\nThe remaining soil F9 is a Cambisol having a cambic horizon from 8 to 58 cm and failing the acid oxalate and the phosphate retention requirements of andic properties throughout. F9 is characterized by the absence of a dark-coloured thick topsoil and very small values of Alo+0.5 Feo.\nFig. 3 shows that phosphate retention is strongly related to the Alo+0.5 Feo value (R 2 =0.79, pb0.001, n=164). Moreover\nit points out the higher phosphate retentions of grassland uppermost horizons (Oa or Ah) compared to those of Araucaria forest and that buried horizons of Araucaria forest and shrubland soils meet the andic criteria."

    "text": "The classification of 27 soils according to WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) resulted in a mosaic of 15 Andosols, 11 Umbrisols and one Cambisol (Table 3). However, the chemical and physical analyses show that the soils differ in some properties not that much as their placement into different soil groups reflects. All have low bulk densities in the topsoil and with the exception of two (F9, B) all have high phosphate retentions at some depth.\nThe way the distribution of the Andosols and Umbrisols depends from the vegetation can only be understood if we\n170 A. Dümig et al. / Geoderma 145 (2008) 158–173\nconsider vegetation history. The grassland was the widely predominating vegetation till around 1000 years ago according to pollen analyses (Behling, 1997; Behling et al., 2001). The melanic indexes (MI) depend directly from the vegetation. In the uppermost horizons (Oa or Ah) they have the following values (Table 1): grassland: 1.5–1.8, Araucaria forest: 1.9–2.6, shrubland: 2.0–2.2. In soils with buried A horizons the MI is lowest in the first (F6, F7, F8, F10, S1) or second (S2) buried horizon. (Buried soils were only found in Araucaria forest and shrubland and are all Andosols.) This confirms that these buried soils have developed under grassland and a significant amount of grassland humus persisted especially in the upper part of the buried soils. In the overlying soils predominantly tree-derived humus with higher MI values accumulated, and further down in the buried soils the remnants of old grassland humus decrease with depth and probably become outranged by recent input from tree roots. In these six Andosols the andic properties are always found in the buried soil. In the overlying soil it depends on the vegetation. While present in the two shrubland soils, under forest they are absent (F7) or present only in the layer directly overlying the buried soil (F6, F8, F10).\nThe Araucaria forest soil F5 lies on the forest border and shows like pedon FP2 in the patch of Araucaria forest the typical black colour of the grassland soils and decreasing melanic indexes with increasing soil depth, indicating that these forests recently invaded the grassland. It has been shown previously that, where deciduous forest spread onto grassland, the soils may lose in a relatively short period their black colour and their A-type humic acids (Golchin et al., 1997; Higashi et al., 1999; Caner et al., 2003), which are typical for melanic characteristics (Honna et al., 1988). That the MI of some grassland soils is slightly higher than the typical grassland value of b1.7 can be explained with the input of organic matter derived from shrubs. Also for the Andosol PP2 in the Pinus plantation the andic characteristics are related to the grassland which had been there before the afforestation 13 years ago. Obviously grassland favours in that environment the formation and permanence of andic properties."

    "heading": "4.3. Soil forming processes and the origin of andic properties",
    "text": "The soils of Pró-Mata originate from acid to intermediate rhyodacite and developed under a highland climate with high rainfalls. The intense status of weathering is reflected by high contents of clay dominated by kaolinite and chloritized 2:1 minerals as well as by the absence of primary silicate minerals. The climate led to small concentrations of exchangeable bases and high Al saturations, which all agree with the low pH. Several soil properties as high potential CEC and low bulk densities are strongly related to the high content of organic matter. Thus, a key process for the development of the andic properties is the accumulation of organic matter. Taking into account the originally high content of weatherable minerals in rhyodacite and the high weathering status, we conclude that high amounts of Al had been released, which then interacted with the organic phase leading to a stabilization of organic matter. The inhibition of humus mineralization by formation of\norgano-metallic complexes, particularly of Al and Fe with organic compounds, is well documented (Broadbent et al., 1964; Martin et al., 1966; Blaser and Klemmedson, 1987; Oades, 1988).\nPhosphate retention is highly correlated to the amount of non-crystalline Al and to a lower degree also to non-crystalline Fe oxides (e. g. ferrihydrite), which are determined by acid oxalate extraction (o). Oxalate extraction estimates the amount of total non-crystalline Fe (Schwertmann, 1964) and Al, including Fe and Al bonded to humus, Al in allophane and imogolite, as well as Al and Fe in non-crystalline hydroxides and oxyhydroxides (Wada, 1977; Wada, 1980; Mizota and Wada, 1980). Most topsoils with Alo+0.5 Feo≥1.6% have phosphate retentions ≥85% which indicates that other forms of active Al and Fe than those which are extractable by oxalate treatment are contributing also to the high phosphate retention. Pyrophosphate is an even more effective extractant of Al and Fe bound to humus but much less effective for the other forms (Wada, 1977; Higahsi and Shinagawa, 1981; Mizota and van Reeuwijk, 1989). Pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe values exceeding oxalate extractable Al and Fe values have been reported several times for nonallophanic Andosols (Wada et al., 1986; Bäumler & Zech, 1994; Egashira et al., 1997). Therefore Alp/Alo ratios are frequently used to estimate the relative proportions of the different kinds of active Al. The high Alp/Alo ratios (1–2) of most topsoils in Pró-Mata can be interpreted as evidence of the predominance of Al–humus complexes rather than of short range order minerals, which would lead to much lower Alp/Alo ratios of 0.1–0.4 (Nanzyo et al., 1993). In nonallophanic Andosols with pH (H2O) below 4.9 the ratio of Alp/Ald is mostly greater than 0.9 (Shoji and Fujiwara, 1984) because of the stable complexes Al3+ ions form with soil organic matter (Shoji et al., 1982), which is coincident to our strongly acid soils with high Alp/Ald ratios (N1). Additionally, hydroxyl-Al-organic complexes as well as ill-defined alumosilicate complexes, from which some Al is also extracted by pyrophoshate, can develop depending on the concentrations of humic substances (Huang, 1991). The presence of Al phases similar to hydroxyl-Al in soils, where intense weathering caused depletion of silica, is also reported by Wada and Wada (1976). Formation and stability of allophanes and imogolites is limited to pH (H2O) N4.9 (Shoji and Fujiwara, 1984) or, as stated by Wada (1989), from 5 to 7. Shoji et al. (1985) found that in nonallophanic Andosols with clay fractions dominated by chloritized 2:1 minerals, Alo consists largely or wholly of Al complexed with humus. On the other hand, it is reported that pyrophosphate may release not only Al bonded in humus complexes but also some Al from mineral compounds (Higashi et al., 1981). Kaiser and Zech (1996) indicated that pyrophosphate due to alkaline dissolution may extract some Al from Al hydroxide phases and peptized Al hydroxides associated with organic matter. It cannot be excluded that in Pró-Mata even some Al from gibbsite may be extracted by pyrophosphate. Additionally, high Fep/Feo ratios (0.9–1.6) of most topsoils in Pró-Mata suggest that Fe may also be present to some extent in metal–humus complexes. But as Fe seldom forms complexes with humus, it cannot be excluded that pyrophosphate disperses\n171A. Dümig et al. / Geoderma 145 (2008) 158–173\nalso some poorly crystalline or even finely divided crystalline Fe oxides (Jeanroy and Guillet, 1981).\nDithionite–citrate–bicarbonate (DCB) also extracts various forms of Al and Fe in soils, such as from humus complexes, allophane-like constituents and hydrous oxides (Wada, 1977). Contrary to the other extractants, the latter may be to a greater extent in crystalline forms. We conclude further that the stronger increase of pyrophosphate extractable Al and Fe compared to dithionite extractable Al and Fe from the upper topsoil horizons to the horizons below with lower OC contents (Table 1) reflects the low complexing ability of litter and young humus for Al and Fe, which increases with time or humification and therefore with depth as stated by Wada and Higashi (1976). That in many soils the Alo and Feo values are highest in the upper horizons is due to the inhibitory effect of organic compounds on the crystallization of minerals (Schwertmann, 1966; Shoji and Ono, 1978; Huang, 1991). This is especially the case for grassland soils which will be discussed later. In BA or B horizons with low OC contents the Alp and Fep values decline stronger than those of the other Al and Fe species but there is no clear relation between the concentrations of Alp and OC contents (R\n2 =0.20, pb0.001, n=164), why we again assume that the type of strongly humified substances rather than the amount of organic matter determines interactions between humus and different forms of active Al and Fe. Shoji and Ono (1978) showed that phosphate retention of nonallophanic Andosols with clay fractions dominated by chloritized 2:1 minerals is closely related to Ald.\nWe found that the relation of P retention is strongest with both, Alo (R 2 =0.82, pb0.001, n=164) and Ald (R 2 =0.78, pb0.001, n=164), and slightly less strong with Alp (R 2 =0.71, pb0.001, n=164). For Fe the relation of P retention (pb0.001, n=164) is strongest with Fep (R\n2 =0.54), followed by Feo (R2 =0.46) and is lowest with Fed (R\n2 =0.21). Almost all horizons of our soils show low contents of Sid and only traces of Sio, confirming the absence of allopohane and imogolite (Shoji et al., 1985). In contrast, Sip values were considerably higher, why we assume that some Si released by weathering is bound to humus, too.\nThe topsoil horizons under Araucaria forest, where the organic matter is mainly derived from trees, do not exhibit andic properties. Generally, they have clearly lower Feo and/or Alo concentrations, lower Feo/Fed ratios, and lower phosphate retentions than the upper topsoil horizons of the grassland soils. But the Fed concentrations are in the same range. Therefore we conclude that under forest crystallization of Fe (and Al) oxides seems to be easier than under grassland. A better aeration of the forest soils may contribute to crystallization. Burgert (2001) studied the water potentials in Pró-Mata soils for 100 days. For a depth of 40 cm he compared forest and non-forested areas and found markedly lower values in the forest for the whole time. That may reflect an ongoing process of losing andic properties with forest spreading. The depth where the andic properties start depends on the age of forest invasion and goes along with two other alterations: The soil colour changes from black into dark brown and the melanic index rises. The two soils in patches of Araucaria forest (FP1, FP2) and two other at the border of the\nAraucaria forest (F4, F5) show up that changes at 10–15 cm from the soil surface, whereas the three other Araucaria forest soils have it at greater depth."

    "text": "We detected for the first time Andosols in South America outside the volcanic rim of the Andes. The studied 27 soils are 15 Andosols, 11 Umbrisols and one Cambisol. Six Umbrisols also show andic properties but just miss the thickness or depth requirements for Andosols. The other five miss the requirements for Al and Fe concentrations in acid oxalate. But only one Umbrisol and the Cambisol fail the phosphate retention criterion of the andic properties and all soils have low bulk densities at some depth. The andic properties belong to the nonallophanic (aluandic) type and result mainly from Al and Fe humus complexes, but probably also from interactions of humus with poorly crystalline active Al and Fe phases. We conclude that the development of these andic properties is due to the high release of Al and Fe by intense weathering of rhyodacite and the accumulation of organic matter favoured by the formation of organo-metallic complexes under strong acid conditions with high rainfalls. Andic properties are predominantly found in upper and intermediate depths of grassland soils and in buried and other subsoil horizons under Araucaria forest, but not in recent forest topsoils. Hence we suggest that the andic properties have evolved under grassland vegetation. Araucaria forest invading the grasslands promotes the crystallization of Al and Fe oxides which characterizes an ongoing process of losing andic properties. Further the results indicate that the invasion of shrubs and the expansion of Araucaria forest into grasslands is not controlled by the presence or absence of andic properties."

  "abstractText": "Soils in the highlands of north-eastern Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) show dark-coloured topsoils which are light and very rich in organic matter. They are distributed in a mosaic of grassland, forest with Araucaria angustifolia and several anthropogenic vegetation forms. The climate is humid and temperate without marked dry periods. We characterized and classified 27 soils to investigate the relationships between present and past vegetation pattern and soil properties. All soils are strongly acidic with high clay contents, low bulk densities and most of them show high phosphate retentions. X-ray diffraction indicates the presence of quartz, kaolinite, secondary chlorite and gibbsite. Selective extractions with pyrophosphate (p), dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate (d) and acid oxalate (o) give in most horizons the following relationships: FedNFepNFeo and AlpNAldNAlo. Despite the possible Al release from gibbsite, we attribute the high Alp concentrations mainly to high amounts of Al–humus complexes. The absence of allophane and imogolite was confirmed by the very low Sio and Sid concentrations. 21 soils have andic properties according to World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) [IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006. World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2006. World Soil Resources Reports, 103. FAO, Rome.] at least for some depth range, 15 of them fulfil the minimum thickness and depth requirements of Andosols. They belong to the aluandic type and are the first detected Andosols in South America outside the areas of recent volcanism in the Andes. The other soils are Umbrisols (11) and Cambisols (1). In grassland soils, andic properties start at or near the soil surface, in forest soils they are only present in subsurface layers, especially in buried A horizons. The latter differ from their actual topsoils by some characteristics which they have in common with the grassland soils like deep black colours and low melanic indexes. It is known from pollen analyses that the Araucaria forests are invading the grasslands since about 1000 years. In this environment a grass vegetation seems to favour formation and permanence of Andosols whereas a change into the forest starts a process of losing andic properties. Most soils without andic properties or with andic properties of insufficient thickness only fail the required minimum concentrations of Alo and Feo. On the other hand, they all show similar concentrations of Ald and Fed. Therefore we conclude that the loss of andic properties with forest proliferation is caused by crystallization of Al and Fe oxides which seems to be easier under forest. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
