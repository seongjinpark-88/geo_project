The initiation, culmination, and ultimate decay of the GYGS involved complex interactions between several coalescent ice masses flowing from glacial source areas adjoining and including the Yellowstone Plateau. Here, we present an updated review of the history and dynamics of the GYGS during the penultimate (Bull Lake) and last (Pinedale) glaciations, drawing upon an integration of glacialgeologic mapping with >130 cosmogenic 10Be and 3He exposure ages.\nBull Lake glacial deposits in greater Yellowstone are dated to ca. 150e140 ka and correlate with marine isotope stage 6. The Bull Lake glaciation extended well beyond the Pinedale along the southern and western GYGS margins, but Pinedale glaciers overrode Bull Lake ice limits on the north and east sides. The northeastward shift of the center of ice mass from Bull Lake to Pinedale time may be explained by uplift on the leading edge of the Yellowstone hotspot and subsidence on the trailing margin.\nIn early Pinedale time (~22e18 ka), ice buildup culminated in the high terrain of the Beartooth Uplift and High Absaroka Range. Glaciers from these source regions flowed onto the northeastern margin of the Yellowstone Plateau and advanced to terminal moraines beyond Clarks Fork Canyon and in Jackson Hole. By middle Pinedale time (~18e16 ka), the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap surface had risen above the equilibrium-line altitude, stimulating orographic glacial buildup nourished by storms funneled eastward through the Snake River Plain. The plateau ice cap eventually thickened to >1000m and joined glaciers from the Beartooth Uplift and Gallatin Range to form the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier. Terrain east and downwind of the ice cap crest was placed in a precipitation shadow, resulting in glacial recession in these regions. During the late Pinedale (~16e13 ka), the plateau ice cap prograded southwestward toward the direction of moisture supply, leading to advances along the southern and western margins of the GYGS. Northern sectors of the plateau ice cap were nearly stagnant at this time. The Yellowstone region experienced widespread deglaciation ca. 15e14 ka in response to warming climate. Unloading of the ~1 km-thick plateau ice cap and consequent release of pressure on the magmatic system beneath Yellowstone was not accompanied by volcanism, indicating that the magma chamber was not primed to erupt via decompression during the last deglaciation.\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

    "heading": "1.1. Overview of the Greater Yellowstone Glacial System",
    "text": "The Greater Yellowstone Glacial System (GYGS) covered about 20,000 km2 during the late Pleistocene and comprised the largest\nLicciardi), kpierce@usgs.gov\nglaciated area in the Rocky Mountains south of the Laurentide ice sheet (Fig. 1). The glacial source areas for the GYGS consisted of mountain ranges within and adjacent to Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and at times included the Yellowstone Plateau. Themountain source areas are (clockwise): (1) the Beartooth Uplift, encompassing the continuous structural block of high mountains to the north and northeast of YNP (Pierce, 1979); (2) the moderately high portion of the Absaroka Range located along the east side of YNP; (3) the high southern sector of the Absaroka Range (referred to throughout this report as the High Absaroka Range) that includes\nand extends beyond southeastern YNP; (4) the high but narrow Teton Range; and (5) the moderately high and narrow Gallatin Range in the northwest part of YNP. These mountains form a crude horseshoe that is open to the southwest and encloses the Yellowstone Plateau (Fig. 2). The intent of this report is to review available knowledge of the complex history and dynamics of the GYGS during the last two glaciations, drawing upon an integration of previous glacial-geologic mapping investigations and dating efforts in the region as well as new chronological data presented here that further document the timing of glacial events. We describe the penultimate (Bull Lake; marine isotope stage (MIS) 6) glaciation first, and then review the last (Pinedale; MIS 2) glaciation in greater detail as much more is known about the Pinedale changes through time.\nBecause the GYGS initiated in Pinedale time and presumably in Bull Lake time with ice buildup in the high mountains adjacent to YNP and only later expanded to encompass a substantial ice cap on the Yellowstone Plateau, the dynamics of this system changed dramatically through time. In the early stages of the Pinedale\nglaciation, ice from the surrounding mountains flowed onto the northern and eastern margins of the Yellowstone Plateau until the distal portions of these glaciers thickened enough to rise above the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) on the plateau. This glacial buildup above the ELA induced the plateau ice cap to become a major selfamplifying glacial source area by middle Pinedale time. As the surface of the plateau ice cap gained altitude, mountain source areas in the lee of the emergent ice mass were placed in a precipitation shadow, causing glaciers in these regions to recede. Later in the Pinedale, the center of mass of the GYGSmigrated progressively to the southwest as the plateau ice cap built strongly toward its primary source of atmospheric moisture. This southwestward shift in the center of mass caused a growing expanse of the plateau ice cap to fall within a precipitation shadow on its downwind lee side. The greatly reduced snowfall and a near-zero to negative mass balance in these sectors of the GYGS diminished their ice contributions to the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier, which receded to and stabilized at the Deckard Flats readjustment position upon being fed primarily by glaciers from the Beartooth Uplift and\ne development of the GYGS. The North American Plate is moving southwest above an ith the hotspot track. The Yellowstone hotspot track of the eastern Snake River Plain is t.

Warmer colors indicate higher altitudes and cooler colors indicate lower\nGallatin Range. Consequently, the evolution of the GYGS differed dramatically from that observed for typical mountain-valley glaciers which simply flow downvalley from cirque headlands to end moraines in the terminal region. In building toward its primary source of moisture, the GYGS behaved similarly to continental ice sheets (Sanberg and Oerlemans, 1983; Roe and Lindzen, 2001). To our knowledge, however, this study represents the first extensive integration of detailed age control and glacial-geologic field evidence that documents the key role of orographic precipitation feedback mechanisms in the development and decay of a large Pleistocene mountain glacier complex."

    "heading": "1.2. Climatic and topographic features important to glaciation",
    "text": "The high topography, snowy character, and consequent glaciation of the greater Yellowstone region can largely be explained by the ongoing geodynamic effects of the Yellowstone hotspot (e.g., Anders et al., 1989; Smith and Braile, 1994; Pierce and Morgan, 1992, 2009). The hotspot and its inferred mantle plume are ultimately responsible for producing twomajor physiographic features that were critical to promoting the extensive glaciation of the GYGS (Fig. 2). The first of these is the Yellowstone Crescent of High Terrain (YCHT), which flares outward from the leading margin of the Yellowstone hotspot as it migrates northeastward at a rate of ~2.5 cm/ yr while the North American plate moves in the opposite direction above a relatively stationary thermal-mantle plume (Pierce and Morgan, 1992, 2009; Nelson and Grand, 2018). The YCHT is manifested as a series of high mountain chains and uplands that served as glacial source regions for the GYGS. The second major physiographic element is the hotspot track of the eastern Snake River Plain, which forms a lowland that acts as a conduit for storms carrying prodigious orographic snowfall to the greater Yellowstone area (Fig. 2).\nThe pronounced influence of surface orography on regional precipitation patterns in the greater Yellowstone area is critical to understanding the large dynamical changes of the GYGS through time. As moist air is forced to ascend on the windward side of a topographic upland, atmospheric pressure decreases, and the air undergoes adiabatic cooling, which in turn decreases the capacity to hold water vapor and leads to condensation and extraction of orographic precipitation. In contrast, descending air on the leeward side of a topographic barrier experiences increased atmospheric pressure and warming, thus increasing the moisture-holding capacity and suppressing precipitation (Roe, 2005). At present, moisture-laden storm systems from the Pacific Ocean traverse the eastern Snake River Plain (Fig. 2) and then rise up over the Yellowstone Plateau and the YCHT, resulting in deep orographic snowfall in the greater Yellowstone region (Fig. 3; Farnes, 1997; Farnes et al., 1999). This storm trajectory corresponds in part with the “Columbia-Snake-Wyoming” route described by Bryson and Hare (1974; their Figs. 2 and 3) and identified as an important low-level path for the westerly Pacific airstream across the western Cordillera. The ~1000m (3300 ft) orographic rise from the Snake River Plain onto the southwestern Yellowstone Plateau presently results in a deep May snowpack with as much as 1.8m waterequivalent depth (Figs. 3 and 4) (Farnes, 1997; Farnes et al., 1999; Marcus et al., 2012). Eastward across the Yellowstone Plateau, the mean altitude decreases by about 150m (500 ft) and the precipitation diminishes to 0.8e1.0m (Figs. 3 and 4). Further to the east, precipitation increases to 1.3e1.5m as the air rises over the Beartooth Uplift northeast of YNP, the moderately high Absaroka Range along the eastern YNP boundary, and the High Absaroka Range southwest of YNP. This easterly air flow then descends and becomes drier, creating a pronounced precipitation shadow toward the\nBighorn Basin and other lowlands (Figs. 3 and 4). In addition to precipitation (mostly snow) derived from zonal flow following the above trajectory, moist air arriving from other directions may also contribute to precipitation in the YCHT.\nThe orographic precipitation patterns controlled by present-day topography are clearly observed from modern meteorological data (Fig. 3), and it is reasonable to assume these modern patterns are also broadly representative of past regional conditions during Pleistocene glacial episodes for the GYGS (e.g., Zielinski and McCoy, 1987). However, as detailed later in this report, the development of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap dramatically altered the regional topography, which would have consequently modified orographic precipitation patterns during glacial periods. Moreover, the GYGS ice mass interacted dynamically with these orographic influences in complex ways as ice centers in the different glacial source areas for the system waxed and waned over time and space.\nThe glaciation of Yellowstone is relevant to both the activity on the Teton fault and volcanism associated with the Yellowstone hotspot. Themass of the GYGS would have depressed the landscape and caused downward flexure of the lithosphere along the margins of the ice complex (Hampel et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2014). This downward flexure diminished the gradients of the Yellowstone River north of YNP and the Snake River south of YNP, and led to deposition of thick outwash gravel during glaciation (Pierce et al., 2018). Deglacial unloading may have induced an increase in differential stress in the crust that accelerated slip rates on the Teton fault (Hampel et al., 2007). However, removal of the ice load and attendant lowering of lithostatic confining pressure did not stimulate volcanic eruptions during the last deglaciation."

    "heading": "1.3. Age control for glacial features and events in greater Yellowstone",
    "text": "A wide range of Quaternary dating methods have been employed to provide age control for glacial features and events in the greater Yellowstone region, including combined KeAr and obsidian-hydration dating of moraines and outwash (Pierce et al., 1976), weathering rind measurements (Colman and Pierce, 1981), KeAr dating of interglacial volcanic units (Obradovich, 1992; Christiansen, 2001), radiocarbon dating of basal lake sediments (e.g., Whitlock, 1993), and U-series dating of travertine (Sturchio et al., 1994). These earlier efforts established a foundational chronology for the glacial history of the GYGS. Our more recent investigations have involved surface exposure dating of boulders on terminal and recessional moraines using cosmogenic 10Be, and to a lesser extent cosmogenic 3He (Licciardi et al., 2001; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008; this report). The glacial history of the GYGS reviewed here integrates all available age data, but the chronological framework we propose is largely based on surface exposure ages because these methods have enabled the direct dating of moraine sequences. No dating method is without disadvantages, however, and in the case of exposure dating, the largest source of uncertainty is generally linked to knowledge of isotopic production rates and how they vary in space and time. Although the 10Be and 3He production rates and scaling factors applied here may be refined in the future, we note that the exposure age differences important to our major interpretations in this report will not change significantly.\nThe sampling and field protocols, laboratory methods, and isotopic measurement techniques we follow for cosmogenic 10Be and 3He dating are summarized in Licciardi and Pierce (2008). Photographs of several of the dated moraine boulders are shown in Licciardi and Pierce (2008) and Pierce et al. (2018). Here, we compile these previously acquired 10Be and 3He data from the Yellowstone region, and also report a new set of 10Be exposure ages\nfrom the southern margin of the GYGS that provide additional age constraints on the Pinedale glacial history (Table 1). All new and previously reported cosmogenic 10Be exposure ages are calculated using a recently developed calibration of regional in situ 10Be production rates based on measurements at Promontory Point, Utah (Lifton et al., 2015), which are lower than the globally averaged production rate (Balco et al., 2008) used in our prior work (Licciardi et al., 2001; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008). The Promontory Point measurements currently constitute the most extensive 10Be production rate calibration data set developed in the western U.S. and come from sites relatively close in proximity and elevation to exposure-dated features in the greater Yellowstone region, thus minimizing uncertainties associated with scaling. A nuclide- and time-dependent scaling model formulated by Lifton et al. (2014) and designated as “LSDn” is implemented in the age calculations. The recalculated 10Be exposure ages are 2.6e4.3 kyr older for the Bull Lake and 0e1.1 kyr older for the Pinedale relative to those reported in earlier papers. Previously reported 3He exposure ages (Licciardi et al., 2001) are also recalculated using recently developed isotope production rates (Goehring et al., 2010) and the LSDn scaling. All exposure ages were derived from the CRONUS-Earth calculator version 3 (Balco et al., 2008). The exposure ages are summarized in Fig. 5, which shows probability density function plots for the distribution of boulder ages on dated moraines of the GYGS.\nAlthough glacier configurations in the GYGS were continuously evolving, we use the informal terms early Pinedale (~22e18 ka), middle Pinedale (~18e16 ka), and late Pinedale (~16e13 ka) to provide a temporal framework for the major changes that occurred in different sectors of the GYGS through the last glaciation. These informal subdivisions of Pinedale time are defined on the basis of geologic sequence relationships and available moraine\nchronologies, which enable the reconstruction of overall trends in glacial patterns."

    "text": "The penultimate Pleistocene glaciation is regionally known in the Rocky Mountains as the Bull Lake glaciation after the type terminal moraines and outwash terrace on the east side of the Wind River Range (Blackwelder, 1915; Richmond, 1965). Older glacial events that clearly pre-date the Pinedale in the Jackson Hole area were originally designated the Munger glaciation for deposits defining a high-altitude ice limit on Munger Mountain (Pierce and Good, 1992). Elsewhere in the greater Yellowstone region, deposits originally interpreted to be pre-Pinedale were mapped as either Bull Lake or Sacagawea Ridge (e.g., Richmond, 1964, 1973b; Pierce, 1979). The Bull Lake glaciation exceeded the limits of the Pinedale glaciation by 48 km to the south in Jackson Hole, by 23 km to the southwest near Ashton, Idaho, and by 22 km to thewest in theWest Yellowstone area (Fig. 1). In contrast, Bull Lake glacier extents were similar to or less than Pinedale maxima along the northern and eastern periphery of the GYGS. Relative to the Pinedale, far fewer details are known about the Bull Lake history because many glacial features from this period were obliterated by overriding Pinedale ice advances of the GYGS. Moreover, the surviving evidence for Bull Lake glacial activity is generally more degraded by surface processes and not as well-preserved as the comparatively much fresher Pinedale features which are an order of magnitude younger.\nPrior to the advent of numerical dating, the ages of the Munger and Bull Lake deposits were inferred primarily from stratigraphic relationships and relative weathering criteria, which led to\nTable 1 (continued )\nSample ID Lat ( N) Lon ( W) Alta (m. asl) Thickb (cm) Shieldc factor [TCN]d (104 at g 1 ± 1s) AMSe standard Pub agef (ka ± 1s) Recalc ageg (ka ± 1s)\nOJEN-7 43.76503 110.7103 2099 2.00 1.0000 38.01± 0.89 KNSTD 15.1± 0.4 15.8± 0.4 OJEN-7D 43.76503 110.7103 2099 2.00 1.0000 39.13± 1.07 KNSTD 15.6± 0.4 16.2± 0.5 OJEN-8 43.76462 110.7105 2095 1.50 1.0000 36.42± 0.92 KNSTD 14.5± 0.4 15.1± 0.4 OJEN-9 43.76462 110.7105 2095 2.00 1.0000 38.28± 0.89 KNSTD 15.3± 0.4 15.9± 0.4 OJEN-10 43.78308 110.7303 2115 2.00 0.9919 33.98± 0.78 KNSTD 13.5± 0.3 14.1± 0.3 OJEN-11 43.78398 110.7289 2100 2.00 0.9919 37.50± 1.41 KNSTD 15.0± 0.6 15.7± 0.6\n14.6± 0.7 15.2± 0.7 Inner Jenny Lake moraine IJEN-1 43.78068 110.7256 2113 1.75 1.0000 33.68± 0.77 KNSTD 13.2± 0.3 13.9± 0.3 IJEN-2 43.78041 110.7248 2097 1.75 1.0000 31.88± 0.86 KNSTD 12.7± 0.4 13.3± 0.4 IJEN-3 43.77991 110.7231 2108 2.00 1.0000 35.50± 0.81 KNSTD 14.0± 0.3 14.7± 0.3 IJEN-4 43.77863 110.7221 2105 2.00 1.0000 43.82± 1.27 KNSTD 17.4 ± 0.5 18.0± 0.5 IJEN-5 43.77791 110.7219 2110 2.00 1.0000 29.62± 0.68 KNSTD 11.7± 0.3 12.0± 0.3 IJEN-6 43.77506 110.7186 2103 1.75 1.0000 35.92± 0.85 KNSTD 14.2± 0.3 14.9± 0.4 IJEN-7 43.76685 110.7140 2093 2.00 1.0000 32.44± 0.77 KNSTD 12.9± 0.3 13.6± 0.3 IJEN-11 43.75806 110.7158 2084 2.00 1.0000 37.37± 0.87 KNSTD 15.0± 0.4 15.7± 0.4 IJEN-12 43.75740 110.7163 2085 1.50 1.0000 44.92± 0.75 KNSTD 18.0 ± 0.3 18.6± 0.3 IJEN-13 43.75769 110.7165 2090 1.50 1.0000 35.56± 0.83 KNSTD 14.2± 0.3 14.9± 0.4\n(Pub age ¼ 2 outliers; Recalc age ¼ 3 outliers) 13.5± 1.1 14.4± 0.8\nCascade Canyon scoured bedrock BED-1 43.78500 110.8303 2618 1.00 0.9550 47.30± 1.08 KNSTD 13.8± 0.3 14.2± 0.3 BED-2 43.76696 110.7491 2214 2.50 0.9726 34.28± 0.57 07KNSTD 14.8± 0.2 15.0± 0.3\nLake Solitude cirque lip boulders LS-1 43.79210 110.8414 2767 1.00 0.9829 48.30± 0.91 KNSTD 12.5± 0.2 12.6± 0.2 LS-6 43.79309 110.8411 2774 1.50 0.9800 40.02± 0.95 KNSTD 10.4 ± 0.2 10.2± 0.2 LS-7 43.79107 110.8418 2787 1.50 0.9817 52.81± 1.62 KNSTD 13.5± 0.4 13.7± 0.4 LS-8 43.79140 110.8416 2764 2.25 0.9823 42.63± 1.00 07KNSTD 12.3± 0.3 12.4± 0.3\n12.8± 0.6 12.9± 0.7\na Age calculations are performed with an atmosphere approximation derived from altitude using the standard atmosphere equation with geographically variable surface pressure and 1000mbar temperature, as implemented on the CRONUS-Earth calculator version 3 (Balco et al., 2008).\nb Sample thickness corrections use a rock density of 2.7 g cm 3 for granitic rocks and 3.1 g cm 3 for basalt. c Topographic shielding corrections were derived from field measurements using the CRONUS-Earth geometric shielding calculator (http://hess.ess.washington.edu/math/ general/skyline_input.php). d All10Be samples were spiked with 9Be carrier prepared from either SPEX (commercial), BeSO4 (LDEO), or shielded beryl (LDEO); at least one blank was processed in parallel with each chemistry batch.

Subsequent studies in the region (e.g., Gosse and Phillips, 2001; Sharp et al., 2003; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008; Pierce et al., 2011) have upheld and bolstered the interpretation that the Bull Lake glaciation occurred during MIS 6."

    "heading": "2.2. Jackson Hole",
    "text": "Jackson Hole was almost entirely filled with ice that extended south from Yellowstone during the Bull Lake glaciation (Fig. 6) (Pierce and Good, 1992; Pierce et al., 2018). The southern end of Jackson Hole contains erratics and till deposits with recognizable moraine morphology that define the former footprint and height of the Bull Lake glacier. Some of the Bull Lake erratics are very large (Fig. 7) and all show effects of weathering. Based on the erratic\ndistributions and moraine positions, contours on the reconstructed surface of the Bull Lake glacier can be drawn from an altitude of 2135m (7000 ft) just above the southern terminus up to an altitude of 2745m (9000 ft). The surface of the Bull Lake glacier must have continued to rise northward toward its source area, but supporting evidence such as erratics and scour features was likely obliterated by the overriding younger Pinedale glaciation.\nBoulders near the Bull Lake ice limit in southern Jackson Hole were sampled for 10Be exposure dating in our previous work and yield a mean age of 133± 13 ka (Table 1; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008). The two oldest boulder ages in the distribution agree within 2s uncertainty and yield an average of 150± 4 ka. Recognizing that boulders on old moraines are prone to geologic factors such as erosion, exhumation, and past cover that may lead to anomalously young exposure ages, we interpret the two oldest ages as the most representative age for the Bull Lake deposits (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008; Pierce et al., 2018). These 10Be data place the Bull Lake moraines in MIS 6.\nIn southern Jackson Hole, a Bull Lake outwash terrace ~120m (400 ft) above the modern Snake River is locally capped by 8.5m of loess with eight buried soils. An age-depth model for the loess sequencewas developed from thermoluminescence (TL) ages in the\nupper 7m of loess combined with the meteoric 10Be content of the three buried soils in the lowest 1.5m of loess (Pierce et al., 2011). The projected age of the outwash gravel at the base of the section is ca. 152 ka, as suggested by the meteoric 10Be inventory in the loess. This result provides an independent minimum age limit for the Bull Lake outwash gravel that agrees within uncertainty with the cosmogenic 10Be exposure ages of nearby Bull Lake erratics (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008), and supports the correlation of the Bull Lake glaciation with MIS 6."

    "heading": "2.3. Fall River lobe near Ashton, Idaho",
    "text": "In the area near Ashton, Idaho on the southwest margin of the GYGS, Bull Lake moraines of the Fall River glacial lobe extend 23 km beyond Pinedale moraines (Fig. 8). About 15 km northeast of Ashton, mapped glacial deposits indicate that the Bull Lake advanced across the Henrys Fork near Warm River and formed an ice dam at an altitude of about 1830m (6000 ft). This ice dam would have impounded a glacial lake in the southernmost Island Park area. Age estimates for the glacial deposits associated with the Fall River lobe are based on weathering rind measurements on basalt clasts reported in Colman and Pierce (1981) (Table 2) and on previously unpublished obsidian hydrationmeasurements on abraded pebbles in till (Table 3). Our correlations differ from those of Richmond (1973a, 1973b) but are consistent with the mapping designations of Scott (1982).\nWeathering rind thicknesses in basalt clasts within glacial deposits of the Fall River lobe form two distinct groupings (Table 2).\nOne set of study sites yields rind thicknesses between 0.24 and 0.34mm, which is similar to basalt weathering rinds measuring 0.40± 0.22mm (n¼ 80) in Pinedale deposits of the West Yellowstone area (Colman and Pierce, 1981). On this basis, deposits at these sites near Ashton are assigned to the Pinedale glaciation (Fig. 8). Thesemeasurements do not support correlations to the Bull Lake for some of these sites as mapped by Richmond (1973a, 1973b). The other grouping of rind thicknesses falls between 0.76 and 1.04mm, in line with weathering rind thicknesses of 0.78± 0.19mm (n¼ 162) in Bull Lake deposits at West Yellowstone (Colman and Pierce, 1981); hence these latter deposits are assigned to the Bull Lake (Fig. 8) rather than the Sacagawea Ridge (pre-Bull Lake) glaciation as mapped by Richmond (1973a, 1973b).\nSimilarly, obsidian hydration measurements obtained from glacial deposits of the Fall River lobe correlate with measurements from Bull Lake and Pinedale deposits of theWest Yellowstone area (Table 3). The thicknesses of hydration rims on abraded obsidian pebbles collected by K.L. Pierce in 1973 from two road cuts into till southeast of Ashton (localities P-2037, P-2039; Fig. 8) bracket the value measured in Bull Lake deposits near West Yellowstone (Pierce et al., 1976). The West Yellowstone measurements were restricted to hydration on abrasion pressure cracks, whereas the measurements east of Ashton include measurements on outer surfaces of pebbles. Also, the obsidian samples near Ashton were from shallow road cuts and may not have been deep enough below the natural surface where summer temperatures are warmer and thus result in thicker hydration. Nevertheless, the hydration thicknesses at the Ashton sites clearly support\ncorrelation with the Bull Lake of West Yellowstone as well as correlation with MIS 6, and not with the Sacagawea Ridge as mapped by Richmond (1973a, 1973b).\nObsidian hydration measurements from two localities at the edge of Big Grassy flats (Fig. 8) also support the correlations in this report. Measurements of obsidian hydration rims from localities on the north (P-2029) and south (P-2030) sides of Big Grassy (Fig. 8, Table 3) are similar to those in Pinedale and Bull Lake deposits, respectively, in the West Yellowstone area (Pierce et al., 1976)."

However, several lines of evidence indicate that the Henrys Lake Flat area was occupied by a glacial lobe during Bull Lake time (Fig. 1). The lobe is bounded by a thin sliver of Bull Lake ice-contact deposits on the north side of Henrys Lake Flat, and the Stamp Meadows ice-marginal channel on the southwest side of the flats (Witkind, 1972). At this time, ice would have been fed by the large Bull Lake glacier from the West Yellowstone Basin which spilled westward over Reas Pass into Henrys Lake Flat. Bull Lake till and rubble veneer in the Reas Pass area are mapped at altitudes as high as 2380m (7800 ft) (Waldrop, 1975; Scott, 1982). The Bull Lake glacial lobe over the eastern part of Henrys Lake Flat (altitude 1950m; 6400 ft) would have therefore been more than 400m thick. The margin of the Bull Lake glacier between the Reas Pass area and the Big Grassy area to the south has not yet been resolved."

Eastward and up-ice from the Bull Lake moraines, glacial scour features trend west across the 160 ± 2 ka Nez Perce flow but are buried by the 110 ± 1 ka West Yellowstone flow (KeAr ages from Obradovich, 1992; as compiled by Christiansen, 2001). These relationships show that the Bull Lake scour features and associated deposits are bracketed by the Nez Perce and West Yellowstone flow ages. Glacial abrasion cracks on obsidian clasts from the Bull Lake moraines have hydration thicknesses of 14.7 ± 0.6 mm (Table 3), and these measurements are calibrated by KeAr ages of cooling cracks on dated rhyolite flows to indicate an age of about 140 ka for the Bull Lake moraines (Pierce et al., 1976). These data place the age of Bull Lake glacial deposits near West Yellowstone within MIS 6.\nAdditional age constraints on Bull Lake deposits near West Yellowstone come from volcanic ash exposed in “The Narrows” of Hebgen Lake. At this site, wave erosion exposes tephra that was thrust up into the Bull Lake moraines and most likely erupted just prior to moraine deposition. The relative coarseness and thickness of this tephra layer and its location just upwind from Yellowstone suggests a large explosive eruption from a nearby Yellowstone source vent. Based on its location and explosive nature, we suspect the tephra at The Narrows correlates with the tuff of Bluff Point, which dates to 162 ± 2 ka and was probably erupted from the West Thumb caldera (Obradovich, 1992; Christiansen, 2001)."

On the basis of weathering criteria, Ballard (1976) found no discernible age differences between moraine complexes in this area and concluded they were all from the same glaciation. Hilmoe (1980) also did not find significant relative-age differences among glacial deposits at themouth of the canyon, but nonetheless assumed the presence of both Bull Lake and Pinedale moraines. However, as we describe later (section 3.2.2), terminal moraines in this area that were previously mapped as Bull Lake (Hilmoe, 1980) have been exposure-dated with 10Be and shown to be Pinedale in age. We conclude that Bull Lake moraines in this area were probably overrun and obliterated during the more extensive Pinedale glaciation. On the other hand, field evidence described by Ballard (1976) suggests the preservation of older outwash terrace remnants with highly weathered boulders that mantle knolls standing above the level of Pinedale outwash; these older terrace remnants may be Bull Lake in age.\nThe widespread deposits of the Pinedale glacier that advanced up Sunlight Creek (section 3.2.2), a tributary of the Clarks Fork, may overlie some remnants of Bull Lake sediments. In a now-reclaimed\nroad cut exposure just south of Sunlight Creek, thick glacial backfill is underlain by a tephra layer grading downward from coarse to fine which, in turn, rests on bedrock (Cheryl Jaworowski and Henry Heasler, written commun., 1985; USGS Denver Tephrochronology Laboratory sample numbers 85G36 for finer ash and 85G37 for coarser ash). The coarseness and thickness of the tephra probably requires a proximal source vent in Yellowstone, and we speculate that this tephra correlates with the 162 ± 2 ka tuff of Bluff Point (Obradovich, 1992; Christiansen, 2001), as this represents the most recent large tephra-bearing eruption in Yellowstone."

    "text": "The most recent Pleistocene glaciation, corresponding to MIS 2, is regionally known in the Rocky Mountains as the Pinedale glaciation after the terminal moraines near the town of Pinedale, Wyoming, on the west side of the Wind River Range (Blackwelder, 1915; Richmond, 1965). Cosmogenic 10Be exposure dating of Pinedale terminal moraines around the periphery of the GYGS reveals significant differences in age that document the changing dynamics of various ice source regions throughout the Pinedale glaciation (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008) (Figs. 1 and 5). Terminal moraine ages of the GYGS are oldest in the east (19.8 ± 0.9 ka), intermediate-aged in the north (17.9 ± 1.2 ka), and youngest in the south (15.5 ± 0.5 ka), representing a progression of glacial culminations that span 4e5 thousand years. Complex dynamics are further illuminated by glacial-geologic mapping and stratigraphic relationships that document a sequence of glacial episodes involving dramatic shifts in ice flow direction during the Pinedale. These changes in flow direction and relative glacial extents resulted from time-transgressive culminations in different glacial source areas involving early ice buildup in the mountains northwest and southeast of the Yellowstone Plateau, followed by ice buildup on the plateau itself, and later progressive migration of the plateau ice cap to the southwest toward the primary source of moisture.\nOur reconstructions of the GYGS as the ice complex evolved throughout the Pinedale glaciation represent best-fit configurations based on a merging of available age control with mapped ice flow indicators, glacial landforms and deposits, and stratigraphic relationships. Estimated ice thicknesses and surface geometry in various sectors of the GYGS are also informed by basal shear stress and mass balance calculations suggesting the ice configurations drawn from field evidence and age determinations are glaciologically reasonable (Pierce, 1979). However, as acknowledged in the discussions that follow, various details of our proposed Pinedale reconstructions remain incomplete or uncertain and await refinement by future studies.\n3.2.

    "text": "During early Pinedale buildup, glaciers from the high-altitude Beartooth Uplift and the High Absaroka Range advanced to terminal moraines on the northeast, east, and southeast sides of the GYGS (Fig. 9). Around the same time, a glacial lobe from the High Absaroka Range flowed west into Jackson Hole. In contrast, the altitude of the Yellowstone Plateau (generally 2450e2600m; 8000e8500 ft) was probably 150e300m (500e1000 ft) below the regional ELA and therefore not quite high enough to initially act as a glacial accumulation area on its own (Pierce, 1979, p. F74F76). Glaciers heading in the Beartooth Uplift also advanced onto the northeastern portion of the Yellowstone Plateau, while\nglaciers from the High Absaroka Range invaded the eastern part of the plateau. The distal sectors of these glaciers eventually became thick enough for the ice surface to rise above the ELA in these parts of the plateau by middle Pinedale time. The culmination of the early Pinedale phase probably occurred ~22e20 ka based on the ages of terminal moraines of the Clarks Fork glacier from the Beartooth Uplift (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008) as well as mountain-valley glaciers in both the Wind River Range (Gosse et al., 1995; Dahms et al., 2018) and Teton Range (Licciardi et al., 2015; Pierce et al., 2018)."

    "text": "The oldest dated terminal moraines of the Pinedale GYGS (19.8± 0.9 ka) occur just beyond the mouth of the Clarks Fork Canyon on the western margin of the Bighorn Basin (Fig. 9). Glacial flow to these moraines was from the Clarks Fork drainage of the Beartooth Uplift, which heads in high terrain that includes Granite Peak, the highest peak in Montana at 3904m (12,807 feet). As noted previously (section 2.7), the Clarks Fork terminal moraine we dated with cosmogenic 10Be (Table 1) was originally mapped as Bull Lake by Hilmoe (1980) but is clearly Pinedale in age. This age revision is akin to the situation at the terminus of the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier where Bull Lake moraines were previously assumed to be present (Horberg, 1940), but where subsequent studies (Pierce, 1979; p. F14-15) including our 10Be dating efforts (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008) now identify only Pinedale moraines.\nThe terminal moraines beyond the mouth of Clarks Fork Canyon are interspersed with extensive low terraces studded with flood boulders. These boulders were likely deposited by multiple glacial outburst floods emanating from a lake impounded in Sunlight Basin by a peripheral lobe of the Clarks Fork glacier that pushed up Sunlight Creek (Fig. 9) (Parsons, 1939; Erb, 1995). The flood waters apparently drained through the basal zone of the ice dam, for it is unlikely the discharge could have removed the damming glacier, which at this time extended 20 km downvalley from the lake impoundment site to the Clarks Fork terminal moraines and reached a thickness of 800m. Large granitic boulders sourced from the Beartooth Uplift are found up to an altitude of 2210m (7250 ft) on the slopes of Sunlight Basin, and these are interpreted to have been rafted by icebergs calved from the Clarks Fork glacier while it was damming the basin. The altitude of these boulders above the floor of Sunlight Basin indicates a former lake depth of 140m (Erb, 1995). Based on this lake level and the topography of the basin, the maximum volume of glacial Lake Sunlight and consequent release of flood waters is estimated to have been about 4 km3 (Nicholas Bader, written commun., 2015).\nAs revealed by Precambrian granitic erratics resting on Eocene volcanic bedrock, a minor strand of the western part of the Clarks Fork glacier flowed across the valley of Crandall Creek and then southward over Trail Creek Pass to deposit end moraines on the north side of Sunlight Basin (Fig. 9). At this time, any local glacier in the valley of Crandall Creek, which heads on the eastern boundary of YNP, either did not join the Clarks Fork glacier, or was crowded in a narrow strip along the west side of the Clarks Fork glacier as it flowed across Trail Creek Pass into Sunlight Basin.\n3.2.2.2. Beartooth Uplift advance to the southwest. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that glaciers heading in the Beartooth Uplift advanced to the southwest and onto the Yellowstone Plateau during the early Pinedale. Precambrian granitic erratics quarried from the high Beartooth Uplift are found in a thick but nearly formless till rich in fines in the Canyon Village area, demonstrating that Beartooth-sourced ice once flowed southwest up the Grand Canyon\nregion of the Yellowstone River. This glacial advance also dammed the Yellowstone River to form an ice-contact lake in Hayden Valley, which is presently occupied by grasslands underlain by Pleistocene lacustrine sediments of glacial Lake Hayden (Fig. 9). Observations presented by Pierce (1979; p. F27-30) andmore recent data indicate that the Hayden Valley lake sediments are of early Pinedale age rather than late Bull Lake as previously mapped and classified by Richmond and Waldrop (1975) and Richmond (1976, 1977). The lake sediments rest on and are therefore younger than both the 102 ± 4 ka Hayden Valley rhyolite flow and the 110± 3 ka Solfatara Plateau rhyolite flow (KeAr ages from Obradovich, 1992; Christiansen, 2001). These stratigraphic relationships are not consistent with a Bull Lake age for the lake sediments, given that a number of studies (e.g., Pierce et al., 1976; Sharp et al., 2003; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008) have established that the Bull Lake glaciation in this region correlates with MIS 6, which spans 190e130 ka (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). Granitic erratics from the Beartooth Uplift are also found within the Hayden Valley lake sediments. After emplacement in early Pinedale time, evidently by ice rafting, these erratics may have then been remobilized and carried farther to the west by middle Pinedale glacial flow.\nAdditional critical evidence for early Pinedale ice flow southwest from the Beartooth Uplift comes from striations on Observation Peak, a 2864m (9397 ft) summit located in the southwest part of the Washburn Range (Fig. 10). Two generations of cross-cutting striations on different-facing surfaces of basalt bedrock are equally fresh and consistent with a Pinedale age (Pierce, 1973a). However, the relative ages of the two striation sets clearly document earlier glacial flow to the southwest followed by later flow to the north (Fig. 10). This evidence indicates southwestward glacial advances from the Beartooth Uplift in the early stages of the Pinedale, followed by northward flow from the Yellowstone Plateau\nice cap in middle Pinedale time (Pierce, 1973a, 1979).\n3.2.2.3. Beartooth Uplift advance to the Gardiner area. About 3 km south of Gardiner, Montana (Fig. 9) is an 84-m thick section of Quaternary sediments that fill a paleo-valley beneath McMinn Bench (Fig. 11). Although Pierce (1973a) briefly described the section, we now have a more detailed history that provides a sensible context for the stratigraphic units. Our interpretation of the section places the early Pinedale extent of glaciers from the Beartooth Uplift about 60 km upvalley from the Eightmile terminal moraines of the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier.\nAlthough radiometric age control is lacking, this section is interpreted to be entirely Pinedale in age because no buried soils or evidence of weathering horizons are observed. The three tills in the upper part of the section are most readily distinguished by color changes observed from a distance, but upon closer inspection the units are seen to be in gradational contact. Based on lithologic observations and our current understanding of the Pinedale sequence, we interpret these three tills to correspond with early, middle, and late Pinedale glacial episodes.\nThe stratigraphic sequence (Fig. 11) is interpreted in detail as follows: (1) beds rich in subangular boulders of Absaroka volcanic rocks were emplaced, but are of uncertain origin; (2) beds containing abundant subrounded basalt boulders were deposited by multiple outburst floods from a glacial lake dammed in the lower Gallatin River valley by a glacier from the Beartooth Uplift; (3) lake sediments were then deposited at this locality as the glacial dam became more established; (4) pink till of early Pinedale age was emplaced as Beartooth Uplift ice with granitic erratics advanced further up the Gardner River valley; (5) tan till of middle Pinedale age was deposited as the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier advanced 60 km downvalley to the Eightmile terminal moraines (Pierce,1979); (6) gray till of late Pinedale agewas deposited during the Deckard Flats readjustment as the glacier from the Beartooth Uplift with granitic erratics again invaded the lower Gardner River valley; (7) sand and silt (loess) was deposited on McMinn Bench by winds blowing up steep poorly-vegetated slopes that developed along the Gardner River in post-glacial times. The bouldery gravel horizon in the lower 30e50m of this Quaternary section can be traced about 2.5 km southward where it acts as a base level for the post-glacial alluvial fans built below the steep slopes of Mount Everts (Pierce, 1973a).\n3.2.2.4. Other Beartooth Uplift glaciers. In addition to the Clarks Fork and Yellowstone River ice advances, glaciers from the Beartooth Uplift also flowed down major drainages to the northeast, north, and northwest and deposited terminal moraines at the mouths of these valleys (Figs. 1 and 9). Our only cosmogenic 10Be ages for these advances are on the northwest part of the GYGS, where boulders on Pine Creek terminal moraines date to 18.2± 1.3 ka. Because the Clarks Fork glacier culminated early (19.8± 0.9 ka), it is likely that terminal moraines from glacial advances in other drainages heading in the Beartooth Uplift also culminated in early Pinedale time. This prediction awaits testing by further age determinations in additional glacier terminus areas."

Ice from the High Absaroka Range also fed valley glaciers in\ndrainages radiating toward the south and east, but glacial deposits in these terminal regions await further mapping and age control studies, and are not discussed in this report.\n3.2.3.1. High Absaroka Range advance into Jackson Hole. In early Pinedale time, glaciers from the High Absaroka Range advanced westward down the Buffalo Fork and Pacific Creek drainages into Jackson Hole (Fig. 9). This oldest stage of the Pinedale glaciation in Jackson Hole was formerly designated the Burned Ridge phase (Love et al., 1992; Pierce and Good, 1992) and is now termed the Jackson Hole Pinedale-1 advance (JH Pd-1) (Pierce et al., 2018). The former extent of the Buffalo Fork lobe is best defined along its southern margin, as this ice mass was conjoined with the Pacific Creek lobe on its north side (Pierce et al., 2018). A large 180-m deep scour basin beneath the Jackson Lake Dam was excavated by the JH Pd-1 advance of the combined Buffalo Fork and Pacific Creek lobes, but erosion of the outlet and a thick sediment fill has obscured this glacial basin. Lack of suitable boulders prevents reliable 10Be dating of Pinedale-1 moraines (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008), but we hypothesize that the JH Pd-1 advance probably correlates with terminal moraines of the Wind River Range that date >20 ka (Gosse et al., 1995; Dahms et al., 2018). Stratigraphic relationships suggest that the JH Pd-1 advance is considerably older than the subsequent stage of the Pinedale glaciation in Jackson Hole (Pinedale-2) (Pierce et al., 2018), which is linked to advances from the ice cap on the Yellowstone Plateau (see section 3.4.2).\n3.2.3.2. High Absaroka Range advance north down the upper Yellowstone River valley. The High Absaroka Range, which hosts the headwaters of the upper Yellowstone River, was the source of an early Pinedale glacial advance northwestward down the upper Yellowstone River valley that continued northward along the eastern side of present-day Yellowstone Lake (Fig. 9). This ice advance dammed ancestral drainages on the plateau that flowed west toward the area now occupied by Yellowstone Lake, which resulted in deposition of proglacial lake silt that was subsequently overridden and compacted by Pinedale ice and blanketed with glacial till (Richmond and Pierce, 1972; their stratigraphic sections 2, 5, 9, 21). The till contains erratics of light-gray dacite porphyry most likely carried northward from the upper Yellowstone River headwaters (Richmond and Pierce, 1972). This glacier flowed north through the Southeast Arm of Yellowstone Lake which is 75m deep, and as imaged byMorgan et al. (2007) has the form of a fjordlike trough excavated by northward glacial flow. We infer that the hydrothermally cemented gravel and till exposed at the north end of Yellowstone Lake in the Steamboat Point area (Richmond, 1977; his stratigraphic sections 65, 66, 67) was deposited near the northern end of this glacial advance and then hydrothermally cemented by mineralized subglacial hydrothermal waters when an ice cap covered the Yellowstone Plateau. This northward glacial flow had to occur before the full-glacial ice-cap flow to the southwest into Jackson Hole, which is indicated by abundant glacial scour features on the Two Ocean Plateau just west of the upper Yellowstone River valley (Richmond and Pierce, 1971).\n3.3.

At its maximum, the summit of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap reached an altitude of over 3350m (11,000 ft) and stood 1830m (6000 ft) above the eastern Snake River Plain, thereby creating a major topographic\nobstacle for storms traversing east along these lowlands. Moist air masses that encountered this nascent glacial barrier were forced to ascend the southwestern flank of the ice cap, triggering enhanced orographic snowfall on the upwind side of the ice dome. Conversely, as air masses moved further east across the ice divide and descended the leeward slope of the plateau ice cap, they experienced warming and drying, placing glaciers here in a precipitation shadow. The burgeoning of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap in middle Pinedale time thus had a profound impact on changing orographic precipitation patterns and played a central role in the major glacial events and features that define this interval."

    "text": "The northern Yellowstone outlet glacier reached its maximum extent and deposited the Eightmile terminal moraines at 17.9± 1.2 ka (Licciardi et al., 2001) (Figs. 12 and 13). The surface of the large outwash plain downvalley of the Eightmile moraines displays wellpreserved braided-channel morphology and exhibits a large outwash channel that cuts through the terminal moraine complex (Pierce, 1979; Pierce et al., 2014). The wedge of outwash deposits beyond the terminal moraines is thick and heads about 45m (140 ft) above the present Yellowstone River, but the gradient of the outwash fan surface is steeper than that of the modern river and converges to within 3m (10 ft) of the modern floodplain 18 km further downvalley.\nThe northern Yellowstone outlet glacier was formed by the funneling of thick confluent glaciers from threemajor glacial source areas including (clockwise) the Beartooth Uplift, the Yellowstone Plateau, and the Gallatin Range (Fig.12). The high surface altitude of the glacial systems that converged on the Yellowstone (Paradise) valley at this time is evidenced by: (1) northwest-oriented striations across the highest parts of Specimen Ridge including the summit of Amethyst Mountain (altitude 2930m, 9614 ft), indicating the confluence of equally high glaciers from both the Beartooth Uplift and Yellowstone Plateau (Pierce, 1974a); (2) northoriented striations across the entire crest of the Washburn Range (Pierce, 1973a, 1974a), including the secondary peak of Mount Washburn (altitude 3106m, 10,190 ft; Fig. 14); (3) “rat tails” on glaciated Absaroka volcanic bedrock high on thewest side of Mount Washburn (Alden, 1928), which clearly indicate northward glacial flow from a thick ice cap on the Yellowstone Plateau; (4) confluence of ice from the Gallatin Range and Yellowstone Plateau to form the classic drumlinoid topography of Gardners Hole (Fig. 15), which likely developed under ~600m (2000 ft) of ice reminiscent of continental glaciation (Pierce, 1973b, 1979); and (5) striations on the north spur of Sepulcher Mountain at an altitude of 2620m (8600 ft) indicating ice thicker than 1040m above Gardiner, Montana.\nThe northwesterly ice flow across the top of Specimen Ridge at this time (noted above) requires that the glacial surface rose to even higher altitudes toward the southeast in the present-day headwaters of the Lamar River. The topographic divide between the Lamar River and Crandall Creekwatersheds traces the eastern boundary of YNP and displays glacial striations and scour features such as the rock basin that holds present-day Canoe Lake (Fig. 12). These scour features indicate that ice emanating from the upper Lamar River drainage overtopped and flowed eastward across the divide into the Crandall Creek drainage, where it contributed to an advance and eventual stabilization of the Crandall Creek glacier at 18.2± 0.8 ka (see section 3.3.4).\nFollowing deposition of the Eightmile terminal moraines, the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier receded 6 km and deposited the 17.1± 1.7 ka Chico moraines (Fig. 13). The recession from the Eightmile moraines to the Chico moraines may have resulted from\nthe combined effects of climatic change and the southwestward migration of the crest of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap, which placed a larger area on the lee side of the ice cap in the precipitation shadow and diminished ice contributions from glacial source areas in these regions.\nUpvalley from the Chico moraines, the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier excavated a deep scour basin now filled with finegrained sediment between Gardiner and Yankee Jim Canyon (Figs. 12 and 13). Along the Yellowstone River 8e9 km downstream from Gardiner, lake sediments are exposed from the river bed up to about 8m above the river (Pierce et al., 1991). These bank exposures reveal zones of contorted and swirled lake sediments overlain by ripple-bedded sand, which are interpreted to represent glacial outburst floods surging through a lake. A geothermal well log in the vicinity of the bank exposures shows that the lake sediments and interbedded sand layers extendmore than 100m below the present river level, thus indicating a minimum depth of the scour basin (Pierce et al., 1991)."

It is thus reasonable to deduce that the 17.9 ± 1.2 ka age of the Eightmile terminal moraines may correspond with the ages of Pinedale terminal moraines in the West Yellowstone area. Our dating efforts along this part of the GYGS margin yielded only one cosmogenic 10Be exposure age of 17.7 ± 0.4 ka from a boulder on terminal moraines in the Gallatin River valley (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008). These moraines were deposited by glacial ice sourced from the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap that flowed through Faun Pass in the Gallatin Range (Pierce, 1973b, 1979). Although only one age was obtained on the Gallatin River valley moraines, this age supports the predicted correlation between terminal moraine ages near West Yellowstone and in the Yellowstone River valley."

In this vicinity, a prominent end moraine dated to 18.2± 0.8 ka marks the stabilization of a glacier that flowed down Crandall Creek (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008). Two-sided kame gravels indicate the coeval existence of the 18.2± 0.8 ka Crandall Creek glacier terminus and the retracted Clarks Fork glacier (Fig. 16). The ca. 1.6-kyr difference in age between the Clarks Fork terminal moraines and the retracted position of the Clarks Fork glacier 45 km upvalley translates to an average recession rate of roughly 28m/yr. Glacial striations on scoured bedrock near the Clarks Fork e Crandall Creek confluence also indicate older flow to the southeast by the Clarks Fork glacier followed by younger flow to the east by the Crandall Creek glacier (McKenna, 1997; Carson, 2010). Mapping of ice flow indicators and erratics in the area west of this location suggests that the Crandall Creek glacial advance was augmented by ice originating in the Lamar River drainage in YNP that spilled over the topographic divide along the eastern park boundary (Pierce, 1974b). It thus appears that the 18.2± 0.8 ka Crandall Creek glacier existed at roughly the same time that the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier deposited the 17.9± 1.2 ka Eightmile terminal moraines (see section 3.3.2), while both systems were being fed by a shared glacial source.\n3.4.

    "text": "During the later stages of the Pinedale, the ice cap on the Yellowstone Plateau continued to build to the southwest toward its primary source of moisture (Fig. 17). The growth and migration of this orographic barrier led to an expansion of the precipitation shadow in the lee of the ice crest, where snowfall was reduced, the ELA became higher, and large sectors of the ice cap tended toward stagnation. As a consequence of virtually no input from ice on the Yellowstone Plateau, the remaining glaciers from the Beartooth\nUplift and Gallatin Range stabilized and deposited the moraines of the Deckard Flats readjustment during the late Pinedale (section 3.4.5). Cosmogenic 10Be dating allows us to determine the relative timing of glacial events in the northern and southern parts of the GYGS, and these ages suggest that regional stagnation in the northern sector of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap actually coincidedwith active flow and associated glacial culminations along the southern and southwestern margins of the GYGS. Late Pinedale time drew to a close at ~15e14 ka when mountain glaciers and ice caps across the GYGS experienced widespread regional deglaciation."

    "text": "In middle and late Pinedale time, glacial lobes sourced from the Yellowstone Plateau and High Absaroka Range flowed down the Snake River and Pacific Creek drainages into Jackson Hole (Figs. 17 and 18). A key instigator of these ice advances was the expansion of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap, which promoted southward flow of the Snake River lobe and also contributed to the adjoining Pacific Creek lobe (Pierce et al., 2018). The late Pinedale advance of the southward-flowing Snake River lobewas responsible for excavating a deep glacial scour basin nowoccupied by Jackson Lake (Pierce and Good, 1992). This intermediate stage of the Pinedale glaciation in Jackson Hole was first described as the Hedrick Pond phase (Pierce and Good,1992) but is now rechristened the Jackson Hole Pinedale2 advance (JH Pd-2) (Pierce et al., 2018).\nIn prior work (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008), we constrained the age of the JH Pd-2 ice margin indirectly through stratigraphic relationships with 10Be-dated moraines deposited by Teton Range valley glaciers. The outer Jenny Lake moraines at the mouth of Cascade Canyon yield a mean age of 15.2± 0.7 ka and are partly buried by outwash that heads at the nearby JH Pd-2 ice margin. This relationship indicates that the JH Pd-2 position must be younger than the age of the outer Jenny Lake moraines.\nHerewe report new 10Be measurements that allow direct dating of the JH Pd-2 ice margin in Jackson Hole (Table 1). Recent field investigations revealed large granitic boulders suitable for 10Be dating along the JH Pd-2 ice margin that had escaped notice in earlier work (Fig. 18). Samples were collected from six boulders resting on a partly-forested hummockymoraine ridge, located 4 km northeast of Jenny Lake and situated at the head of the Pinedale-2 outwash wedge that partly buries the outer Jenny Lake moraines. One 10Be exposure age is considered an old outlier (24.2± 0.3 ka), most likely due to isotope inheritance, whereas the remaining boulder ages range from ca. 16.4e15.1 ka and yield a mean of 15.5± 0.5 ka. These age determinations overlap within uncertainty with the 15.2± 0.7 ka mean age of the outer Jenny Lake moraines, and while stratigraphic relationships demonstrate that the Jenny Lake moraines must be older than the JH Pd-2 moraine, we conclude that these two Pinedale maxima are closely contemporaneous. These ice margin positions represent the youngest dated terminal moraines around the periphery of the GYGS.\nSouth of the Pinedale GYGS margin in Jackson Hole, the landscape is dominated by massive outwash fans and terraces. Many of these features owe their origin to the south-flowing Snake River lobe, which sculpted drumlinoid topography along the east side of Jackson Lake and excavated roughly 6 km3 of unconsolidated sediments from the Jackson Lake basin during the late Pinedale (Pierce et al., 2018). The Spalding Bay outwash fan was built southward from near the south end of Jackson Lake (Fig. 18). This large outwash deposit may be as thick as 100m near the fan head based on the depth of kettles that indent the outwash surface, and has an estimated volume of 3 km3 (Pierce et al., 2018). Isostatic depression due to the mass of the GYGS lying to the north would have diminished the surface slope of the outwash fan and promoted thick buildup of gravel near the fan head. Postglacial isostatic rebound has likely made the current slope of the fan steeper than the original depositional gradient."

This stable recessional position marks the youngest stage of the Pinedale glaciation in Jackson Hole, formerly known as the Jackson Lake\nphase (Love et al., 1992; Pierce and Good, 1992) and more recently designated the Pinedale-3 (JH Pd-3) (Pierce et al., 2018). The JH Pd3 recessional position of the GYGS is not directly dated, but its age is correlated based on outwash relationships with the 14.4± 0.8 ka inner Jenny Lake moraines (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008). These cosmogenic 10Be ages, which are interpreted as the timing of\nmoraine abandonment, are consistent with radiocarbon dating of sediments in Jenny Lake indicating that deglaciation of the lake basin began centuries before 13.8 cal ka BP (Larsen et al., 2016). About 12.5 km up Cascade Canyon from the inner Jenny Lake moraines, boulders perched on the lip of the Lake Solitude cirque yield a mean age of 12.9± 0.7 ka (Table 1; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008), demonstrating that Teton Range valley glaciers retreated to their cirques by this time."

These moraines were initially considered to be Bull Lake in age by Richmond (1964, 1973a, 1973b), but basalt weathering rind and obsidian hydration data from moraines of the Fall River lobe are in accord with their assignment to the Pinedale by Scott (1982). The absence of suitable large boulders prevented cosmogenic dating of these terminal moraines, but based on the southwesterly migration of the Yellowstone Plateau ice-cap source area we infer that the Pinedale terminal moraines of the Fall River lobe are similar in age to the 15.5± 0.5 ka JH Pd-2 terminal moraines in Jackson Hole. For the Fall River lobe, the late Pinedale is represented by more than four moraine subdivisions spread over a distance of 6 km."

    "heading": "3.4.5. Deckard Flats readjustment in northern Yellowstone",
    "text": "After depositing the 17.9± 1.2 ka Eightmile terminal moraines and the nearby 17.1± 1.7 Chico recessional moraines, the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier then receded 45 km upvalley to deposit the 15.1± 1.2 ka moraines of the Deckard Flats readjustment just beyond the northern boundary of YNP (Figs. 13 and 17). No recessional moraines, stillstand positions or terraces have been found between the Chico and Deckard Flats moraines. The duration of this 45-km recession was roughly 2 ka, which translates to a relatively fast average recession rate of ~22m/year.\nThe Deckard Flats readjustment represents a time when the\nYellowstone Plateau ice cap ceased to contribute much if any ice to the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier (Pierce, 1979). Once the ice flow from the plateau diminished, the GYGS margin in this part of northern Yellowstone stabilized at a position sustained by glaciers from the Beartooth Uplift and the Gallatin Range. The type moraines associated with this stable ice margin are located on Deckard Flats, a bench that lies 250m above the Yellowstone River and just inside the YNP boundary. On the northward continuation of this bench just beyond the park boundary, bouldery moraines are exposure-dated with 10Be to 15.1± 1.2 ka (Licciardi et al., 2001; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008). Nearby on the floor of the Yellowstone River valley, moraines from the Deckard Flats readjustment were reworked by Pinedale floods into giant ripples whose boulders yield a mean age of 14.4± 1.3 ka (Table 1; Fig. 19).\nBased on the cosmogenic ages and glacial-geologic relationships, the recessional Deckard Flats moraines (15.1± 1.2 ka) roughly correlate with the 15.5± 0.5 ka JH Pd-2 terminal moraines in Jackson Hole (section 3.4.2). These broadly correlative ages suggest that the northern slope of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap was essentially stagnant and contributed little or no glacial flow to the northern sectors of the GYGS, while at the same time the plateau ice cap was culminating at terminal moraines along its southern margin in Jackson Hole and on its southwestern margin near Ashton, Idaho. It may appear difficult to reconcile how these contrasting flow regimes could have operated simultaneously on opposite sides of the ice cap divide. However, this scenario becomes plausible if the Yellowstone Plateau summit dome was prograding toward the southwest during later Pinedale time as it was nourished by enhanced orographic snowfall arriving from storms traversing the Snake River Plain, while at the same time being starved of moisture on the lee side of the ice divide due to a growing precipitation shadow there. This hypothesis requires further testing with additional dating to more precisely define the phase relationship between the Deckard Flats stabilization on the north side of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap and glacial culminations toward the south.\nOur reconstruction of a stagnant northern sector of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap is consistent with mapped field\niner, Montana. Flood bar deposits include glacial boulders from Deckard Flats moraines e surface of the giant ripples yield an age of 14.4± 1.3 ka (Licciardi et al., 2001). View is\nrelationships in this region. In the terrain between Mount Washburn and Specimen Ridge, striated bedrock and glacial erratics associatedwith the Deckard Flats readjustment indicate that glacial ice from the Beartooth Uplift abutted ice from the Yellowstone Plateau at this time (Pierce, 1979, p. F59-60). On Specimen Ridge up to an altitude of 2750m (9000 ft) (Fig. 17), ice was flowing southwest from the Beartooth Uplift as indicated by striated bedrock and the distribution of limestone and crystalline rock erratics (Pierce, 1974a). Similar erratics are found on the northeast slope of MountWashburn up to an altitude of 2620m (8600 ft) (Fig. 17), but no Beartooth-sourced erratics are found on the extensive loweraltitude benches between Mount Washburn and Specimen Ridge (Pierce, 1974a, 1979). These observations suggest this area was occupied by remnants of the nearly stagnant Yellowstone Plateau ice cap during this time that blocked southward incursion of Beartooth ice (Pierce, 1979, p. F60).\nOn the northern flanks of theWashburn Range somewhat above and outside the Deckard Flats limit on the Blacktail Deer Plateau (Pierce, 1973a), striated bedrock and erratics of Precambrian crystalline rocks both indicate westerly flow of Beartooth Uplift ice (Figs. 13 and 17) and require the absence of Yellowstone Plateau ice in this area between middle and late Pinedale time (Pierce, 1973a). East of the Gallatin Range, glacial flow changed from northeasterly in middle Pinedale time (Fig. 12) to easterly in late Pinedale time (Fig. 17), as shown by bedrock striations and Gallatin Range erratics (Pierce, 1973a). This evidence also indicates that the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap had retreated to the south and no longer flowed into or occupied this area.\nA high two-sided kame terrace located just northeast of and 30m above Mammoth (Fig. 13) was fed by outwash gravel sourced from Gallatin Range ice on its south side, while simultaneously being buttressed on its north and east sides by a glacier either confluent with or flowing from the Beartooth Uplift. The upper surface of this kame bench is now perched 250m (800 ft) above the present-day Gallatin River, and therefore requires that the topography below this level was filled by glacial ice when the kame terrace was deposited."

    "heading": "3.4.6. Recession from the Deckard Flats readjustment position",
    "text": "Following the Deckard Flats readjustment, ice retreated 36 km up the Yellowstone River drainage from the Deckard Flats moraines to the Junction Butte moraines near Tower Junction (Fig. 13). The Junction Butte moraines were deposited by a glacier that headed in the Beartooth Uplift and flowed down the Slough Creek drainage (Pierce,1979). Cosmogenic 10Be ages of ten boulders on the Junction Butte moraines form a bimodal distribution (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008, Table 1), and we suspect the older mode is affected by isotope inheritance. The younger mode yields a mean age of 14.9± 0.4 ka, and this is considered the most representative age for these moraines. The overlapping mean ages of the Deckard Flats and Junction Butte moraines suggest an interval of rapid retreat ca. 15 ka (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008).\nThe extensive glacial deposits and landforms of northern YNP were constructed during the interval of rapid deglaciation from Deckard Flats to Junction Butte. These deposits underlie the sagebrush grasslands that comprise Yellowstone's Northern Range, now inhabited by elk, bison, wolves, and grizzly bears. In the Mammoth area, end moraines near the Gardner River Bridge mark an early phase of ice recession from the Deckard Flats limit to positions further up the Gardner River valley (Alden, 1928; Pierce, 1979, p. F58-59). The Gallatin Range glaciers that contributed to the Gardner River Bridge moraines later receded further and deposited end moraines near the mouths of valleys on the eastern side of the range, and also exposed Gardners Hole and its extensive grasslands (Pierce, 1973b, 1979). East of these locations, about ten recessional\nmoraines on the Blacktail Deer Plateau are distributed across an area of about 20 km2 and record progressive retreat of Beartooth Uplift ice (Pierce, 1973a). During recession from the Blacktail Deer Plateau to the Junction Butte moraines, about five successive icemarginal channels were incised into bedrock (Pierce, 1973a, 1974a) including the Phantom Lake channel, which has steep sides as high as 100m eroded into Absaroka volcanic bedrock and a flat valley floor with a gentle downvalley gradient.\nLarge glacial floods occurred during the recession of Beartooth Uplift glaciers in northern Yellowstone. Field relations show that the northern Yellowstone glacial floods are younger than the 15.1± 1.2 ka Deckard Flats moraines and that at least three major floods occurred (Pierce, 1979). The mid-channel flood bar in the Yellowstone River valley downstream of Gardiner, which is dated to 14.4± 1.3 ka (Table 1; Licciardi et al., 2001), displays giant ripples that attest to the large magnitude of these floods (Fig. 19). These flood deposits represent reworked end moraines from the Deckard Flats readjustment, and may record a flood that originated far upvalley and occurred during or soon after construction of the 14.9± 0.4 ka Junction Butte moraines."

In the Wind River Range, valley glaciers lingered near their Pinedale terminal position for several thousands of years, but then rapidly deglaciated to the cirques (Gosse et al., 1995). A similarly rapid deglaciation occurred in Cascade Canyon in the Teton Range, where glaciers were near their full-glacial extent as indicated by the inner Jenny Lake moraines dated to 14.4± 0.8 ka and then retreated 12.5 km upvalley to the lip of the Lake Solitude cirque by 12.9± 0.7 ka (Table 1; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008). In contrast, the Clarks Fork glacier receded from its terminal moraine to half its maximum length in only about 1.6 kyr, and then deposited multiple recessional moraines as it retreated progressively further upvalley. We interpret the initially fast recession of the Clarks Fork glacier to have resulted from the development of a precipitation shadow in its Beartooth Uplift glacial source region in middle Pinedale time as the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap became established. The subsequently slower recession of the Clarks Fork glacier during the late Pinedale likely occurred while the precipitation shadow endured but lessened as the plateau ice cap built toward the southwest."

    "heading": "4.1. Differing Bull Lake and Pinedale glacial extents linked to uplift and subsidence",
    "text": "Glacial-geologic evidence indicates large differences in the relative extents of Bull Lake and Pinedale terminal moraine positions around the periphery of the GYGS (Fig. 20). On the south and west sides of the GYGS, Bull Lake terminal moraines lie beyond the Pinedale ice limits by 48 km in Jackson Hole, 23 km near Ashton,\nand 22 km near West Yellowstone. However, on the north and east sides of the GYGS, Pinedale glaciers either completely overrode the Bull Lake terminal deposits or extended about as far downvalley as the Bull Lake ice margin. In the Yellowstone River valley on the north side of the GYGS, Bull Lake deposits were apparently overridden and obliterated by the Pinedale outlet glacier. Along the north side of the Beartooth Uplift, Bull Lake moraines form narrow slivers on benches above the Pinedale moraines in some drainages, indicating Pinedale glaciers were equally long or longer.\nThe regional pattern of relative Bull Lake and Pinedale glacial extents described above reveals a northeastward shift in the center of mass of the GYGS between Bull Lake and Pinedale time. We hypothesize that this change in glacial configuration is best explained by late Pleistocene uplift on the leading half of the YCHT and subsidence on the trailing half (Fig. 2). In terrain that has been uplifting on the leading portion of the Yellowstone hotspot since\nthe penultimate glaciation, the Pinedale glacial source regions would have been at a higher altitude than those of the Bull Lake. Consequently, the Pinedale glaciers would have likely reached a greater maximum extent than Bull Lake glaciers and overrode the Bull Lake terminal moraines. This scenario applies to the north and east sides of the GYGS, which are on the leading half of the YCHT (Fig. 2). Conversely, the terrain underlying the south and west sides of the GYGS on the trailing half of the YCHT has been subsiding through time, and Bull Lake glaciers there would have developed at higher altitudes than Pinedale glaciers; hence Bull Lake terminal moraines are likely to be further downvalley than those deposited during the Pinedale. This explanation is consistent with much greater extents of the Bull Lake ice limit relative to the Pinedale along the southern and western periphery of the GYGS. The northeastward progression of the Yellowstone hotspot is minor over the ~130 kyr between the Bull Lake and Pinedale glaciations,\nfor at the rate of ~2.5 cm/yr (Pierce and Morgan, 1992, 2009) the hotspot would have moved only about 3.3 km.\nThe much greater extent of the Bull Lake along the south, southwest and west sides of the GYGS may also be related to a longer duration of ice cap occupation on the Yellowstone Plateau. The Pinedale ice cap on the plateauwas present for only about 3000 years (ca. 18e15 ka). If the Bull Lake ice cap continued to build for significantly longer than a few thousand years, then this prolonged glacial buildup period during the penultimate glaciation might be a factor in explaining the low Pd/BL ratios for the southern, southwestern, and western parts of the GYGS (Fig. 20).\nIn an earlier publication, Pierce (1979) hypothesized that emplacement of intra Bull Lake-Pinedale rhyolite flows in the western part of YNP led to the blockage of Pinedale glacial flow toward the western periphery of the GYGS and a resultant increase in Pinedale glacial flow on the north side of the GYGS that overrode and obliterated the Bull Lake moraines. However, such rhyolite flows should have also caused Pinedale ice to flow beyond the Bull Lake limit on the south side of the GYGS in Jackson Hole. Later discovery that the Bull Lake glaciers actually extended 48 km beyond Pinedale glaciers in Jackson Hole (Pierce and Good, 1992; Pierce and Morgan, 1992; Pierce et al., 2018) rules against the hypothesis that intra Bull Lake-Pinedale rhyolite flows diverted Pinedale ice flow patterns.\n4.2. Evolution of GYGS configurations during the Pinedale glaciation\nA synthesis of the evolving relationships between Pinedale GYGS configurations and precipitation patterns is shown conceptually in Fig. 21. These conceptualized relationships assume that modern-day orographic and atmospheric circulation patterns also likely prevailed in Pinedale glacial times. Although we focus on moisture delivery via the low-lying Snake River Plain as a primary control on orographic precipitation patterns in the greater Yellowstone region (Figs. 4 and 21), it must be noted that storms also arrive from other directions and would have impacted Pinedale glacier mass balances, particularly in the Beartooth Uplift.\nIn early Pinedale time, glacial buildup occurred on the YCHT and included ice advances from the Beartooth Uplift and High Absaroka Range. The Yellowstone Plateau was not high enough to be above the ELA and therefore not yet covered by an ice cap. Easterlymoving storms funneled by the Snake River Plain did, however, produce deep orographic snow as they rose up onto the plateau, and then experienced a precipitation shadow as they descended a little across the plateau (Fig. 21A). As the easterly-moving air masses subsequently rose up and over the mountains of the YCHT, more orographic precipitation was extracted on the upwind side of these ranges and another precipitation shadow formed on the lee side.\nIn middle Pinedale time, thickening ice on the northern and northeastern Yellowstone Plateau elevated these areas above the ELA where enhanced orographic precipitation stimulated rapid glacial buildup (Fig. 21B). Northward glacial flow from the plateau ice cap combined with glaciers from the YCHT and formed the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier, which advanced 55 km down the Yellowstone River valley north of YNP to the Eightmile terminal moraines. A precipitation shadow developed eastward and downwind from the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap (Fig. 21B), causing the Clarks Fork glacier from the Beartooth Uplift to retreat 45 km upvalley to recessional positions.\nDuring the late Pinedale, orographic precipitation progressively built the crest of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap to the southwest (Fig. 21C), where it advanced south to terminal moraines of the Snake River lobe just beyond Jackson Lake and alsowest to terminal moraines of the Fall River lobe. Descending air resulted in a\nprecipitation shadow northeast of the ice cap summit, raising the ELA and severely limiting the ice cap contribution to the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier. As a result, the outlet glacier retreated 50 km upvalley and the terminus stabilized at moraine positions of the Deckard Flats readjustment. The Clarks Fork glacier from the Beartooth Uplift remained in the precipitation shadow and deposited multiple recessional moraines as it retreated (Fig. 21C)."

    "heading": "4.3. Assessing paleoclimatic controls on the glacial history of greater Yellowstone",
    "text": "In previous work on the GYGS history (Licciardi et al., 2001; Licciardi and Pierce, 2008), we explored associations between late Pleistocene glacier fluctuations in the greater Yellowstone area and regional climate forcings. This earlier assessment recognized four main challenges in discerning climate drivers from the glacial history, including: (1) the inherently selective nature of moraine chronologies; (2) the complex influence of glacier dynamics on temporal and spatial patterns of glacial events; (3) uncertainties in the accuracy of cosmogenic nuclide exposure ages; and (4) the lack of numerical modeling experiments to test hypothesized paleoclimatic controls. These challenges are not unique to Yellowstone and represent general issues that must be confronted when attempting to extract paleoclimate signals from exposure-dated moraine chronologies. Nonetheless, mountain glacier records are widely recognized as invaluable archives of past climatic information (e.g., Oerlemans, 2005; Leonard et al., 2017), and the GYGS history is no exception.\nOur updated synthesis of Bull Lake and Pinedale glacial histories provides important progress on the first three issues listed above and prompts a re-examination of postulated glacier-climate links in the Yellowstone region. First, the glacial chronologies have been augmented by newly available data sets including previously unpublished obsidian hydration measurements on glacial deposits near Ashton, Idaho (this report), TL and meteoric 10Be age constraints on loess stratigraphy in Jackson Hole (Pierce et al., 2011), additional 10Be exposure ages on moraines in the Teton Range (Licciardi et al., 2015; Pierce et al., 2018), and new 10Be exposure ages along the southern margin of the GYGS (this report). Second, our new reconstructions of Pinedale ice sheet configurations through time elucidate fresh details on internal glacier dynamics and evolving orographic influences that impacted the GYGS during the last glaciation. Third, the recalculation of published cosmogenic 10Be exposure ages using updated nuclide production rates and scaling yields ages with improved accuracy (Table 1). In some cases, these recalculated ages differ enough from the originally published ages to impact previously hypothesized connections between the moraine chronologies and independently dated climate events.\nAll available age constraints on Bull Lake glacial deposits in the greater Yellowstone region support their correlation with MIS 6 (190e130 ka). Marine records of global ice volume suggest that the most extensive interval of MIS 6 glaciation was centered on ca. 140 ka and that the penultimate glaciation ended swiftly (Termination II) from 135 to 130 ka (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). A coincident timing of Termination II is also recorded in speleothem records from thewestern U.S. (e.g., Shakun et al., 2011;Moseley et al., 2016). Over broad timescales, it is sensible to ascribe the Bull Lake glaciation in Yellowstone to cold climates of the penultimate glacial period. However, on higher-resolution timescales it becomes challenging to assess correlations between the ages of reconstructed Bull Lake glacial events and short-lived excursions in global ice volume and regional paleoclimate during MIS 6 for several reasons. First, while it is tempting to expect the Bull Lake glacial maximum in Yellowstone to align with peaks in global ice volume, this inference is risky because the marine record is a signal\nof globally integrated ice volume and does not resolve potential asynchrony between mountain glacier and continental ice sheet fluctuations (Gillespie and Molnar, 1995). Second, given the documented complexities of the Pinedale glaciation, it seems likely that the Bull Lake was characterized by similarly complex internal ice dynamics and asynchronous maxima within the GYGS system. Third, existing age uncertainties on the Bull Lake deposits, particularly those related to moraine degradation, boulder surface erosion, and scaled time-varying isotope production rates, hinder millennial-scale correlations with independently dated records spanning the penultimate glacial period.\nThe oldest dated Pinedale feature in greater Yellowstone is the Clarks Fork moraine (19.8± 0.9 ka); the recalculated age is about 1000 years older than its previously published age (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008) and falls within the latter part of the global last glacial maximum (LGM) interval (26.5e19 ka; Clark et al., 2009). Similar ages of moraines built by valley glaciers in the Teton Range (Licciardi et al., 2015; Pierce et al., 2018) and nearby Wind River Range (Gosse et al., 1995) suggest a regional pattern of glacial culminations followed by retreat toward the end the LGM. Other major glacial events of the early Pinedale were driven by ice advances from the Beartooth Uplift and the High Absaroka Range that also likely occurred during the LGM (section 3.2). It is reasonable to link these ice expansions and subsequent retreat to external climate forcings such as changes in summer insolation that drove the development and eventual deterioration of LGM climates (e.g., Hays et al., 1976; He et al., 2013; Shakun et al., 2015). The shift toward older moraine ages arising from 10Be age recalculations suggests that our previous attribution of a relatively “late” Pinedale maximum in northern Yellowstone to the glacier-inhibiting impacts of the cold dry anticyclone over the Laurentide Ice Sheet no longer holds (Licciardi et al., 2004; Thackray, 2008).\nIn middle Pinedale time, the buildup of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap created a formidable new orographic barrier at the western center of the GYGS. The culmination of the ice cap in northern Yellowstone is recorded by the Eightmile terminal moraines (17.9± 1.2 ka) deposited by the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier. We argue that this late-blooming ice mass strongly impacted orographic precipitation patterns in the greater Yellowstone region and became a dominating influence on the temporal and spatial patterns of glacial events during the middle and late Pinedale. External climate forcings surely played some role in driving glacier fluctuations during this time, but these external controls were likely obscured or overprinted by orographic influences. For example, the age of the Chico recessional moraines (17.1± 1.7 ka) marks the end of an interval when the outlet glacier margin had lingered within 6 km of the Eightmile terminus, and the beginning of a rapid 45-km retreat upvalley to Deckard Flats. In the absence of orographic influences, one might ascribe the abandonment of the Chico moraines and ensuing large-scale glacier retreat to a climatic warming. However, our geologic reconstructions indicate that retreat from the Chico moraines was largely a consequence of stagnation of the northern sector of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap, which was brought about by an expanding precipitation shadow in the lee of the growing summit dome in late Pinedale time (section 3.4.5). These orographic influences confound efforts to isolate and identify external climate drivers of glacier fluctuations during the middle and late Pinedale.\nBy late Pinedale time, the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap had prograded southwest toward its primary source of moisture, thereby causing large geographic shifts in orographic precipitation patterns. The major glacial events that characterize the late Pinedale in the GYGS, including the stabilization of glaciers at the Deckard Flats readjustment position and the culmination of plateau-sourced ice along the southern and southwestern margins\nof the GYGS, are largely attributed to dynamical changes related to shifting orographic controls on themass balance of different sectors of the GYGS (Fig. 21). In contrast, we consider it likely that regional deglaciation throughout greater Yellowstone ca. 15e14 ka was actually driven by external climate forcing. The timing of late Pinedale glacial retreat in Yellowstone broadly coincides with widespread deglaciation across the western U.S. (e.g., Licciardi et al., 2004; Schaefer et al., 2006; Young et al., 2011; Leonard et al., 2017). We concur with previous suggestions (e.g., Young et al., 2011) that the final phase of retreat in western North America ca. 15 ka may be related to warming at the onset of the BøllingAllerød (14.7 ka) (Stuiver and Grootes, 2000; Clark et al., 2012).\nThe youngest dated glacial position in the greater Yellowstone region is the Lake Solitude cirque lip in the Teton Range, where perched boulders yield a recalculated mean age of 12.9± 0.7 ka (Table 1). Our earlier interpretation that these boulder ages signify a glacial stillstand near the onset of the Younger Dryas cold interval (12.9e11.7 ka) remains equally viable with the recalculated age, which is nearly equivalent to our previously published age of 12.8± 0.6 ka (Licciardi and Pierce, 2008).\nFinally, we note that initial progress has been made toward numerical modeling of paleoclimatic and orographic controls on the development of the Yellowstone ice cap during the LGM (Anderson et al., 2014). Outcomes from these first-order modeling experiments represent an encouraging first step toward assessing the stability and sensitivity of our geological reconstructions of evolving GYGS configurations through the various stages of the Pinedale glaciation and subsequent deglaciation.We anticipate that future modeling exercises will enable us to more confidently identify and tease apart external climate drivers, orographic impacts, glacier dynamics, and non-climatic influences on the growth and demise of the GYGS."

    "text": "Yellowstone has experienced repeated cycles of active volcanism and glaciation throughoutmuch of the Quaternary Period (the last 2.588Ma), and because volcanic and glacial events were presumably contemporaneous at times, one might expect to find ample evidence of past ice-volcano interactions in the geologic record. However, only a few glaciovolcanic features have been described. One notable example is the 110± 1 ka West Yellowstone rhyolite flow, which contains large reentrants along its eastern flow margin that are interpreted to indicate emplacement against glacial ice (Christiansen, 2001).\nNumerous studies have documented compelling links between glacial unloading and increased rates of volcanism (e.g., Jakobsson et al., 1978; Maclennan et al., 2002; Licciardi et al., 2007; Tuffen, 2010). One conceptual model is that ice unloading induces changes in tectonic stress and lithostatic confining pressure on magma bodies that lead to eruption of pooled crustal magma (Guðmundsson, 1986; Sigvaldason et al., 1992). Other studies argue that rapid postglacial isostatic rebound stimulates decompressioninduced melt production and eruptive activity (e.g., Jull and McKenzie, 1996; Slater et al., 1998). Regardless of cause, it merits some consideration whether past episodes of deglaciation in Yellowstone were associated with enhanced volcanism.\nThe Pinedale ice cap on the Yellowstone Plateau reached a thickness of about one kilometer, which translates to an ice overburden pressure of about 910,000 kg/m2 on the landscape. The mass of the full-glacial ice cap would have depressed the crust and increased confining pressure on the magmatic system beneath the Yellowstone Plateau. Unloading of the thick Yellowstone Plateau ice cap during deglaciation would have relieved considerable pressure from the magmatic system. Yet our reconstructions also limit the\nbuildup, establishment, and subsequent disappearance of this ice cap to only a few thousand years, hence the full cycle of glacial loading-unloading would have been relatively rapid. However, no volcanic eruptions are documented to have occurred in YNP during the deglacial unloading of the GYGS. This indicates the magma chamber beneath YNPwas not primed to erupt via pressure-release phenomena 15,000 years ago. On the other hand, some studies have suggested that hydrothermal explosions may have been more frequent and vigorous shortly after withdrawal of Pinedale ice, possibly triggered by sudden drainage of ice-dammed lakes overlying active hydrothermal systems and associated reduction in confining pressure (Muffler et al., 1971; Pierce et al., 2003). Other studies have used radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic relationships of large hydrothermal explosion deposits to show these events have occurred regularly in Yellowstone since the last deglaciation, implying that non-glacial triggering mechanisms must also be considered (Morgan et al., 2009).\nWhat effect would the heat produced by Yellowstone's famous geothermal features have on glaciation? The geothermal heat currently emanating from the Lower, Middle, and Upper Geyser Basins is estimated to impart enough energy to locally melt 3m of ice per year from the base of an overlying glacier; but when averaged over the entire Firehole River drainage basin, this heat would melt about 0.3m of ice per year (Pierce, 1979). The impact of geothermal heat on basal ablation is comparatively minor relative to atmospheric temperature controls on surface melt, given that annual ablation loss of the glacier surface increases by 0.3m for every 30-m drop in altitude (Pierce, 1979)."

    "heading": "5. Conclusions",
    "text": "The Greater Yellowstone Glacial System (GYGS) covered about 20,000 km2 at its Pleistocene maximum, but this glaciated area was not occupied simultaneously (Fig. 1). The glacial history is inextricably associated with the Yellowstone hotspot, which caused two conditions that fostered extensive glaciation: (1) uplift and resultant cold temperatures in greater Yellowstone; and (2) the lowland track of the hotspot along the eastern Snake River Plain that funneled moisture to the Yellowstone Plateau and the Yellowstone Crescent of High Terrain (YCHT). Glacial-geologic relationships and cosmogenic 10Be ages of moraines reveal a complex dynamic history of the GYGS during the last two glaciations.\nBull Lake terminal moraines on the south side of the GYGS yield a10Be exposure age of 150± 4 ka and those along the western margin of the GYGS are dated to ~140 ka by combined obsidianhydration and KeAr methods. The penultimate (Bull Lake) glaciation extended well beyond the Pinedale on the south (48 km), southwest (23 km), and west (22 km) sides of the GYGS, but was less extensive than Pinedale ice on the north and east sides. The northeastward shift in the center of ice mass from Bull Lake to Pinedale time may be explained by uplift on the leading margin of the Yellowstone hotspot concomitant with subsidence on the trailing margin.\nIn early Pinedale time (~22e18 ka; Fig. 9), glacial buildup on the Beartooth Uplift stimulated ice advances to the ~20 ka Clarks Fork terminal moraines as well as advances onto the northern margin of the Yellowstone Plateau. Glacial buildup in the High Absaroka Range led to an advance westward down the Buffalo Fork into Jackson Hole as well as northward ice flow through the present-day Yellowstone Lake and onto the eastern part of the Yellowstone Plateau.\nIn middle Pinedale time (~18e16 ka; Fig. 12), distal portions of Beartooth and Absaroka glaciers flowing onto the margins of the Yellowstone Plateau grew in thickness to rise above the ELA, eventually building into a self-sustaining ice dome centered over\nthe plateau. Once established, the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap was further nourished by strong orographic snowfall and started building southwestward, driving glacial flow northward across the Washburn Range. The plateau ice cap combined with glaciers from the Beartooth Uplift and Gallatin Range to form the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier, which extended ~60 km north of Yellowstone National Park (YNP). The birth of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap placed the Clarks Fork glacier in a snow shadow, causing it to retreat to half its length.\nIn late Pinedale time (~16e13 ka; Fig. 17), the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap built further to the southwest toward its main source of moisture. Ice advanced south down the Snake River valley and scoured a deep glacial trough now occupied by Jackson Lake, while the Fall River lobe flowed west and deposited terminal moraines near Ashton, Idaho. At the same time, the northern lee slope of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap fell within a growing precipitation shadow and stagnated, causing the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier to retreat 45 km to the Deckard Flats moraines. The Yellowstone Plateau ice cap also placed the Buffalo Fork lobe in a precipitation shadow that caused this lobe to recede >20 km from its terminus.\nToward the end of late Pinedale time, further ice recession led to separation of the northern GYGS into its component parts, with retreat of Beartooth Uplift glaciers marked by the ~15 ka Junction Butte moraines. Meanwhile, the Snake River lobe in Jackson Hole receded to a stable position just south of Jackson Lake, and outwash from this ice lobe flowed around the margin of the inner Jenny Lake moraines from the Teton Range. These events represent the final stand of the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap, which deglaciated at ~15e14 ka. Teton Range valley glaciers also abandoned their terminal positions at ~15e14 ka and retreated upvalley to their cirques, where they stabilized around 13 ka before final retreat.\nIsostatic depression of the crust by glacial loading reduced the gradients of meltwater streams flowing away from YNP and resulted in deposition of thick outwash gravels. Floods emanating from the downwasting GYGS coursed across its progressively deglaciated periphery in all directions and punctuated outwash deposition. Unloading of ~1000m of ice during the final deglaciation of the GYGS was not accompanied by volcanism, suggesting that the eruptive susceptibility of the Yellowstone magmatic system was not affected by postglacial pressure release.\nWhile the initiation and eventual demise of the GYGS was driven by external climate forcings associated with buildup and termination of global glacial maxima, we argue that orographic controls on precipitation patterns and glaciermass balance played a critical role in guiding the dynamical evolution of the GYGS during full-glacial times. Moisture-laden storms traversing the lowland Snake River Plain produce deep orographic snows as they rise up onto the Yellowstone Plateau. Precipitation diminishes across the plateau but then increases again as air masses encounter the high mountains northwest and southeast of the plateau, and then diminishes dramatically as air descends into the low-lying basins farther east (Fig. 4). This orographic precipitation extraction on windward topographic slopes and suppressed precipitation in leeside locations explainsmuch of the ice-dynamical changes of the GYGS during the last glaciation (Fig. 21). In light of our glacial reconstructions in the Yellowstone region, it seems possible if not likely that other large Pleistocene mountain glacier complexes in the western U.S. and elsewhere also experienced similarly complex ice dynamics linked to shifting orographic influences and strong precipitation gradients (e.g., Laabs et al., 2009).\nThus, the Greater Yellowstone glacial system changed dramatically between the last two glaciations and during the course of the last glaciation."

  "abstractText": "The Greater Yellowstone Glacial System (GYGS) covered about 20,000 km2 at its maximum Pleistocene extent. The initiation, culmination, and ultimate decay of the GYGS involved complex interactions between several coalescent ice masses flowing from glacial source areas adjoining and including the Yellowstone Plateau. Here, we present an updated review of the history and dynamics of the GYGS during the penultimate (Bull Lake) and last (Pinedale) glaciations, drawing upon an integration of glacialgeologic mapping with >130 cosmogenic 10Be and 3He exposure ages. Bull Lake glacial deposits in greater Yellowstone are dated to ca. 150e140 ka and correlate with marine isotope stage 6. The Bull Lake glaciation extended well beyond the Pinedale along the southern and western GYGS margins, but Pinedale glaciers overrode Bull Lake ice limits on the north and east sides. The northeastward shift of the center of ice mass from Bull Lake to Pinedale time may be explained by uplift on the leading edge of the Yellowstone hotspot and subsidence on the trailing margin. In early Pinedale time (~22e18 ka), ice buildup culminated in the high terrain of the Beartooth Uplift and High Absaroka Range. Glaciers from these source regions flowed onto the northeastern margin of the Yellowstone Plateau and advanced to terminal moraines beyond Clarks Fork Canyon and in Jackson Hole. By middle Pinedale time (~18e16 ka), the Yellowstone Plateau ice cap surface had risen above the equilibrium-line altitude, stimulating orographic glacial buildup nourished by storms funneled eastward through the Snake River Plain. The plateau ice cap eventually thickened to >1000m and joined glaciers from the Beartooth Uplift and Gallatin Range to form the northern Yellowstone outlet glacier. Terrain east and downwind of the ice cap crest was placed in a precipitation shadow, resulting in glacial recession in these regions. During the late Pinedale (~16e13 ka), the plateau ice cap prograded southwestward toward the direction of moisture supply, leading to advances along the southern and western margins of the GYGS. Northern sectors of the plateau ice cap were nearly stagnant at this time. The Yellowstone region experienced widespread deglaciation ca. 15e14 ka in response to warming climate. Unloading of the ~1 km-thick plateau ice cap and consequent release of pressure on the magmatic system beneath Yellowstone was not accompanied by volcanism, indicating that the magma chamber was not primed to erupt via decompression during the last deglaciation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
