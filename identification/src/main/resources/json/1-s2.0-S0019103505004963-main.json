    "text": "We use Viking and new MGS and Odyssey data to characterize the lobate deposits superimposed on aureole deposits along the west and northwest flanks of Olympus Mons, Mars. These features have previously been interpreted variously as landslide, pyroclastic, lava flow or glacial features on the basis of Viking images. The advent of multiple high-resolution image and topography data sets from recent spacecraft missions allow us to revisit these features and assess their origins. On the basis of these new data, we interpret these features as glacial deposits and the remnants of cold-based debris-covered glaciers that underwent multiple episodes of advance and retreat, occasionally interacting with extrusive volcanism from higher on the slopes of Olympus Mons. We subdivide the deposits into fifteen distinctive lobes. Typical lobes begin at a theater-like alcove in the escarpment at the base of Olympus Mons, interpreted to be former ice-accumulation zones, and extend outward as a tongue-shaped or fan-shaped deposit. The surface of a typical lobe contains (moving outward from the basal escarpment): a chaotic facies of disorganized hillocks, interpreted as sublimation till in the accumulation zone; arcuate-ridged facies characterized by regular, subparallel ridges and interpreted as the ridges of surface debris formed by the flow of underlying ice; and marginal ridges interpreted as local terminal moraines. Several lobes also contain a hummocky facies toward their margins that is interpreted as a distinctive type of sublimation till shaped by structural dislocations and preferential loss of ice. Blocky units are found extending from the escarpment onto several lobes; these units are interpreted as evidence of lava–ice interaction and imply that ice was present at a time of eruptive volcanic activity higher on the slopes of Olympus Mons. Other than minor channel-like features in association with lava–ice interactions, we find no evidence for the flow of liquid water in association with these lobate features that might suggest: (1) near-surface groundwater as a source for ice in the alcoves in the lobe source region at the base of the scarp, or (2) basal melting and drainage emanating from the lobes that might indicate wet-based glacial conditions. Instead, the array of features is consistent with cold-based glacial processes. The glacial interpretations outlined here are consistent with recent geological evidence for lowlatitude ice-rich features at similar positions on the Tharsis Montes as well as with orbital dynamic and climate models indicating extensive snow and ice accumulation associated with episodes of increased obliquity during the Late Amazonian period of the history of Mars.  2005 Elsevier Inc.

The Olympus Mons deposits have been variously interpreted to be landslide deposits, explosive and effusive volcanic deposits (Carr et al., 1977; Scott and Tanaka, 1986; Morris and Tanaka, 1994) and rock glaciers (Lucchitta, 1981). With the recent availability of multiple, high-resolution datasets and in light of recent analyses of proposed glacial features at the Tharsis Montes (e.g., Head and Marchant, 2003; Shean et al., 2005; Parsons and Head, 2005), we have undertaken a re-examination of these intriguing deposits. We begin\nby reviewing the characteristics of the aureole deposits, which contrast greatly with the lobate deposits on top of them. We next summarize the previous studies of the lobate deposits themselves and review the morphological characteristics of four pos-\nsible emplacement mechanisms—landslide, glacial, pyroclastic, and lava flows—as observed on Earth. We then examine the lobate deposits in recent Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey images and topographic data to determine the most\nplausible emplacement mechanism. Finally, we discuss the implications of our interpretations for martian climate during the Late Amazonian.\nOlympus Mons, a massive martian volcano located in the equatorial regions, rises over 25 km and is surrounded by a basal escarpment up to 8 km high (Fig. 1). Extending as much as 1000 km beyond this scarp are lobes of ridged materials known as the aureole deposits (Carr et al., 1977; MouginisMark et al., 1992). The aureole deposits form an asymmetric ring of material around Olympus Mons and are made up of at least seven distinct lobes that were deposited in at least four separate intervals. The surfaces of these lobes are characterized by a corrugated texture, formed from curvilinear, flat-topped ridges and troughs with heights of several hundred meters to a few kilometers (Tanaka, 1985). The corrugations are generally parallel to the margins of aureole lobes (Tanaka, 1985). The lobes are up to 4 km thick (Francis and Wadge, 1983) and in places they are cut by graben (Morris, 1982; Francis and Wadge, 1983). Linear faults and fractures in the aureoles do not cut through multiple overlying lobes nor do they intersect the basement; this implies that the aureole deposits are mechanically detached from the underlying material (Francis and Wadge, 1983). Mechanisms favored for the emplacement of the aureole deposits include large catastrophic landslides originating at the basal escarpment (Lopes et al., 1982), or gravitydriven landslides of lubricated material, possibly ice (Tanaka, 1985).\nSuperimposed upon the west and northwest aureole deposits at the base of the escarpment (Fig. 1) are smaller lobate features described by Scott and Tanaka (1986) as “fan-like corrugated sheets as wide as 600 km that appear to override topographic obstacles without deflection of internal structure; source areas (are) hummocky, (and) contain small hills and circular depressions” (Scott and Tanaka, 1986). Carr et al. (1977) observed that steeper portions of the basal scarp are associated with lobes containing larger marginal zones of arcuate ridges.\nMany mechanisms have been proposed for the emplacement of the lobate deposits. Scott and Tanaka (1986) interpreted the lobate deposits to be avalanches of volcanic debris from either slope failure or explosive volcanism. Other initial hypotheses for the emplacement mechanism of these deposits include landslide debris aprons lubricated during emplacement by compressed gas (Carr et al., 1977). Lucchitta (1981) demonstrated that the morphology of these lobate deposits as revealed in Viking imagery is very similar to that of terrestrial glaciers. Ridges associated with these deposits are superposed on the surrounding aureole and are not deflected by underlying topography; thus Lucchitta (1981) interpreted them to be draped over the aureole surface as might be the case for ridges produced by downwasting of a debris-covered glacier or rock glacier. Lucchitta (1981) also stressed the morphological similarities of the lobate deposits with those associated with terrestrial piedmont glaciers such as the Malaspina Glacier (Fig. 2) (and Fig. 5b in Lucchitta, 1981). The lobate deposits on Olympus Mons and the supraglacial debris on the Malaspina Glacier both show long, even, curvilinear ridges that are subparallel to deposit margins.\nSubsequent to the initial Lucchitta (1981) Viking-era study several new datasets have been acquired: Mars Global Surveyor’s high-resolution Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images (with meters/pixel resolution) and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) topographic data, as well as Mars Odyssey’s Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) near-IR images (with 100 m/pixel resolution). In this study we employ these new datasets to assess four previously proposed mechanisms for emplacement of the lobate deposits: landslide, glacial, pyroclastic, or lava flow. We then place these deposits in the context of recent research into martian climate history.\nWhat criteria can be used to distinguish among the multiple suggested origins for these deposits? Here we examine the characteristics of terrestrial landslide, volcanic and glacial deposits in order to provide a framework in which to interpret the morphology of the lobate deposits.\nLandslide deposits Two major categories of terrestrial landslide deposits, slumps and debris avalanches, have fundamentally different morphologies that reflect differences in their\nmode of origin. The debris apron of a slump deposit is wide relative to its length, with common length-to-width ratios of approximately 1:2. Such a debris apron is also often cut by transverse faults to form large blocks and ridges, and is generally steep along curvilinear fronts. Slump deposits may also lack a well-defined source region (Moore et al., 1989).\nIn contrast, the morphology of the apron of a debris avalanche commonly shows trough structures near source regions and hummocky terrain near distal ends (Moore et al., 1989; Ablay and Hürlimann, 2000). The surface of the apron is characterized by longitudinal grooves and transverse ridges, giving rise to an overall corrugated texture (Moore et al., 1989; Ablay and Hürlimann, 2000; Laberg and Vorren, 2000). Debris avalanches originate at horseshoe-shaped depressions or theaters (Moore et al., 1989) that commonly widen in the direction of avalanche movement (Moon and Simpson, 2002).\nPyroclastic flow deposits Pyroclastic surge and flow deposits are emplaced by laterally moving density currents containing ash particles and gas. The morphology of pyroclastic deposits is dependent on several factors, including the proportion of ash and gas in the flow. Pyroclastic flows tend to extend radially away from a source vent and are controlled by local topography. They typically pond in depressions and thin out on topographic highs (Freundt et al., 2000).\nLava flow deposits Lava flows tend to be hundreds to thousands of times longer than they are wide and are made up of multiple overlapping sequences of lobes. The fronts and margins may have complex budding tongues and toes. A lava flow can have a surface characterized by irregular crustal fragments or be smooth and continuous depending on the composition of the flowing material (Kilburn, 2000).\nGlacial deposits The morphology of glacial deposits is controlled to a large extent by the thermal regime of glacier ice (wet-based or cold-based), the extent of surface melting, the origin and abundance of supraglacial, englacial, and basal debris, and the geometry of underlying terrain (e.g., Benn and Evans, 1998).\nValley glaciers For typical valley glaciers that achieve wetbased conditions as well as surface melting in ablation zones, debris that is entrained by surface rockfall and/or basal plucking is ultimately deposited as basal till, ablation till, stratified ice-contact drift, or proglacial fluvial and lacustrine sediment. Typical landforms associated with these glaciers include eskers; terminal, lateral, and recessional moraines; kames and kame terraces; ice-contact deltas; and outwash. Ice-margin advances associated with these wet-based glaciers tend to erode previous deposits, resulting in a single flow trace at the ground surface that represents active flow during ice retreat. Multiple flow traces, showing a palimpsest landscape, may be preserved in regions overrun by polythermal ice (e.g., Kleman, 1994). In this case, dissection and erosion of earlier deposits is incomplete and two or more flow traces may be preserved on a regional scale. Complete preservation of unconsolidated landforms is possible beneath cold-based ice. In such glaciers, basal ice remains below the pressure-melting point; and flow thus occurs\nwithout basal sliding, accommodated entirely by internal deformation. Such cold-based glaciers are common in the Antarctic Dry Valleys (e.g., Waller, 2001) and may also occur on Mars (Head and Marchant, 2003).\nDebris-covered glaciers As the name implies, debriscovered glaciers contain a core of glacier ice that is overlain by a veneer of surface debris. This veneer of surface debris, which may be meters thick, most commonly originates through a combination of rockfall onto glacier ice and/or sublimation of debris-rich ice. The veneer protects the underlying ice and slows melting and/or ice sublimation; as a result, ice in terrestrial debris-covered glaciers may be considerably older than typical valley glaciers. Flow of the buried glacier ice creates a ridge-and-furrow topography in the surface debris (e.g., Ackert, 1998; Kääb and Weber, 2004).\nNon-glacial ice-rich lobate deposits Some lobate deposits that superficially resemble those produced by glaciers, particularly debris-covered glaciers, may in fact be related to flow and deposition associated with non-glacial, icy regolith (for a review, see Martin and Whalley, 1987; Whalley and Martin, 1992). These non-glacial deposits include rock glaciers (with a core of non-glacier ice), protalus ramparts, and protalus lobes.\nRock glaciers Rock glaciers are a mass of fine-to-coarsegrained material that contains interstitial ice and/or an ice core; in active rock glaciers, surface debris commonly shows ridges and furrows suggestive of downslope flow. Rock glaciers may have a variety of morphologies depending on the surrounding topography. Confined within a valley, the lobate body is commonly termed a tongue-shaped rock glacier; if distal margins are not confined topographically, lateral flow may yield a spatulate shape, culminating in a piedmont rock glacier. Rock glaciers may be tens of meters to a few kilometers long (Martin and Whalley, 1987; Whalley and Martin, 1992). Confusion relating to the origin of terrestrial rock glaciers arises from the fact that some rock glaciers are cored wholly or in part with glacier ice; in such cases, we prefer to use the term debriscovered glacier; we reserve rock glaciers for those deposits cored by segregation ice or where ice origins are unknown.\nProtalus ramparts and lobes These lobate deposits generally form at distal boundaries of perennial snowbanks. The snow surface provides a rampart on which rockfall debris slides and accumulates at distal margins. Periodic snowmelt infiltrates rockfall debris, occasionally forming pore ice that may be of sufficient concentration to yield creep deformation and downslope flow. Protalus lobes commonly occur where ice-rich, flowing deposits, are frequently stacked one on another. Protalus lobes and ramparts are commonly found in association with rock glaciers (Whalley and Azizi, 2003)."

    "heading": "2. Detailed characteristics of the lobate deposits at Olympus Mons",
    "text": "Using the range of basic characteristics and recognition criteria outlined above, we now turn to a detailed description of\nthe deposits themselves. In terms of their general, broad distribution, the lobate deposits rest unconformably on older, aureole deposits and lava plains derived from Olympus Mons eruptions,\nand extend for over 340 km from an azimuth of N 30◦ W to S 70◦ W along the western Olympus Mons scarp (Figs. 1, 3–6) covering an area of ∼15,000 km2. The deposits are made up of\nfifteen lobes, individually extending tens to one hundred kilometers from the base of the scarp; lobes have a spatulate form, increasing in width as they extend outward from the base of Olympus Mons. We examined the lobate deposits at a variety of scales in THEMIS, MOC, and MOLA data. An overview of topography is presented in Figs. 8–10. In the figures and\ndescriptions that follow, the region of the lobate deposits is subdivided into three regions identified in Fig. 3; individual lobes are numbered in this figure as well. A THEMIS IR mosaic and a map of the lobate deposits are found in Fig. 3 and serve as an overview for the more detailed figures of each region that follow. THEMIS mosaics, geologic sketch maps, and MOLA\ndata of each region (Figs. 4–6), and MOLA profiles (Fig. 7) provide the basis for our characterization. Each facies and/or feature on the map in Fig. 3B is described in the sections that follow, beginning at the base of Olympus Mons and working radially outward. These include the basal escarpment surrounding Olympus Mons (Figs. 1B and 1D), four facies (chaotic, blocky, arcuate-ridges, and hummocky), and a distal marginal ridge.\nThe basal escarpment, indicated in red in Fig. 3B, is found at the base of Olympus Mons (Fig. 1) and rises to heights of 8 km. The lip of the scarp has variable morphology along its extent (e.g., Basilevsky et al., 2005); throughout Region 1\n(Fig. 4A) and in several locations in Region 2 (Fig. 5A) and Region 3 (Fig. 6A), the lip displays an arcuate, sharp-crested ridge. Arcuate, outward-facing, theater-like alcoves (Fig. 8) are found throughout the escarpment. Layered outcrops made up primarily of bedded lava flows of the flank of Olympus Mons dominate the upper part of the scarp and form spurs and ridges (see Basilevsky et al., 2005 for more details), giving way to extensive talus deposits in the lower half of the scarp. The talus piles and aprons clearly embay and postdate the hillocks and knobs of the hummocky facies (Figs. 8B and 8C). In portions of Regions 2 and 3, the lip at the top of the escarpment is gentle, rather than sharp-crested, consis-\ntent with a mantle of superposed lava flows emanating from the flanks of Olympus Mons. The four mapped facies (chaotic, blocky, arcuate-ridged, and hummocky) all extend outward from the base of the scarp in approximately the sequence mentioned.\nThe chaotic facies, shown in gray in Fig. 3B, is found immediately adjacent to the scarp, usually defining a topographic low in the core of an individual lobe (Figs. 4D and 7). It is characterized by disorganized hillocks, each ranging in size from\nhundreds of meters to tens of kilometers (Fig. 9). Collectively the facies extends outward tens of kilometers from the basal escarpment (Fig. 3). The proximal contact is obscured by superposed talus from the scarp (Figs. 8 and 9), while the distal contact is transitional to the next outermost arcuate-ridged facies (Figs. 8C and 9).\nThe blocky facies, indicated in light purple in Fig. 3B, is found in areas where the lip of the adjacent escarpment is smooth rather than sharp-crested, and the slopes of the scarp\nare much lower (compare topographic maps in Figs. 4D, 5D, and 6D). This facies (Fig. 10) commonly extends 40–70 km from the base of the scarp; it thus forms the majority of the lobate deposit in these regions. The surface of the blocky terrain is characterized by oriented knobs that are arrayed in a linear, generally radial pattern outward from the base of the scarp (Fig. 10). The individual knobs in this facies can be as small as a few hundred meters, or thousands of meters long and hundreds of meters wide. The closer to the basal escarpment, the longer and more distinctly linear are the features (right-hand\nparts of Figs. 10A–10C). The linear aspects of the proximal parts of the deposits are generally contiguous with radial lava flows streaming down the sides of Olympus Mons. Basilevsky et al. (2005) described the blocky facies as part of their type 2 slopes.\nIndicated in light blue in Fig. 3B, the arcuate-ridged facies forms the majority of the lobate features in areas where the lip of the basal escarpment is sharp-crested and characterized by numerous alcoves (Figs. 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 6A, 6B). Individual lobes of the ridged facies are characterized by regular, arcu-\nate, subparallel ridges up to 60 km long (Fig. 11). In many locations, these ridges are draped over preexisting topography such as knobs or other ridges (Fig. 11B, left side) rather than curving around them. Many depressions are found in this facies (Fig. 11A, right; Fig. 11C, upper right; Fig. 11D, right); several are circular and are interpreted to be small impact craters; most others are irregularly shaped. Depressions tend to be hundreds of meters wide and thousands of meters long with depths on the order of tens of meters. This facies extends up to 100 km from the base of Olympus Mons (Fig. 3). Topographic profiles show that individual lobes thin toward their distal margins, commonly have convex upward profiles (Fig. 7), and reach as much as 800–1200 m in thickness.\nThe hummocky facies, indicated by dark blue in Fig. 3B, is found at the distal margin of several lobes in Region 1 (Fig. 4). This unit is 1–7 km wide and is characterized by a series of pits and knobs hundreds of meters in diameter (Fig. 12). The facies often forms outward-facing indentations in adjacent terrain, which follow the local to regional topography (see Fig. 12B).\nThe marginal ridge facies is comprised of a continuous ridge found along the outer margin of each lobe independent of the interior morphology of the lobe; Fig. 13A illustrates this ridge at the margin of the arcuate-ridged facies and Fig. 13B shows it at the margin of the blocky facies. At locations where multiple lobes meet, the marginal ridge facies is broken into individual linear segments along the boundary between the lobes; here\nseveral marginal ridges appear to be superposed (Figs. 13C– 13E). The distal marginal ridge is typically less than 100 m in height, but can be up to 125 m.\nAlthough facies exposure varies among lobes, the relative positioning of facies in each lobe is consistent with respect to the basal escarpment. For example, the sequence for lobe 2 (Fig. 4) shows, extending outward from the basal scarp: chaotic facies, arcuate-ridged facies, hummocky facies, and the marginal-ridge facies. Similarly, the sequence at lobe 3 (Fig. 4) shows the basal escarpment, a small amount of chaotic terrain, arcuate-ridged facies, hummocky facies, and the marginal ridge. Although lobe 9 (Fig. 5) only exhibits the blocky facies and the marginal ridge, these are arrayed in the sequence observed in other lobes.\nThe material that surrounds the lobate deposits has been defined by Scott and Tanaka (1986) as Aos, the Olympus Mons shield member found on the flanks of the volcano and on the smooth surrounding plains as well. It is made of complex, interfingering lobes of lava flows and contains channels and levees of volcanic origin as well as collapse pits. In our geologic sketch maps (Figs. 3–6), we have differentiated between Aos on Olympus Mons itself and Aos on the surrounding plains in the interest of highlighting the location of the basal escarpment. Corrugated material cut by deep troughs and graben, found in the northwest corner of Region 1 (Fig. 4), is identified by Scott and Tanaka (1986) as Aoa4, the youngest member of the aureole unit. North of this material are broad\nlevel plains that appear locally etched and striated in the direction of prevailing winds; these are interpreted as aeolian deposits.\nA survey of MOC images found throughout the western side of Olympus Mons reveals that aeolian features such as dunes cover the surfaces of all units. Fig. 14 shows several examples of dunes in the lobate deposits; Figs. 14A and 14B contain dunes between individual arcuate ridges of lobe 10 while Fig. 14C shows dunes on the surrounding plains beyond the marginal scarp as well as dunes within the lobe 10 itself. Fig. 14D shows dunes between individual ridges of the arcuateridged facies and the marginal ridge between lobes 3 and 4. The dunes are also found within crater floors in this area. This is consistent with Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) thermal inertia and albedo studies that indicate the region is covered by fine-grained dust (e.g., Putzig et al., 2005).\nWe found no evidence of fluvial channels in association with the lobate deposits, either in their source regions (the scarp areas) or at their lateral or distal margins, or generally within the ridges and materials of the lobate deposits themselves. The one exception to this is the presence of several small channel-like features seen in the blocky facies near the edge of the scarp (Fig. 5)."

    "heading": "3. Interpretation of the lobate deposits",
    "text": "We now assess the most plausible emplacement mechanisms for the lobate deposits. Because the deposits lack (1) the corrugated texture of terrestrial debris avalanches, (2) the topographic profile of typical terrestrial slump deposits, and (3) the radial grooves of martian landslides such as those found in Valles Marineris (Fig. 15A; Lucchitta, 1978; Lucchitta et al., 1992), we do not favor a landslide origin for the Olympus Mons lobate deposits. While portions of the lobate deposits appear to be influenced by lava flows (e.g., lobe 9 and the associated region of the basal escarpment), many features are inconsistent with emplacement by lava or pyroclastic flow, including the chaotic facies near the basal escarpment and the hummocky facies at the distal margin of several lobes, as well as the ubiquitous arcuate-ridged facies. Furthermore, the margin of a typical martian lava flow (Fig. 15B) is characterized by many small lobes and tongues rather than the continuous, regular ridges (Fig. 13) found at the margin of the Olympus Mons lobate deposits (Fig. 15C). This implies that the lobate deposits are not lava or pyroclastic flow features. There is no evidence of infilling of topographic lows to a relatively level surface, which\nwould distinguish pyroclastic flows from lava flows (see profiles in Fig. 7). Candidate volcanic source vents have also not been identified.\nAmong the various candidate origins for the lobate deposits previously mentioned, we conclude that a glacial origin is most consistent with the data, as originally proposed by Lucchitta (1981) on the basis of Viking data. The multiple lines of evidence originally cited by Lucchitta are considerably strengthened by our analysis of the new data. Furthermore, among the strengths of the glacial model is that it explains the relative positioning of the facies; although each facies considered in isolation might not be entirely diagnostic of a glacial origin, the observed facies sequence is strongly suggestive of glacial processes.\nFollowing this line of reasoning, we interpret the theaterlike alcoves in the basal escarpment as former ice-accumulation zones, many of which show the types of widening and overdeepening typical of terrestrial cirques. The main body of the lobate deposits could be interpreted as a combination of debriscovered glaciers and/or rock glaciers. We conclude that these deposits originated as multiple debris-covered glaciers: in this scenario, snow and ice that accumulated in alcoves was covered with rockfall emanating from the high-cliffs as the ice flowed outward from the basal scarp. Progressive sublimation in the advancing exposed ice led to concentration of debris on the surface and the formation of an overlying sublimation till. If the rockfall and resulting sublimation till were of sufficient thickness and extent, they could potentially significantly retard the loss of underlying ice (e.g., Marchant et al., 2002; Helbert and Benkhoff, 2005). On the other hand, if rockfall was sparse and discontinuous and the ice contained minimal englacial debris, then sublimation could remove all ice leaving only a “residue” of sublimation till. The presence of distinctive talus cones derived from the upper cliffs subsequent to glaciation (Figs. 8 and 9), suggests that there was a plentiful source of supraglacial debris to partially cover the accumulation zone and contribute to the evolving sublimation till. We interpret the chaotic facies at the base of the escarpment to be largely composed of this type of sublimation till. The dominance of exposed ice in the proximal regions would result in preferential sublimation of ice in the accumulation zone, producing a depression, less sublimation in the thin till distal to the accumulation zone, and production there of chaotic hummocks. The relatively low topographic depression at the site of the chaotic facies (Fig. 7) suggests that the chaotic facies lacks a uniform core of ice, but some of the individual larger hills could be underlain by an ice core protected by debris.\nThe continuous, curvilinear ridges characterizing the arcuate-ridged facies are very similar to those found on rock glaciers and debris-covered glaciers and are interpreted as ridges of surface debris formed by the flow of underlying ice (e.g., Martin and Whalley, 1987; Adamson and Colhoun, 1992). Comparison of the two different views of the Malaspina Glacier (Fig. 2) and the Olympus Mons lobes (Figs. 4–6, 15C) shows a remarkable similarity in terms of scale and morphology. The limited available data do not allow us to confirm the presence or absence of ice in this facies, but we speculate that if sufficient debris\ncovered underlying ice, then remnant ice may still core this facies; such ice, if present, would account for the convex-upward profile of lobes 1 and 3 (Fig. 7). Radar experiments on Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may be able to test for the presence of buried ice.\nThe hummocky facies at the edge of several lobes (Fig. 13) is interpreted as sublimation till locally enhanced by structural deformation of the ice. The location of the facies is coincident with a rise in the topography toward a plateau and the individual parts of the facies are developed in outward-facing depressions in this topography (Fig. 12B). The preferential development of the hummocky facies where the margin of the glacial deposit would interact with the background topography\nis typically where thrusting and fracturing of the protective debris cover occurs in terrestrial glaciers (e.g., Benn and Evans, 1998). This process results in exposure of the underlying ice, causing local preferential sublimation and leaving behind a sublimation till.\nThe marginal ridges (Fig. 13) occur at the distal and lateral portions of the lobes and thus are interpreted to be local terminal moraines. The distal ridges represent the furthest extent of glacier ice in each lobe. The segments of marginal ridges between individual lobes, especially lobes 4, 5, and 6 (Figs. 13C– 13E), are interpreted as lateral moraines. Superposed and crosscutting lateral moraines suggest multiple phases of ice advance and retreat (Figs. 13A, 13D, 13E). The unusual prominence of\nthese ridges is attributed to the stabilization of the glacier at this position for an extended period of time; in this case, forward advance of the ice continues to deliver debris to the margin, but sublimation maintains a balance with advance, resulting in the deposition of the debris in one location as a large marginal ridge.\nThe blocky facies lacks a close analog with terrestrial glacial deposits. Its association with inferred lava flows descending the flanks of Olympus Mons, however, lead us to conclude that it represents ice–lava interactions (e.g., Larsen, 2002). Normally, lava flows descending the flanks of Olympus Mons encounter the scarp and drape over it, build up lava aprons on the flanks\nand the flats below (see the lower part of region 3, Figs. 3 and 6). In lava flow-glacier scenario, however, lava flows from the upper slopes of Olympus Mons flow radially downslope and cross the escarpment, encountering glacial ice banked up\nagainst the escarpment. On the basis of known terrestrial experience (e.g., Larsen, 2002), some melting and interaction would take place and the flows would break up into smaller, linear segments (interpreted to represent segments of flow margins).\nSuch relationships are observed in Figs. 5 and 10. Flows descending the scarp appear to have done so in regions of lobate glacial deposits (note the shapes and terminal moraine deposits; Fig. 5), and undergone significant disruption in contrast to those in areas without lobate deposits (area in the southern part of Fig. 6). If this interpretation is correct, the blocky facies implies that in selected areas along the flanks of Olympus Mons, volcanic and glacial activity must have overlapped in time. The likely extended period of time in which lava flows have erupted on the flanks of Olympus suggests that glacial ice may have\nbeen present for geologically extended periods. Basilevsky et al. (2005) describe similar relationships, distinguishing type 1 slopes (steep scarps with no lava flows), type 2 slopes (less steep scarps with disrupted flows) and type 3 slopes (lowest slopes with lava aprons without significant disruption of the flows). They point out the existence of a micro-chaos texture that they attribute to melting of underlying glacial ice by superposed lava flows.\nDebris-covered glaciers or rock glaciers? As outlined above, differentiation of terrestrial debris-covered glaciers from rock\nglaciers in older deposits is often difficult due to the loss of subsurface ice with time. In the Olympus Mons lobes, the convex profile of many of the lobate deposits is suggestive of a large core of remaining ice, and hence is consistent with an origin as debris-covered glaciers. Furthermore, the huge scale of the Olympus Mons lobes argues against secondary ice-related rock glaciers. The low-lying terrain associated with the chaotic facies and the hummocky facies suggests considerable ice loss, more than that typically associated with pore ice and interspersed ice lenses of terrestrial rock glaciers. Furthermore, there is no positive evidence of channels in the source regions that might have been a source of supply of groundwater to form ice for any non-glacial (rock glacier) deposits. The lack of associated meltwater features indicates that the ice, whether of glacial origin or otherwise, failed to reach the basal pressure-melting point and that any near-surface ice remained frozen. On the basis of these numerous observations, we thus envision the following scenario for the emplacement of the lobes (Fig. 16): In Phase 1, snow and ice build up on the NW slope of the basal escarpment and are preferentially concentrated and preserved in alcoves. Mass wasting, thermal cycling and glacial-assisted debris eroded from the steep escarpment is deposited on top of the ice. In Phase 2 as ice deposits build up and reach a critical thickness, they begin to flow away from the escarpment and form a debris-covered glacier. Progressive concentration of\nrockfall and debris by sublimation of ice produces an increasingly thick cover of sublimation till with increasing distance from the source region. The glacier flows out away from the scarp, spreading onto the flat plains to develop the spatulate shape observed today (Fig. 3). Several periods of advance and retreat are recorded in multiple cross-cutting lateral moraines. At its furthest extent, each glacier deposited a large terminal moraine (Fig. 13). During Phase 3, at some times and places during these phases of advance and retreat, lava flows from the Olympus Mons upper flanks erupted, flowed down and covered portions of the basal escarpment and interacted with the ice collected there. In Phase 4, climatic conditions changed such that snow and ice were no longer accumulating, and the glacial deposits were subsequently degraded by the sublimation of internal ice and modification by aeolian erosion. In some regions debris seems sufficiently thick to protect a portion of underlying ice from sublimation (Fig. 7). Locally, sublimation of debris-rich ice likely produced the hummocky terrain at the distal margins of several lobes. The low-lying chaotic material at the head of individual lobes and at the base of the basal escarpment formed from sublimation of relatively clean (debris poor) ice in the accumulation zone. The open, curvilinear depressions at the base of the alcoves represent the remains of the very ice-rich accumulation zones. No evidence has been found for either groundwater contributions to the accumulation zones\nor for basal melting, strongly suggesting conditions of a thick cryosphere and cold-based glacial conditions. Basilevsky et al. (2005) have described evidence that ice and some small glaciers may have covered portions of flanks of Olympus Mons above the scarp, and that some ice may still be present, covered by sublimation till. This interpretation suggests that snow and ice accumulation may have been more widespread and not limited to the alcoves at the base of the scarp."

    "text": "In addition to the lobate deposits at the base of the scarp on the northwest flanks of Olympus Mons, Lucchitta (1981) also identified glacier-like features along the NW flanks of the nearby Tharsis Montes. Recent analysis of MOLA topography data confirms this result and concludes that cold-based glaciers once occupied the west–northwest flanks of Arsia Mons (Head and Marchant, 2003), Pavonis Mons (Shean et al., 2005), and Ascraeus Mons (Parsons and Head, 2004). The glacial features found around the Tharsis Montes are far more extensive than those at Olympus Mons; the Arsia Mons deposit covers ∼180,000 km2 (Head and Marchant, 2003), the Pavonis Mons deposit covers ∼75,000 km2 (Shean et al., 2005), and the Ascraeus Mons covers ∼14,000 km2 (Parsons and Head, 2004) compared to ∼15,000 km2 for the total Olympus Mons lobate deposits. Each of the fan shaped deposits on the Tharsis Montes contain three characteristic facies. From distal to proximal regions, these include a ridged facies, interpreted to be distal drop moraines resulting from lateral glacial advance and retreat; a knobby facies, interpreted to be sublimation till from vertical downwasting of the glaciers; and an interior smooth facies, characterized by broad lobes hundreds of meters thick with a series of concentric ridges tens of meters high on their surfaces, and interpreted to be debris-covered alpine-like glaciers. Collectively, these features are interpreted to be formed by coldbased glaciers that advanced westward out onto the surrounding plains of the Tharsis Montes, with the smooth facies comprised of debris-covered glaciers from the most recent phases of glaciation (Head and Marchant, 2003; Parsons and Head, 2004; Shean et al., 2005). Thus, the smooth facies at the Tharsis Montes is most analogous to the lobate deposits on Olympus Mons. Apparently, a greater quantity of ice was present during glacial periods at the Tharsis Montes than at Olympus Mons.\nThere is growing evidence for the existence of martian ice ages, periods when water ice moved away from the poles and towards the equator (e.g., Head et al., 2003). Models of volatile behavior at high obliquity have demonstrated that H2O ice is more stable toward the equator than at the poles (Jakosky and Carr, 1985; Mellon and Jakosky, 1993). Climate models including water vapor in the atmosphere and run at obliquities of 45◦, such as those by Richardson and Wilson (2002), indicate that H2O ice will sublimate from the polar caps and be transported towards the equatorial regions under these conditions. Geological evidence for ice-rich deposits at a range of latitudes around the planet (e.g., Milliken et al., 2003; Head et al., 2005) combined with the identification of a possible lag deposit within the polar layered deposits of the north cap (Milkovich\nand Head, 2005) support the hypothesis that ice has been transported from the polar regions to lower latitudes during periods of climate change in recent geological history. What are the ages of these deposits? Previous geological mapping studies assigned them to the Amazonian Period (Scott and Tanaka, 1986; Morris and Tanaka, 1994). Neukum et al. (2004) recently performed crater counts on Mars Express High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images of the lobate deposits and found a range of surface exposure ages for individual lobes. Major lobes date to 130–280 Ma while some lobes are 20–60 Ma (Neukum et al., 2004) and others may be as young as 4 Ma (e.g., Head et al., 2005). These data thus indicate a range of ages and strongly suggest several episodes of glacial deposit formation in recent (Late Amazonian) history, consistent with our interpretation of the morphological characteristics of the deposit and evidence for multiple, overlapping lobe formation.\nUnder what conditions might these deposits have formed? General circulation models under various orbital conditions on Mars indicate that at obliquities of ∼45◦, water is transported from the north pole to the equatorial regions and can be deposited there (e.g., Richardson and Wilson, 2002; Mischna et al., 2003; Levrard et al., 2004). Furthermore, Forget et al. (2005) have completed climate simulations with a numerical model designed to simulate the current water cycle, at an obliquity of 45◦, and they predict accumulation of water ice specifically on the northwest flanks of Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes. Recent analysis of martian obliquity implies that obliquity has exceeded 45◦ multiple times in the last 20 Myr and may have frequently done so in the last 250 Myr (Laskar et al., 2004). Therefore, climate and orbital parameter models and calculations predict that it is physically plausible to deposit snow and ice to form glacial features on the flanks of Olympus Mons episodically in the last several hundred million years."

    "heading": "5. Summary and conclusions",
    "text": "In summary, under current climatic conditions on Mars, significant water ice deposition is not favored on the surface in equatorial and mid-latitude regions. Several workers, however, have found evidence for glacial-like deposits at these latitudes, interpreted to represent previous climatic conditions in which the deposition and accumulation of ice were favored. We have used MGS and Odyssey data to characterize the extensive lobate deposits along the northwest flank of Olympus Mons at and adjacent to the bounding scarp as follows: (1) At least twelve individual lobes extend from the scarp base for distances ranging from 15 to 140 km and averaging ∼45 km, and have widths typically 10–30 km but up to ∼80 km. (2) These lobes form a deposit that extends along an arcuate segment of the western Olympus Mons scarp for over 340 km, from an azimuth of N 30◦ W to S 70◦ W from the summit caldera center, defining an angular segment of 80◦ centered on N 70◦ W, and covering an area of ∼15,000 km2. (3) The individual lobes typically consist of five facies and other associated features, including, from distal to proximal in relation to the scarp: (a) an outer bounding ridge; (b) a hummocky zone; (c) a series of arcuate ridges convex outward from the scarp and generally parallel\nto the lobe boundaries; (d) a chaotic terrain, usually within a topographic low, at the core of the lobe adjacent to the scarp; (e) an arcuate, theater-like alcove forming a portion of the major Olympus Mons scarp; (f) the scarp itself, which can consist of talus slopes (lower) and exposed layered outcrops (upper) in the scarp wall, or lobate flow-like features mantling the scarp to varying degrees; (g) a blocky unit characterized by oriented knobs that are arrayed in a linear, though radial pattern outward from the base of the scarp; and (h) the lip of the scarp, which has variable morphology including sharp-crested and gentle. (4) Topographic profiles show that these lobes are thin distally, thicken toward the base of the scarp, often have concave-downward profiles and depressions at the base of the scarp, and reach as much as 800–1200 m in thickness. The distal marginal ridges are typically less than 100 m in height, but can be up to 125 m. (5) Low thermal inertia and high albedo data suggest that the surfaces of these deposits are covered by fine-grained dust (e.g., Putzig et al., 2005). (6) Very high-resolution MOC images show that the deposits are currently undergoing aeolian modification and erosion. (7) Counts of superposed impact craters indicate that these deposits formed in the last 300 Myr, and that they may have been locally active in the last few million years (e.g., Neukum et al., 2004; Head et al., 2005). The lobate deposits give a range of ages, suggesting that they formed episodically over an extended period of time.\nWe considered several possible origins for these deposits: landslides, lava flows, pyroclastic flows and glaciers. Detailed assessment of each possible origin and comparison to terrestrial analogs reveals strong similarities to debris-covered piedmont glaciers on Earth. On the basis of the characteristics discussed above, we conclude that the lobate deposits were emplaced as debris-covered glaciers from snow and ice accumulating on the western margins of Olympus Mons. From distal to proximal facies, the outer ridge is interpreted to be a terminal moraine; the hummocky facies to be marginal ice-rich portions of the glacier that have undergone sublimation and collapse; the arcuate-ridge facies to be drift ridges typical of those that have formed over flowing ice; the chaotic facies as the collapsed core of glacier ice via sublimation; the talus cones represent mass wasting in recent times subsequent to the period of glacier formation. On the basis of the lack of meltwater-related and basal scour features, we interpret these deposits to be formed by cold-based glaciation. Superposed marginal ridges are interpreted as lateral moraines and suggest that there were several phases of advance and retreat as ice stability zones fluctuated with changing martian climate. Readvance of glaciers occurred in some places along the Olympus Mons escarpment and not in others, perhaps due to local microclimate conditions. Another possible explanation is that glacier advance occurred along the entire region of the basal escarpment but that some glaciers had insufficient debris cover to preserve the glacial record.\nTaken together, these characteristics suggest that during periods in the Late Amazonian, snow and ice accumulated in the vicinity of the western flanks of Olympus Mons, centered on alcoves in the marginal scarp, and flowed outward, downslope into adjacent terrains over distances as great as 140 km. These\nglaciers were debris-covered, primarily by talus eroded from the scarp outcrops and deposited on the accumulating ice, and transported distally to form a sublimation till. The proximal pitted terrain (chaotic facies) and related depressions are located at the base of the theaters in a region that plausibly corresponds to former accumulation zones. The present negative topography and morphology of this facies strongly suggest that sublimation has dominated over accumulation in the recent geological past and that ice, if present, is no longer active. Relationships along the upper parts of the scarp, the scarp itself, and the flanks of the volcano suggest that (1) ice and snow accumulated on the flanks of the volcano above the scarp in several places, stopping and diverting flank lava flows, (2) in some cases, lava flows extended over the margins and flowed over the glacial deposits, and (3) in some cases glacial/volcanic interactions may have formed significant edifice rim topography (e.g., Basilevsky et al., 2005).\nRecent general circulation models for conditions unlike today (obliquity at 45◦ and water vapor in the atmosphere) predict snow and ice accumulation at Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes (e.g., Forget et al., 2005). This is consistent with our interpretation that these deposits date from times earlier in the Amazonian when obliquity was higher, and polar ice was mobilized and redeposited in equatorial regions. Some small lobes near the base of the scarp have concentric structures and may be evidence for local debris-covered glaciers in more recent periods (Head et al., 2005). The thickness of the large lobate deposits strongly suggests that very ancient ice currently lies buried below the surface in these regions. Radar sounding instruments on Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may be able to detect such near-surface buried ice. The possible presence of similar ice-rich deposits on the flanks of Olympus Mons earlier in the Amazonian may have been a major factor in initiating the large-scale slope failures that formed the more extensive Olympus Mons aureole deposits."

  "abstractText": "We use Viking and new MGS and Odyssey data to characterize the lobate deposits superimposed on aureole deposits along the west and northwest flanks of Olympus Mons, Mars. These features have previously been interpreted variously as landslide, pyroclastic, lava flow or glacial features on the basis of Viking images. The advent of multiple high-resolution image and topography data sets from recent spacecraft missions allow us to revisit these features and assess their origins. On the basis of these new data, we interpret these features as glacial deposits and the remnants of cold-based debris-covered glaciers that underwent multiple episodes of advance and retreat, occasionally interacting with extrusive volcanism from higher on the slopes of Olympus Mons. We subdivide the deposits into fifteen distinctive lobes. Typical lobes begin at a theater-like alcove in the escarpment at the base of Olympus Mons, interpreted to be former ice-accumulation zones, and extend outward as a tongue-shaped or fan-shaped deposit. The surface of a typical lobe contains (moving outward from the basal escarpment): a chaotic facies of disorganized hillocks, interpreted as sublimation till in the accumulation zone; arcuate-ridged facies characterized by regular, subparallel ridges and interpreted as the ridges of surface debris formed by the flow of underlying ice; and marginal ridges interpreted as local terminal moraines. Several lobes also contain a hummocky facies toward their margins that is interpreted as a distinctive type of sublimation till shaped by structural dislocations and preferential loss of ice. Blocky units are found extending from the escarpment onto several lobes; these units are interpreted as evidence of lava–ice interaction and imply that ice was present at a time of eruptive volcanic activity higher on the slopes of Olympus Mons. Other than minor channel-like features in association with lava–ice interactions, we find no evidence for the flow of liquid water in association with these lobate features that might suggest: (1) near-surface groundwater as a source for ice in the alcoves in the lobe source region at the base of the scarp, or (2) basal melting and drainage emanating from the lobes that might indicate wet-based glacial conditions. Instead, the array of features is consistent with cold-based glacial processes. The glacial interpretations outlined here are consistent with recent geological evidence for lowlatitude ice-rich features at similar positions on the Tharsis Montes as well as with orbital dynamic and climate models indicating extensive snow and ice accumulation associated with episodes of increased obliquity during the Late Amazonian period of the history of Mars.  2005 Elsevier Inc.
