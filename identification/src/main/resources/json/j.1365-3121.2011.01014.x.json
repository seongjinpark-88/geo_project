    "text": "Tectonic unroofing during continental extension and breakup causes kilometres-scale rift-flank uplift along passive margins (Buck, 1988; Weissel and Karner, 1989). Although the resultant topography is countered by post-rift erosion and thermal subsidence (McKenzie, 1978; Watts, 2001), many passive margins display impressive ocean-facing escarpments that continue to control sediment routing and supply for tens of millions of years after rifting has ceased (e.g. Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Gilchrist et al., 1994; Gunnell and Fleitout, 1998; Lidmar-Bergström et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2009; Gabrielsen et al., 2010). The cause of either continuity or rejuvenation of such topography is not well understood, and consequently is hotly debated (e.g. Lidmar-Bergström and Bonow, 2009; Moore et al., 2009; Nielsen et al., 2009, 2010; Gabrielsen et al., 2010). As the geological processes behind the long-term evolution of a passive margin are fundamental to the evolution of hydrocarbon-bearing basins as well as to landscape evolution and geohazards, they may be of significant importance to society. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain post-rift uplift in the circum-Atlantic region (e.g. Faleide et al., 2002). However, no current model is completely satisfactory. For example, it is difficult to link the 1 km of Neogene uplift in Norway proposed by Riis and Fjeldskaar (1992) to the thermal effects of breakup at c. 54 Ma. Likewise, Neogene glacial erosion cannot explain the proposed Palaeogene uplift in the circum-North Atlantic region, nor can it explain present-day escarpments at non-glaciated margins such as those of Namibia or Brazil. Numerical models of mantle-related topography under areas such asGreenland, Scandinavia, Brazil or southern Africa (e.g. Steinberger, 2007) tend to produce long-wavelength, low-amplitude and morphologically symmetric uplifts that peak in the continental interior. Nevertheless, the heights of the asymmetric escarpments that run along the coasts of these margins can approach or even surpass 2 km. Although it is likely that external processes add their topographic signature to passive margins, the globally widespread distribution of post-rift escarpments indicates that they rely on a primary control rooted in the processes related to rifting and breakup. One such fundamental process is crustal thinning. In this contribution, we review data\nand recent observations from offshore and onshore the Norwegian margin and a compilation of published geoseismic cross-sections from other passive margins to demonstrate empirically that a robust control on escarpment topography is associated with the location of the first highly thinned crust in the distal margin. We\nfirst review some recent concepts for crustal thinning at passive margins."

    "text": "Recent publications have introduced new perspectives to our knowledge of crustal thinning at passive margins, and as a result, a new conceptual framework has emerged (e.g. Manatschal et al., 2001; Peréz-Gussinyé and Reston, 2001; Manatschal, 2004; Reston et al., 2004; Reston, 2009; PéronPinvidic and Manatschal, 2009). These works show that many passive margins can be divided into proximal and distal domains, where parts of the latter are characterized by continental crust thinned to <10 km (e.g. Reston, 2009; Péron-Pinvidic and Manatschal, 2009). For a number of margins, it is now well demonstrated that crustal thinning in their distal parts was facilitated by low-angle normal faults with displacements in the order of tens of kilometres (e.g. Boillot et al., 1987; Reston et al., 1995, 2004; Manatschal et al., 2001; Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Thinon et al., 2003; Reston, 2005; Tucholke et al., 2007; Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008; Péron-Pinvidic and Manatschal, 2009). These faults became directly responsible for the exhumation of serpentinized mantle rocks to the seafloor outboard of the most highly extended continental crust (e.g. Boillot et al., 1987; Manatschal et al., 2001; Peréz-Gussinyé and Reston, 2001; Manatschal, 2004). For such complete excision to\nThe long-term evolution of kilometre(s) high, seaward-facing escarpments at passive margins is linked directly to the crustal thinning gradient. The development of ‘post-rift’ faults in the onshore parts of the margin and the associated distribution of drainage patterns, landscape types and sediment dispersal patterns reflect this linkage. For the seismically well-imaged Norwegian margin as well as for a number of passive margins worldwide, we identify a scaling relationship that correlates escarpment height with the distance to the highly extended distal margin or, more specifically, the taper break. The highest escarpments and the most asymmetric margin topography are found inboard of sharply tapering crystalline crust, independent of margin age. Conversely, escarpments are lower where the taper is gentle. Thus, the topography of passive margins does not primarily reflect age, magmatism, climate or mantle convection, but more probably the response to loading of the laterally variable, fault-controlled architecture of the crystalline crust.

E-mail: per.osmundsen@ngu.no\n2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 349\noccur, normal faults must cut the entire crust. On the Iberian margin, this became possible only when the crust had already been made brittle throughout by an earlier reduction to a thickness of 10 km or less. Thus, previous thinning is required to have first reduced the continental crust from its normal pre-extensional thickness (Péron-Pinvidic and Manatschal, 2009; Mohn et al., 2010). The necking zone at a passive margin has been defined as the area where the crust tapers off from a thickness of 30 km to <10 km thickness (Péron-Pinvidic and Manatschal, 2009; Mohn et al., 2010). Recently, it has been shown that large-magnitude normal faults play an important role also in the formation of the necking zone, and that the hyper-extension style of deformation is not exclusive to so-called magmapoor margins, but has occurred along magmatic margin segments as well (Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008; Lundin and Doré, 2011).\nThe passive margin offshore Norway\nBased on seismic reflection, refraction ⁄OBS and potential field data, it has been shown that the fundamental structure of the Norwegian extended margin changes significantly along strike from south to north, and that the Møre and Vøring sectors display very different crustal thinning gradients (e.g. Mjelde et al., 2005; Ebbing et al., 2006; Faleide et al., 2008; Figs 1 and 2). Changes in the thickness of the crystalline crust relate mainly to differences in pre-breakup thinning and, in particular, to the distribution and displacement magnitude of very large normal faults (Osmundsen et al., 2002; Goméz et al., 2004; Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008). The crustal taper is sharp in the Møre margin area, where up to 200 km of highly extended crust under the Møre Basin is separated from the unrifted continent by a narrow necking zone. The necking zone is defined by an extensional detachment complex that thinned the crust from 30 km down to <10 km over a horizontal distance of <100 km in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (Fig. 2; Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008). In contrast, the taper is relatively gentle\ninboard of the Vøring Basin, where highly extended crust under the basin is separated from the continent by moderately thinned, up to 200 km wide platform and terrace areas. Large-magnitude normal faults and flexures separate western and northern edges of the Trøndelag Platform from the Halten Terrace and from the deep Cretaceous basins farther offshore (Blystad et al., 1995; Brekke, 2000; Osmundsen et al., 2002). The depths of flanking Cretaceous basins are comparable to those in the Møre Basin (10–15 km; Ebbing et al., 2006). North of the Trøndelag Platform, in the Lofoten–Vesterålen (Lof) and Troms (Lyn) areas, the taper of the crystalline crust once again becomes relatively sharp. In the case of Lofoten, the extension is distributed over 3–4 large normal faults of pre-Cretaceous and Early Cretaceous age (Blystad et al., 1995; Tsikalas et al., 2005; Bergh et al., 2007). We propose that after PermianTriassic rifting, the most important variations in crustal structure were determined by the large-magnitude Jurassic-Cretaceous faults, which reached displacement values in the order of 20–30 km. The location of, and interference pattern between these structures determined the position of\n350 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nthe necking zone with respect to the relatively undeformed continent, the position of the most distinct crustal thickness minima and the location of post-rotational sag basins (i.e. the Møre and Vøring basins) that began developing after the main phase of Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous crustal thinning, but prior to magmatic breakup in the Eocene. Closer to the line of breakup, a Late Cretaceous– Palaeogene phase of crustal thinning affected areas that were already very severely thinned, such as the Gjallar Ridge (Blystad et al., 1995; Ren et al., 1998; Gernigon et al., 2006). In the Skagerrak Sea area south of Norway, the Triassic and Jurassic strata are warped, eroded and overlain unconformably by the Middle Cretaceous Chalk Group, consistent with uplift and south-eastwards rotation of that part of Scandinavia in the Late Jurassic– Early Cretaceous (e.g. Gabrielsen et al., 2010). Offshore western Norway, clastic wedges of Late Jurassic age were sourced in the Norwegian mainland and deposited outboard of present-day fjords, supporting the view that mainland Norway was being uplifted at this time (Gabrielsen et al., 2010). The turbidites of the Danian– Maastrichtian Ormen Lange Fan of the Møre Basin requires substantial onshore topography in the drainage area (see Sømme et al., 2009). Some components of uplift clearly occurred during the Cenozoic (Riis and Fjeldskaar, 1992; Riis, 1996; Lidmar-Bergström et al., 2000; Gabrielsen et al., 2010). Offshore along the Norwegian coast, a hinge zone is defined by warped Mesozoic and Cenozoic strata consistent with postOligocene uplift (e.g. Faleide et al., 2002; Gabrielsen et al., 2010). Offshore evidence includes clastic influx of sediments into the Møre Basin in the Palaeogene (e.g. Faleide et al., 2002) and in the Norwegian–Danish Basin in the Oligocene (Rasmussen, 2009). The Molo Formation, a prograding deltaic unit of Late Miocene– Early Pliocene age has been taken as evidence for uplift of the mainland during Neogene time (e.g. Eidvin et al., 2007). Later Neogene glaciacions are represented offshore by the Late Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary wedge (e.g. Ottesen et al., 2009)."

    "text": "In Norway, the highest, most deeply incised, most alpine and most asymmetric onshore topography occurs in the Møre, Lofoten–Vesterålen and Troms areas (Figs 1 and 3; e.g. Etzelmüller et al., 2007; Osmundsen et al., 2010), directly inboard of the most sharply tapering segments of the passive margin. Conversely, inboard of the more gently tapering crystalline crust of the Trøndelag Platform (Figs 1 and 3), the onshore\n2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 351\ntopography is lower, exhibits a reduced escarpment and is less asymmetric. Thus, a first-order correlation between the crustal taper and the height and shape of the onshore escarpment is evident. A corresponding correlation is observed between taper and the distribution of relict surfaces, drainage patterns and major reactivated faults (Osmundsen et al., 2010). Palaeosurfaces are widely preserved in Scandinavia east of the watershed, where they partly define the gently eastto south-east sloping topography (e.g. Lidmar-Bergström et al., 2000, 2007). Their westwards fanning pattern has been interpreted in terms of erosional\nbevelling punctuated by episodes of uplift (Lidmar-Bergström et al., 2007). Their ages of formation have been the matter of much debate (e.g. Riis, 1996; Lidmar-Bergström et al., 2000, 2007; Japsen et al., 2006; Lidmar-Bergström and Bonow, 2009; Nielsen et al., 2009, 2010; Gabrielsen et al., 2010), but the oldest ones are constrained by apatite fission-track (AFT) data (Norway) and fossil material (Finland) to have formed between the Late Jurassic and the Eocene (Rohrman et al., 1995; Ebert, 2009). Late Jurassic AFT ages are widespread at sea level in coastal Norway, indicating 2–3 km of denudation since 150–160 Ma (Rohrman et al., 1995; Hendriks et al., 2007). Fission-track age minima of 110 Ma or less mainly occur inboard of sharp crustal tapers in the Møre and Lofoten–Vesterålen areas. Herein, sea-level AFT (2r) age-jumps in combination with structural data also provide evidence for kilometre-scale, Late or postCretaceous reactivation of faults (Redfield et al., 2004; Hendriks et al., 2007, 2010; Leighton, 2007; Osmundsen et al., 2010). Normal-sense reactivation appears to have occurred after c. 100 Ma along the Møre-Trøndelag Fault Complex (MTFC; Redfield et al., 2004, 2005a,b), and at or later than 81 ± 7 and 72 ± 5 Ma along basin-bounding normal faults in Lofoten and Vesterålen respectively (Hendriks et al., 2010). Normal-sense reactivation is supported by structural work carried out along the tectonic lineaments that bound high-relief, linear alpine ranges in Møre, Lofoten– Vesterålen and Lyngen areas (Bering, 1992; Redfield et al., 2005a,b; Redfield and Osmundsen, 2009; Osmundsen et al., 2010). These alpine ranges most probably evolved, as glacial erosion was allowed to exploit the pre-glacial footwall drainage patterns (Osmundsen et al., 2010). In Lofoten, relict surfaces that occur at a height of a few hundred metres appear to have been tilted towards the south-east, in a manner consistent with uplift and rotation of the footwall of the West Lofoten Border Fault (Fig. 4; see Bergh et al., 2007, 2008; Hendriks et al., 2010; Osmundsen et al., 2010). In addition to the kilometre-scale normal faults, a set of small-scale, recent stress-release reverse faults were observed in roadcuts in Mid Norway by Roberts and Myrvang (2004).\n352 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nQuantifying the influence of crustal architecture on topography\nThe consistent correlation between crustal taper, topography and geomorphology along a margin whose breakup occurred everywhere at c. 54 Ma suggests that the variation in crustal taper exerts a long-term control on both the tectonic and geomorphic evolution of the hinterland. To test how much control the taper exerts over passive margin topography on a more general level, we have defined some benchmark locations in the generalized margin architecture that can be readily identified and used to quantify aspects of taper and topography. We next apply this approach, first to the Norwegian margin, and then to a set of other passive margins distributed across the globe. One obvious benchmark is the generalized location of the ContinentOcean boundary (COB), which defines the continental margin per se. Davis and Kusznir (2002) noted a spatial relationship between crustal thinning factors and distance to the COB. However, the relationship observed between the height of the escarpment and the distance from the escarpment to the COB is inconclusive (see Fig. S3 in Supporting Information). Uncertainties commonly associated with locating the COB and the statistical limitations to our dataset may have precluded a more conclusive resolution. In light of both recent models for passive margins and the empirical relationship observed along the Norwegian coast (Fig. 1), another benchmark point appears as equally or more important than the COB in the present context. This is the taper\nbreak , defined here as the point nearest the coast where the crustal thickness is reduced to 10 km or less (Fig. 5a,b). Conceptually as well as in the well-imaged Norwegian example, the taper break is located close to the hangingwall cutoff for the first fault-block in the distal margin. At margins with an even taper, the taper break is placed at the 10 km mark (Fig. 1c). An inflection point in the basinward-shallowing Moho may also be commonly located at or in close vicinity of the taper break. Thus, the distance between crust of normal thickness and the taper break (the taper length) relates to the width of the necking zone and to the mean taper angle for the crystalline crust in the area, where it is thinning from normal down to <10 km. A measure of the taper length would require that we could confidently measure the distance from the taper break to the first occurrence of crust of normal pre-rift crustal thickness under the continent. However, the taper length is generally not directly recoverable. Global data such as the CRUST2 model (Bassin et al., 2000) are of too coarse resolution to accurately identify the transition to unrifted crust. The mean thickness of emergent and non-orogenic continental crust in the CRUST2 model is about 38 km, and thus the 30-km crustal thickness resolved at the landward end of a number of deep seismic transects should probably not be used as a proxy for unrifted crustal thickness, as it would underestimate the taper length. This is well illustrated by our two best-constrained transects from Norway (i.e. the transects with the best definition of the subcontinental Moho, see Figs 2 and 3). As the true taper length can only rarely be measured with confidence, we are obliged to use another, more measurable entity as a substitute for the taper length when extending our concept to a global dataset. The maximum topographic elevation encountered at the passivemargin escarpment (defined here as the highest peak within a 20 km radius moving window swath) does not necessarily overlie the point where the crust regains normal thickness. In the two best-constrained sections of Fig. 3, the highest point on the topographic escarpment lies close to and directly outboard of the thickest crust. Such\n2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 353\npositioning may not be coincidental; although rift-related escarpments can be replaced by erosional escarpments within a few million years (Gilchrist et al., 1994), Matmon et al. (2002) concluded that the positions of the new escarpments are controlled primarily by deeply rooted crustal structures. Our empirical observations from the Norwegian margin (Figs 3 and 6) suggest that the location of the highest point of the escarpment relative to the taper break holds an important tectonic significance. The relationship in Fig. 6 invites comparison with other passive margins. In the following, we test the above relationship on a global dataset. We also assess the relative effects of other parameters frequently invoked in models for margin uplift, such as breakup age, magmatic character, glacial history and computed mantleinduced uplift. A simple test of taper and topography We have spliced 40 published, depthconverted cross-sections (including those from Norway) through the offshore parts of passive margins with onshore topographic data to build a dataset from which the apparent taper length and escarpment elevation can be measured directly. Our ability to measure correctly and confidently relies on the quality of the data and on the previous interpretations used in our compilation. Also, measured distances sometimes become a question of definition. We have compiled our measured sections in Section 2 of the Supporting Information that accompanies this article. In Fig. 7, we have plotted escarpment elevation against apparent taper length for the entire dataset. We\n354 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\nconclude that the relationship between apparent taper length and topography is a global phenomenon: the highest maximum elevations are found for margins with short apparent taper lengths. Conversely, where the apparent taper length is longer, the maximum elevation of the onshore escarpment is less. The implication, in our view, is that the ratio between apparent taper length and escarpment height reflects a fundamental relationship between (syn-rift) crustal thinning and (post-rift) escarpment evolution. Active rifts or margins that are very young (e.g. the Red Sea ⁄Afar escarpments of Fig. 8 and the Transantarctic Mountain rift shoulder) display the greatest maximum elevations. Morocco, the margin with the oldest age of breakup (175–190 Ma), exhibits a very low maximum elevation. Thus, at first glance, an agefunction that describes a slow decay\nof syn-rift topography appears relevant. Between these end-members, old margins such as that of Namibia (breakup at c. 127 Ma) present highrelief, high-elevation escarpments, whereas the much younger Southern Australia margin (breakup at c. 85 Ma) escarpment is as low or lower than that of Morocco (Fig. 7). Also, where the age of breakup is constant, wide ranges in escarpment elevation exist. For instance, both the Norwegian and East Greenland margins display great along-strike topographic variation, which in the case of Norway correlates directly with the sharpness of the crustal taper. Other conjugate margins clearly show strongly contrasting topography, such as those of South Africa ⁄Namibia (high escarpment, short taper) and Argentina (no escarpment, very gentle taper). Thus, the long-term topographic evolution of passive margins does not appear to be dominated by a simple age of breakup function (Figs 7, S3 and S6). Our sections include old and young, glaciated, non-glaciated, magmatic and non-magmatic margins, over regions of both high and low mantle velocities (Figs S6–S12). When published data are considered, elevation appears to correlate better with the crustal taper than with any of the abovementioned properties. The only truly global relationship revealed by our test appears to be that between escarpment elevation and apparent taper length."

    "text": "We have identified a global relationship that links the height of a passive margin escarpment to its offshore structural architecture via the location of the taper break. As we cannot confidently identify the innermost limit of extended crust for many margin segments, the relative importance of the true crustal thinning gradient upon escarpment elevation cannot be entirely resolved in this contribution. However, the observed relationship between escarpment elevation and apparent taper length must be to a large degree associated with the seawards tapering of crystalline crust, as the apparent taper length in all our examples covers the region where the crust is thinned from 30 to\n2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 355\n356 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd\n<10 km. In our view, this correlation suggests that a commonality of process applies to all passive margins with respect to the creation, maintenance or rejuvenation of topography in the post-rift phase. Although crustal taper forms progressively as the crust is thinned during rifting, it is probably the large-magnitude detachment faults that form during the margin s thinning phase that are the most fundamental agents in the reduction of thickness of the crystalline crust (e.g. Lavier and Manatschal, 2006; Manatschal et al., 2007;Mohn et al., 2010). Their three-dimensional arrangement therefore probably controls the lateral variations in crustal thinning gradient as well as the location of the taper break along the resultant passive margin. In Scandinavia, copious data document fundamental differences between how the onshore portions of the margin evolved (Redfield et al., 2004, 2005a,b; Osmundsen et al., 2009, Redfield and Osmundsen, 2009; Hendriks et al., 2010; Osmundsen et al., 2010). Normal faulting or normal-sense reactivation of pre-existing faults appears to have occurred in the Latest Cretaceous or Cenozoic inboard of the most sharply tapering crystalline crust (see Redfield et al., 2005a,b; Hendriks et al., 2010). Numerical modelling appears to support the role of inherited structures, such as the MTFC, as major stress boundaries in the postrift deformation of the margin (Pascal and Gabrielsen, 2001). Cenozoic compressional deformation is observed offshore passive margins such as that of Norway and Iberia (Løseth and Henriksen, 2005; Péron-Pinvidic et al., 2008; Doré et al., 2008) as well as in some roadcuts onshore Norway (Roberts and Myrvang, 2004; Pascal et al., 2006). These compressive structures represent very small strain magnitudes and appear out of phase with the processes responsible for kilometre-scale normal-sense fault reactivation. Onshore normal faulting in the post-rift phase is not solely a Norwegian phenomenon. In western Greenland, normal faults displaced and rotated an uplifted, relict surface incised into Palaeogene volcanic and sedimentary rocks, inboard of an area characterized by a sharp crustal thinning gradient (Japsen et al., 2006). In Brazil, Palaeogene and Neogene sedimentation has taken place along faults that strike parallel to the south Brazilian escarpment and to the Brazilian margin, and that have a pronounced topographic expression at present day (Zalán and Oliveira, 2005). Viola et al. (2005) described normal faults from the south-western African escarpment. Although the AFT age-jumps across these African faults were not large enough to document post-rift fault activity, Viola et al. (2005) interpreted from general geological relationships that Mesozoic–Cenozoic and neotectonic activity was responsible for the observed margin-parallel faulting. We suggest that the association of sharp taper, out of sequence normal faulting, resultant topographic and landscape contrasts and, in some cases, faultbounded basin formation, is underexplored on several margins. Perhaps surprisingly, it appears from the Norwegian and Brazilian examples that although fault activity migrates seawards during formation of a passive margin (e.g. Péron-Pinvidic et al., 2007), it migrates inboard in the post-rift phase, restricted mainly to the areas of uplift, inboard of where the crustal taper is sharp. The observation that maximum escarpment elevations follow a simple function related to crustal thickness gradients, independent of breakup age, magmatism, glaciations or modelled mantle effects suggests that crustal and lithospheric factors dominate the evolution of an extended margin throughout the remainder of its Wilson Cycle. Processes such as erosion and deposition, relative buoyancy and upwarping commensurate with the flexural rigidity of the margin segment probably constitute the principle parameters that govern the development and evolution of the topography, structure and geomorphology of a margin segment. The observed elevation limit of 3.5– 4.5 km approached by the young, essentially syn-rift Ethiopian escarpment and the Royal Society range of the Transantarctic mountains follows directly. As unstretched, normal continental crust can only be unloaded so much, the amount of upwarping that is possible must also be limited. Numerical models invoking an elastic thin plate with minimal coupling between the continent and the margin (Stüwe, 1991; Gunnell and Fleitout, 1998) have successfully simulated the geometry of rift-flank uplift, maintenance of post-rift topography, step-like escarpment shapes and their propagation. This situation is probably best approximated by margin segments with short distances from normal crust to the taper break and a penetratively faulted, mechanically weakened distal margin – in other words, sharp tapers. As a significant part of the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere is determined by the brittle layer of the crust, brittle faulting will have an important impact on the ability of the lithosphere to support imposed loads or to bend. It follows that the taper break, which is located at the boundary between two domains of very different mechanical properties, must be an important boundary also with respect to flexural rigidity. As faulted crust is weaker than undeformed crust (e.g. Buck, 1988; Watts, 2001), the necking zone must represent the transition from rigid, less faulted strong crust to crust that is highly thinned, entirely broken by faults and thus very weak. Such relations may be transient, and admittedly, it is not obvious that reduction in crustal strength is matched by a corresponding reduction in lithospheric strength. Indeed, previous models have argued that extended lithosphere becomes stronger after rifting and thermal relaxation, thereby explaining the common observation of seaward fault migration on passive margins (e.g. Ziegler and Cloething, 2004). However, the rheological structure of the lithosphere is currently under debate (e.g. Jackson, 2002). Some recent observation-based works have argued that the most highly extended areas of the margins must remain weak for a long time to explain, for instance, concentration of much younger compressional structures over areas with exhumed or nearly exhumed mantle (e.g. Péron-Pinvidic et al., 2008; Lundin and Doré, 2011). Crustal thinning gradients control gradients in thermal subsidence and thus the location of post-rift depocentres. Footwall uplift will be largest in the area adjacent to the faults that facilitate the largest amount of\n2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd 357\ntectonic unroofing (e.g. Kusznir and Egan, 1990), and coincides with the areas that undergo the deepest erosion after rifting has ceased. Taper and load effects may therefore represent a positive feedback mechanism on many passive margins, consistent with repeated uplift in the areas that were most uplifted in the syn-rift phase, and consistent with repeated or longlasting sediment input from the same catchment systems. For instance, some of the fjords in western Norway represent areas of repeated input of sediments to the North Sea basin from the Jurassic onwards (e.g. Gabrielsen et al., 2010). After the main phase of crustal thinning, processes such as breakuprelated underplating may theoretically modify the taper by adding crustal material to the section. In Fig. S13 and Table S1, we show the effect of including high-velocity bodies, commonly interpreted as underplate, in the crustal section when defining the taper break. The effect does not appear as significant on our global taper vs. elevation curve."

    "text": "We conclude that the topographic fate of a passive margin is determined by the end of the rift phase, and that this is directly related to the pattern of large-magnitude extensional faults that created the crustal taper and decided the location of the taper break. Crustal taper and its attendant strength gradient (essentially, the location of the associated taper break) exercise the most fundamental and long-lasting controls over escarpment topography and on the asymmetric character of the onshore parts of the rifted margin. Taper and load effects may comprise a positive feedback on many passive margins, consistent with repeated exhumation in the areas that were most uplifted in the syn-rift phase, and also consistent with repeated or long-lasting sediment input from the same catchment systems. Although thermal effects and climatic changes may affect rates and magnitude of uplift, the shape and localization of uplift appears to be pre-determined and, in some areas, affected by post-rift normal faults. For passive margins in general, the implications with respect to drainage\nevolution and landscape formation, and the associated erosion, transport and deposition of sediments are profound.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the Geological Survey of Norway for financial support and Susanne Buiter, Jörg Ebbing, Bart Hendriks and Erik Lundin for stimulating discussions.

  "abstractText": "Tectonic unroofing during continental extension and breakup causes kilometres-scale rift-flank uplift along passive margins (Buck, 1988; Weissel and Karner, 1989). Although the resultant topography is countered by post-rift erosion and thermal subsidence (McKenzie, 1978; Watts, 2001), many passive margins display impressive ocean-facing escarpments that continue to control sediment routing and supply for tens of millions of years after rifting has ceased (e.g. Gilchrist and Summerfield, 1990; Gilchrist et al., 1994; Gunnell and Fleitout, 1998; Lidmar-Bergström et al., 2000; Moore et al., 2009; Gabrielsen et al., 2010). The cause of either continuity or rejuvenation of such topography is not well understood, and consequently is hotly debated (e.g. Lidmar-Bergström and Bonow, 2009; Moore et al., 2009; Nielsen et al., 2009, 2010; Gabrielsen et al., 2010). As the geological processes behind the long-term evolution of a passive margin are fundamental to the evolution of hydrocarbon-bearing basins as well as to landscape evolution and geohazards, they may be of significant importance to society. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain post-rift uplift in the circum-Atlantic region (e.g. Faleide et al., 2002). However, no current model is completely satisfactory. For example, it is difficult to link the 1 km of Neogene uplift in Norway proposed by Riis and Fjeldskaar (1992) to the thermal effects of breakup at c. 54 Ma. Likewise, Neogene glacial erosion cannot explain the proposed Palaeogene uplift in the circum-North Atlantic region, nor can it explain present-day escarpments at non-glaciated margins such as those of Namibia or Brazil. Numerical models of mantle-related topography under areas such asGreenland, Scandinavia, Brazil or southern Africa (e.g. Steinberger, 2007) tend to produce long-wavelength, low-amplitude and morphologically symmetric uplifts that peak in the continental interior. Nevertheless, the heights of the asymmetric escarpments that run along the coasts of these margins can approach or even surpass 2 km. Although it is likely that external processes add their topographic signature to passive margins, the globally widespread distribution of post-rift escarpments indicates that they rely on a primary control rooted in the processes related to rifting and breakup. One such fundamental process is crustal thinning. In this contribution, we review data and recent observations from offshore and onshore the Norwegian margin and a compilation of published geoseismic cross-sections from other passive margins to demonstrate empirically that a robust control on escarpment topography is associated with the location of the first highly thinned crust in the distal margin. We first review some recent concepts for crustal thinning at passive margins.",
