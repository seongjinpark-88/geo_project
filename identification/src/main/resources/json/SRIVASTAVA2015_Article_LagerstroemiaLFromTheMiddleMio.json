    "text": "Lagerstroemia L. from the middle Miocene Siwalik deposits, northern India: Implication for Cenozoic range shifts of the genus and the family Lythraceae\nGaurav Srivastava1,∗, Rajan Gaur2 and R C Mehrotra1\n1Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, 53 University Road, Lucknow 226 007, India. 2Department of Anthropology, Panjab University, Chandigarh 160 014, India.\n∗Corresponding author. e-mail: gaurav jan10@yahoo.co.in\nFossil leaves of Lagerstroemia (Lythraceae) are described from the Siwalik deposits (middle Miocene) of Kathgodam, Uttarakhand, India. The fossil records of the Lythraceae indicate its worldwide distribution in the Cenozoic. The family had its widest distribution during the Miocene but became less widespread during the Pliocene, followed by range expansion during the Quaternary. The present leaf fossil, along with the previous fossil records of Lagerstroemia, indicates that the genus followed the same pattern of expansion and retraction as the entire family Lythraceae suggesting that both the genus and the family adapted in similar ways. The fossil plant assemblage from the Lower Siwalik deposits indicates warm and humid climate with plenty of rainfall in the region during the depositional period."

    "text": "The family Lythraceae consists of ∼31 genera and 600 species distributed mainly in tropical and subtropical areas of the Old World (18 genera) and NewWorld (13 genera) (figure 1), and includes four small, previously independent families, i.e., Duabangaceae, Punicaceae, Sonneratiaceae, and Trapaceae (Graham et al. 2005). The Lythraceae has been placed in the order Myrtales with closely allied family Onagraceae based on the morphological, anatomical, embryological, and molecular studies (Dahlgren and Thorne 1984; Johnson and Briggs 1984; Conti et al. 1997; Sytsma et al. 2004). On the basis of molecular data it was suggested that the Lythraceae diverged from the Onagraceae at 93 Ma, i.e., in the early Late Cretaceous (Sytsma et al. 2004); however, the oldest fossil records of the family (pollen grains) are from the early Campanian (81–82 Ma) of Wyoming,USA (Grimsson et al. 2011). Lagerstroemia (crape myrtle) is a genus of ∼53– 56 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs native to the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, northern Australia, and parts of Oceania (figure 1) (Mabberley 1997; Graham 2013). The genus mainly grows in lowland swamps and montane and secondary forests (Graham 2013). Lagerstroemia, along with other taxa such as Sonneratia L.f., Duabanga Buch.-Ham. and Trapa L. form a subclade of one of the two major clades of the family Lythraceae (Graham et al. 2005; Morris 2007). The genus is economically very important as it is used as timber, fuel, and fodder and is also used in making drugs for diabetes (Judy et al. 2003). In the present communication a new fossil leaf of Lagerstroemia is described from the Siwalik sediments of northern India (figure 2). The evolutionary history, expansion, and phytogeography of the genus and its family in the geological context are also discussed.\nKeywords.

    "text": "For better understanding of the floristics and palaeoclimate of Kathgodam Siwalik, an excursion was undertaken by one of us (RG), who collected a few fossil leaves from the yellowish grey mudstone exposed along the Gola River near Kathgodam, Nainital District of Uttarakhand (figure 2). The geology of the area has been given by Middlemiss (1890), Heim and Gansser (1939), Tiwari and Mehdi (1964), Fuchs and Sinha (1974) and Ranga Rao et al. (1979). According to them, the Siwaliks are exposed in this area all along the main boundary thrust in the southwest and are overridden by the Krol Group rocks (Fuchs and Sinha 1974). The Siwalik beds in the aforesaid area are found running in a northeast direction (figure 3). The area is characterized by the middle Miocene Lower Siwalik deposits (Ranga Rao et al. 1979). These deposits are made up of alternating layers of medium-grained sandstones and mudstones and an age between 10.8 and 18.3 Ma was assigned to them on the basis of palaeomagnetic investigations in the Pakistan Siwalik (Gaur 1987). According to Tandon (1976), the Lower Siwalik of Kumaon Himalaya probably indicates a fluviatile and deltaic environment. After cleaning the surface of the leaves, the fossils were photographed under low angled sunlight using a 10 megapixel digital camera (Canon SX 110). The terminology used in describing the fossil leaf is based on Hickey (1973), Dilcher (1974) and\nEllis et al. (2009). The leaf fossils were identified at the Central National Herbarium (CNH), Howrah, the Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun, and the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow after comparing them with herbarium material of the extant plants. The fossil specimens are deposited in the museum of the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow. The accepted fossil records of Lythraceae and Lagerstroemia as provided by Graham (2013) are discussed in view of the new fossil."

    "text": "Family: Lythraceae J. St.-Hil. Genus: Lagerstroemia L. Species: Lagerstroemia himalayaensis, Srivastava, Gaur et Mehrotra, sp. nov. (figure 4A, B, D, E) Holotype: Specimen no. BSIP 40116. Paratype: Specimen no. BSIP 40117. Horizon: Lower Siwalik. Locality: Gola River near Kathgodam, Nainital District of Uttarakhand. Age: Middle Miocene. Material: Two well preserved specimens. Etymology: After the Himalaya.\nDescription: Leaf simple, symmetrical, mesophyll, elliptic to narrow elliptic; preserved lamina length and width 6.1 × 3.1 cm and 7 × 3 cm; apex acuminate with round tip; base acute; margin entire, slightly wavy; texture supposedly chartaceous; petiole not preserved; venation pinnate, eucamptodromous to brochidodromous; primary vein stout, almost straight; nine pairs of secondary veins, 0.5–0.9 cm apart, predominantly alternate, angle of divergence moderate to wide acute (49◦– 69◦), uniformly curved and running parallel to each other up to the margin, sometimes turning sharply upwards near the margin to form loops with the adjacent secondaries at the upper part of lamina, moderately thick; intersecondary veins present, 1 or 2 in number; tertiary veins percurrent, simple, rarely forked, recurved, oblique in relation to midvein, angle of origin predominantly acute-obtuse (AO); marginal ultimate venation looped.\nAffinities: The characteristic features of the fossil leaves, specifically the elliptic to narrow elliptic shape, eucamptodromous to brochidodromous venation, moderate to wide acute angle of divergence of secondary veins, percurrent and recurved oblique tertiary veins suggest their close affinity with Lagerstroemia of the family Lythraceae. A large number of taxa of many tropical and subtropical families like Anacardiaceae, Annonaceae,\nCombretaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, Polygalaceae, Phyllanthaceae, Rutaceae, Sapindaceae, Sapotaceae, and Simaroubaceae were studied and compared with the present fossil. Anacardium occidentale, Parishia maingayi, and Taxicodandron acuminatum of the Anacardiaceae, Alphonsea lutea, Oxymitra fornicata of the Annonaceae, Combretum decandrum, Illigera khasiana, Terminalia chebula of the Combretaceae, Hancea penangensis of the Euphorbiaceae, and Artocarpus integrifolia and Ficus pumila of the Moraceae show most resemblance but the presence of character combinations such as an attenuate apex, eucamptodromous venation and reticulate tertiaries differentiates the fossil. Pimenta dioica of the Myrtaceae has obtuse base and brochidodromous venation while in Psidium guineense secondary veins are moderately acute and the venation is eucamptodromous, which distinguishes them from the present fossil.\nVarious taxa of the Lythraceae such as Ammannia baccifera L., Lagerstroemia spp, Lawsonia alba Lamk., Lythrum salicaria L., Punica granatum L., Rotala indica and Woodfordia fruiticosa (L.) Kurz have been compared with the present fossil. In Ammannia baccifera, Lythrum salicaria, and Woodfordia fruiticosa, the venation is brochidodromous. In Lawsonia alba and Rotala indica, the leaves are smaller (nanophyll) in size, while in Punica granatum, the apex is acute and venation is only reticulate. In the present fossil, the apex is acuminate and venation is eucamptodromous to brochidodromous. Among the Lagerstroemia species such as L. calyculata Kurz, L. floribunda Jack, L. hypoleuca Kurz, L. indica Linn., L. minuticarpa Debb. ex Kanjilal, L. parviflora Roxb., L. speciosa (L.) Pers., L. tomentosa Presl, L. turbinata Koehne, L. venusta Wall. ex Clarke, and L. villosa Wall. ex Kurz, it has been inferred that the present fossil is similar to L. parviflora (figure 4C, F) (herbarium sheet nos. CNH 8629, 10513; FRI:21817 and L. speciosa (herbarium sheet no. FRI 41562). A large number of herbarium sheets of L. indica, L. tomentosa and L. villosa were examined. In these species, the apex is attenuate to mucronate and the base is obtuse to round, unlike in our fossil. The presence of simple to forked percurrent and reticulate tertiaries in L. hypoleuca and L. turbinata differentiate them from the present fossil. Leaves of L. floribunda are bigger in size (∼16.5 × 4.8 cm) than our fossil (length and width 6.1 × 3.1 cm and 7 × 3 cm), though size is a variable feature. In L. minuticarpa, the adjacent secondary veins are not running parallel to each other as in the fossil, while L. venusta differs from the fossil in eucamptodromous venation and having attenuate apex.\nAs far as the fossil leaf records of Lagerstroemia are concerned, they are known mainly from India and Japan. Lagerstroemia patellii, Lakhanpal and Guleria (1981) reported from the lower Eocene sediments of Kachchh, differs from the present fossil in having a cuneate base. Two species, namely\nT a b le\n1 .

Later, L. siwalika Prasad was again reported from the Miocene sediments of the Neyveli Lignite mine (Agarwal 2002). These fossils have pinnate craspedodromousto brochidodromous venation in contrast to the present fossil, where it is eucamptodromous to brochidodromous. Dwivedi et al. (2006) reported two species, viz., L. mioparviflora and L. eomicrocarpa from the Siwalik of Nepal. Both these fossils have only eucamptodromous venation and the angle of divergence of secondary veins is moderate acute, whereas it is moderate to wide acute in the present fossil. Another fossil L. imamurae Tanai and Uemura (1991) was reported from the Oligocene sediments of Japan, but it is different in being oblong in shape. A comprehensive chart of the character by character comparison of the aforesaid fossils is provided in table 1. Under these circumstances, the present leaf fossil has been assigned to a new species, Lagerstroemia himalayaensis Srivastava, Gaur et Mehrotra, sp. nov. The modern comparable species, i.e., L. parviflora is distributed on the foothills of the western Himalayas and throughout the Deccan Plateau, while L. speciosa is found from Assam to Malacca abundantly, on the hills of the Deccan Peninsula and in Sri Lanka (Hooker 1879)."

    "text": "4.1 Origin, diversification, modern distribution, fossil records and range shift of the family\nLythraceae\nThe modern distribution and fossil records of Lythraceae are very interesting because nowadays\nthe family is restricted only to tropical and subtropical areas, while its fossils have been reported from almost all parts of the globe (figure 1). They have been reported from the Late Cretaceous of USA and Mexico; Deccan Intertrappean beds (late Maastrichtian–Danian) of central India; Paleocene sediments of France and North America; Eocene sediments of North America, Europe, Libya, and south Asia; Oligocene sediments of North America, Europe, Siberia, and Japan; Miocene sediments of North America including Alaska and Canada, Europe, Denmark, south and southeast Asia, Russia, and China; Pliocene sediments of North America including Canada, Europe and China; Quaternary sediments of Panama, Colombia, Brazil, USA, Europe, and south and southeast Asia (Graham 2013). The family expanded after the Eocene, reached its peak during the Miocene (figure 5) and then declined significantly in the Pliocene as the climate deteriorated (Zachos et al. 2001) and now the family is not found in high latitudes such as Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and Siberia (figure 1).\nBased on the molecular data, Graham et al. (2005) suggested an Old World lauracesian origin of the family but the oldest fossil records (Lythrum and Peplis pollen) from Wyoming, USA indicate that the family was already established by the early Campanian (Late Cretaceous) in the New World Laurasia (Grimsson et al. 2011). The oldest megafossil record is a seed of Decodon described from the late Campanian (Late Cretaceous) of Mexico (Rodŕıguez-de la Rosa et al. 1998), again suggesting an early diversification of the family in the New World during the Campanian (∼70.6–83.5 Ma). Besides the fossil records mentioned above, the next oldest record is from India in the form of a flower (Sahnianthus) and\nMonocotyledons\nMarantaceae\nAlpinia siwalica Prasad et al.

On the basis of these records it can be inferred that the family was widely distributed on both the northern and southern hemispheres by the Late Cretaceous (∼65.6–99.6 Ma) (Venkatesan et al. 1993; Shukla et al. 1997; Salis and Saksena 1998).\n4.2 Fossil records of Lagerstroemia\nThe fossil records of Lagerstroemia are represented in the form of wood, leaf, and pollen which are restricted to south and southeast Asia, China, and Japan. In south Asia, the fossils are recorded in the form of leaves and wood from the Eocene, Miocene, and Mio–Pliocene sediments of India and Nepal (Prakash and Tripathi 1970; Awasthi 1981; Lakhanpal and Guleria 1981; Lakhanpal et al. 1981; Srivastava and Bande 1992; Antal and Awasthi 1993; Prasad 1994b; Agarwal 2002; Prasad et al. 2004; Dwivedi et al. 2006). Similarly, the genus was recorded as pollen and wood from the Neogene sediments of southeast Asia (Prakash 1965a, b; Prakash 1972; Kramer 1974; Prakash and Bande 1980; Du 1988; Guleria 1989; Watanasak 1990; Songtham et al. 2005). Fossils of the genus have also been reported from the Oligocene and Neogene sediments of Japan (Tanai and Uemura 1991; Miyoshi et al. 1999; Fujiki et al. 2001; Momohara et al. 2006; Choi et al. 2010). Its pollen and wood are also known from the Miocene and Pliocene of eastern and southwestern China (Cheng et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2008). Among all these fossil records, the oldest is from the Eocene sediments of Gujarat (Lakhanpal and Guleria 1981), India suggesting a probable Gondwanic origin of the genus. The aforesaid fossil records of Lagerstroemia, at least in south and southeast Asia, suggest that the genus might have migrated from India to southeast Asia after the complete suturing of the Indian and Eurasian plates. Like Lagerstroemia, many other taxa such as Mangifera and Semecarpus of the Anacardiaceae (Mehrotra et al. 1998; Srivastava and Mehrotra 2012; Chatterjee et al. 2013), Alphonsea of the Annonaceae (Srivastava and Mehrotra 2013a), Sterculia of the Malvaceae (Srivastava and Mehrotra 2013b) and Dipterocarpaceae (Dutta et al. 2011) might have migrated from India to southeast Asia. Their migration supports the ‘Out of India’ hypothesis (Bossuyt and Milinkovitch 2001).\n4.3 Expansion and retraction of Lythraceae and Lagerstroemia during the Cenozoic\nA cursory look at the known fossil records of Lythraceae and Lagerstroemia (figure 5) indicates a pattern of expansion and retraction which showed a maximum peak in the Miocene but dropped abruptly in the Pliocene due to the deterioration in the climatic conditions (Zachos et al. 2001). Both the family and the genus show the same pattern of expansion and retraction suggesting that they had a similar behaviour for adaptation during the Cenozoic. The similar behaviour pattern in adaptation might be because of the ecological niche conservatism (ENC). The ENC, therefore, is defined as the tendency of a species (or clades) to hold their ecological traits over a period of time (Peterson et al. 1999) and this phenomenon is observed not only at regional level but on a global scale as well (Crisp et al. 2009).\n4.4 Palaeoclimate analysis of the fossil locality\nA large number of fossil taxa have been reported from the Siwalik (middle Miocene) of Kathgodam (table 2). The presence of typical megathermal pantropical families like Annonaceae, Bombacaceae, Combretaceae, and Clusiaceae indicates a warm condition with plenty of rainfall. The dominance of evergreen and moist deciduous taxa, along with the mixed deciduous taxa (figure 6) indicates seasonality in the rainfall. The abundance of legumes (table 2) further supports this view. Palaeosol record from northwest Himalaya and quantitative palaeoclimate reconstruction based on pollen assemblage from south India also suggested that during the middle Miocene a monsoonal type of climate was\npresent in India (Ganjoo and Shaker 2007; Reuter et al. 2012)."

    "text": "Lagerstroemia (Lythraceae) fossil leaf is described from the middle Miocene (Lower Siwalik) sediments of Kathgodam, Uttarakhand, India. The family Lythraceae had worldwide distribution in the Cenozoic in contrast to modern day tropical to subtropical areas of the world. The present leaf fossil, along with the previous known fossil records of Lagerstroemia, indicates that the genus followed the same pattern of geographic expansion and retraction as the entire family Lythraceae. The plant fossil assemblage from the Lower Siwalik deposits indicates warm and humid climate with seasonality in rainfall in the region during the depositional period."
