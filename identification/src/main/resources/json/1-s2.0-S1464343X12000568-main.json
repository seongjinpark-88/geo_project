This paper discusses the contrasting aggradational mechanisms in fluvial systems strongly influenced by explosive volcanism which took place during sedimentation of the Queih basin. Six main facies associations composed of 12 lithofacies have been recognized in the Neoproterozoic succession filling the Queih basin: (1) lava flows and pedogenically modified pyroclastics facies association, (2) debris-flow-dominated alluvial fan facies association, (3) sheetflood-dominated alluvial fan facies association, (4) crevasse-splay facies association, (5) lacustrine facies association, and (6) loess facies association. These facies assemblages are typical of low-sinuosity rivers flowing through unsymmetrical half graben basin. Petrographical and geochemical data of the Queih sediments indicate a predominantly continental volcanic block provenance and stable craton to fault-bounded basement uplift. Low values of Chemical and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (CIA and PIA) are consistent with low intensity source rock weatherning under prevailing semi-arid to arid climate.\nDuring deposition of the lower member of the Queih basin, common fall and flow tuff events occurred, indicating syn-eruptive conditions. In contrast, deposition of the upper member occurred in a fluvial– aeolian setting without input of primary volcaniclastic detritus, indicating inter-eruptive conditions. The change in depositional mode from the lower to upper is considered to be due to a change in the balance between the sedimentation rate and the rate of lake-level rise. Lithofacies stacking and rapid lateral changes of lithological units in conjunction with interformational unconformities and basin margin faults suggest tectonically induced sedimentation. Volcanism can also influence basin evolution and the delicate balance between erosion, sedimentation, and prevalent transport processes is affected the Queih basin by volcanic input. Thus, the Queih basin records the response of fluvial system to large, volcanism-induced sediment loads.\n2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

    "text": "The influence of volcanism on nonmarine sedimentation has been addressed in several studies (e.g., Nakayama and Yoshikawa, 1997; Smith, 1987, 1991; Smith et al., 2002; Waresback and Turbeville, 1990). However, scarce works (e.g. O’Halloran and Gaul, 1997; Smith, 1987) has dealt with volcanism-induced sedimentation within fold belts in the foreland setting (cf. Jordan, 1995). Explosive volcanism can introduce rapid delivery of large volumes of volcaniclastic materials and sediments into different types of marine and continental settings (Smith, 1991). An abundant volcaniclastic input can modify topography and drainage patterns (Smith, op.cit.), and can eliminate sediment-stabilizing vegetation\nAll rights reserved.\n(Vessell and Davies, 1981). Primary volcaniclastic deposits are commonly redistributed immediately after eruptions by processes such as debris-flows, hyperconcentrated-flows and fluvial flows (e.g. Kataoka and Nakajo, 2002). In some cases, reworked volcaniclastic deposits are better represented in the rock record than primary volcaniclastic deposits (O’Halloran and Gaul, 1997). The sedimentary processes operating within an active volcanic terrains are different compared with those of non-volcanic settings and cannot be adequately explained by the existing or ‘‘background’’ alluvial facies models (Smith, 1987). In volcaniclastic alluvial environments, most sediments aggradation occurs during short syneruption periods separated by longer inter-eruption periods of incision when streams adjust to re-establish their former graded profile (Smith, 1987, 1991). These fluctuations occur at a much higher frequency than tectonically or climatically induced modifications (Smith, op.cit.). Syn-eruption deposits have a high\npreservation potential, because they are relatively thick, laterally extensive sheets with relatively low-erodability due to their inherent primary welding. Conversely, preservation of inter-eruption alluvial successions is independent of volcanism and requires base-level adjustments within the basin (Smith, op.cit.).\nThe Queih basin hosts a 2500 m thick (El-Taky, 1988) Neoproterozoic complex volcano-sedimentary succession that unconformably lies over the oldest Precambrian basement. This basin, about 30 km north of Quseir, is bounded by latitudes 26 160 and 26 230N and longitudes 33 560 and 34 050E. It covers about 250 km2 to the north and south of Wadi Queih. Previous studies of Wadi Queih (e.g. Abdeen, 1995; Abd El-Wahed, 2007; El Gaby et al., 1989; El-Taky, 1988; Rice et al., 1983) have shown that the Neoproterozoic basement rocks there comprise both Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups. These studies have mainly concentrated on geochemistry of the Dokhan Volcanics. The present paper focuses on a specific formation of the Queih basin, the Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups, consisting of volcaniclastic breccias and conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones–mudstones, subaerial lava flows, and pyroclastics. The main contributions of this study include: (i) describing the detailed sedimentology of the volcaniclastic rocks that belong to the Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups; (ii) proposing a paleogeographic, paleotectonic, and paleoweathering reconstruction; (iii) exploring the influence of volcanic activity on alluvial fan sediments; and (iv) providing information about the relationship between the alluvial sedimentation of the Queih basin and tectonics in the Precambrian. This work combines new data with those of previous studies of the Hammamat basins in the Central Eastern Desert (CED) in order to delineate the stratigraphical evolution of the Queih basin.\nAncient alluvial deposits can form thick, complex strata, but recognizing and distinguishing between alluvial fan, braided fluvial, or braidplain deposits in the sedimentary record is often difficult, especially if the channel(s) paleoslope is unknown (e.g. Eriksson et al., 2006; Bose et al., 2008). Moreover, alluvial sedimentation patterns can display complex interaction between tectonics, different sedimentation processes, climate, and source rock composition. Although, they tend to have some recognizable facies assemblages, the recognition of ancient alluvial deposits and its paleotectonic and paleoclimatic setting should be based on a combination of physical features, including textural, compositional, and lithofacies type criteria, in combination with studies of clastic petrofacies and geochemical characteristics. So, this study contributes to Precambrian alluvial systems by using multifaceted approach to recognize alluvial fan sedimentation patterns from a well preserved and well exposed Queih basin, CED, Egypt."

    "text": "The CED of Egypt constitutes the western part of the Arabo-Nubian Shield (ANS), which represents a Neoproterozoic juvenile crust (Stern, 1994). The deformed and variably metamorphosed pre-Cretaceous rocks making up the CED can be subdivided into three main lithotectonic units: (i) a lower unit composed of medium and high-grade core complex metamorphic ortho- and paragneisses, (ii) a structurally overlying low grade unit of ophiolite and island arc assemblages, and (iii) a sequence of non- to weakly metamorphosed and deformed volcanic (Dokhan Volcanics) and sedimentary rocks (Hammamat Groups) unconformably on top (Fig. 1). Gneisses are locally present in the CED as late Cryogenian–Ediacaran gneiss domes at Meatiq, El Sibai, and Hafafit along or close to NW- to WNW-trending fold structures and strike-slip faults in the northern part of the ANS (Fig. 1, Andresen et al., 2010). The overlying ophiolitic and volcano-sedimentary supracru-\nstal rocks are separated from the underlying gneissic rocks by a high-strain zone referred to as the Eastern Desert Shear Zone (EDSZ) (Andresen et al., 2010; Fritz et al., 2002; Sturchio et al., 1983). All these units are intruded by numerous post-orogenic granitic plutons which range in age from 610 Ma to 550 Ma (Andresen et al., 2009; Moghazi et al., 2004; Stern and Hedge, 1985). Variably deformed (syn-tectonic) calc-alkaline plutons ranging in age between c. 700 and 600 Ma are widespread in the units underlying the Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups (Kröner et al., 1994).\nThe Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups crop out in small terrestrial post-amalgamation basins in the ED (Johnson et al., 2011). The Dokhan Volcanics succession varies in thickness from basin to basin, ranging from a few tens of meters to 1300 m (Eliwa et al., 2006). The Hammamat Groups range from about 4000 m thick along Wadi Hammamat in the type Hammamat basin (Abd El-Wahed, 2008) to about 7500 m in the Kareim basin (Fig. 1, Fritz and Messner, 1999). The proportions of the volcanic and sedimentary rocks vary from basin to basin. Some contain only volcanic rocks; others are entirely sedimentary; yet other basins contain both volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Because of the varied distributions of these volcanic and sedimentary rocks and different relationships in basins where both rock types occur, the stratigraphy of the Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups is debated. Some workers consider that the Hammamat Groups underlie the Dokhan Volcanics (e.g., Stern and Hedge, 1985); others believe that the Hammamat overlies the Dokhan (e.g., Akaad and Noweir, 1980; Rice et al., 1983); yet others infer that the two interfinger and are essentially contemporaneous (El Gaby et al., 1989; Eliwa et al., 2010; Khalaf, 2004). Both units are Ediacaran. Recent SHRIMP U–Pb dating established that the Dokhan Volcanics erupted between 630 and 592 Ma, while the Hammamat Groups were deposited between 593 and 579 Ma (Breitkreuz et al., 2010; Stern and Hedge, 1985; Wilde and Youssef, 2000).\nSeveral authors suggest that the Hammamat Groups were deposited in a major fluvial system of continental proportions that linked the various basins, and possibly linked to similar successions in Sinai and Jordan; other workers infer that the Hammamat groups were deposited in isolated, fault-bounded basins (Abdeen and Greiling, 2005; Grothaus et al., 1979; Wilde and Youssef, 2002). These are variously classified as a foreland basins, in the case of the type Hammamat basin (Fritz et al., 1996), intermontane basins in the cases of the Kareim, Queih, and Igla basins, for example (Abd El-Wahed, 2008), a strike-slip pull-apart basins, in the case of the El Mayah basin (Shalaby et al., 2006), and fault-bounded basins (Abdeen and Greiling, 2005). The range of inferred structural controls included thrusting, normal faulting, strike-slip faulting, N–S to NW–SE extension, and magmatic doming."

    "heading": "2.2. Geological background of the Queih basin",
    "text": "Wadi Queih basin is a NNE–SSW to NE–SW trending intermontane basin which occurs adjacent to the inferred northern limit of the Najd fault system (NFS) in the CED of Egypt (Fig. 1). It is largely occupied by Neoproterozoic basement rocks forming part of a horst bounded on the east and west by a number of major normal faults trending NNW and WNW (Fig. 2A). The horst is flanked on the west by Cretaceous and Eocene strata of the Duwi structural low and on the east by Nubia Sandstones and Neogene sediments of the Red Sea province (Fig. 2A). The exposed basement rocks belong mainly to the Hammamat Groups that rest unconformity overlying the Dokhan Volcanics especially in the northern part of Wadi Queih basin (Fig. 2B). This unconformity surface is subplanar and dips generally 35–45 towards SSW, while the Hammamat Groups dip 30–40 towards the same direction and are marked by a thick sequence of coarse to very coarse basal conglomerates (Fig. 2B).\nThe Dokhan Volcanics are exposed in the northern part and extend continuously from the eastern to the western basin boundaries (Fig. 2B). They form a rugged mountainous terrain of grayish green1 through purplish red to creamy color. These volcanics are folded into an anticline and a syncline whose axes trend NW–SE, plunging 10 toward the SE. The two folds are dissected by a number of sinistral oblique-slip faults, which off-set the volcanics against the Hammamat Groups. These volcanics comprise intermediate and felsic lava flows with their related pyroclastics as well as hypabyssal porphyries that grade downwards into epizonal A-type granite plutons (Khalaf, 1994; Stern and Gottfried, 1986). The Dokhan Volcanics are linked to crustal extension and local rifting during a late stage in the formation of the ANS (Khalaf, 1994). This rifting event may have created accommodation space for the late orogenic Hammamat Groups.\n1 For interpretation of color in Figs. 1–3 and 6–11, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.\nThe Hammamat Groups cover about 60 km2 to the north and south of Wadi Queih area. They are composed of immature red and green polymitic conglomerates alternating with sandstones, siltstones and mudstones that were deposited through fluvial processes (Grothaus et al., 1979). Some volcanic flows are interbedded with the Hammamat Groups indicating an interfingering relationship between both rock units. These rock units are overthrust by the Kujura felsites in the southwestern part of the studied area (Figs. 2B and 3A). The Kujura felsites cover an area of about 11 km long and up to 0.5 km thick. They are generally fine-grained, mylonitized, massive but occasionally flow-banded. Arc metavolcanics form thick thrust sheets that overlie all rock units and are well exposed in the south (Fig. 2B)."

    "text": "Intense folding and faulting complicate the deformational history of Wadi Queih basin which was subjected to at least four\nphases of deformation. D1 event is attributed to a NNW–SSE compression that is manifested by NNW-ward thrust slices of metavolcanics, felsites, and Hammamat Groups, forming imbricate thrust zones (T1) in the southern part of the Wadi Queih area (Fig. 2B) that are related to the NNW-ward tectonic transport. These were overprinted during the D2 event by E–W or ENE–WSW trending megascopic folds in the northeastern part of the basin. These folds which were associated with NNW-directed early thrusts (Abdeen and Greiling, 2005), are asymmetrical anticlines and synclines (Fig. 3B) whose fold axes trend NW and plunge 10 SW. These NE-trending asymmetric folds were accompanied by SW-dipping\nimbricate thrust zones (T2), which represent a direct product of the NE–SW compression event (D2) in Wadi Queih area. These thrusts were also described by Greiling et al. (1994). During the D3 event, sinistral strike-slip faulting occurred in the Wadi Queih area along a number of NW–SE to WNW–ESE oriented curvilinear and branching subvertical faults. These faults affect both the Hammamat Groups and Dokhan Volcanics forming a positive flower structure (Fig. 3C) as described by Abdeen and Greiling (2005). This structure represents the transpressional regime of the NFS. Three major sinistral strike-slip shear zones can be identified in the southwestern part of Wadi Queih area namely: Queih (QSZ), Um\nKujura (KSZ), and Himeiriyia (HSZ) shear zones (Fig. 2B). QSZ is located in the central part of Wadi Queih basin and has deformed the folds and S-planes formed during D1 and D2 events. The area between QSZ and KSZ is marked by subvertical mylonitic foliation (S3) and subhorizontal bedding-cleavage lineation (L3) and represents the most highly deformed part of Wadi Queih basin (Fig. 3C). The Dokhan Volcanics are also affected by the sinistral movement along HSZ. The minor NW-trending F3 folds are characterized by tight, asymmetric overturned folds. SE-dipping extensional normal faults are related to thrusting, folding, and sinistral shearing during D2 and D3 events. Late NNW–SSE normal faults and NW–SE sinistral strike-slip fault and N–S dextral strike-slip faults were most probably reactivated during Red Sea rifting (D4 event). Genetically, these NW–SE to WNW–ESE oriented transpressional structures are of Late Neoproterozoic age but younger than the folds and thrusts of the ANS, because they overprint and mask the earlier E–W oriented structures and do not cut the Phanerozoic sediments outside the Wadi Queih basin (Abdeen, 1995)."

    "text": "This work has been carried out on outcrop exposures, by applying the conventional methods of lithofacies and architectural element analysis. The lithofacies classification used in the present study follows the system introduced by Miall (1978) and Rust (1978), and subsequently expanded by several authors for fluvial and alluvial fan-related deposits in volcanic settings (Palmer and Neall, 1991; Smith, 1986, 1987). The identification of the facies constituents of the volcaniclastic sediments in Wadi Queih area were done through four collected sections (Fig. 2B), which have been measured at the meter scale. Rock names for mixtures of pyroclastic and epiclastic fragments are based on the proportion of the pyroclastic fraction and the average grain size (Fisher and Schmincke, 1984). The classification of Ingram (1954) is used to classify the beds according to their thickness. Shapes of sediment bodies were classified according to width, length, and thickness (Bridge, 1993). All these data have been interpreted in terms of depositional trends, stratal stacking patterns, and paleo-depositional environments.\nThe description of the volcano-sedimentary rocks is based on the study of thin sections, including point counting (only for sandstone rocks) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (Jeol SEM 6400) at the National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt. Moreover, whole-rock chemical analyses were performed for 16 samples, including two samples from the lava flows, four samples from the pyroclastics, two samples from siltstones, and eight samples from purple sandstones (medium-grained). Analyses were performed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF spectrometer Phillips PW 1510), at the laboratories of the Nuclear Material Authority, Egypt and the results are provided in Table 1. Chemical analyses were calibrated against both international and internal standards. Analytical uncertainties are estimated at 2% for major elements, and at 5% or 10% for trace-element concentrations."

    "text": "The Queih basin contains a thick fluvial siliciclastic succession of the Hammamat Groups that unconformably lie over the lava flows and reworked pyroclastics of the Dokhan Volcanics (Fig. 4). Twelve lithofacies have been recognized in the Neoproterozoic succession filling this basin. These lithofacies were grouped into six facies associations (the term ‘facies associations’ is applied herein following (Reading, 1996; Miall, 2000) representing four distinct depositional environments: (1) lava flows and pedogenically modified pyroclastics facies association (FA1); (2) debris-flow-dominated\nalluvial fan facies association (Fa2); (3) sheetflood-dominated alluvial fan facies association (FA3); (4) crevasse-splay facies association (FA4); (5) lacustrine facies association (FA5); and (6) loess facies association (FA6). The description and interpretation of the different sedimentary facies are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. In the measured stratigraphic sections (Fig. 5), the lower member of the Queih basin is composed of FA1, FA2, FA3, and FA4. In contrast, its upper member is composed of FA5 and FA6. The intrusive suite includes younger granites and NE–SW-trending sills and/or dikes."

The contact of the lava flows and pyroclastic units with the overlying FA2 is generally erosive and sharp."

    "heading": "4.1.1. Volcanic lava flows",
    "text": "4.1.1.1. Description. Individual flow units, 5–30 m thick, grade upward into flow breccias that rest on a basement of metamorphosed supracrustal and intrusive rocks in the Queih basin. They are exposed either as small bodies with a restricted surface expression and a thickness of less than 10 m, or as tabular bodies of great lateral extent ranging from hundreds of metres to tens of kilometres and thicknesses of up to 50 m. They are generally composed of massive, aphyric andesitic to rhyolitic lavas which grade into porphyritic textures, showing also pervasive vesiculation. Brecciated lavas display blocky or ‘‘aa’’ flow forms.\n4.1.1.2. Interpretation. A subaerial setting is favoured for the massive flows and block-type breccias. ‘‘Aa’’ flow breccia, characterized by spinose clasts with irregular-shaped vesicles, is suggestive of subaerial flow (Macdonald, 1972)."

    "heading": "4.1.2. Massive, poorly sorted tuff beds (T1)",
    "text": "4.1.2.1. Description. This facies consists of medium to fine-grained off-white, slightly welded, poorly sorted structureless tuffs, arranged into thick homogenous bodies 1 to 5 m thick and tens of meters in lateral extent. It commonly shows positive relief in the field and contains sparse, pumiceous and lithic clasts of lapilli and block size (Fig. 6B). Contacts are sharp, with non-erosional, irregular to wavey bases and strongly irregular tops. Lithics are subangular to angular, and are primarily composed of porphyritic andesites. The pumiceous clasts in contrast, are crystals-poor, subrounded and show clast sizes between 0.01 and o.16 m. Internally, the pumiceous clasts has curviplanar surfaces with rounded to ellipsoidal vesicles, and more elongate tube-like vesicles parallel to the flow direction (Fig. 6C). The matrix of the pumiceous tuffs is composed of angular crystal fragments, cuspate and platy glass shards, locally recrystallized (Fig. 6B). The crystals consist of subhedral, striped–twinned kaolinized plagioclase, quartz, greenish– brown biotite and subordinate opaque. Rheomorphic folded glass shards are occasionally observed.\n4.1.2.2. Interpretation. Welded pumiceous particles in this facies clearly indicate that the sediment transport was related to a volcanic eruption. The physical features together with composition allow interpretation of this facies as primary pyroclastic flow beds. The massive and homogenous nature of these deposits and non-erosional bases suggest emplacement from laminar flows (cf. Fisher and Schmincke, 1984; Sparks, 1976). The poor sorting can be attributed to a high particle concentration in the flow (Sparks, 1976), suggesting inertial processes. The degree of lithofication of these beds could be explained by high-temperature emplacement. This is consistent with the ductile deformation shown locally by\nthe rheomorphic folds of glass shards. The absence of gas segregation pipes formed by the interaction between hot pyroclastic flow and water implies that this facies was deposited in a subaerial setting."

    "heading": "4.1.3. Thinly stratified lapilli tuff beds (T2)",
    "text": "4.1.3.1. Description. Thinly stratified lapilli-tuffs consist of a welldefined alternation of fine to coarse lapilli-range from 10 to 30 cm, whereas the tuff layers range in thickness from 0.5 to 2 m. The tuffs are thin bedded, massive, or internally planar to wavy stratified (Fig. 6D). R-type accretionary lapilli, consisting of a coarse-grained core surrounded by multiple rims (Schumacher and Schmincke, 1991) are common (Fig. 6E). These lapilli are spheroidal, less commonly discoidal, 1 mm to 3 cm in size (Fig. 6F). In some cases, these particles are prolate with the long axis parallel to the stratification plane. The upper part of some beds is composed of highly altered glass shards and scarce weathered plagioclase with pedofeatures (T3). Common pedofeatures are void quasi-coatings and carbonate aggregate nodules (Fig. 7A).\n4.1.3.2. Interpretation. Thick stratification and poorly sorted deposits indicate deposition from pyroclastic surges lacking tractional processes (Carmona et al., 2011). Textural evidence for a pyroclastic origin include pumice, accretionary lapilli (Fig. 6E), shards, and broken crystals (Fisher and Schmincke, 1984). R-type accretionary lapilli commonly originate from phreatomagmatic eruptions associated with magma-meteoric water interaction (Gilbert and Lane, 1994). The prolate shape of accretionary lapilli is attributed to compaction (Umazano et al., 2008). The presence of accretionary lapilli is generally regarded as indicative of a location proximal to the volcanic vent (Schumacher and Schmincke, 1991). After deposition, the facies associations 1 were slightly to moderately modified by pedogenesis (Retallack, 1988) as suggested by the presence of facies T3 (Fig. 7A)."

Most of the beds are massive, poorly defined and without recognizable tops and bases. They are texturally polymodal, clast-supported, with variable content of sand matrix."

The texture and fabric of the beds is ungraded and disorganized, and the clasts do not show any significant stratification (Fig. 7C). The grain size of the breccia fragments varies from less than 5.0 cm to 30 cm. The breccia fragments are angular to sub-angular and are composed of the andesitic to rhyolitic volcanics. The matrix is composed of medium- to coarse-grained arkosic sandstone and shows no stratified features.\n4.2.1.2. Interpretation. The texture and fabric of the beds and the sandstone matrix indicate that this deposit represents a sedimentary breccia rather than a volcanic autobreccia formed during the eruption of the Dokhan Volcanics. Thick bedding, poorly organized texture, and the lack of stratification or grading suggest that the beds has been deposited en masse (Went, 2005). The lack of imbrication suggests relatively short travel distance, a non-sheared high strength flow, or a high viscosity flow (Kim et al., 1995; Sohn et al., 1999). This lithofacies is interpreted to represent either a subaerial plastic debris flow deposition with a high-strength or viscous nature, or possible colluvial (hill-slope) deposits."

    "heading": "4.2.2. massive or amalgamated bodies of conglomerates (Cm)",
    "text": "4.2.2.1. Description. Up to several metres thick massive or amalgamated conglomerate bodies of facies (Cm) are built of boulderto pebble-size, angular to sub-rounded clasts of andesites, argillites, granites, reworked pyroclastics, and chert clasts (Fig. 7D–F). These clasts range in diameter from 2 mm to 50 cm,\nand are sometimes graded (normal or reverse to normal, Fig. 7F). This lithofacies is 1–5 m thick and displays upward fining (Fig. 5) with sharp erosional contact and a sheet-like geometry with good lateral continuity. Whereas bases are planar to wavey, tops are seldom markedly irregular due to subsequent erosion. Local imbrication of clast grains has been observed (Fig. 7F).\n4.2.2.2. Interpretation. The clast-supported and disorganized nature of the conglomerate beds indicate a cohesive, highly viscous, sluggish, and low mobility flow. The erosive base and normal grading may indicate a more turbulent flow in earlier phase or water-rich sediment flows, the movement of which involved intense shearing and turbulent churning (Nemec and Postma, 1993; Went, 2005). Because of polymodal grain-size distribution (Fig. 7F), lack of stratification within the beds, lack of major erosional surfaces, the thick breccias, and conglomerate bodies can be treated as deposited on the proximal and/or mid-fan from high-concentration flows or debris flows, occasionally rock avalanches (e.g. Blair and McPherson, 1994; Nemec and Postma, 1993)."

    "text": "The sheetflood facies deposits occur as thick caps of fining-upward sequence or thin-lenticular layers within the debris flow facies at the base of the Hammamat Groups. These deposits show planar and slightly erosional bases with frequent low-relief scour. The tops are planar to undulatory. Individual beds are amalgamated laterally and form sheet-like bodies that extend for several hundred metres. Bed thickness ranges from decimeters to metres, some beds are vertically stacked forming successions up to 15 m thick. This facies association includes an association of thin-laminated sandstone facies (Sh), massive sandstones (Sm), and planar cross-bedded ferruginous sandstones (Sp). These sandstones have some interbed of siltstones and in their upper parts reach to siltstone–mudstone units (Fig. 5)."

The\nSh lithofacies ranges in thickness from 0.3 to 0.5 m and consists of grey fine-to medium-grained sand, most parts of which are characterized by fine materials of pyroclastic origin. The dominant primary sedimentary structures of this lithofacies include horizontal and wavey lamination with small-scale sediment deformation (Fig. 8A). The lower and upper contacts with the underlying and overlying massive sandstones are sharp with slightly erosional base surfaces and wavy tops.\n4.3.1.2. Interpretation. The presence of well-developed thin stratification suggest deposition from dilute turbulent flows, where the transport was essentially by traction (Lowe, 1982). This lithofacies is interpreted as the horizontally laminated sandstone facies of Miall (1977). The thin sheet-like geometry in association with small-scale sedimentary structures and fine-grained lithology indicate deposition as bar-top sand sheets or as in-channel deposits during the terminal waning stage of seasonal flood events (McLoughlin and Drinnan, 1997).

The framework of this lithofacies is composed of subhedral broken twinned plagioclase and monocrystalline quartz crystals, volcanic lithics (Lv), and relict minor sedimentary chert clasts (Ls). A large amount of devitrified cuspate shards and pumice clasts are also present. The fabric is dominantly grain-supported (Fig. 8B).\n4.3.2.2. Interpretation. The massive sandstones represent sediments transported during high discharge conditions in which sediments cannot be redistributed into bed-forms (Smith, 1991). Similar sandstones that were described in fluvial braided-river deposits by Martin and Turner (1998) were attributed to deposition from highly concentrated sediment/water mixtures. The formation of this lithofacies type appears to involve the\nmanifestation of sandy debris flows or hyper-concentrated stream flows, followed by rapid sediment deposition (Martin and Turner, 1998)."

The sandstone bodies are 50 cm to 1.5 m thick and extend laterally for meters to tens of meters, with sharp upper and lower contacts. They show sharp to gradational contacts with the overlying siltstone beds (F1, Fig. 8C). These sandstones are composed of poorly sorted, immature, coarse to medium-grained feldspathic\nlitharenites and litharenites. Sedimentary (Ls) and volcanic lithics (Lv) occur in variable proportions. The feldspars are dominated by plagioclase and less abundant untwined orthoclase with minor monocrystalline quartz (Fig. 8D).\n4.3.3.2. Interpretation. These beds are interpreted as channel fill deposits with erosional bases and cross-bedding which indicate unidirectional sediment transport as bed load (Saneyoshi et al., 2006). The predominance of planar cross-bedding structure throughout this lithofacies is representative of active lateral channel shifting and represents lower flow regime, linguoid and traverse sandbars or straight-crested dunes (Reineck and Singh, 1980; Tosolini et al., 1999) that commonly accrete along the sides\nof gravel bars. The channels were probably shallow because the large-scale trough/planar cross-bedded structures do not appear to form parts of larger scale macroforms (Scherer et al., 2007). The absence of epsilon cross-stratification, important indicators of meandering streams, implies that this lithofacies is of braided stream origin. This lithofacies corresponds to Miall’s (1977) planar cross-bedded sandstone facies (Sp). Low angle cross-beds may be deposited under high-energy conditions in particular channel locations such as at the base of longitudinal bars or at the intersection of channels (McLoughlin and Drinnan, 1997). The purple color of sandstones is due to iron oxides pigmentation (dominantly diagenetic)."

Massive tuffaceous siltstones that locally cover the sandstone bodies imply settling from suspension, probably during waning-flow conditions. The scarcity of crevasse-splay deposits suggests that channel stability was relatively low (Galloway, 1981) and/or that the channels were too short-lived to build extensive channel-margin deposits (Dreyer, 1993)."

They expose load cast and flame structures as well as dish and pillar textures. The layers are generally a few millimeters to 3.0-cm-thick, and have gradational boundaries. Their beds have non-ersional bases and tops. The basal contacts of these beds are sharp or amalgamated with the underlying planar cross-bedded ferruginous sandstones (Fig. 8C). The siltstones and mudstones of the FA5 are mainly red and green variably mottled (red, green, purple, yellow). They are characterized by volcanic products (juvenile clasts including pumice clasts and volcanic glass) and are well to moderate sorted. Dissecation and mud cracks have not been observed. Pedogenic features, such as carbonate nodules (Fig. 7A), redoximorphic features (i.e., mottles), slickensides, and clay and iron oxide coatings, are developed to various degrees within these beds. Laminated chert beds (Ch) is commonly interbedded with the siltstone–mudstone beds (Fig. 5). They are texturally uniform, fine-\ngrained, and are composed mostly of dense quartz-rich laminae and volcaniclastics-rich laminae. The latter consist of silt-to sand sized grains of lithics and feldspar within the color-laminated chert. These layers are commonly graded.

The presence of climbing ripples or convoluted bedding in the pale, silty, and fine-grained sandy layers suggests that the siltstone–mudstone deposits represent a flood basin, crevasse splay, or natural levee (Collinson et al., 2006). This lithofacies corresponds in part to Miall’s (1977) Fl and Fm (laminated and massive silt/mud) facies. Typical braided-river deposits usually preserve only thin sequences of floodplain sediments (Miall, 1977; Cant, 1978). Such fine-grained sediments may also accumulate in the distal areas of floodplains, under seasonally dry and oxidizing environmental conditions. The latter interpretation is supported by the presence of red (hematite-rich) paleosoils, which are a prominent feature of flood-basins that develop under semi-arid to arid conditions (Mader, 1985)."

Low CIA and PIA values in the sandstones and siltstones (CIA = 56; PIA = 59) indicate low weathering condition in the source area and may reflect cool and/or arid climate conditions (Table 1). This corresponds with the generally low levels of K2O (Fig. 10B). The CIA values of the sandstone and siltstone sediments are closer to the unweathered upper crust CIA value (50), than to the average shale CIA values (70–75) of Taylor and McLennan (1985), which indicates limited chemical weathering of the source rocks. The strong depletion of K, Ba, and Rb and slight enrichment of Sr, Mg, Fe, and Na in the sandstone and siltstone samples related to UCC (Fig. 9B) suggest also less intense chemical weathering of the source region (Absar et al., 2009; Fedo et al., 1996; Nesbitt and Wilson, 1992).\nThe A–CN–K ternary diagram (Fig. 10C; Al2O3 CaO + Na2O K2O; Nesbitt and Young, 1984) can also be used to constrain initial compositions of source rocks. In the absence of post-depositional K metasomatism, the weathering profile would show a linear trend\nLo g\n(N a2\nO /K\n2O )\nsubparallel to the A–CN join (line 1 of Fig. 10C) and extend to the original source composition on the feldspar join (Fedo et al., 1996). In contrast, samples that experienced post-depositional K metasomatism such as conversion of aluminous clay minerals to illite (line 2 of Fig. 10C) or replacement of plagioclase with Kfeldspar (line 3 of Fig. 10C), would have shifted away from the predicted weathering trend (Fedo et al., 1995). The sandstone and siltstone samples plot along the A–CN line in the A–CN–K diagram and when extended towards the feldspar join coincides with those of andesite and pyroclastics of the Queih basement. The clusters of these samples around the compositions of the andesitic and felsic pyroclastic rocks, suggests that the source was mainly composed of such materials. This clearly indicates that possible source rocks of these sediments were typically plagioclase-bearing but devoid of K-feldspars. The enrichment in Sr suggests enrichment by parent rock weathering and/or that the source rock was rich in plagioclase (Kasanzu et al., 2008). This would probably affect the enrichment in Ca as well (Fig. 10B). I conclude that the Queih sediments was dominantly derived from felsic-intermediate provenance composed of andesitic and felsic volcanic rocks."

Even though few samples plot within the field assigned for felsic source (Fig. 10D). In Fe2O3 + MgO (wt.%) vs. TiO2 (wt.%) diagram, the rock samples are scattered over the fields of island arc and active continental margins (Fig. 11A). So, the geochemical characters of the siltstones and sandstones indicate that the Queih sediments might have been partly resulted from the significant input from mafic and felsic volcanic source rock present in the basement complex as relicts of the Precambrian magmatic arc (see also Bhatia, 1983; Mack, 1984). The volcanic component may have been derived from the continental shield or from intra-cratonic volcanic rocks, which may have erupted during the rift-valley or graben stages before the formation of the passive margin (Bhatia, 1983).\nThe main lithic fragments in the siliciclastic sediments of the Queih basin are predominant andesite and felsites with some granites and sedimentary rocks (mainly chert clasts). This mixture indicates multiple sources that could be the Dokhan continental arc volcanic rocks as the major contributor with older intra-oceanic island arc metavolcanics and their associated sedimentary rocks. The same conclusion is in good agreement mentioned by Abd El-Rahman et al. (2010), Abu El Ela and El Bahariya (1995) and Holail and Moghazi (1998) for the Hammamat Groups in the CED and by Osman et al. (2001) for the NED. The Dokhan Volcanics in the Queih area comprise mainly subaerial lava flows and pyroclastics of calc-alkaline andesitic to rhyolitic rocks (Fig. 11B). These rocks are enriched in LILEs (Rb, Ba, K,) relative to high field strength elements (Nb, Zr, P, Ti) (Table 1). Their geochemical characters, and their high Zr/Y suggest that their emplacement followed the cessation of subduction in the ED in an extensional, within-plate setting (Fig. 11C). The contribution of both the Dokhan Volcanics and island arc metavolcanics and associated sediments are recorded gen-\nTi O\n2 (w\nt.% )\nerally by the whole Hammamat Groups in the ED (Akaad and Noweir, 1980). The lower content of Nb (Table 1) and Zr relative to UCC indicates an arc source for the Queih sediments (c.f. Zhang, 2004) which is supported by modal analyses (Table 1 and Fig. 11D)."

As convincingly argued by White and Robinson (1992), low-density fallout or surge deposits eroded after explosive events, are easily entrained to produce high-density mass flows. Preservation of subaerial pyroclastic debris in the Queih basin suggests that basin subsidence and tectonic uplift was significant, permitting rapid burial.

Highly feldspathic nature and general abundant of lithic fragments of the sandstones suggest sediment derivation mostly from uplifted crystalline (plutonic and volcanic rocks) source rocks and insufficient erosion for removal of cover rocks. Reworking and down-cutting in the form of stream incision and fluvial denudation processes occur during stages of volcanic quiescence. The profound coarsening-upward trend in the proximal section with increasing abundance of coarse-grained mass-flow products (FA2) supports progradation of an alluvial fan (cf. Blair and McPherson, 1994). The up-section change of lithofacies suggests braided alluvial fan for (FA3) grading into braid- or floodplains with local small ponds or a central lake for FA4 and FA5 (Fig. 4). The perceived absence of channel geometries might be due to the relatively small investigable areas of the alluvial fan coupled with the location of the studied stratigraphic sections with respect to the feeding channels active at the time of deposition. The associated debris-flow, sheetflood, and lacustrine deposits reflect the lack of channelized drainage and vegetation and the abundant weathered detritus from the Queih basement possible in a semiarid/arid climate (Blair and McPherson, 1994).The semi-arid climate is further supported by low CIA, PIA, and Qt/F + R ratio (mean: Q23F28R26, mean Qt/F + R = 0.43; Table 1)(Basu, 1976; Young et al., 1975).\nThe provenance of the Queih fluvial sediments which mainly comprise pyroclastics and effusive volcanic clasts indicates high affinity with the volcanic landscape, as it is almost unrelated to the country rocks especially Meatig domal gneisses. The abundance of tuffaceous material clearly reveals a continuous delivery of pyroclasts, originated by the reworking and redeposition from primary pyroclastic units (i.e., ignimbrites and base surges) to the sedimentary system. The absence of major erosive surfaces and degradational cycles is consistent with a high aggradational rate. It is consistent with the volcaniclastic facies model proposed by Smith (1991), who suggested that between major explosive volcanic events, rivers tend to recover their graded profile, incising channels through the existing substrate of pyroclastic composition. These results suggest that the deposition of these rocks in the Queih basin occurred close to the source area (uplifted shoulders) and not from a far hinterland in the carton.\nThe compositions of the fluvial sediments as well as those of the intermediate and felsic Dokhan Volcanics with some granites and meta-sediments of the basement are comparable to that of the Zone IV to Zone III of a typical weathering profile (Nesbitt et al., 1997). These two zones are the least weathered and are characterized by an abundance of rock fragments mainly derived from volcanics, large mineral grains of feldspar and quartz, lesser proportion of sedimentary clasts (e.g., chert clasts), and closely reflect the provenance composition (Nesbitt et al., 1997). Very low rate of chemical weathering and higher erosion rate contribute to the exposure of Zones III or IV. Therefore, the siltstone and sandstone plots in the A–CN–K diagram (Fig. 10C) are in conformity with cold (glacial) and arid climate and relatively higher ratio between rates of basin subsidence and sediment accumulation. Lower CIA and PIA values of the siltstone and sandstone samples also point to relatively less intense weathering of the source rocks."

    "text": "The Queih rock deposits are tilted, folded, dissected by faults, and in some cases the contact between the particular facies associations is probably of tectonic origin. The Queih basin-margin is interpreted to have been steep where the debris-flow facies association (FA2) is exposed along the steepest northeasternmost end of the studied stretch. The vertical stack of FA2 at the basin margin passing vertically and laterally to sheet (FA3) and deep-water deposits (FA4 and FA5) point to frequent tectonic activity, repeatedly creating slopes steeper than the angle-of-repose (Bose et al.,\n2008). Moreover, cyclic repetition of rock units, fining–coarsening–fining upward (Fig. 4), and high sediment accumulation rates implying rapid subsidence also corroborate tectonic disturbance. From this point of view, between the studied four stratigraphic sections (Fig. 5), the Queih area was presumably tectonically most active.\nThe strike-slip faults, which were active during the Late Neoproterozoic, are recognized in the CED in general and Queih basin in particular (Figs. 1 and 2). In Queih basin, brittle and ductile deformations has been recognized as; (1) NW–SE-trending mainly strike-slip faults, (2) NE–SW-trending normal faults, and (3) NE–SW-trending folds which are interpreted to be related to compressional deformation developed between the NE–SW- and NW–SE-trending faults after deposition of the Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary successions in the studied area. Characteristics such as elongate basin geometry, fold patterns, and bounding faults (Fig. 2) in the Wadi Queih area are consistent with strike slip, and enable classification as fault bend (Nilsen and Sylvester, 1995) or fault-wedge basins (Crowell, 1974). These data indicated that Queih basin was deformed under NW–SE directed compression and NE–SW directed extension developed in a NW–SE-trending strike-slip deformational zone. The Queih basin compares favourably with other strike-slip basins. Structural style and overall setting of the strike-slip basins along the Philippine fault system on Luzon (Ringenbach et al., 1993), sedimentology of the Nadai strike-slip basin in Fiji (Hathway, 1993), and Neogene basins in Western Anatolia (Ersoy et al., 2011) are strikingly similar. Hence Queih basin is interpreted to be transtensional basin (Fig. 2) controlled by strike-slip and normal faults and deposited in a supra-detachment basin. Detachment faulting and related supradetachment volcano-sedimentary basin formation with magmatic activity characterize highly extended terrains such as the United States Cordillera and Aegean Extensional Province (Asmerom et al., 1994; Friedmann and Burbank, 1995; Ersoy et al., 2011; Wernicke, 1995; Wernicke and Snow, 1998). The term ‘‘supra-detachment basin’’ refers to a sedimentary or volcano-sedimentary basin developed on a low-angle normal fault that can accommodate very large amounts of extension (Friedmann and Burbank, 1995). Deposition in such basins may occur; (a) actively during the extensional detachment faulting, (b) or passively after faulting. Models for metamorphic core complex formation within the CED involve extension within NW-trending zones bounded by sinistral strike-slip shears of the NFS (Stern, 1985, NFS, Fig. 1). Field observations (existence of lava flows of the Dokhan Volcanics and fluvial siliciclastic sediments of the Hammamat Groups (Fig. 2B), petrographic, and geochemical results suggest the existence of an extensional stage in an extensional basin during the deposition of the Queih basin. The Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups overlie unconformably the gneisses and island arc metavolcanics. This unconformity corresponds to a major unconformity event, which separates highly deformed older rock units and 600 Ma Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat sediments in the ED of Egypt (Avigad and Gvirtzman, 2009)."

    "text": "Sedimentological and geochemical data presented in this study lead to an improved depositional and paleotectonic model for the Queih extensional basin. The contrasting facies composition and vertical distribution of the lower and upper members of the fluvial sediments in the Queih basin suggest that they were deposited in different fluvial systems (Fig. 12). The paleotectonic evolution of the depositional basin started with a within plate mafic and felsic Dokhan Volcanics at the initial extension stage of rifting. During this period, the lower member of the Queih basin (Fig. 12A) was deposited coevally with intense explosive volcanism as con-\nstrained by the wide-spread lava flows and pyroclastic deposits more than 50 km along the northeastern flank of the Queih basin (Fig. 2B). Commonly, the deposits of Fa1 are vertically stacked conformable sheet-like bodies, maintain a relatively uniform thickness, and represent typical syn-eruptive periods (Cas and Wright, 1987; Houghton et al., 2000; Smith, 1991).\nThe onset of deposition is recorded in the lowermost interval of the Queih basin, characterized by coarse-grained breccias and conglomerates (FA2) of the bed-load-dominated fluvial system (Fig. 5), which are absent at higher stratigraphic levels. Alluvial fan deposits of FA2 occur at the northern border of the basin. The provenance suggest that the fluvial system of the FA2 was derived from a broad catchment area north of the basin, probably reflecting an early capture of a major fluvial system to the basin during the first stages of its history. The high angularity of the rock fragments and poor sorting of the FA2 suggest high erosion rates of the source rock and rapid sedimentation (Camirè et al., 1993). According to Prosser (1993), the tectonic system tract is characterized by a small thickness of alluvial sediments deposited in isolated small basins prior to the linkage of the early faults through fault propagation (e.g., Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000). Thus, I interpret that most of the breccias and conglomerates of the FA2 developed during the Early\nRift stage, in a period of great tectonic subsidence. The second stage of basin evolution was characterized by the existence of sheetflood dominated alluvial fans (FA3). The sedimentary structures of the FA3 indicate deposition from bedload transport with different fluid flow and sediment discharge that is characteristic of braided sheetflood dominated alluvial fans (Palmer, 1997). These two stages (FA2 and FA3) are recorded as well-defined distinct successions in the Queih basin.\nThe migration of the locus of active faulting caused a major change in the depositional systems, marked by the substitution of the bed-load-dominated braided river system of the FA3 by a finer-grained one, with a large proportion of preserved floodplain deposits (FA4 and FA5, Fig. 5) in the upper member of the Queih basin (Fig. 12B). The juxtaposition of lacustrine deposits and subaerial deposits is a common record of basin faulting (e.g. Blair and McPherson, 1994). This abrupt change across the basin represents very rapid drowning of the palaeo-river valley. These finegrained deposits comprise crevasse-splay deposits (FA4), and siltstones–mudstones (FA5). They show repeated vertical recurrence (Fig. 5) and pass laterally into each other, revealing contemporaneous deposition. They are characterized by common evidence of sedimentary structures typical of deposition in a steep lake\nhe Queih basin. (A) lower member, (B) upper member.\nslopes and high water depth (especially for FA5). Moreover, synsedimentary soft sediment structures were noted. Typical transitional facies do not occur which suggests that the alluvial fan slopes were steep fault-related scarps and the proximal and midfan segments (FA2 and FA3, respectively) were inundated by a deep lake (for modern analogues see e.g. Harvey, 2005; Soreghan et al., 1999; Wells et al., 1999). Therefore, the lack of transitional facies can result from: (i) tectonic displacement, (ii) sharp facies change during sedimentation, or (iii) both causes. Absence of primary pyroclastic (Fa1) and debris-flow deposits (Fa2) in the upper member of the Queih basin suggests that this FA5 represents intereruptive conditions (Smith, 1991). The increased preservation of floodplain deposits suggest continuos sediment accumulation associated with long-term lake-level rise, which indicates a greater ratio of accommodation generation to sedimentation and higher subsidence rates (e.g., Shanley and McCabe, 1994; Wright and Marriott, 1993).\nTowards the top of the succession, loess deposits of the FA6 expand over the alluvial deposits. This may have been caused by the increase in the sand content of the alluvial systems as a consequence of the progressive denudation of the fault-scarp and rift shoulders. This would lead to an increase in the catchment area, resulting in a larger sand supply to the dune field. Another factor is a reduction in subsidence rates, resulting in a greater residence time of the sand in the depositional systems (cf. Almeida et al., 2009). The persistence of the denudation of source areas could result in a final decrease in the sediment yield, as tectonic quiescence and continuous erosion promoted planation of the catchment area. This phenomenon may have been responsible for the deposition of FA6 in the uppermost part of the Queih basin, indicating a starved aeolian system. At this stage, finer-grained particles dominated the supply, alluvial fans retreated, and lower subsidence rates favored aeolian reworking of the alluvial sediment. After the phase of rapid fan aggradation, sediment starvation occurred in intrachannel areas, as indicated by the development of paleosoils at the tops of the volcaniclastic bodies (Fig. 5)."

    "text": "Although the limited number of outcrops prevents detailed study of regional variation in fluvial architecture, the recognized facies assemblages, the abundance of high-flow horizontal lamination, the sheet-like architecture of the deposits, and the paucity of channel-shaped scours indicate that the volcano-sedimentary outcrops of the Queih basin were formed by low-sinuosity fluvial systems on a poorly unchannelized alluvial plain (Bentham et al., 1993; Diemer, 1992). Lack of vegetation in the Precambrian Queih basin would have enhanced flash flooding, rapid erosion, and lowsinuosity braided fluvial systems (e.g. Long, 1978). Similar facies assemblages have been described for low-sinuosity rivers flowing through unsymmetrical, extensional basins (i.e., grabens) (e.g., Mack and James, 1993) and for shallow, poorly unchannelized, bedload-dominated, braided fluvial systems (e.g., Cassiliano, 1998). The studied rock successions are considered to have accumulated in an under-filled type basin (Carroll and Bohacs, 1999) for two key reasons: (1) sediments of the fluvial deposits do not contain material from outside of the basin such as gneisses of the Gabal Meatiq, and (2) sediment accumulation was continuous throughout the stratigraphic sections.\nThe Queih basin shows strong asymmetry in cross-section geometry. The debris-flow dominated alluvial fan facies association (FA2) on steep proximal-fan slopes are exposed in a narrow zone in the northern eastern edge of the Queih basin (Fig. 2B). They lie with erosional contact directly on basement rocks, including Dokhan Volcanics (Figs. 2B and 7B). In addition, the steeper paleoslope and higher discharge rate (Figs. 3 and 6A) in the proximal part\nindicate that this part was closer to the margins of the sedimentary basin and topographic highs. The central part of the basin predominates deposits of a sheetflood dominated alluvial fan and/or shallow braided streams on the outer alluvial fan (Figs. 2B and 5). These lithofacies associations and the sedimentation patterns suggest a gradual transgressive stage of the accommodation base level from the FA2 and FA3 sedimentation until the deposition of the FA4 and FA5. This asymmetry may be a result of tectonic activity, maximum subsidence and sedimentation along one basin side, what is typical for strike-slip basins, especially of pull-apart type where parallel or oblique fault segments are separated in accordance with the horizontal separation linked with developing oversteps (e.g. Blair and Bilodeau, 1988; Mastalerz and Wojewoda, 1993; Nilsen and Sylvester, 1995). The east and west borders of the basin is limited by such faults (Fig. 2). Such facies pattern suggests the occurrence of an active margin on the Queih basin linked with the development of half-graben basin structures which accompanied the Queih basin due to the downward component of motion (Blair and Bilodeau, 1988) induced during strike-slip movements. Moreover, the composition of conglomerates filling the basin shows variability suggesting lithological differentiation of the source area.\nRecent contributions on sedimentation in alluvial settings strongly influenced by explosive volcanism (e.g. Kataoka and Nakajo, 2002; Martina et al., 2006; Nakayama and Yoshikawa, 1997) consider the alternation between syn-eruptive and inter-eruptive conditions as the most conspicuous factor affecting sedimentation in this kind of environment. These contributions agree with the classic model of Smith (1991), which includes meandering perennial streams dominated by a more lithologically diverse bedload during syn- and inter-eruptive periods. During syn-eruptive periods, the impact of the sudden influx of tremendous volumes of volcaniclastic debris into the sedimentary basin induces a rapid change of the drainage pattern to a braided configuration (e.g. Kataoka and Nakajo, 2002; Palmer, 1997), and the sediment composition is dominated by pyroclastic sediments (Smith, 1987). The record of contemporaneous pyroclastic eruptions in the lower member and its absence or rarity in the upper member suggests that a comparison with the Smith model is possible. In particular, the lower member would represent a fluvial system developed in a syn-eruptive period and the upper member reflects the adjustment of the fluvial system to an inter-eruptive period. Nevertheless, one difference with Smith’s model is the apparent similarity of the channel pattern in the syn-eruptive and inter-eruptive periods. The stability of the fluvial pattern indicates that the geomorphic threshold for aggradation was continuously exceeded (Smith, op.cit.). In the lower member, this effect could be explained by short-time intervals between the successive eruptions, which is consistent with the dominance of very poorly developed paleosoils and abundant of debrics flow and sheet-flood deposits. In the upper member, the persistence of the fluvial channel pattern can be explained by a high input of flood plain sediments. This model of periodic aggradation–degradation controlled by rapid volcanism-induced sedimentation is similar to those described in the literature (e.g., Nakayama and Yoshikawa, 1997; Smith, 1987; Waresback and Turbeville, 1990) and analogous to different modern examples in the Central Andes of Argentina and Chile."

    "text": "Meatiq and Sebai gneisses are bounded by NW–SE trending strike-slip faults that are parallel to the normal faults bounding Wadi Queih basin in the east (Fig. 1). The Queih basin is bound by northwest-trending steep shear zones and NW-dipping normal faults, reflecting general NW–SE extension. Moreover, the younger granite postdates the deposition of the Queih basin, although some\ngranitic pebbles exist within the framework of clast-supported conglomerates of FA2. The shape of the Queih basin, its position, and structural architecture suggested it to be of pull-apart origin. The bulk of the studied fluvial sediments was deposited in a mega half-graben bounded by basin margin faults and sediment accumulation took place under different fault-controlled subsidence regimes with intervening tectonically static periods. Also, the subsidence rate varied across the basin resulting in an asymmetric basin fill with the thickness increasing towards the north.\nThe Queih basin infilling is characterized by the domination of coarse-grained deposits and numerous local facies changes. Petrographic results of the source rock analysis for the Queih basin exclude the occurrence of high-grade metamorphic rocks (e.g. Meatig gneisses) in the source area for the predominant part of the basin. This distribution, as well as a strong facies pattern asymmetry might suggest that: (i) high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Queih area probably were not exposed during sedimentation of most of the strata, (ii) the paleo-relief was different than present, and (iii) the age of the conglomerates is more diversified than so far accepted. Amazingly, the Queih basin seem to be transgressive across the bounding fault (Fig. 2), what may suggest that this basin is younger than the surrounding basins in the CED (Fig. 1). Moreover, it is important to realise that tectonic activity in a strike-slip setting may create different structural styles along different segments of such faults, resulting in the development of different types of basins (see e.g. Nilsen and Sylvester, 1995). It should be noted, furthermore, that most of the sedimentary rocks deposited within post-amalgamation Hammamat Group basins close to the gneiss domes are deformed, clearly indicating that shearing outlasted the Hammamat sedimentations (Abdeen et al., 2008; Abdeen and Greiling, 2005). By inference, the investigated sedimentary basin in the Queih area has originated due to a transtensional regime that might have been connected with the cooling and exhumation of the metamorphic gneisses. The available data indicate that Meatiq Gneiss with protolith crystallization ages of 631 Ma (Andresen et al., 2009), 644 Ma and 1149 Ma (Loizenbauer et al., 2001), underwent peak metamorphism of 750 C and 8 kbar (about 27 km depth). This was followed by decompression to 4–5 kbar (13–17 km depth) (Neumayr et al., 1998) with a 40Ar/39Ar hornblende and muscovite age suggesting rapid cooling and exhumation at 587 Ma, 583 Ma, 580 Ma, and 579 Ma (Fritz et al., 2002). Muscovite from strike-slip and extension shear zones on the west and south of the Meatiq Dome yields plateau metamorphic ages of 588 Ma and 595 Ma indicating slip on the shear zones contemporary with 583 Ma exhumation within the dome (Fritz et al., 1996; Bregar et al., 2002). These ages of cooling and exhumation are conformable with the deposition of Dokhan Volcanics and Hammamat Groups in the ED (Breitkreuz et al., 2010; Wilde and Youssef, 2000). Besides, several Hammamat basins were formed adjacent to the metamorphic core complexes and domes in the CED (Fig. 1) and their formation is usually attributed to the exhumation of these core complexes during the final stage of ANS (650–550 Ma) (Fritz et al., 2002; Fritz and Messner, 1999; Greiling et al., 1994; Shalaby et al., 2006). The relationship between low-angle normal faulting, which controls exhumation of mid-crustal rocks, and large-scale strike-slip faults has also been documented in South Carolina, where high-grade pelitic schist was exhumed by synchronous crustal-scale strike-slip and normal faulting (Snoke and Frost, 1990).\nMany authors suggested that the Hammamat Groups in the most basins in the CED like El Mayah basin (Shalaby et al., 2006) and Igla basin (Rice et al., 1993) which are stratigraphically similar to the Queih basin, were initiated as a fault-bounded half-graben under transtensional regime and later evolved into a pull-apart basin under transpressional regime at a prominent bend in a sinistral shear system of the NFS (Fig. 1). Field, petrographical outcomes\nalong with geochemical data are consistent with the idea that the Queih basin may probably be correlated with the initial stage of structural evolution of the CED (transtension period). Furthermore, the post-depositional uplift, tectonic deformations and preQuaternary erosion in the investigated area might be correlated with the second stage of the CED evolution (transpression period). The structural framework suggested by Shalaby et al. (2006) is an attractive interpretation for some CED Hammamat basins as pullapart basins formed at releasing bends in the shear system, accommodating orogen-parallel extension on the flanks of structural highs. It should be concluded that a combination of extensional (transtensional regime) and strike-slip tectonic phases (transpressional regime) in the ED has been happened at interval 600– 530 Ma (Stern, 1985). The formation of the Dokhan Volcanics, Hammamat Groups, NW–SE sinistral shear zones, and associated thrusting in felsites may confirm the association of these tectonics (Akaad et al., 1993; El Kalioubi and Osman, 1996).\nAll Hammamat basins in the ED were characterized by fluviatile environments. They are likely to have formed as individual basins in different tectonic settings, rather than as a single large basin covering the entire area (Fig. 1). This is indicated by different subsidence mechanisms for different basins and also by the palaeocurrent directions in various basins (Grothaus et al., 1979). The fact that no marine influence has been found in any of the basins indicates that none of the basins ever subsided to large depths. This may be interpreted as evidence for a largely thin skinned tectonic environment during the Pan-African orogen (Shalaby et al., 2006)."

    "heading": "7. Summary and conclusion",
    "text": "The Queih basin is continental extensional basin dominated by subaerially-deposited successions. This basin records sedimentation in two successive fluvial systems with contrasting features. Six main facies associations composed of 12 lithofacies have been recognized in the successions filling the Queih basin: (1) lava flows and pedogenically modified pyroclastics facies association (FA1); (2) debris-flow-dominated alluvial fan facies association (Fa2); (3) sheetflood-dominated alluvial fan facies association (FA3); (4) crevasse-splay facies association (FA4); (5) lacustrine facies association (FA5); and (6) loess facies association (FA6). These facies assemblages are typical of low-sinuosity rivers flowing through unsymmetrical extensional basin. The low values of Chemical and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (CIA and PIA) for the Queih sediments are consistent with low intensity of chemical weathering under prevailing arid climate.\nA principal characteristic of the Queih basin was a change in the transport processes from nonconfined mass flow to stream flood in the lower member and from flood plain to aeolian condition in the upper member. During deposition of the lower member, pyroclastic sediments arrived as frequent ash falls and flows derived from a volcanic arc located to the north. Tephra deposits were reworked by fluvial networks during inter-eruptive periods (degradation stages) when volcanism ceased. In contrast, deposition of the upper member occurred in a fluvial floodplain setting (lacustrine deposits) without input of primary volcaniclastic detritus, indicating inter-eruptive conditions. During this member, the aeolian input of silt-sized pyroclastic–epiclastic detritus was very significant and primary pyroclastic-fall deposits were rare to absent. The Queih basin displays a range of features indicative of tectonically-controlled strike-slip basin. Its origin can be correlated with transtensional regime that occurred in the strike-slip Najd fault system during late Neoproterozoic times. Moreover, the highgrade metamorphic core of the Meatig and Sebai gneisses was probably not exposed during sedimentation in this basin. The non-existence of the metamorphic core complexes as an uplifted\nand eroded range is in concordance with the facies pattern in the Queih basin. The present-day shape of the Queih basin does not correspond to their original plan and is a result of post-sedimentary uplift and erosion."

  "abstractText": "Wadi Queih basin records different continental settings that interacted with explosive volcanism. This paper discusses the contrasting aggradational mechanisms in fluvial systems strongly influenced by explosive volcanism which took place during sedimentation of the Queih basin. Six main facies associations composed of 12 lithofacies have been recognized in the Neoproterozoic succession filling the Queih basin: (1) lava flows and pedogenically modified pyroclastics facies association, (2) debris-flow-dominated alluvial fan facies association, (3) sheetflood-dominated alluvial fan facies association, (4) crevasse-splay facies association, (5) lacustrine facies association, and (6) loess facies association. These facies assemblages are typical of low-sinuosity rivers flowing through unsymmetrical half graben basin. Petrographical and geochemical data of the Queih sediments indicate a predominantly continental volcanic block provenance and stable craton to fault-bounded basement uplift. Low values of Chemical and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (CIA and PIA) are consistent with low intensity source rock weatherning under prevailing semi-arid to arid climate. During deposition of the lower member of the Queih basin, common fall and flow tuff events occurred, indicating syn-eruptive conditions. In contrast, deposition of the upper member occurred in a fluvial– aeolian setting without input of primary volcaniclastic detritus, indicating inter-eruptive conditions. The change in depositional mode from the lower to upper is considered to be due to a change in the balance between the sedimentation rate and the rate of lake-level rise. Lithofacies stacking and rapid lateral changes of lithological units in conjunction with interformational unconformities and basin margin faults suggest tectonically induced sedimentation. Volcanism can also influence basin evolution and the delicate balance between erosion, sedimentation, and prevalent transport processes is affected the Queih basin by volcanic input. Thus, the Queih basin records the response of fluvial system to large, volcanism-induced sediment loads. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
