It marks a knickpoint along the Colorado River at the top of the steep Grand Canyon, and it is central to debate about the patterns of erosion and sources of uplift in this famous landscape. New chronostratigraphic data from the suite of fi ll terraces here indicate a strong fl uvial response to climate drivers superimposed upon an integrated mid-to-late Pleistocene incision rate of ~350 m/m.y. A regional compilation of well-constrained results over the same timescale reveals that this is intermediate between slower rates downstream in Grand Canyon and even faster rates in the central Colorado Plateau, which taper off again farther upstream near the plateau’s eastern edge. This bull’s-eye pattern of rapid incision in the central Colorado Plateau does not match proposed sources of uplift from mantle dynamics at the south and west fl ank of the plateau, nor patterns of river steepness and energy. Instead we suggest that this incision pattern is primarily driven by transient response to drainage integration and isostatic feedback from the deep exhumation of weak rocks in the central plateau."

    "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "The upper Colorado River fl ows through the heart of the Colorado Plateau in the American Southwest, carving a landscape of deep canyons alternating with broad valleys and mesas. A transition exists at the historic river crossing of Lee’s Ferry, Arizona, where the Colorado River exits Glen Canyon and the Mesozoic stratigraphy of the central plateau, and begins its steep plunge through the older rocks of Marble and Grand Canyons (Fig. 1). Here the Paria River joins the Colorado River, and a relatively wide valley has been carved, allowing greater preservation of Quaternary deposits (see Item DR1 in the GSA Data Repository1). The well-exposed suite of Pleistocene terraces provides a record of fl uvial history pertinent to long-standing scientifi c controversies, including debates on the uplift of this landscape over Cenozoic time and its apparently youthful incision (e.g., Powell, 1875; Davis, 1901). A recent burst of research utilizing new geochronology, geophysics, and modeling has put this region in the spotlight again, and the diverse data sets and geodynamical debates being exercised in this landscape are applicable to all orogenic plateaus.\nIncision of the Colorado Plateau by the Colorado River and its tributaries is the result of a large-scale reversal in drainage direction over late Cenozoic time. There is an early and middle Cenozoic ancestry of uplift and paleocanyon drainage that was directed northeast along the southwestern fl ank of the Colorado Plateau (e.g., Lucchitta, 1972; Young and McKee, 1978). Yet it is well established through extensive chronostratigraphy that the Colorado drainage as we know it became integrated off the plateau and through the lower Basin and Range at ca. 5.6 Ma (e.g., Lucchitta, 1972; House et al., 2005; Dorsey et al., 2007). This late Cenozoic baselevel connection has driven river incision upstream, but this has been\nat least partly decoupled from the more protracted Cenozoic uplift providing erosion potential in this landscape. Several sources of post-Laramide regional uplift have been proposed for the Colorado Plateau. These include buoyancy modifi cations of the mantle lithosphere linked to a history involving the Farallon slab (e.g., Humphreys et al., 2003; Roy et al., 2009), regionalized dynamic support from convecting asthenosphere and mantle drips (Moucha et al., 2009; van Wijk et al., 2010; Levander et al., 2011), and isostatic rebound due to unloading by erosion and extension (Pederson et al., 2002a; Roy et al., 2009). Indeed, the origin of the Lee’s Ferry knickpoint itself is debated as either a pinned adjustment between reaches of differing uplift rates or substrate resistance, or a transient baselevel signal from drainage integration (e.g., Karlstrom et al., 2008; Cook et al., 2009; Pederson and Tressler, 2012).\nReconstructing patterns of fl uvial incision, which sets the pace of erosion in the broader landscape, is a means for evaluating some of these ideas. Using terraces as markers, baselevel-driven river incision rates can be calculated that are integrated over shorter climate-driven oscillations. We present here new mapping, geochronologic, and survey data from the fl uvial terraces at Lee’s Ferry. These provide the best-constrained late Pleistocene incision rate in the Colorado Plateau at a key location between previous work downstream in Grand Canyon and upstream around Glen Canyon. The Lee’s Ferry record, along with other comparable incision constraints along the trunk rivers of the plateau, reveal a distinct pattern of faster incision in the central plateau, which has implications for sources of uplift and controls on topography in the region."

    "text": "We mapped and recorded the sedimentology of Pleistocene deposits in the Lee’s Ferry area, including ~4 km up the Paria tributary (Fig. DR1 in the Data Repository). Cross-sectional total station surveys were conducted to document terrace treads, straths, and sample locations. These fi eld measurements are combined with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure dating to reconstruct the Colorado River’s history of deposition and incision.\nSand samples for OSL were collected at strategic stratigraphic positions in each terrace fi ll and analyzed following the single-aliquot regenerative protocol for quartz sand (Murray and Wintle, 2000; full methods are provided in Table DR2 in the Data Repository).

Full TCN results and methods are in Item DR3. To constrain TCN inheritance, we modeled results from a depth profi le from the tread of the M4 terrace, which fi ts well with the surface concentration of the desert pavement, as presented in Hidy et al. (2010). We adopt this inheritance calculation as the general estimate for these Colorado River deposits during each episode of aggradation, which is supported by our other TCN results in Grand Canyon (Pederson et al., 2006). Our TCN ages fi t nicely with OSL ages, and all geochronology results in Table DR1 are reported with 2σ internal and external errors added in quadrature."

    "heading": "RESULTS",
    "text": "Nine distinct mainstem Colorado River deposits (M1–M9) have been identifi ed in our Lee’s Ferry mapping area with at least 13 terrace levels beveled upon them (including fi ll-cut terraces) (Fig. DR1; Fig. 2). The M1 is a sandy sequence of Holocene deposits along modern channel margins mapped in detail by Hereford (2004) and not discussed further here. Pleistocene deposits are generally ~30 m in thickness where fully preserved, and have irregular basal contacts (Fig. 2). Terrace heights range from 10 m (M2) to ~190 m (M9) above the modern channel and exhibit moderately to well-developed desert pavements, with the exception of the high M8 and M9 terrace remnants that have complex and exhumed petrocalcic soils. The M9 soil profi le was estimated by Lucchitta et al. (2000) to be ~500 k.y. old. The OSL results from Paria River fi ll terraces (P2–P5) within 2 km of its mouth are included in Table DR1 as supporting ages for fi ll deposits, because aggradation at the confl uence corresponds to baselevel control along the Colorado River. In addition, a 10-m-thick deposit (J3) graded to the M3 and ~1 km up the small Johnson Wash tributary within the mapping area was recorded and sampled (Fig. 2; Fig. DR1). Kaufman et al. (2002) report an amino-acid age on snails of ca. 40 ka near the top of this, which is consistent with our ca. 74–43 ka OSL depositional ages (Table DR1).\nGeochronology from the M5 through M2 deposits and terraces indicates characteristic ~40 k.y. cycles of aggradation and incision (Fig. 3) that correlate strongly with mainstem deposits in eastern Grand Canyon (Pederson et al., 2006). The oldest dated deposit is the M5, with one sample’s OSL signal saturated (>130 ka) and another from a correlated Paria deposit dating to ca. 142 ka. Both a TCN age estimate from the M5 tread and an OSL result from the M5y fi ll-cut terrace confi rm that incision was ongoing by ca. 125 ka (Fig. 2). The large M4 deposit records deposition from just before 118 ka to after 97 ka, and then terrace abandonment and incision ca. 90 ka. The subsequent M3 deposit has depositional ages of 76 and 75 ka, but TCN results indicate that the preserved terrace tread was\nnot abandoned until ca. 40 ka. Finally, the M2 deposit (23–15 ka) is partly exposed at Lee’s Ferry and interpreted as also preserved beneath the river channel here.\nThis reconstruction of the cyclical fl uvial history enables us to calculate a baselevel-driven bedrock incision rate integrated through the climate-driven episodes of aggradation and pulses of incision (Fig. 3), an approach described in detail in Pederson et al. (2006). With the exception of the M4, the true basal straths of terraces are obscured in the fi eld area; and besides, the best estimate of background incision is the trend through the center of each fi ll deposit, at analogous positions within each fl uvial cycle (Fig. 3). The result is an incision rate of ~35 cm/k.y. (350 m/m.y.) here at Lee’s Ferry."

    "heading": "DISCUSSION",
    "text": "Quaternary incision rates have been estimated at several other localities along the Colorado River drainage, providing context for the Lee’s Ferry results. Yet it is important to compare “apples to apples.” We fi rst compile results from studies that have multiple age determinations at a locality, and from unequivocally interpreted contexts linked to river incision. Just as important, we compare rates calculated only over mid-to-late Pleistocene time and not longer, million-year spans (cf. Wolkowinsky and Granger, 2004; Karlstrom et al., 2008, 2012). This avoids the systematic tendency for slower process rates when averaged over longer time spans\nSE NW\nH ei\ngh t a\nbo ve\nre fe\nre nc\ne st\nag e\n(m )\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\nM4\nM3y\nM5y M5\nJ3\nM9\nM8\nM7\nM6\nM2 M1\n23 ka 76 ka37 ka\n75 ka 104 ka\n97 ka\n125 ka 142 ka 74 ka 43 ka\n>124 ka\n>84 ka 91 ka\n>38 ka\n118 ka\nTriassic Shinarump\nTriassic Moenkopi\nPermian Kaibab\n? ?\nFigure 2.

Secondarily, we do include a few incision points from the height of the 640 ka Lava Creek B tephra in locations where other data are lacking, but as minimum estimates only.\nIncision rates based on Ar-Ar dated basalt fl ows capping river gravels western Grand Canyon are only 70–90 m/m.y. (Lucchitta et al., 2000; Pederson et al., 2002b; Karlstrom et al., 2008), yet well-constrained incision rates upstream of this in eastern Grand Canyon are ~140 m/m.y. over the same time period (Pederson et al., 2006) (Fig. 4A, locations a–c). The 350 m/m.y. incision rate at Lee’s Ferry is two to four times higher than those reported in Grand Canyon, extending the previously recognized trend of increasing rates upstream (Lucchitta et al., 2000). Indeed, this trend continues with even higher incision rates of 420–450 m/m.y. or more from TCN results in the Glen Canyon region (Fig. 4A, locations e–h), including the Henry Mountains and along the major tributary Fremont River (Davis et al., 2001; Garvin et al., 2005; Marchetti and Cerling, 2005; Cook et al., 2009). A 450 m/m.y. incision rate based on U-series and OSL ages from terrace deposits near the town of Green River, Utah, confi rms that high rates continue across the Canyonlands region (Burnside, 2010) (Fig. 4A, location i). Incision rates taper off still farther upstream, where OSL ages from terraces near Grand Junction, Colorado, indicate incision rates averaging ~270 m/m.y. (Aslan and Hanson, 2009) (Fig. 4A, location k), and lower rates in this area are supported by estimates based on exposures of the Lava Creek B tephra (locations j, l, and m). A return to higher rates is evident upstream of the plateau in some tributaries in the Colorado Rockies, associated with knickzones from recent drainage capture and mantle anomalies (Aslan et al., 2010; Karlstrom et al., 2012).\nIn overview, Lee’s Ferry lies on the fl ank of a central Colorado Plateau bull’s-eye of rapid incision. The contours of Figure 4A only illustrate a pattern in trunk-river incision, not of denudation rates across interfl uves, and the pattern certainly needs testing in areas lacking data. Dampened incision rates in western Grand Canyon have been explained by subsidence along normal faults there (Pederson et al., 2002b; Pelletier, 2010); however, we must identify a cause for rapid incision in the central plateau. To get at this, it is important to recognize the surprising inverse correlation between incision rates and patterns of river steepness and stream power (Figs. 4B and 4C) (Pederson and Tressler, 2012). The steep, narrow river through Grand Canyon actually accomplishes slower bedrock incision than in the much lower-gradient and -energy Glen Canyon reach, with the transition corresponding to the bedrock change at Lee’s Ferry. Indeed, Cook et al. (2009) suggest that there is a pulse of transient incision around Glen Canyon from the ca. 6 Ma drainage integration or a more recent drop in baselevel of unknown source. Modeling results indicate that such a signal would be partly held up by the harder bedrock in Grand Canyon while passing rapidly through the soft bedrock of Glen Canyon (Cook et al., 2009; Pelletier, 2010). These lines of evidence, and the fact that incision rates are faster upstream and slower downstream, strongly suggest that the Lee’s Ferry knickpoint is mostly a pinned adjustment to bedrock, not a transient moving headward through the system (Pederson and Tressler, 2012).\nIntriguingly, there is also a stark mismatch between this pattern of incision focused in the central plateau and recently proposed mantle dynamic support of topography along the southwestern fl ank of the plateau (Moucha et al., 2009; van Wijk et al., 2010). Also, somewhat inboard of these lie areas of recently interpreted crustal delamination and mantle drip (Levander et al., 2011) (Fig. 4A). Levander et al. (2011) and Karlstrom et al. (2012) suggest these match a region of fastest incision in the eastern Grand Canyon and Lee’s Ferry area, contrary to our fi ndings here (Fig. 4A). Although delamination and drip should contribute uplift, rates are unconstrained and these anomalies lie beneath the southwestern and western fl ank of the bull’s-eye of incision rather than its center. Instead, a remarkably well-matched source of rock uplift is the fl exural rebound from up to 3 km of late Cenozoic exhumation focused squarely in the weaker Mesozoic rocks of the central plateau canyonlands (Fig. 4B) (Pederson et al., 2002a; Hoffman et al., 2011; Karlstrom et al., 2012). We suggest that this positive feedback accounts for the relatively rapid incision there. In summary, although the central plateau bull’s-eye of incision was surely initiated by the transient baselevel signal of drainage integration, and although it may incorporate mantle contributions of uplift across its southwest fl ank, we hypothesize it is largely the product of a matching bull’s-eye of isostatic uplift. This adds to an emerging theme in this region—the contrast between the geophysically mundane but spectacularly eroding central Colorado Plateau and the notably different geodynamics along its edges.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/41/4/427/3544804/427.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\n430 www.gsapubs.org | April 2013 | GEOLOGY"

  "abstractText": "| April 2013 | www.gsapubs.org 427 ABSTRACT Lee’s Ferry (Arizona, United States) lies at an important geologic transition between the Grand Canyon margin and the Canyonlands center of the Colorado Plateau. It marks a knickpoint along the Colorado River at the top of the steep Grand Canyon, and it is central to debate about the patterns of erosion and sources of uplift in this famous landscape. New chronostratigraphic data from the suite of fi ll terraces here indicate a strong fl uvial response to climate drivers superimposed upon an integrated mid-to-late Pleistocene incision rate of ~350 m/m.y. A regional compilation of well-constrained results over the same timescale reveals that this is intermediate between slower rates downstream in Grand Canyon and even faster rates in the central Colorado Plateau, which taper off again farther upstream near the plateau’s eastern edge. This bull’s-eye pattern of rapid incision in the central Colorado Plateau does not match proposed sources of uplift from mantle dynamics at the south and west fl ank of the plateau, nor patterns of river steepness and energy. Instead we suggest that this incision pattern is primarily driven by transient response to drainage integration and isostatic feedback from the deep exhumation of weak rocks in the central plateau."
