Continental arc volcanoes 9\nmay produce more CO2 than most other types of volcanoes due to the interaction of 10 magmas with sedimentary carbonates stored in the continental upper plate. As such, global 11 flare-ups in continental arc magmatism may amplify atmospheric CO2 concentrations, 12 leading to climatic warming. However, the high elevations of continental arcs may also 13 enhance orographic precipitation and change global atmospheric circulation patterns, 14 possibly increasing the efficiency of chemical weathering and drawdown of atmospheric 15 CO2, which may subdue the climatic warming response to volcanic activity. To better 16 evaluate the climatic response, we develop models that integrate magmatic crustal 17 thickening, topographic uplift, isostasy and erosion. The topographic response is used to 18 predict how soil formation rates, soil residence times, and chemical weathering rates vary 19 during and after a magmatic episode. Although magmatism leads to crustal thickening, 20 which requires topographic uplift, highest elevations peak ~10 My after magmatism ends. 21 Relatively high elevations, which enhance erosion and chemical weathering of the 22 continental arc, persist for tens of million years after magmatism ends, depending on 23 erosion kinetics. It has recently been suggested that the Cretaceous-Paleogene greenhouse 24 (high atmospheric CO2 and warm climate) coincided with a global chain of continental 25 arcs, whereas mid- to late Cenozoic icehouse conditions (low atmospheric CO2 and cold 26 climate) coincided with a lull in continental arc activity after 50 Ma. Application of our 27 models to the Sierra Nevada (California, USA) continental arc, which represents a segment 28 of this global Cretaceous-Paleogene continental arc, reproduces the observed topographic 29 and erosional response. Our models require that the newly formed continental arc crust 30\n© 2015.

Thus, in the aftermath of a global continental arc flare-up, both the total 32 volcanic inputs of CO2 decline and the average weatherability of continents increases, the 33 latter due to the increased proportion of widespread remnant topography available for 34 weathering and erosion. This combination leads to a decrease in the long-term baseline of 35 carbon in the ocean/atmosphere system, leading to cooling. Mid-Cenozoic cooling is often 36 attributed solely to increased weathering rates associated with India-Eurasian collision and 37 the Himalayan orogeny. However, the total area of now-extinct Cretaceous-Paleogene 38 continental arcs is 1.3-2 times larger than that of the Himalayan range front and the 39 Tibetan plateau combined, suggesting that weathering of these remnant volcanic arcs may 40 also play a role in drawing down CO2 through silicate weathering and subsequent 41 carbonate burial. In summary, if global continental arc flare-ups lead to greenhouse 42 conditions, long-lived icehouse conditions should follow in the aftermath due to decreased 43 CO2 inputs and an increase in regional weathering efficiency of remnant arc topography. 44 45 46 47 1. Introduction 48 Climate, that is, Earth’s surface temperature, is modulated by solar insolation, albedo and 49 greenhouse gas concentrations, such as CO2, in the atmosphere. Of interest here are long-term 50 (>10 My) variations in Earth’s climatic baseline. For example, Earth appears to vacillate 51 between long (>50 My) warm intervals, where there are no significant continental ice sheets like 52 the Cretaceous-Paleogene, to long cold intervals, where ice sheets are important, such as the 53 mid-Cenozoic to present (Zachos et al., 2008). Compared to the Archean, when the sun was 54 dimmer and there may have been fewer continents, long-term variations in solar insolation and 55 albedo (mostly due to exposed continental surface area) during the Phanerozoic were not large 56 enough to play an important role in long-term variation in climate (Caldeira and Kasting, 1992). 57 This leaves variations in atmospheric CO2 as the primary influence on the long-term climatic 58 baseline. 59 On >1 My timescales, the fluxes of carbon within the exogenic system, that is between 60 the ocean, atmosphere and biosphere, are closely balanced, which means that long-term 61\nvariations in atmospheric CO2 are controlled by inputs from the endogenic to the exogenic 62 system via volcanism, metamorphism, and oxidative weathering of fossil organic carbon and by 63 outputs from the exogenic system via silicate weathering and biological productivity in the form 64 of carbonate and possibly organic carbon burial (Berner, 1991; Berner et al., 1983; Kerrick, 65 2001; Kerrick and Caldeira, 1994; Ridgwell and Zeebe, 2005; Walker et al., 1981). Silicate 66 weathering rates scale with atmospheric CO2, hence carbonate precipitation represents a negative 67 feedback (Walker et al., 1981). To illustrate, the rate of change of carbon in the 68 ocean/atmosphere system on long timescales is given by 69\noain oa kMJ dt\ndM  (1) 70\nwhere Moa is the mass of carbon in the ocean+atmosphere system, Jin represents volcanic and 71 metamorphic degassing, and the second term represents carbonate deposition in response to 72 silicate weathering with k being a kinetic rate constant describing the global efficiency of 73 weathering (e.g., weatherability). In reality, weathering rates (e.g., kMoa) are a complex function 74 of a wide variety of factors, so the linear kinetics assumed here are meant only to illustrate a 75 concept. Thus, in Eq. 1, the inverse of k (e.g., 1/k) is the response time of the ocean+atmosphere 76 system to peturbations. Because the response time for silicate weathering and subsequent 77 carbonate burial are less than 100 ky, inputs and outputs should be in balance and the global C 78 system should be near steady state on timescales >1 My (Berner et al., 1983; Zeebe and Caldeira, 79 2008). Global CO2 drawdown via silicate weathering can only be as large as global CO2 inputs 80 Jin. 81 Climate, however, clearly varies on timescales greater than 1 My, as evidenced by long-82 lived greenhouse and icehouse oscillations throughout Earth’s history. What drives these long 83 term secular changes is one of the most perplexing problems in the Earth sciences. Since the left 84 side of Eq. 1 is zero on long timesclaes, the long-term steady state carbon content in the 85 ocean+atmosphere is given by 86\nk\nJ M inoa ~ (2) 87\nThus, while global CO2 drawdown and CO2 inputs are balanced, long term changes in the actual 88 carbon content of the atmosphere+ocean system are possible if there are changes in the external 89 inputs driving the system (Jin) or in the overall weathering kinetics (k) modulating the system or 90\nboth. For example, secular variations in the dynamics of the Earth’s deep interior might set CO2 91 inputs (Kerrick, 2001; Kidder and Worsley, 2010; Larson, 1991). Increased mid-oceanic ridge 92 spreading and eruption of flood basalts have been suggested to have driven the long-lived (150-93 50 Ma) Cretaceous-Paleogene greenhouse (Berner, 1991; Hong and Lee, 2012; Kidder and 94 Worsley, 2010; Larson, 1991). Mid-Cenozoic cooling has been suggested to be linked to India-95 Eurasia collision and the rise of the Tibetan plateau, which led to enhanced kinetics of 96 physical/chemical weathering (Edmond, 1992; France-Lanord and Derry, 1997; Raymo and 97 Ruddiman, 1992; Zachos and Kump, 2005). Thus far, most studies treat changes in inputs and 98 weatherability independently. 99\nWhat happens when magmatism and mountain building are linked? Such may be the 100 case for volcanic arcs. Volcanic arcs are a large source of CO2, which derives from background 101 mantle CO2, decarbonation of subducted carbonates, and magmatically induced thermal 102 metamorphism of carbonates in the upper plate (Burton et al., 2013; Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 103 2010; Hilton et al., 2002; Lee and Lackey, 2015; Lee et al., 2013; Marty and Tolstikhin, 1998). 104 Averaged over 10-50 My, intra-oceanic arcs may not be as important as continental arcs in terms 105 of net CO2 inputs into the exogenic system (arc flux minus subduction flux). This is because 106 much of the carbonate subducted may just come back out through the volcanoes, or as recently 107 suggested, some of the carbonate subducted may bypass the volcanic front, given modern 108 thermal states of subducting slabs (Dasgupta, 2013; Kerrick and Connolly, 2001). It is in 109 continental arcs, where the effect of upper plate carbonates may be most pronounced because 110 continental margins serve as long-lived storage sites for sedimentary carbonate accumulated over 111 a continent’s history (Lee and Lackey, 2015; Lee et al., 2013). Magmatic interaction with upper 112 plate carbonates can serve to enhance the magmatic flux of CO2 (Chadwick et al., 2007; Deegan 113 et al., 2010; Toutain et al., 2009) such that changes in the global ratio of continental to island 114 arcs might be expected to lead to variations in global CO2 inputs to the exogenic system. Global 115 continental arc flare-ups, perhaps associated with super-continent dispersal, have been suggested 116 as leading to greenhouse conditions in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (Lee et al., 2013). Continental 117 arcs, however, are some of the highest elevations on Earth as exemplified by the modern Andean 118 mountain belt in South America. They define long linear mountain belts on the margins of 119 continents. Their high elevations might be expected to enhance erosion rates, which in turn may 120\nincrease chemical weathering rates, culminating in more carbonate deposition and organic 121 carbon burial. 122 Continental arcs are thus a source and a sink for CO2. But to evaluate the role of 123 continental arcs on long-term climate variability, we must ask whether volcanism and weathering 124 are synchronized, and if not, to what extent are they out of phase? The answer to these questions 125 lies in understanding how magmatism, uplift and erosion are related. This paper is about the rise 126 and fall of continental arcs and the effect on climate. 127 128 2. Controls on elevation and crustal thickness 129 2.1 Isostasy 130 On long wavelengths (>10 km) and timescales (>10 ky), high elevations are controlled by 131 isostasy, supported by either thickened, low density continental crust or anomalously hot, and 132 hence low density, asthenospheric mantle. To first order, however, most high (>2 km) mountain 133 belts are isostatically supported by largely thickened crust, as can be seen by the fact that high 134 elevations h generally correlate with crustal thickness H (Fig. 1a). The slope of this correlation 135 is controlled primarily by the effective integrated density contrast between the crust (ρc) and 136 mantle (ρm), 137  mcdHdh  /1/  (3) 138 which assumes differences in the density of crust beneath mountain belts and lowlands are small 139 compared to the density contrast between the mantle and the crust (Fig. 2). Importantly, regions 140 of high elevations (mountain belts) fall roughly along the same slope even though they are 141 formed in very different tectonic settings; for example, the Andes represent a chain of 142 continental arc volcanoes and the Tibetan plateau is formed by a largely amagmatic continent-143 continent collision (Fig. 1a). We can thus assume that the average density of thick continental 144 crust is similar, which implies that the primary control on high elevations is crustal thickness. 145 There are, of course, some notable deviations. Antarctica and Greenland fall on a much steeper 146 slope (not shown) because they are overlain by ice, which has a density of 1 g/cm 3 , much lower 147 than crustal and mantle rocks (2.7-3.3 g/cm 3 ). Some cratonal areas define slopes too shallow to 148 be explained by any reasonable variation in crustal densities, and may be compensated by 149 thermal density anomalies within the lithospheric mantle. In some cases, such as in northeastern 150 Canada, the topography is not isostatically compensated due to delayed viscous response from 151\nrapid ice sheet unloading. Some high elevations are supported by anomalously hot 152 asthenospheric mantle. Because we are concerned with timescales longer than the viscous 153 response time of the mantle (10-100 ky), isostasy is always assumed. We also ignore the effects 154 of density variations in the mantle because these effects represent deviations from the overall 155 relationship between elevation and crustal thickness and are thus of secondary importance for 156 this study. 157 158 2.2 Interplay between magmatic thickening and erosion 159 Crustal thickness represents the balance between addition and subtraction of mass to the 160 crustal column (Fig. 2a). Crustal thickening is caused by magmatic inflation/underplating or 161 tectonic shortening while thinning is caused by erosion/exhumation, delamination, or tectonic 162 extension. The effects of tectonic thickening on erosion and climate have been extensively 163 studied (Molnar and England, 1990; Willet and Brandon, 2002), but the effects of magmatic 164 thickening have received almost no discussion despite many orogenic belts being associated with 165 continental arc magmatic flareups, e.g., the Andes. In this paper, we are interested in the 166 magmatic and geomorphic evolution of continental arcs and their potential effects on climate 167 because recent studies have suggested that the length of continental arcs in the Cretaceous and 168 early Cenozoic was substantially longer than that in the late Cenozoic (Lee et al., 2013) (Figs. 169 2a-c). For these reasons, we examine here the endmember in which thickness is modulated by 170 magmatic additions and erosion; the equations are easily modified in the next section to account 171 for tectonic thickening/thinning and delamination. 172 The rate at which crustal thickness H changes is given by 173 EMdtdH / (4) 174\nwhere M is magmatic volume flux (km 3 /km 2 /My) and E is the erosion rate (km/My) (Fig. 1). 175 We assume that erosion rate is proportional to average steepness (h/w), that is, )/( whE  , 176\nwhere h is the peak elevation of the magmatic mountain belt (relative to some regional base 177 level), w is the width of the magmatic belt, and β is an erosional constant describing the 178 efficiency of transport (km/y) (Simoes et al., 2010). Because we are only interested in the 179 average steepness of the mountain, not the mountain’s overall morphology, we keep the width of 180 the mountain constant, from which it follows that erosion rate is linearly related to elevation 181 instead of slope (see Culling (1960) and Jadamec et al. (2007) for discussions modeling erosion 182\nvia diffusion law). This is an obvious simplification, but allows us to develop an analytical 183 solution when a forcing, such as magmatism, is applied. The erosional constant β is related to the 184\nresponse time E for erosion 185  /wE  (5) 186\nE is related to the product of precipitation rate p (mm/y) and substrate erodibility (m -1 ), that is 187 (Simoes et al., 2010), 188 1)(  pkeE (6) 189\nAccording to Simoes et al. (2010), E ranges from 0.5-300 My across the globe. The low end 190 (0.5 My) describes regions like Taiwan in which precipitation rates are high and bedrock is made 191 up of easily erodible rocks like shales. The high end (~25-300 My) describes arid regions like the 192 Namibian craton where precipitation rates are orders of magnitude lower. Simoes et al. (Simoes 193\net al., 2010) obtained a world-averaged ke of 1.8410 -7 m -1 . We cannot meaningfully ascribe an 194 average precipitation rate for all continental arcs because precipitation rates will depend on the 195 position and orientation of mountain belts relative to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns. 196 For example, mountain belts in the intertropical convergence zone experience mean annual 197 precipitation of 6-10 mm/d, whereas those at 30° N and 30° S may experience relatively dry 198 climates (1-2 mm/d). We might also expect significant asymmetry in mean annual precipitation 199 across a mountain belt due to rain-shadow effects. For example, in the central Andes, the mean 200 annual precipitation in the eastern slope ranges from 2-8 mm/d but on the western slope is less 201 than 1 mm/d. We thus adopt a range of mean annual precipitation between 1-8 mm/d. 202\nCombining with the global average ke yields erosion timescales E ranging from ~14 My for very 203 arid conditions (mean annual precipitation = 1 mm/d) to 1.75 My for relatively wet 204 environments. Taking the global average mean annual precipitation of 2.67 mm/d would yield a 205\nE of ~6 My. 206\nIsostasy relates excess elevation h to excess crustal thickness H via Hh mc )/1(  207 (see Sleep (1971) and Jadamec et al. (2007)). Combining all of the above equations yields an 208 equation that describes how crustal thickness evolves 209\nHM dt\ndH\nm\nc\nE             1 1 (7) 210\nAssuming, for now, that M is constant, integrating Eq. 5 then yields H as a function of time 211\n  LL totL eHeMH  //1   (8) 212 where Ho is initial crustal thickness before initiation of magmatism and τL is defined as 213 )/1/( mcEL   (9) 214 which is the landform relaxation time, not to be confused with the erosion response time τE. 215 Equation 8 is similar in spirit to Equation 8 of Sleep (1971). The second term in Eq. 8 describes 216 the rate at which crustal thickness thins by erosion if the magmatic production rate is zero. The 217 first term describes the balance between erosion and magmatic production. When t approaches 218 infinity, crustal thickness reaches a steady state, e.g., dH/dt=0 in Eq. 7, wherein the erosion rate 219 equals the magmatic production rate (Figs. 3a-c). Steady state thickness is given by 220\n)/1/( mcEL MMH   (10) 221 and steady state elevation by 222 EMh  . (11) 223 At steady state, crustal thickness and elevation depend on magmatic production rate and the 224 erosion rate constant: high magmatic production rate yields thick crust and high elevations while 225 a high erosion rate constant yields thinner crust and lower elevations. Note that steady state 226\ncrustal thickness is influenced by isostasy because the term )/1( mc  in Eq. 10 is non-zero. 227 Steady state elevation, however, is independent of isostasy. This is obvious from the lack of the 228 isostatic term in Eq. 11, but also follows intuitively from the fact that erosion rate is directly 229 controlled by elevation and only indirectly controlled by crustal thickness. 230 The time it takes for the landform to approach steady-state (so-called “equilibrium” 231 landscape) is given by Eq. 9, which states that elevation responds to magmatic thickening on 232 timescales dictated by the kinetics of erosion and modulated by the effects of isostasy, but not on 233 the magmatic production rate (if it is constant). If the erosion timescale τE is short, then 234 landforms (e.g., average surface elevation) respond and attain steady state rapidly. The 235 contribution of isostasy (in the form of density contrast between crust and mantle) to the 236 landform response time τL is substantial (Sleep, 1971). For a crustal density of 2.87 g/cm 3 and a 237 mantle density of 3.33, the landform response time τL is ~6.6 times greater than the erosional 238 time τE due to isostasy. To illustrate, consider a mountain 1 km above baseline. If the mountain 239 is not isostatically compensated by a root (i.e., ρc=0 or if the mountain is supported elastically), 240 then eroding only 1 km of crust is sufficient to bring elevations back to base-level. However, if 241\nthe mountain is isostatically compensated by a buoyant root, 6 km of rock must be eroded to 242 return to base-level because erosion leads to rock uplift (England and Molnar, 1990). Failure to 243 account for isostasy leads to under-estimation of the timescales of geomorphic equilibration. 244 These concepts are illustrated in Figure 3a-c for an instantaneous magmatic influx, which 245 is held constant. The scenario presented here is clearly unrealistic and is only meant to illustrate 246 the behaviors described above. We have assumed M to be constant at 3 km/My and considered 247 three erosional response times: 1.5, 6, and 15 My. The landform response times required to 248 reach steady state elevations are clearly evident from the figures. It can also be seen that if 249 magmatism is sustained at such high levels for >20 My, unrealistically high elevations and 250 crustal thicknesses are attained for erosional response times of 6 and 15 My. The fact that we do 251 not see such high elevations and crustal thicknesses in nature must mean that erosional 252 timescales are shorter, magmatic fluxes are smaller, or the duration of sustained magmatic 253 activity in one given location is shorter than the values assumed in this thought experiment. An 254 additional problem is that there is no limit to how deep the crust can grow. The generation of 255 dense mafic cumulates in the lower crust, followed by their foundering, provides a way of 256 limiting crustal thickness by basal processes. Below, we discuss coupled effects of cumulate 257 foundering and erosion. 258 259\n2.3 The effect of dense cumulate formation and lower crustal foundering 260\nIt is well-known that the lower crust in thick (>45 km) arcs consists of mafic cumulates 261 and restites in the form of garnet pyroxenites (DeBari and Sleep, 1991; Ducea and Saleeby, 262 1996; Greene et al., 2006; Jagoutz and Schmidt, 2012; Lee, 2014; Lee et al., 2006; Lee et al., 263 2007). Garnet pyroxenites are denser than peridotitic mantle, so they should founder into the 264 mantle once critical thickness is attained. The value of this critical thickness is likely to be 265 highly variable as it depends on density and viscosity of the pyroxenite, the latter depending on 266 temperature. In some places, like the Sierra Nevada batholith, it is clear that a garnet pyroxenite-267 bearing layer extending from ~45 km depth down to at least 70 km (lithosphere thickness may 268 have extended to depths >90 km) developed in the late Cretaceous and persisted until the late 269 Miocene before foundering (Ducea and Saleeby, 1996; Lee et al., 2006). As the pyroxenite layer 270\ngrows in thickness, surface elevations subside due to the growing mass excess in the crustal 271 column (Fig. 2b). Elevation h is given by 272\ntot\nm\npx\nb\nm\nc px\nm cpx HHhh                          11 (12) 273\nwhere px, c, and m are the densities of the pyroxenite, normal crust, and mantle, hpx is the 274 depth at which pyroxenite begins to form, Hb is the thickness of the background crust (e.g., at sea 275 level), and Htot is the total thickness of the crust, including the pyroxenite layer. The thickness of 276 the pyroxenite layer Hpx is given by Htot - hpx. Thus, the change in elevation per change in 277 pyroxenite layer thickness is given by (Lee, 2014) 278\n         m px pxdH dh   1 (13) 279\nEquation 13 is applicable to both thickening and thinning of the pyroxenite layer. Thus, if the 280 pyroxenite layer thins, perhaps by foundering, elevations rise again. Incorporating equations 12 281 and 13 into the mass transport equations in the previous section is best done numerically by 282 considering the amount of pyroxenite to represent the fraction of the crust that lies deeper than 283 the depth at which pyroxenite begins to form. In all of these calculations, we are interested in 284 timescales longer than 10-100 ky, such that all long wavelength mountain ranges can be assumed 285 to be in isostatic equilibrium. 286 The effects of pyroxenite formation for constant magmatic forcing can be seen in Figure 287 3d-f. Here, we have assumed hpx = 65 km, Hpx = 35 km and px = 3.5 g/cm 3 . This means that 288 garnet pyroxenite forms at depths greater than 65 km and after if reaches 35 km in thickness, it 289 undergoes rapid wholesale foundering back into the mantle, resetting the crustal thickness to 65 290 km. Our models show that crustal thickness and elevation rise up and down with a sawtooth 291 pattern. When crustal thickness exceeds 65 km, the formation of a growing pyroxenite layer 292 causes a gradual drop in elevation. When the pyroxenite layer thickness exceeds 35 km, the 293 pyroxenite is removed rapidly (instantaneously in our model), resulting in a rapid return to high 294 elevations. But since we have assumed a constant sustained magmatic flux M, elevations start to 295 decline again because the pyroxenite layer resumes growing. Note that if erosion response times 296 are short (efficiency of erosion is high), then erosion is efficient enough to limit crustal thickness 297 from growing beyond 65 km, preventing dense pyroxenite formation. 298 299\n2.4 Other effects not considered in our models 300\nThere are other processes that we did not consider here. One is the effect of arc front 301 migration. The second is the effect of tectonics on thickening or thinning the upper plate in 302 magmatic arcs. Tectonic effects on climate have been explored in depth, but how magmatism 303 influences tectonic shortening rates, for example, or how tectonics influences magmatism, have 304 not been explored in great detail. One could envision magmatism weakening the lower crust by 305 heating it up, thereby decreasing the resistance to tectonic forces. In addition, thickening of the 306 upper plate decreases the “headspace” for decompression melting, and thus, magmatic 307 thickening may itself be a self-limiting process (Karlstrom et al., 2014). Finally, we have not 308 considered gravitational collapse in our models (Bird, 1991; Jadamec et al., 2007; Molnar and 309 Lyon-Caen, 1988). 310 311\n3. Application to the Cretaceous Sierra Nevada magmatic flare-up in North America 312\n3.1 Forward models with non-steady magmatic production rates 313 We now consider the more realistic scenario in which magmatic production rate M is not 314 constant, requiring Eq. 2 to be solved numerically. We motivate our model with the Cretaceous 315 Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Ranges batholiths in California, USA (Fig. 4), which flared up 316 most recently between ~120 and ~85 Mya (My ago) based on a compilation of U-Pb zircon ages 317 in sediments and plutons (Ducea and Barton, 2007; Ducea et al., 2015; Paterson and Memeti, 318 2014; Paterson et al., 2014; Paterson et al., 2011) (Fig. 5a). During this ~40 My interval, 319 magmatic flux rises, peaks at ~95 Ma, and then declines. What leads to long-lived magmatic 320 flare-ups in continental arcs is unclear, but possibilities include changes in plate motion, 321 lithospheric thinning by delamination/convective removal, and underthrusting of continental 322 lithosphere in the back-arc region (Ducea and Barton, 2007 ). The eventual decline and 323 termination of magmatism could be caused by thickening of the arc crust (e.g., by magmatism), 324 which limits the extent of decompression melting in the asthenosphere (Chin et al., 2015; 325 Karlstrom et al., 2014). For the purposes of this paper, we take the observed flareup as given. 326 To simulate the growth of the Sierran arc, constraints on the magmatic flux, that is, the 327\nvolume flow rate per unit area (e.g., km/Ma or km 3 /km 2 /Ma), are needed. Flux is a difficult 328 quantity to obtain because only the area of exposed plutons and their ages can be obtained. The 329\nvertical dimension of plutons cannot be directly obtained because the rocks of interest are either 330 already eroded or in the subsurface. Nevertheless, it may still be possible to approximate 331 average, arc-wide fluxes. Figure 5b shows the total volume of magmas added to the crust per 332 million year estimated by determining the total surface area of plutons in the Sierra Nevada 333 batholith per age, multiplying by a nominal value of 30 km, which corresponds to the thickness 334 of the crust as defined by the Moho, and adjusting this volume based on the total percent of 335 plutonic versus host rocks established from maps for different depths of the crust (Paterson and 336 Ducea, 2015). This total magmatic addition can then be averaged per area of arc. Estimated in 337\nthis way, the volume flow rate peaks at ~1.510 5 km 3 /My at ~95 Ma. Dividing the volume flow 338\nrate by total area of the batholith (~800 km  100 km) yields a peak magmatic flux of ~1.8 339 km/My. If mafic cumulates are considered as part of the magmatic flux, the estimated flux is 340 doubled to ~3.6 km/My, assuming a ~1:1 ratio of felsic crust to mafic cumulates. It is likely that 341 these estimates of magmatic addition are minimum bounds because erosion was not considered 342 in the calculations. However, knowing the exact number is not crucial because we are interested 343 primarily in general trends of magmatically evolving mountain belts. We will consider peak 344 magmatic fluxes between 1.8-3.6 km/My in our forward models. 345 To simulate the Sierran magmatic flareup, we assume that magmatic flux is zero at 120 346 Ma, rises linearly to the peak magmatic flux at 100 Ma, and then declines linearly to zero by 80 347 Ma. We have chosen to keep the magmatic evolution with time linear and symmetric, mainly to 348 keep the model simple and general. We assume a reference mantle density m of 3.33 g/cm 3 349 (Lee, 2003). We assume an average continental crust density of c of 2.87 g/cm 3 , which we take 350 as the best fit of equation 1 to the elevation (h) versus crustal thickness (H) data of mountain 351 belts (h>2 km) in Figure 1. This regression also gives us an estimate of the baseline thickness of 352 hb = 30 km of continental crust at sea level (e.g., at the continental margin). We consider erosion 353 response times τE of 1.8, 6, and 16 My to explore the full range of behaviors. These erosion 354 response times correspond to landform relaxation timescales of τL are ~11, ~36 and ~84 My. 355 We first consider the case in which no garnet pyroxenite forms. Model results are shown 356 in Figure 6 for magmatic fluxes with peak flux Mmax = 1.8 km/My and 3.2 km/My. Because M is 357 not constant, the system is never at steady state. Peak erosion is of course delayed after peak 358 magmatism, but depending on erosion kinetics (1/τE) the delay can range from 5 to 20 My. For 359 erosion response times of 1.5 My, erosion nearly keeps up with magmatism as expected: the 360\nerosional flux is concentrated in a narrow pulse, resulting in high erosional fluxes just after peak 361 magmatism; maximum elevations and crustal thicknesses are limited. For longer erosional 362 response times (e.g., 6-15 My), erosion rates are low, which slows down the decrease in crustal 363 thickness and elevation, resulting in a long and protracted (>50 My) post-magmatic interval of 364 erosion. For peak magmatic flux of 1.8 km/My, we obtain peak elevations between 1-4 km for 365 the range of erosional response times considered here. For reasons discussed above, a peak 366 magmatic flux of 3.2 km/My is likely more realistic for the Sierra Nevada, but this results in 367 peak elevations of 6-8 km for erosional response times of 6 and 15 My, which seem unrealistic. 368 Peak elevations, however, will be suppressed if the crust thickens enough to stabilize 369 garnet pyroxenite in the lower crust. To explore this effect, we define the critical depth at which 370 garnet pyroxenite forms to be hpx = 65 km, the critical thickness of the pyroxenite prior to 371 foundering to be Hpx = 35 km, the density of pyroxenite px to be 3.5 g/cm 3 , which is 5% denser 372 than our nominal mantle density of 3.33 g/cm 3 . Clearly, temperature contrast between the crust 373 and the mantle plays a strong role in density contrast, but garnet pyroxenite densities can also 374 vary from 1-10% relative to the mantle due to composition alone (Lee et al., 2006). The mafic 375 pyroxenite layer may also be interleaved with peridotites. This density contrast of 5% is thus 376 chosen to encapsulate the integrated compositional and temperature effects on density in the 377 mafic lower crust. Similarly, the depth at which garnet pyroxenite forms depends on bulk 378 composition, and given the transitional nature of crustal composition with depth, our choice of 379 hpx is only considered approximate. Again, our interest lies evaluating the effect of parameter 380 variability in overall trends and behavior. 381 The effects of pyroxenite formation on crustal thickening and elevation change are shown 382 in Figure 7. Only the case for Mmax of 3.2 km/My is shown because the crust never reaches 383 thicknesses that exceed hpx of 65 km for the case in which peak Mmax is 1.8 km/My and thus 384 remains unchanged from Figure 6a-d. It can be seen from Figure 7 that once crustal thickness 385 exceeds 65 km, elevation stops rising, and because elevations are subdued, erosion rates cannot 386 continue to rise. In fact, continued thickening of a pyroxenite layer due to progressive magmatic 387 addition causes elevations and erosion rates to decrease. However, once magmatism ends, 388 erosion will thin the crust, and in so doing, the thickness of the pyroxenite layer Hpx also 389 decreases because the top of the layer is transported to depths shallower than the pyroxenite 390 transition hpx and metamorphoses back into plagioclase-bearing rock. Thus, after magmatism 391\nends, surface elevation rises slightly. But once the pyroxenite layer is completely converted to 392 plagioclase-bearing lithologies, that is, crustal thickness decreases below hpx of 65 km, elevations 393 subside again because the only control on elevation is crustal thickness (not vertical density 394 variations). In our models, it can be seen that for very short erosional response times (1.5 My), 395 pyroxenite never forms because the crust never thickens sufficiently. Only for higher erosional 396 response times (6 and 16 My) does the pyroxenite layer form; in both of these cases, elevations 397 peak at ~4 km followed by a long (>50 My) tail of sustained high elevations. 398 399 3.2 Comparison to Sierran geomorphic evolution 400 The most important conclusion of our analysis is that magmatic flare-ups are 401 accompanied by erosion and that high elevations can persist long after magmatism ends. U-402 Th/He thermochronology and coupled studies of pluton barometry and U-Pb geochronology 403 provide some constraints on the paleo-depths of plutons as a function of time (Ague and 404 Brimhall, 1988; Cecil et al., 2006; House et al., 1998; House et al., 1997; Paterson et al., 2014; 405 Wakabayashi and Sawyer, 2001) as can be seen in Figure 5. These paleo-depth-time constraints 406 can be used to place bounds on erosion rates, which we show in Figure 8 in comparison to our 407 modeled erosion rates. What is clear is that observed erosion rates are low before 100 Ma, 408 highest between 100-50 Ma, and low again between 50-0 Ma. That is, erosion rates are low 409 before magmatism and are highest during the latter half of the magmatic flare-up, with high 410 erosion rates continuing for 30 My after magmatism terminates. Our observations indicate a 411 delayed erosional response. Erosional response times of 1.5 My are too short to explain the 412 observations and response times of 15 My appear to be too long. This suggests that the 413 appropriate erosional response time to adopt is intermediate, consistent with the global average 414 response time of 6 My used here. We note that our models for M = 1.8 and 3.2 km/My for 415 erosional response times of 6 My (with or without pyroxenite formation) are all consistent with 416 the observations to within error (Fig. 8a). Based on earlier discussions, however, a peak 417 magmatic flux of 1.8 km/My is most certainly a minimum bound and a value of ~3 km/My may 418 be more reasonable. 419 Adopting Mmax of 3.2 km/My and an erosional constant of 6 My, we find that models that 420 do not allow for garnet pyroxenite formation yield peak elevations of 6 km, but when pyroxenite 421 formation is included, peak elevations are 4 km. We can compare our model outputs to paleo-422\naltimetry constraints. Elevations prior to the Cretaceous magmatic flare-up were likely low or 423 close to sea-level based on the fact that Cretaceous plutons intruded into 150-190 Ma old marine 424 sediments throughout the Sierras, such as the Mariposa Formation (Cao et al., 2015; Paterson et 425 al., 2014). Oxygen isotopic constraints suggest elevations reached ~3 km by ~85 Ma, indicating 426 that magmatism was accompanied by surface uplift (Poage and Chamberlain, 2002). These high 427 elevations may have persisted until the Miocene (Poage and Chamberlain, 2002). Today, the 428 Sierran crest reaches ~4 km high, but given the sparse data constraints, it is not clear if these high 429 elevations represent residual Cretaceous elevations or if they reflect late Cenozoic uplift. Indeed, 430 the western Sierra Nevada foothills are characterized by over-steepened Miocene paleochannels, 431 which indicates that there has been significant westward tilting and crest uplift in the Pliocene 432 uplift (Huber, 1981). There is insufficient data to evaluate whether Sierran elevations decreased 433 in the mid-Cenozoic and rose again or whether elevations have remained high ever since 434 magmatism terminated ~80 Ma ago. Our model results, however, would suggest that elevations 435 may have subsided, but only moderately, such that elevations still remained at 2 km ~40 Ma ago. 436 Pliocene uplift could have been superimposed on this gradual but moderate decline in elevation. 437 438\n4. Continental arc volcanism and regional chemical weathering 439\nIt is natural now to explore the effects of uplift and physical weathering on regional 440 chemical weathering. We assume that chemical weathering occurs primarily when the rock is in 441 residence in the soil mantle overlying the bedrock, where soil is distinguished from bedrock in 442 having higher porosity owing to chemical weathering and bioturbation. Soil formation processes 443 occur on timescales much faster and length scales much shorter than secular changes in orogenic 444 activity, so the details of soil formation on overall erosion rates was ignored in Section 2. 445 However, as we show below, chemical weathering fluxes are strongly influenced by soil 446 residence time because it dictates what fraction of the physically eroded material is chemically 447 weathered (dissolved). 448 The rate at which the soil mantle thickness z changes is a competition between the rates 449 of bedrock-to-soil production P (km/My) and erosion E (km/My) that is, 450 EPdtdz / (14) 451\nHere, we assume that P and E are representative averages of the mountain and that E, as 452 described in Eq. 4, depends on average topographic gradient. We assume that the soil formation 453 rate decays exponentially with depth in the soil mantle, that is, 454\nDz oePP / (15) 455 where Po is the bedrock to soil production rate of fresh bedrock surface (e.g., when soil mantle 456 thickness is zero) and D is the characteristic lengthscale over which soil production decays with 457 depth (Heimsath et al., 1997) (Fig. 9a). This equation requires that Po>E at all times. The decay 458 lengthscale D describes how the efficiency of bedrock to soil conversion decreases with depth; D 459 should be large when precipitation rate, bioturbation and/or bedrock permeability (fracture 460 density) is high. Combining equations 14 and 15 leads to a differential equation, which can be 461 integrated to yield soil mantle thickness versus time 462\n              DEto Dzo e E P e E P Dz o / / ln (16) 463\nIt can be seen that if Po=E, an infinitesimally small soil mantle forms (e.g., z=0), that is, erosion 464 and bedrock-to-soil conversion at the surface are equal. Eq. 16 also indicates that soil mantle 465 thickness reaches steady state when t is longer than the soil formation response time 466\nEDS / (17) 467 The steady state soil mantle thickness is given by (Heimsath et al., 1997) 468\n)/ln( EPDz o (18) 469\nwhich is attained if S is less than the landform relaxation time L . Figure 9b shows soil mantle 470 thickness z as a function of time for different net erosion rates E. When erosion rates are high 471 (due to high elevations and high magmatic production), soil mantle thickness is very thin. When 472 erosion rates are low, thick soil mantles develop. Steady state soil mantle thickness is attained 473 rapidly when erosion rates are high. 474 We now evaluate chemical weathering fluxes. We assume that most of the chemical 475 weathering occurs in the soil profile. We ignore weathering in river bedload and in depositional 476 basins because we assume that bedload is evacuated quickly in mountainous regions and 477 sedimentation rates in orogenic-driven basins is too fast to permit significant post-depositional 478 weathering. We consider chemical weathering associated with soil formation for the condition in 479\nwhich S is less than L . At steady state soil mantle thickness, the residence time of any particle 480 in the soil mantle is given by 481\n              E P E P E D E z o S o res lnln  (19) 482\nFor a given soil mantle thickness, the higher E is, the shorter the residence time (Fig. 9c). The 483 mass fraction of material in the soil mantle that remains after dissolution fw should decrease with 484 increasing residence time of a particle in the soil mantle. The quantity fw represents the 485 availability of weatherable material, that is, fw=1 corresponds to relatively unaltered bedrock and 486 fw=0 corresponds to a highly depleted residue (e.g., a laterite would be an extreme case of 487 weathering). 488 To describe how fw evolves with time, we adopt an inverse time relationship 489 following Maher and Chamberlain (Maher and Chamberlain, 2014) 490 1)1(  resww kf  (20) 491\nwhere kw is the inverse response time (s -1 ) and is a function of the dissolution rate constant 492 (which depends on pCO2, pH, mineral composition, etc.) and the effective surface area of 493 mineral grains in the soil mantle (Maher and Chamberlain, 2014). A high kw implies more 494 efficient or rapid chemical weathering and faster approach to fw = 0. For a given kw, when the 495 residence time of particles in the soil mantle is short, weathering intensity is small so fw 496 approaches 1. When the residence time is high, weathering intensity is high so that fw approaches 497 zero and saprolitic or lateritic soils are generated. The time-integrated fraction of material lost by 498 dissolution is 1-fw. The time-integrated chemical weathering flux W is then 499 W = E(1-fw) (21) 500 that is, the chemical weathering flux is controlled by the physical weathering flux E and the 501 intensity of weathering (1-fw). Maher and Chamberlain emphasize a link between riverine solute 502 flux and water flow (runoff) and suggest that regional chemical weathering fluxes can thus be 503 predicted by runoff. We do not model runoff here, and instead, relate weathering flux to erosion, 504 but the outcome of our weathering calculations should be similar. Global compilations of river 505 chemistry show that runoff and erosion correlate, so chemical and physical erosion also correlate 506 (Gaillardet et al., 1999; Millot et al., 2002). High elevations should also increase runoff rates due 507 to increased orographic precipitation (Maher and Chamberlain, 2014; Montgomery et al., 2001). 508\nThe development of soil mantles and chemical weathering fluxes can be evaluated if 509 values of Po, D and kw are known. These quantities will undoubtedly vary as a complicated 510 function of biology, precipitation rate, pCO2, bedrock composition, and soil and bedrock 511 permeability (West, 2012). Calibrating this functional relationship requires empirical constraints 512 from the field or laboratory, which are currently too sparse to span all relevant variable space. 513 Maher and Chamberlain (2014) adopt of chemical weathering decay time (1/kw) of ~10 ky 514 appropriate for granitic systems, but given that kw depends on reactive surface area, which itself 515 can vary by an order of magnitude in granitoids, this number should be considered approximate. 516 Dixon et al. (2012) estimate values of Po (~0.23 km/My) and D (~30 m) for the currently 517 uplifting San Gabriel Mountains in southern California. If we adopt these numbers, we find that 518 the chemical weathering flux goes to zero between the peak of magmatism and ~25 My after 519 magmatism terminates, after which it rises (Fig. 10). This is because physical erosion rates E 520 exceed the maximum bedrock-to-soil production rate. The San Gabriels, however, represent an 521 unusually arid endmember (Dixon et al., 2012) so Po and D might be expected to be significantly 522 higher for larger mountain ranges, which tend to induce more orographic precipitation. 523 Adopting a higher value for Po will give finite chemical weathering rates (Fig. 10), but even if 524 we adopt an unusually high value of 1 km/My, chemical weathering rates are subdued when 525 elevations are highest (or more accurately, when average slope is highest) and physical 526 weathering rates are highest. For example, if we assume Po of 0.8 km/My, we obtain finite 527 chemical weathering rates, but such rates are low during and immediately after the magmatic 528 flare-up, only to increase ~20 My after magmatism ends. Adopting an even higher Po of 1 529 km/My would increase syn-magmatic chemical weathering rates, but a long tail of chemical 530 weathering will continue to persist for >50 My after magmatism ends. In summary, chemical 531 weathering and physical erosion in general correlate, but at very high erosion rates, chemical 532 weathering is kinetically limited by the short residence time of rock in the soil mantle on eroding 533 landscapes (Dixon et al., 2012; Ferrier and Kirchner, 2008; Hilley et al., 2010; West et al., 2005). 534 It is during the geomorphic relaxation of the residual topography, where erosion rates are high, 535 but not too high, that chemical weathering fluxes are highest (Fig. 10). Our models thus predict 536 a long (>50 My) tail of enhanced regional chemical weathering after magmatism wanes. 537 Finally, another prediction of our model is how the composition of the weatherable 538 substrate evolves. As shown in Figures 10d and e, when elevations and erosion rates are high, 539\nthe substrate would be geochemically more juvenile, that is, closer to original magmatic 540 compositions. As elevations subside and erosion rates decline, the substrate would be represented 541 by more deeply weathered lithologies, perhaps approaching lateritic compositions under the right 542 climatic conditions. Saprolites are abundant throughout the Sierra Nevada, and based on the fact 543 that they are capped by Eocene gravels and Miocene lava flows, these saprolites must have 544 formed before the Eocene (Lindgren, 1911). A powerful test of the concepts introduced here 545 would be to investigate how the alteration degree (such as the Chemical Index of Alteration) of 546 siliciclastics shed off of the Sierra Nevada and into the Great Valley changes with time. Our 547 models predict alteration degree to be low in the late Cretaceous and high in the Cenozoic. 548 549 5. Implications for long-term climate change: icehouse-greenhouse pairs 550 Although we have focused our discussions so far on the Sierra Nevada, California, the 551 Sierras are only part of a global chain of continental arcs that were active during the Cretaceous 552 and early Paleogene (Bateman and Eaton, 1967; Ducea et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2013). This chain 553 of continental arcs extended along the southern, southeastern and eastern margins of Eurasia and 554 along the entire western margins of North and South America, altogether totaling 33,000 km, 555 which is 200% longer than the length of continental arcs in the mid-Cenozoic to present (Lee et 556 al., 2013) (Fig. 4c). Much of the continental arc magmatism in western North America waned by 557 the mid-Cenozoic. All of the southern and southeastern Eurasian continental arcs terminated ~50 558 Ma due to the collision of India with Eurasia and large-scale rollback in the western Pacific, 559 which culminated in the formation of the Tonga-Izu-Bonin-Kermadec island arc system ~52 Ma 560 (Ishizuka et al., 2014). Lee et al. (2013) have suggested that this global flare-up of continental 561 arc volcanism may have led to greenhouse conditions of the Cretaceous and early Paleogene 562 because many of the continental arc volcanoes intersected and interacted with ancient crustal 563 carbonates stored on the continental upper plate (Fig. 4c); by contrast, the upper plate in intra-564 oceanic settings has comparatively less carbonate. As a consequence, this flare-up in continental 565 arc volcanism and associated decarbonation of crustal carbonates may have led to enhanced CO2 566 outputs from the Earth’s interior (Dasgupta, 2013; Lee and Lackey, 2015; Lee et al., 2013). The 567 second consequence of such an extensive flare-up of continental arcs in the Cretaceous-568 Paleogene is a >50 My aftermath of relict topography underlain by relatively juvenile crust 569 susceptible to sub-aerial chemical weathering. Widespread occurrence of saprolite in the Sierra 570\nNevada and Peninsular Ranges batholiths and in the batholiths of southern and eastern China, 571 attest to prolonged and continued weathering of the Cretaceous-Paleogene arcs (Lindgren, 1911). 572 Mid to late Cenozoic cooling has often been attributed to the rise of the Tibetan plateau, 573 leading to global increases in weatherability and efficiency of CO2 removal. Here, we suggest 574 that both long-term greenhouses and icehouses are ultimately controlled by external drivers of 575 CO2 inputs from the endogenic to the exogenic system, that is, on long timescales weathering 576 outputs of CO2 are only as high as that supported by volcanic+metamorphic inputs (Berner and 577 Caldeira, 1997). Thus, when inputs are high (continental arc stage), atmospheric pCO2 is high, 578 and when inputs subside (island arc stage), atmospheric pCO2 subsides (see Eq. 2). We suggest 579 that the rise and fall of global continental arc flare-ups may be the primary driver of greenhouse 580 and icehouse fluctuations. Cooling in the aftermath of a flare-up may be further enhanced 581 because of the increase in regional weatherability due to the large areas of remnant arc 582 topography. While the weathering rate per unit area of the Himalayan front is likely much 583 higher than that of remnant arc topography because of more active tectonics in the former, the 584 total weathering output associated with remnant arcs may nonetheless be significant. The area of 585 the Tibetan plateau is 2.5 million km 2 , whereas the Cretaceous-Paleogene continental arcs 586 generated 3.3-5 million km 2 of elevated relict topography assuming an arc width of 100-150 km 587 (Lee et al., 2013). Furthermore, most of the chemical weathering in Tibet occurs in narrow belts 588 along the southern and eastern margins of the plateau where orographic effects are strongest (Wu 589 et al., 2008). By contrast, continental arcs are long and narrow, hence a greater fraction of 590 volcanic arc mountain belts might be expected to undergo chemical weathering than the Tibetan 591 plateau (although the intensity of weathering would be less in the remnant arcs). Thus, if a 592 global Cretaceous-Paleogene continental arc system indeed existed, their topographic remnants 593 must have contributed a significant proportion of the global chemical weathering sink in the mid 594 to late Cenozoic, with or without India-Eurasian collision. Whether these remnant arcs are more 595 important than the Himalayan orogeny in terms of weathering flux cannot be answered in this 596 study. Our study suggests that the exact role of Himalayan weathering in Cenozoic climate may 597\nnot be straightforward. For example, the rise in seawater 7 Li/ 6 Li, a tracer of chemical 598\nweathering, occurs ~20 My before the rise of seawater 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, a tracer of the source of 599 weathered material, making it difficult to attribute both to the Himalayan orogeny (Misra and 600 Froelich, 2012; Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992). Finally, because the collision of India with 601\nEurasia around ~50 Ma coincides with the shift from continental arcs in southern and eastern 602 Eurasia to the initiation of intra-oceanic arcs in the western Pacific, disentangling the relative 603 effects of continental arcs, continental collisions, and island arcs on seawater isotope proxies 604 may be difficult. 605 606 6. Summary and future directions 607 Our analysis shows that magmatism, uplift and erosion are intimately linked, and hence, 608 these connections should be considered in understanding the evolution of magmatic arcs. 609 Importantly, if continental arcs emit large quantities of CO2 and if the generation of juvenile 610 crust in the form of long mountain belts enhances chemical weathering, global flare-ups in 611 continental arc magmatism should influence long-term climate evolution. If global continental 612 arc flare-ups indeed lead to greenhouse conditions, icehouse conditions may then be a direct 613 consequence of these flare-ups due to the protracted weathering of remnant topography after 614 magmatism wanes. Currently, explanations for long-lived greenhouse or icehouse conditions 615 typically invoke unique and unrelated processes, such as the emplacement of large igneous 616 provinces for greenhouses and continental collisions for icehouses. The concepts presented here 617 provide an internally consistent way to explain why long-term climatic baselines change. 618 A full test of the climatic implications of our model will ultimately require conversion of 619 our model outputs into CO2 volcanic inputs and carbonate and organic carbon outputs. In the 620 meantime, there are some potentially fruitful avenues for testing these hypotheses. One is to 621 track global flare-ups in continental arc magmatism using detrital zircon geochronology, under 622 the likely assumption that zircons predominantly derive from felsic rocks, which are more 623 abundant in continental arcs than in island arcs and flood basalts. For example, detritical zircon 624 geochronology has now been used to show that the cold climate of Ediacaran times coincides 625 with a lull in global continental arc magmatism, while the greenhouse climate of the Cambrian 626 coincides with a global flare up in continental arc magmatism (McKenzie et al., 2014). 627 Extending these concepts throughout the Phanerozoic would be ideal. A second test would be to 628 better quantify how erosion fluxes vary with time, using the composition and mineralogy of 629 siliciclastics to constrain how the intensity of weathering changes during and after magmatic 630 episodes. 631 632\nAcknowledgments 633 We thank Tien Chang Lee and Peter Molnar for detailed informal reviews, insight and 634 encouragement.

  "abstractText": "Continental arcs, such as the modern Andes or the Cretaceous Sierra Nevada 8 batholith, are some of the highest topographic features on Earth. Continental arc volcanoes 9 may produce more CO2 than most other types of volcanoes due to the interaction of 10 magmas with sedimentary carbonates stored in the continental upper plate. As such, global 11 flare-ups in continental arc magmatism may amplify atmospheric CO2 concentrations, 12 leading to climatic warming. However, the high elevations of continental arcs may also 13 enhance orographic precipitation and change global atmospheric circulation patterns, 14 possibly increasing the efficiency of chemical weathering and drawdown of atmospheric 15 CO2, which may subdue the climatic warming response to volcanic activity. To better 16 evaluate the climatic response, we develop models that integrate magmatic crustal 17 thickening, topographic uplift, isostasy and erosion. The topographic response is used to 18 predict how soil formation rates, soil residence times, and chemical weathering rates vary 19 during and after a magmatic episode. Although magmatism leads to crustal thickening, 20 which requires topographic uplift, highest elevations peak ~10 My after magmatism ends. 21 Relatively high elevations, which enhance erosion and chemical weathering of the 22 continental arc, persist for tens of million years after magmatism ends, depending on 23 erosion kinetics. It has recently been suggested that the Cretaceous-Paleogene greenhouse 24 (high atmospheric CO2 and warm climate) coincided with a global chain of continental 25 arcs, whereas midto late Cenozoic icehouse conditions (low atmospheric CO2 and cold 26 climate) coincided with a lull in continental arc activity after 50 Ma. Application of our 27 models to the Sierra Nevada (California, USA) continental arc, which represents a segment 28 of this global Cretaceous-Paleogene continental arc, reproduces the observed topographic 29 and erosional response. Our models require that the newly formed continental arc crust 30"
