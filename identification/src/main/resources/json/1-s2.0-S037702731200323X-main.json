Detailed textural and stratigraphic relationships of aggregates are examined in six of the ten erupted units, which range from relatively dry styles of eruption and deposition (units 2, 5) to mixed (units 6, 7, 8) and dominantly wet (unit 3). Aggregate structures and grain size distributions shift abruptly over vertical scales of cm to dm, providing diagnostic features to identify deposits emplaced primarily as vertical fallout or pyroclastic density currents (PDCs). The six categories of ash aggregates documented here are used to infer distinct volcanic and meteorological interactions in the eruption cloud related to dispersal characteristics and mode of emplacement. Our field observations support the notion of Brown et al. (2010, Origin of accretionary lapilli within ground-hugging density currents: evidence from pyroclastic couplets on Tenerife. Geol. Soc. Am. Bull. 122, 305–320) that deposits bearing matrix-supported accretionary lapilli with concentric internal structure and abundant rim fragments are associated with emplacement of PDCs. However, on the basis of grain size distributions and field relationships, it is inferred that these types of ash aggregates formed their ultrafine ash (dominantly b10 μm) outer layers in the buoyant plumes of fine ash lofted from PDCs, rather than during lateral transport in ground-hugging density currents. The propagation of voluminous PDCs beneath an overriding buoyant cloud –whether coignimbrite or vent-derived in origin – is proposed to generate the observed, concentrically structured accretionary lapilli by producing multiple updrafts of convectively unstable, ash-laden air. The apparent coarsening of mean grain size with distance from source, which is observed in aggregate-bearing fall facies, reflects a combination of multi-level plume transport and enhanced proximal fallout of fine ash (b250 μm) by aggregation. Gravitational fallout and melting of abundant ice in the clouds was likely to have contributed a key source of liquid water for wet aggregation in near-source areas. In contrast, deposits from relatively drier eruption phases are aggregate-poor in proximal areas, yet develop loosely-bound particle clusters and mm-scale massive ash pellets >100 km from vent. It is inferred that ambient meteorological conditions play a more important role in ash fallout in these cases. Entrainment of moist air, and distal subsidence and melting of ice carried by the plume, are both likely to have contributed to the observed features of late-stage aggregation in the drier phases of eruption. These observations suggest that proximal, column-influenced aggregation processes, which weaken with distance from source, are overprinted by secondary, later-stage aggregation mechanisms farther downwind.\n© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Aggregation plays a central role in the injection, transport and deposition of ash from explosive eruption clouds (Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982; Brown et al., 2012 and references therein). Although some degree of aggregation is thought to occur in all eruptions generating fine ash, it is a particularly important process in volcanic clouds incorporating abundant water. As a result, the deposits and fallout patterns of ‘wet’ eruptions (incorporating non-magmatic, external water into the volcanic plume) exhibit distinctive differences to their dry counterparts\n: +64 4 463 5463. Eaton).\nrights reserved.\n(Walker, 1971, 1981a; Self and Sparks, 1978; Houghton et al., 2000). Defining the conditions under which varying spatial and temporal scales of aggregation occur in eruption clouds has practical implications for understanding the dispersal patterns of volcanic ash, and is crucial to interpreting deposits from wet eruptions.\nAlthough the signatures of aggregation in deposits are frequently used to examine the dynamics of plume development in past eruptions, the range of processes leading to the observed spectrum of aggregate types poses a number of challenges. A key complication is that the various styles of aggregation affect fallout patterns of volcanic ash at different stages of plume development. For example, aggregation can be triggered immediately after eruption due to incorporation of surface water at the vent (Tomita et al., 1985), or many hours afterwards\n(100 s to 1000 s of kilometers downwind) by entrainment of tropospheric moisture or melting of ice carried in the plume (Durant et al., 2009). These spatiotemporally variable sources of liquid water and ice also respond to changes in eruption style (e.g. buoyant rise vs. column collapse), resulting in overprinting of multiple processes. The purpose of this study is to document the delicate balance between plume dynamics and availability of water on the behavior of eruption clouds, as recorded in the resulting deposits. Distinctive styles of ash aggregation are defined and classified in deposits from one of the largest water-rich eruptions yet documented (the Oruanui eruption of Taupo volcano, NewZealand) as ameans of investigating these dynamic feedbacks.\nThe term ash aggregate is used here in a broad sense to refer to all clusters of volcanic ash particles. These clusters are bound together by cohesive forces related to one or more of: electrostatic attraction (Schumacher, 1994; James et al., 2002, 2003), liquid water (Gilbert and Lane, 1994; Schumacher and Schmincke, 1995; Telling and Dufek, 2012) and ice (Brown et al., 2012; Van Eaton et al., 2012a), followed by cementation, which develops more permanent solid bridges between grains. A number of previous field-focused studies have mapped aggregate-bearing layers with distance from vent in the deposits of past eruptions (e.g. Schumacher and Schmincke, 1991; Scolamacchia et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2010), suggesting that the characteristics of aggregate types can be linked to specific emplacement processes. In particular, the model of Brown et al. (2010) infers that ash aggregates with concentric internal structure are generally formed within ground-hugging density currents, rather than by direct fallout from a high, buoyant plume.\nThe nature and origins of ash aggregate types in the Oruanui eruption are explored here in context with their end-member modes of emplacement, i.e. whether the aggregates landed vertically as fall deposits or with a lateral component from emplacement in PDCs. (Note: we use PDC as a general term for deposits of gravity-controlled, ground-hugging currents, whether dilute or concentrated.) Selected localities and fall units from this eruption (units 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8) are used to illustrate the spectrum of aggregate types and commensurate complexity of processes that may have given rise to the observed textures. This study addresses two key aspects of volcanic plumes in general and the Oruanui eruption in particular: (1) what are the controls on the nature of aggregation in volcanic ash clouds? and (2) what are the resulting impacts on the dispersal and grain size distribution of volcanic products?"

    "heading": "2. The Oruanui eruption",
    "text": "The Oruanui eruption is an archetype for the largest scale of water-rich eruption styles, occurring when silicic magma mingles explosively with surface water (the phreatoplinian style of Self and Sparks, 1978). It represents one of the most widely dispersed examples of wet volcanism documented (Self, 1983), producing an estimated 430 km3 of fall and 320 km3 of PDC deposits (mostly ignimbrite), together with ~420 km3 of intracaldera fill, equating to a total of ~530 km3 of magma (Wilson, 2001). The eruption occurred at 25.4 calibrated ka (Vandergoes et al., in press), just prior to the last glacial maximum (LGM). At the time of the eruption, mean sea level was ~120 m lower (Newnham et al., 1999; their Fig. 3), and an elongate paleolake (Lake Huka: Grindley, 1965; Self and Healy, 1987; Manville and Wilson, 2004) resided directly over what became the Oruanui vent areas (Fig. 1). Paleoenvironmental reconstructions (Pillans et al., 1993; Alloway et al., 2007; Lorrey et al., 2012) and climate simulations (Drost et al., 2007; Rojas et al., 2009) have indicated overall colder, drier conditions and stronger westerly winds in New Zealand during the LGM, with weather patterns that were likely to have been significantly influenced by the axial ranges (Salinger, 1980a, 1980b). This information is roughly consistent with the overall easterly distribution of the Oruanui volcanic products.\nThe Oruanui eruption is divided by Wilson (2001) into ten phases based on fall deposit stratigraphy. Each phase interacted to some extent with overlying Lake Huka at the time of eruption, and each is associated with the generation of PDCs. Evidence for extensive magma– water interaction includes abundant ash aggregates, exceptionally fine grain size of the overall deposits (Self and Sparks, 1978; Wilson, 2001) when compared to typical dry fall deposits compiled byWalker (1971), and the entirely non-welded, low-temperature nature of the ignimbrite (150–250 °C: Wilson, 2001).\nThe spectrum of aggregate types preserved in these deposits ranges from ‘mud rain’ (Walker, 1981a) that splashed on impact with the ground, to material inferred to represent delicate, snowflake-like ash clusters (e.g. Sorem, 1982). Previous work linking aggregate textures with distinct depositional styles in the Oruanui eruption (Self, 1983; Wilson, 2001), has led to fundamental questions about the role of aggregation in transport and dispersal of volcanic emissions. For example, grain size analyses of the Oruanui unit 3 deposits show an overall increase in mean grain size downwind of vent (Fig. 13 of Wilson, 2001). This peculiar characteristic has also been observed in aggregatebearing deposits of the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption (Hatepe ash: Smith, 1998) and co-PDC deposits from block-and-ash flows at Unzen in 1991 (Watanabe et al., 1999). What are the mechanisms responsible for this coarsening with distance? Given the entirely non-welded nature of the Oruanui deposits, this case study enables integration of grain size data and aggregate facies analysis within a well-established stratigraphy to address these issues.\nThe dynamics of wet eruption columns present unique challenges due to the complex partitioning of energy into solid, liquid and gaseous phases of water. Previous numerical studies of explosive eruption plumes have shown that column stability depends critically on eruption rate and magma temperature (Wilson et al., 1978) as well as the amount of water incorporated into the plume from surface water (Koyaguchi and Woods, 1996) or atmospheric moisture (Woods, 1993; Glaze and Baloga, 1996; Graf et al., 1999). Microphysics-capable simulations by Van Eaton et al. (2012b) have also shown that abundant magma–water mixing in large-scale eruptions (≥108 kg s−1 magma) results in dynamically unstable column behavior. However, even very wet, unstable eruption columns were simulated to have the capacity to rise to stratospheric levels due to energetic boosts from latent heat release. These processes give rise to a hybrid cloud system (Fig. 2), characterized by Plinian-style (sustained buoyant) ascent, simultaneous shedding of ground-hugging currents and lofting of PDC-derived ‘coignimbrite’ ash. Following Van Eaton et al. (2012b), three roughly concentric zones of deposition are distinguished in the hybrid cloud concept: (1) a proximal zone of chaotically mixed, laterally- and vertically-transported currents, dominated by PDCs; (2) a falldominated transitional zone, in which a laterally persistent fall stratigraphy emerges, interlayered with PDCs; and (3) a distal zone that is beyond the limits of PDCs, and characterized by pure fall deposition.\nA key aspect of this hybrid cloud system is that selective transport of pyroclasts and hydrometeors (i.e., airborne water phases, such as hail, rain, graupel, snow) occurs in different parts of the cloud. The central ‘core’ of the rising column (Woods, 1988) is relatively insulated from turbulent air entrainment, and able to maintain higher temperatures and vertical velocities. This central column transports larger pyroclasts into the upper atmosphere (e.g., Neri et al., 2002), and may, under some circumstances, be capable of sustaining water in a liquid state at high altitudes (Van Eaton et al., 2012b). In contrast, the coignimbrite updrafts ascend at initially slow vertical velocities, particularly as the density currents lose momentum away from source, depositing coarser particles and lofting the finest ash (Woods andWohletz, 1991). Interaction between the higher velocity, central column and coignimbrite thermals thus results in amulti-level transport system; coarser particles are carried aloft by the high plume and laterally by ground-hugging currents, whereas dilute fractions lofted from PDCs form a lower-level cloud of preferentially finer ash.\nFrom both field-based and numerical studies of the Oruanui eruption it is inferred that PDCs and fall deposits were generated simultaneously during each eruptive phase, with the proximal, PDC-dominated zones varying with distance from source (Wilson, 2001). This study focuses on key sites at varying stages of PDC run-out and beyond (Fig. 3) to examine how the processes and products of aggregation change with respect to each depositional regime."

    "text": "Exposures of the Oruanui deposits were logged and samples obtained by carving out intact monoliths of ash. The deposits are unlithified, but are generally dense and compact enough to extract intact samples. To reveal the detail of aggregate outlines and void space in the matrix, the monoliths were scraped flat and air-dried before being dusted with a soft brush and etched with a compressed air jet. This enabled more detailed in situ examination than was possible in the field. The support framework of aggregates was defined as matrix-supported (where aggregates did not touch each other) or clast-supported. ‘Just’matrix-supported is used where approximately 50% of the aggregates are touching. Concavo–convex contacts were noted where aggregates showed soft deformation and ‘point’ contacts where they did not. Epoxy-impregnated thin sections were used for examining internal microstratigraphy (e.g. orientation of individual particles, number of internal laminae) and for identifying cryptic or poorly-defined aggregates that could not be readily distinguished in the field. X-ray computed microtomography was also employed to visualize 3-dimensional structures, proving useful for weak samples that collapsed during the impregnation stage of thin sectioning.\nWhere possible, individual aggregates were extracted intact from the deposit and their three principal axes and dry masses measured after air-drying. An additional subset of the aggregates was also weighed before air-drying (directly after removal fromwater-saturated outcrops) tomeasurewater content. The aggregateswere halved and characterized with respect to themorphology and dimensions of any internal layering, void space (e.g., ovoid vesicles, loosely-packed grains or large cavities), and grain size. A Beckman Coulter LS 13 320 laser diffraction particle\nsize analyzer was used to obtain grain size distributions. The optical model assumed a refractive index of 1.55 and absorption coefficient of 0.01, with no correction factor applied (as detailed in Ch. 3 of Van Eaton, 2012). Splits of the whole sample and representative individual aggregates from each interval were gently and thoroughly disaggregated, sonicated in 1% Calgon solution and passed through a 1.4 mm mesh before laser diffraction analysis (to avoid blockages in themachine). For concentrically structured aggregates, additional analyses were performed on individual layers from core to rim. Optical particle diameters were binned into ½-φ size intervals and grain size parameters were calculated as in Folk and Ward (1957). All data used this study are available in the electronic supplementary material."

    "heading": "4. Ash aggregates in the Oruanui deposits",
    "text": "4.1. Aggregate types — classification and terminology\nThe growing number of detailed studies of ash aggregates has led to diverse classification schemes. Although ‘ash aggregates’ is frequently used to encompass all types, the term has also been used interchangeably with pisolites (Lacroix, 1904), chalazoidites (Berry, 1928; Self and Healy, 1987), accretionary lapilli (Moore and Peck, 1962), volcanic hailstones (Kato, 1986) andmudballs (Schumacher andMues-Schumacher, 1997). Where it is necessary to discriminate between subtle aggregate characteristics, however, a more specific nomenclature is required. The basic themes reviewed by Brown et al. (2012) are adopted here in distinguishing between the end-member types composed of looselybound individual particles (particle clusters) vs. very water-rich aggregates (akin to mud rain). A further distinction is made between the subspherical, internally structureless aggregates (ash pellets) and the more compact, internally layered varieties, which are referred to here as accretionary lapilli, in rough equivalence to the core-type vs. rim-type classification of Schumacher and Schmincke (1991). Although ‘accretionary lapilli’ as a general term includes all ash aggregates with diameters 2 mm to 2 cm (Moore and Peck, 1962; Schumacher and Schmincke, 1991), its specific usage provides a means to differentiate between the simple vs. complex end-members (Gilbert and Lane,\n1994; Smith, 1998; Wilson, 2001; Brown et al., 2010). Here the specific usage of the term accretionary lapilli is employed to refer to ash aggregates with a concentrically layered internal structure, regardless of their size.\nThe spectrum of aggregate types in the Oruanui deposits is divisible into six categories (Table 1), three of which are varieties of accretionary lapilli. Each aggregate type is categorized on the basis of internal structure, constituent grain size distributions and relationship to host deposit, and each has variants with a larger pumice, lithic, or crystal fragment at the center, referred to as armored lapilli by White and Houghton (2000). The dry end-member is particle clusters, irregularly-shaped linkages of fine ash that are loosely bound by electrostatic forces and/or small amounts of liquid water (b5 wt.%), akin to snowflake clusters (Sorem, 1982; James et al., 2002). This type is inferred to comprise fall layers in the Oruanui deposits with low bulk densities (b900 kg m−3) and a loosely-packed appearance with no subspherical pellets visible (Wilson, 2001). The most water-rich example, coalesced ash pellets, must also be inferred from the deposits due to the partial or complete destruction of aggregate structures after landing. These aggregate types occur as near-homogeneous layers of dense, cohesive fine ash with a scalloped base (Fig. 4a) or as individual lumps ‘caked’ onto surrounding structures (Fig. 4b). Although the constituent aggregates cannot be readily distinguished in the field, these\ndeposits contain abundant ovoid vesicles, indicative of air bubbles trapped in a saturated matrix (Lorenz, 1974). Rosi (1992) inferred that this texture forms from beds of ash pellets that were wet enough to splash or coalesce on landing, and are akin to mud rain. It is likely that during the Oruanui eruption, many of these examples may also have landed frozen and melted after impact (cf. 1969 Ruapehu eruption: Healy et al., 1978). Experimental studies have shown that coalescence and slurrying behavior in fine ash occurs at water contents approaching 20–25 wt.% (Walker, 1981a; Schumacher and Schmincke, 1995; Van Eaton et al., 2012a). However, the lack of large-scale slurrying in the Oruanui deposits, (cf. erosional gullies in the 1.8 ka Hatepe and Rotongaio deposits:Walker, 1981a), suggests that water contents rarely exceeded these amounts on deposition.\nMassive ash pellets are characterized by more coherent, spherical to subsphericalmorphologies, although they frequently showevidence for soft deformation on landing. They are commonly 2–6 mm, but almost always ≤1 cm in diameter (Fig. 5a–f). They lack internal stratigraphy, with the exception that some exhibit a very thin (≤0.1 mm) outer layer of finer-grained ash (Fig. 5b). This outer film has been replicated experimentally in saturated ash pellets (15–20 wt.% liquid) that compacted after coming to rest, squeezingwater and the finest ash particles to their surfaces (Van Eaton et al., 2012a). Consequently, dried and etched natural samples of massive pellets in situ often show a\nE ru\npt io\nn ph\nas e\nhoneycomb-like network of inverse aggregate structures, in which the concavo–convex contacts between individual aggregates are delineated by these more resistant outer films. In cases where the aggregates did not deform as much on landing, point contacts between individual pellets leave behind an open framework with vermiform or cuspate voids in between (Fig. 5c). The smallest pellets (diameters 100–300 μm) becomemore common>100 km fromvent, and are associatedwith similarly sized crystals, glass shards and ash-coated pumices (Fig. 5e–f).Massive ash pellets occur most frequently in a clast-supported (Fig. 5a–c) or ‘just’ clast-supported network of aggregates (Fig 5d), indicating that emplaced as fall deposits from an overlying cloud. The individual constituent particles exhibit random orientations, suggesting the pellets grew by rapid, chaotic coalescence in a more or less single event. The internal textures of massive pellets are taken to represent a range of conditions; examples with a porous, low-density structure indicate sub-saturated water contents (b10–15 wt.% water), while dense, vesicular aggregates with evidence for soft deformation and outer films formwithin saturated conditions (15–20 wt.%) via wet nucleation and coalescence (Van Eaton et al., 2012a).\nLayered accretionary lapilli (Fig. 6a–g) are characterized by internal grain size layering and spherical to subspherical morphologies. These aggregates are found wholly clast-supported (Fig. 6d, f–g) or ‘just’ matrix-supported (Fig. 6e) in the Oruanui deposits, and occur well beyond the limits of PDCs. They are generally larger than massive pellets (typically 5–20 mm diameter) and consist of one to approximately five laminae of similarly sized or slightly finer ash. These layers may comprise alternating bands with sharp contacts, or a single normally graded structure that fines outward from the central core. Constituent particles are almost always concentrically oriented, and the aggregates lack evidence for having ‘captured’ smaller ash clumps. These textures are consistent with growth by a process of grain-by-grain layering (Sastry et al., 2003). In laboratory experiments, layering was replicated by decreasing the availability of liquid water to the point at which the ash was sub-saturated (Van Eaton et al., 2012a). It is therefore inferred that the presence of concentric layering signifies that the aggregate experienced (cyclic) passage through sub-saturated regions of ash-laden atmosphere.\nUltrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli are distinct from layered accretionary lapilli in two ways. First, ultrafine rim-types have at least one (typically ≤3) sharply defined outer layer(s) of ultrafine ash.\n‘Ultrafine’ is applied here to grain size distributions (Fig. 7a–j) with high proportions of b10 μm ash (>50 vol.%) and b4 μm ash (>10–15 vol.%). The presence of ultrafine ash can be determined in the field with a fingernail scratch test, feeling soft rather than gritty. Second, these types are nearly always matrix-supported in PDC deposits, floating in a matrix of fine to coarse ash, along with abundant aggregate fragments (Fig. 7g–h, j). The fragments are dominated by cuspate portions of broken rims. Ultrafine rim-types typically range from ~2 to 30 mm diameter and show complex morphologies, including multiple cores (Fig. 7c), as also observed by Raza et al. (2001). Cauliform or kidney bean-like morphologies are also common (Fig. 7d, f). In all cases, particles comprising the ultrafine outer rim are concentrically oriented, indicating a shift to layering conditions (sub-saturated with respect to liquidwater) and a supply of ash that is dominated by ultrafinematerial (Van Eaton et al., 2012a).\nComplexly layered accretionary lapilli are composed of tens of thin, concentric laminae and lenses with sharp truncations (Fig. 8). They can be unusually large (>3 cmdiameter), are alwaysmatrix-supported and are not found beyond the extent of PDC deposits. Although their internal layers do generally fine outward, with the outermost layer being the finest, complexly layered accretionary lapilli differ from ultrafine rim-types in that they lack the sharp textural and grain size demarcation between core and rim. Conditions leading to the formation of these accretionary lapilli are envisioned as an extreme version of the twoprevious types, involving vigorous, cyclic passage through stratified regions of a volcanic cloud.\n4.2. Aggregate types — quantitative classification\nThe ash pellets and accretionary lapilli described above can also be delineated based on the grain size distribution of their constituent particles. Characteristic grain size distributions of each aggregate type are shown in Fig. 9a–d. Particle clusters and coalesced ash pelletswere not analyzed because they could not be extracted from the deposits reliably intact. However, coalesced ash pellets examined in thin section were found to be texturally similar tomassive pellets, and are assumed to have comparable grain size characteristics. Fig. 10a shows that mean grain size and sorting of the aggregates overlap with the finest fall deposits from the Oruanui eruption (Wilson, 2001). Outer rims of accretionary lapilli are always finer and better sorted than their corresponding cores (Fig. 10b).\nAggregate types can be further grouped on the basis of grain size, as in Fig. 11. All except the ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli plot along a linear trend, increasing in 63–4 μm ash content with increasingly complex internal structure. The ultrafine rim-types diverge from this trend by showing a distinctive increase in material b4 μm. Interestingly, the internal cores of each of the three types of accretionary lapilli are texturally indistinguishable from massive ash pellets.\nThe thickness of rims from accretionary lapilli collected from proximal unit 3 are compared to whole-aggregate diameters, expressed as equivalent spherical diameter in Fig. 12a–b. Data from ultrafine rim-types and layered accretionary lapilli indicate that the larger aggregates generally have thicker rims, as also observed in the Laacher See tephra (Schumacher and Schmincke, 1991, their Fig. 10a–b). There is also a weak positive relationship between core diameter and rim volume (Fig. 12b), suggesting that the larger cores are somewhat more effective at scavenging fine grained outer layers. It is worth noting that the whole-aggregate diameters obtained in this study are unlikely to provide an accurate representation of the original population deposited, because measurements tended to be biased towards the larger, more visible aggregates. However, the dataset provides useful information on relationships between aggregate dimensions and factors governing their aerodynamic behavior. Bulk density, mass, aspect ratio and calculated terminal fall velocity of the measured aggregates are plottedwith respect towhole-aggregate diameter in Fig. 13. Density does not show a systematic variation with respect to aggregate diameter (Fig. 13a), and least-squares regressions from plots of diameter vs. mass give average dry and wet aggregate densities of 1.36 and 1.63 g cm−3, respectively (Fig. 13b). Fig. 13c shows that the largest aggregates (>1.5 cm) have generally smaller aspect ratios, indicating greater sphericity, and very few show elongate morphologies like\nthose reported from El Chichón by Scolamacchia et al. (2005). Estimated fall velocities are for wet and dry aggregates in Fig. 13d, exhibit roughly parallel, linear relationships with respect to ESD."

    "heading": "5. Stratigraphic context",
    "text": "One of the key challenges in studies of wet eruption deposits is determining the role of water involvement at each stage of eruption, transport and deposition (Houghton et al., 2000). Although explosive mixing of magma andwater is inferred to generate abundant fine ash, the quantitative relationships betweenfine ash content,magma:water ratio and eruption energetics are challenging to constrain (Zimanowski et al., 2003). A number of processes can alter the initial vent-derived grain size distribution, including milling in the column or PDCs during transport, and wet aggregation during sedimentation. Although all phases of the Oruanui eruption saw some magma–water interaction at vent (as evidenced by the wholly non-welded nature of the ignimbrites), each unit exhibits different degrees of ‘wet’ deposition in terms of fine ash content and aggregate types. For this study, the Oruanui deposits are considered within a framework of three intergradational styles of wet eruption and deposition: (1) wet throughout; (2) alternating wet and dry; and (3) ‘drier’ Plinian-like. Table 2 summarizes the main aggregate-bearing facies in the Oruanui eruption deposits in terms of their occurrence, and inferred processes involved in transport and deposition."

    "text": "The unit 3 deposits provide the most detailed record of transitions between aggregate types in time (vertically in the sections) and space (laterally) due to excellent preservation near the base of the Oruanui\neruptive stratigraphy. Unit 3 is also themost uniformly fine grained component of the Oruanui; even the near-vent PDC deposits are >50 wt.% finer than 63 μm, suggesting that this eruptive phase saw the most extensive magma–water fragmentation and ‘moisture-flushed’ fallout (Wilson, 2001). As shown in stratigraphic logs (Fig. 14a–j), the overall\nsize and complexity of ash aggregates diminish with distance from vent, and are closely related to the emplacement of PDCs. We describe these aggregation characteristics with respect to the proximal, transitional and distal depositional regimes shown in Fig. 2. Features of the unit 3 deposits are thus used to introduce the primary mechanisms of\nfeatures: (a) soft, concavo–convex contacts between pellets in proximal unit 3, ~100 cm r saturation, ~30 cm above the base of unit 3 at locality 235; and (c) void space between diameter of enlargement is 4 mm).

    "heading": "5.1.1. Proximal regime: PDC-dominated, mixed deposition",
    "text": "The PDC-dominated proximal regime in unit 3 extends to ~30 km from vent (Fig. 14a–d). The majority of these deposits were laterally emplaced, recorded by the occurrence of fragmented accretionary lapilli in a poorly sorted matrix, with scoured contacts and pinch and swell bedding. However, even in the proximal area, distinctive phases of fall deposition can be identified from the aggregate facies and grain size characteristics. For example, the base of unit 3 is everywhere a densely packed sequence of clast-supported, wholly to partially coalesced, massive ash pellets that is recognizable outwards into the distal area. These pellets commonly exhibit thin outer films, suggesting they were moist upon landing, or landed frozen but melted shortly afterwards (see Section 4.1). The occurrence of massive ash pellets before the first influx of PDC deposits in unit 3, and their presence well beyond the limit of laterally emplaced material (Fig. 14f–j) indicates that conditions in the buoyant cloud alone must have been suitable for their formation. We infer that the opening phase of unit 3 produced aggregated fallout from a buoyant, water-rich cloud, as illustrated in stage (i) of Fig. 15.\nUpwards in the most proximal sections (Fig. 14a–b), unit 3 deposits grade into amixed assemblage ofmassive ash pellets and layered accretionary lapilli that are fragmented and matrix-supported. This laterally emplaced material reflects the earliest emplacement of PDCs related\nto (partial) column collapse. Co-deposition of both aggregate types suggests that some of the simple, massive pellets falling out of the high plume experienced additional growth during re-entrainment and/or passage through stratified cloud levels (Reimer, 1983). This apparent increase in plume complexity may be explained by early-stage interaction with updrafts from ground-hugging currents (stage (ii) of Fig. 15). We infer that the generation of a “PDC wedge” forces warm, moistureladen air upwards from ground level toward the higher, pre-existing plume. Convergence between the two systems generates convective instability and vertically stratified cloud regions through which ash aggregates may pass and accumulate additional layers. However, a notable lack of ultrafine rims in themixed assemblage of aggregates indicates that conditions amenable to their formation were not consistently met during early development of the hybrid cloud system.\nThe ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli appear in quantity directly above this mixed assemblage. They are accompanied by abundant fragments of cuspate, ultrafine rims in a relatively loose, sandy matrix. Thismaterial comes in asmultiple, cm-dmscale beds, characterized by normal grading and tops rich in ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli (Fig. 16a). The beds represent episodic emplacement of turbulent, dilute PDCs (Wilson, 2001), followed by accretionary lapilli fallout from the overlying hybrid cloud system. As depicted in stage (iii) of Fig. 15, this situationmay have arisen in the later stage of hybrid clouddevelopment, during which ultrafine ash was preferentially elutriated from the farther-traveled ground-hugging currents (Neri et al., 2002; Van Eaton et al., 2012a). As massive pellets (or layered accretionary lapilli)\ndropped out of the buoyant plume, they passed through the lowlevel coignimbrite cloud. There, condensedmoisture andmultiple, turbulent updrafts in the ascending thermals would provide optimum conditions for accumulation of ultrafine ash. The growing accretionary lapilli would then drop out of the suspended cloud into the laterally moving undercurrent, where abrasion and breakage occurred before deposition.\nThe temporal shift from fall to PDC-dominated deposition in unit 3 described above is reflected in the microstructure of the ash aggregates (see basal detail of Fig. 14b) and their constituent grain size distributions. Fig. 17 showsdetailed laser diffraction grain size data froma proximal exposure. The PDC material is typified by matrix-supported accretionary lapilli containing abundant ultrafine ash (>10–15 vol.% b4 μm) and modes b40 μm. In contrast, the clast-supported massive ash pellets or layered accretionary lapilli characterizing fall deposits generally have a coarser mode (>60 μm) and sub-4 μm ash contents b10 vol.%."

The basal layer still comprises the laterally continuous bed of partially to wholly coalesced ash pellets (stage (i) of Fig. 15). However, this is directly overlain by the fallout equivalent of the mixed aggregate layer (laterally emplaced at more proximal exposures), and represents fallout from the stage (ii) scenario of Fig. 15. An interesting observation is that sparse fragments (b1% modal vol.) of ultrafine rims are also present in this layer (Fig. 18, at 20–30 cm). The fragments are clearly foreign to the enclosed aggregates (which do not have ultrafine layers themselves) and it appears that ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli, produced and fragmented closer to source, were re-entrained into a buoyant plume that deposited here as fall. Grain size analyses (Fig. 18) show that the clast-supported aggregates contain b10 vol.% sub-4 μm ash,\nandmodes are generally 60 to 80 μm, consistent with the grain size signature of fall material observed in the proximal area.\nUpwards in the stratigraphy, emplacement of the farthestreaching, dilute PDCs is marked by sharp basal contacts against the fall material. Inferred to represent stage (iii) of Fig. 15, these thin pulses of PDC deposits contain abundant ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli and matrix-supported rim fragments. The aggregates contain ≥10 vol.% sub-4 μm ash, with a mode of ~40 μm (Fig. 18). Occurrence of distinctive, clast-supported fall beds between the individual PDC deposits here represents time breaks between emplacement vents (likely on the order of minutes), with continuous fallout from a persistent, water-rich plume.Where the final input of PDCmaterial fades out (above 65 cm in Fig. 18), the deposits contain ‘just’ matrix-supported, ultrafine rim-types plus layered accretionary lapilli. This indicates the waning influence of coignimbrite ash in the\natmosphere and a return to stage (ii) processes of Fig. 15.

    "heading": "5.1.4. Lateral coarsening of unit 3",
    "text": "Previous work by Wilson (2001) identified a coarsening signature in the unit 3 deposits overall. Channel samples collected over the full thickness of unit 3 at a number of field sites showed mean grain size coarsening up to a distance approximately 110 km from vent, and fining beyond (Fig. 13 of Wilson, 2001). The fractionation of each whole-phi grain size interval is shown here in Fig. 20a. To our knowledge, such downwind coarsening has only been documented in the aggregate-bearing facies of the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption (Smith, 1998) and in the Unzen co-PDC deposits (Fig. 13b of Watanabe et al., 1999), although it may be a more common feature of heavily aggregated eruption deposits than previously assumed. To explain this observation in context with new textural data and field observations, we explore the roles of two complementary mechanisms.\n5.1.4.1. Aggregation-enhanced fallout. Wet aggregation is known to preferentially select particles b250 μm from a wider grain size population (Schumacher and Schmincke, 1995; Van Eaton et al., 2012a) because coarser grains cannot be efficiently captured by liquid bridges. Consider the effect this has on a water-rich volcanic plume, in terms of mass fallout (per unit area) as the cloud drifts away from vent (Fig. 20b). Particles coarser than 250 μm will have a similar fallout pattern whether conditions are wet or dry; that is, the larger particles drop out closer to source, with less mass and finer sizes depositing at greater distances, as in normal dry fall deposits (Walker, 1971). In contrast, ash finer than 250 μm deviates from this pattern. The clumping of fine ash into larger pellets and accretionary lapilli under wet conditions significantly enhances fallout closer to source. In cases where liquid water does not become readily available until the cloud has drifted some tens to hundreds of kilometers from source, this results in a secondary thickness maximum (e.g. Mount St Helens 1980: Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982). However, during phreatomagmatic eruptions vaporizing abundant surface water, liquid condenses in the erupted mixture and is available almost immediately after eruption (Van Eaton et al., 2012b). Under these conditions, the mass of finer ash that deposits as aggregates in the near-source area outweighs coarser particles that settle individually. This behavior persists up to a certain distance from vent; in unit 3, this distance is ~110 km, beyond which much of the finest ash is depleted and normal outward fining resumes (Fig. 20b).\n5.1.4.2. Multi-level transport. The transport heights of volcanic ash clouds are also capable of contributing to anoutwards coarsening signature in the deposits. In numericalmodeling ofwet plumes (Van Eaton et al., 2012b), Plinian-like ascent from vent, combined with lofting of material from PDCs, produces a multi-level, hybrid volcanic cloud that is stratified with respect to grain size (e.g., Fig. 2). Whereas the central core transports a poorly sorted particle population to the maximum cloud height, PDCs preferentially elutriate finer particles, yielding a bi-level transport system with a higher level, coarser component and a lower level cloud of fine ash. Higher-level transport generally deposits particles farther from vent (Carey and Sparks, 1986), especially if there is interaction with stronger winds aloft (e.g. the jetstream: Bursik et al., 2009), this would accentuate deposition of coarser particles farther from vent and finer particles closer to vent."

First is the evidence for exceedingly powerful, episodic outbursts that are more widely dispersed that the products of unit 3. Second, there is substantially greater deposition of medium ash to lapilli-sized clasts throughout these phases of eruption, despite abundant evidence for wet depositional processes. The combined influences of non-steady eruption column heights (Walker, 1981b), variable degrees of magma–water mixing at vent (Kokelaar, 1983), and changing availability of liquid water on deposition (Walker, 1981a) are all likely to have promoted the mixed fallout of fine ash and coarser clasts. In the following section, grain size and aggregation characteristics from these units are used to examine the eruption, transport and dispersal patterns distinctive to each eruptive phase. Representative stratigraphic logs and grain size distributions of units 6, 7 and 8 are shown in Figs. 21 and 22."

Normal grading in the fall deposits imply that phase 6 comprised 3 major outbursts, of which the third was the most widely dispersed.

Although most of the PDCs are inferred to have been concentratedflows (s.s.), sites northeast of Lake Taupo show evidence for local emplacement ofmultiple dilute PDCs with overlying layers rich in ultrafine accretionary lapilli. Just beyond the limits of the most widespread unit 6 PDCs (Fig. 21a, 43 km from vent), fall deposits are a clast-supported mixture of layered accretionary lapilli, some ofwhich one ormore internal layers of ultrafine ash (cf. Fig. 6e). These are inferred to record an earlier stage of growth, during which the aggregates passed through suspended ultrafine ash from waning PDCs, perhaps before being re-entrained into a more water-rich, poorly sorted region of the cloud. The unit 6 transitional regime shows similar aggregate characteristics to the corresponding regime in unit 3, with the shift from mixed aggregate populations (e.g. Fig. 14e, between 70 and 85 cm) to primarily massive (or coalesced) ash pellets. However, the size of the unit 6 aggregates decreases more slowly beyond ~75 km from source. This implies overall similar wet aggregation mechanisms for the two eruptive phases, though a more powerfully dispersed cloud system operated during phase 6 that was capable of sustaining aggregates farther from vent. Unit 6 persists\nto >150 km to the south and becomes a single normally graded bed with no visible aggregate structure and only sparse fine ash matrix beyond 100–120 km from source."

    "heading": "5.2.2. Unit 7",
    "text": "This eruptive phase produced multiple PDCs (mostly concentrated flows, s.s.) and exceptionally widely dispersed fall deposits (Bed B of Wilson, 1994). The proximal area of unit 7 (within 40–50 km of vent) is dominated by emplacement of PDCs,with sparse, intermittent contribution from fall material. In the transitional area, for example locality 1652, ~43 km from vent (Fig. 15 of Wilson, 2001), complexly layered accretionary lapilli are dispersed in the ignimbrite flow units and form clast-supported lenses. The accretionary lapilli are associated with fluidization segregation pods and pipes, and are interpreted to have landed, along with liquid water, into hot (>100 °C) flow material which then boiled the water to steam. It is inferred that interaction occurred between two emplacement systems in the transitional unit 7 area: hot, dense ground-hugging currents and overlying accretionary lapilli-generating clouds. The passage of PDCs is inferred to have\n(b)\nximal unit 3 at locality 235.

Just beyond this area and out of reach of the earliest unit 7 PDCs, large accretionary lapilli (some>3 cm) fell directly to the ground as fall material.\nThe distal fall equivalent of this sequence exhibits two distinctive layers (Wilson, 2001) west of the axial ranges (Fig. 1) Here, the basal component is a poorly sorted, aggregate-bearing layer, whereas the upper part is somewhat better sorted and predominantly aggregatepoor (see coarse bed in Fig. 21b–d; also referred to as ‘bed B’ in Wilson,\nProximal unit 3 localities\n(a) 2751 (11 km) (b) 1287 (17 km)\n(c) 235 (26 km) (d) 1443 (30 km)\n1994). The aggregate-bearing basal component reflects the lateral equivalent of PDC-triggered aggregation in lower altitude clouds elutriated during the passage of several far-travelled PDCs. The sizes of aggregates in basal unit 7 diminish rapidly beyond the proximal area. For example, maximum diameters decrease from 3.1 to 1.0 cm between 43 and 75 km from virtual source (Fig. 23). Based on the distribution of aggregate facies and grain size characteristics beyond the proximal regime in unit 7, two key processes are distinguished which independently influenced the distal transport of the volcanic cloud in space and time.\n5.2.2.1. Drying during transport. It is notable that the aggregated, matrix-rich base of the unit 7 fall deposits only persists between the source region and the axial ranges, but not beyond (Fig. 1). It is inferred from the overall southeastward distribution of fall unit 7\n(Wilson, 1994, and unpublished data) that northwesterlywinds pushed the hybrid eruption cloud against the axial ranges. This would have caused rapid ascent of the moist, lower-level coignimbrite material, promoting extensive condensation and precipitation in the cloud, as occurs during orographic drying in modern weather patterns (Salinger, 1980a). At representative sites ~75 km from vent (Fig. 21b–c), just upwind of the ranges, the aggregated basal portion of unit 7 is composed of massive ash pellets, locally irregular layers of coalesced pellets and layered accretionary lapilli deposited in close succession (Fig. 16b). This complex depositional style is envisioned to result from wet aggregation occurring simultaneously atmultiple plume levels, accompanied by local downbursts of ash-laden rain (cf. Smith, 1998). In contrast, unit 7 fall deposits east of the ranges consist of a single, ungraded bed of aggregate-poor, fine ash to fine lapilli, implying that the volcanic\ncloud lost much of its water during this process and progressed to relatively dry deposition from a uniformly sustained plume downwind.\n5.2.2.2. Drying at vent. Contrasting sharply with the aggregate-bearing base, the upper portion of the unit 7 fall sequence west of the ranges (2–2.5 cm thick in Fig. 21b–d) is a matrix-poor bed of medium ash to\n(i) Simple, buoyant plume\n(ii) Increased cloud stratification\n(iii) Interaction with lofted coignimbrite ash\nMpel\nLacc\nUfacc\nfall\nfallPDC\nfallPDC\nFig. 15. Schematic model for the formation of observed aggregate textures in unit 3 deposits. Stage (i) is characterized by fallout from a high, stable plume, depositing clast-supported, massive (Mpel) and coalesced ash pellets (Cpel). See Table 1 for definitions of terms. In stage (ii), the early generation of PDCs forces moist, ash-laden air upwards, which interacts with the overriding plume. Increased recycling promotes formation of layered accretionary lapilli (Lacc), which fragment as they drop into the ground-hugging PDCs. Stage (iii) depicts multiple pulses of PDCs lofting preferentially finer ash as they travel outwards from source. The lower atmosphere becomes choked with ultrafine ash, providing the final stage of growth for ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli (Ufacc) before they drop into the flows and breakup during transport. Some rim fragments generated in the PDCs behave as coherent particles and are re-entrained into the buoyant, airborne cloud.\nmedium lapilli, with sparse macroscopic aggregates. This suggests that the phase 7 eruption transitioned abruptly to drier depositional processes with time. Grain size characteristics of the coarser (‘drier’) top are consistent with single particle settling from a buoyant cloud (with limited influence of aggregation), reflected in a decreasing mean grain size of the entire unit with distance from source (Fig. 13 of Wilson, 2001). It is likely that the drier depositional processes in part reflect decreased magma–water interaction at vent. An increase in eruption rate is precluded as an influence because of the lack of grading in the distal fall deposits, and it is inferred that the voluminous coeval generation of ignimbrite effectively reduced the amount of magma–water interaction at vent by blocking vent water access (e.g. Walker, 1981a; Kokelaar, 1986). An implication of this shift is that while less fine ash may have been generated overall, the paucity of wet aggregation would also have allowed the fine ash to be transported farther, i.e. over the Pacific Ocean."

    "heading": "5.2.3. Unit 8",
    "text": "Phase 8 saw generation of the most powerfully emplaced and widespread PDCs during the Oruanui supereruption, depositing voluminous, non-welded ignimbrite in the proximal area within 90 km from virtual source. However, unit 8 differs from preceding phases in that it lacked a distinctive Plinian component. Instead, grain size and dispersal characteristics suggest that the eruption produced a short-lived, but powerful blast with an extremely high mass eruption rate (>109 kg s−1). Most of the material was laterally emplaced or lofted from PDCs. Numerical simulations of a collapsing column with mass eruption rate of ~109 kg s−1 (Fig. 3h of Van Eaton et al., 2012b) imply that even in the absence of sustained Plinian-like ascent, near-vent lofting of the ground-hugging density currents is capable of transporting ash laden updrafts to stratospheric heights. These near-vent updrafts are generally hotter and more vigorous (i.e. able to transport coarser particles) than those lofting from PDCs many kilometers away from source. Therefore, although phase 8 did not likely have a vent-derived, central column like that depicted in Fig. 2, the concept of multi-level transport still applies due to the contrast between higher-altitude injection of vigorous near vent updrafts, and lower injection of more passively elutriated, fine coignimbrite ash.\nIn the proximal area, the earliest unit 8 deposit is widespread ignimbrite. Generation of PDCs early in this phase triggered the aggregation and fallout of large (1–2.5 cm), layered accretionary lapilli. In stratigraphic logs from sites 75–81 km from source (Fig. 21b–d), which are within or just beyond the extent of the basal ignimbrite, layered accretionary lapilli immediately follow ignimbrite deposits as a 12–14 cm clast-supported fall bed. This is overlain by a repeated sequence of PDCs, incorporating abundant, matrix-supported, whole and fragmented ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli. Each pulse of PDC deposits is followed by a clast-supported bed of layered accretionary lapilli; this pattern is strikingly similar to the typical pyroclastic couplets of Tenerife (Brown et al., 2010), with the exception that we identify concentric structure in the overlying clast-supported aggregates (more akin to examples from the Fasnia Formation from Fig. 10 of Brown et al., 2010). At the contact between clast-supported beds of layered accretionary lapilli and poorly sorted ignimbrite, aggregates appear to have been ripped up and fragmented (Fig. 24). The aggregates\nthat follow have thin outer layers of ultrafine ash rims. Beyond the limits of the unit 8 PDCs, ultrafine rim-types do not occur, although by comparison with units 3 and 6 there may be a previously unrecorded layer (potentially destroyed by erosion) just beyond the flows, recording simultaneous deposition of ultrafine rim-types with layered pellets.\nHowever, as far as the modern east coast of the North Island in Hawkes Bay the unit 8 fall deposits are characterized by layered accretionary lapilli (e.g. Berry, 1928) that become smaller and less complex with distance from source. An additional observation from the unit 8 aggregates preserved in the Hawkes Bay region is that many appear to be ‘just’matrix supported, i.e., just touching each other, with some matrix in between. As seen in thin sections (Fig. 6f), the intervening matrix is composed of broken aggregates and larger individual particles, supporting the assertion that the material landed as a combination of aggregate fallout (some of which broke on landing) and singleparticle sedimentation.\nOne important distinguishing feature between aggregation in unit 8 vs. that in unit 3 is the nature of the intervening fall layers. In both eruption phases these are composed of clast-supported, massive pellets (unit 3) or layered accretionary lapilli (unit 8) However, the clast-supported aggregates are much larger and more complex in unit 8, and cm-sized accretionary lapilli were evidently capable of being deposited >100 km from vent. Concentrically structured aggregates do not persist beyond approximately 40 km from vent in unit 3. This suggests that plume processes were much more vigorous during emplacement of unit 8 (see Section 6.5 for discussion)."

Most parts of these deposits are relatively well sorted, become systematically finer with distance from vent and often lack visible ash aggregates. They are thus inferred to have seen only moderate amounts of interaction with water at vent (Wilson, 2001). However, ash aggregation occurs farther downwind over regional extents, as will be exemplified here with field observations from units 2 and 5.\nUnit 2 consists of fall deposits with plinian dispersal, which are accompanied by localized PDC deposits (only to b20 km from vent), and was coupled with sporadic outbursts from vents that became vigorously active in phase 3 of the eruption (indicated by interbedded layers of unit 3-like material). The unit 2 fall deposits were emplaced primarily by single-particle settling, lacking visible ash aggregates within 60–70 km from vent. Beyond this, however, the deposit has a loosely packed, microvesicular texture which, at the best preserved sites, contains mm-scale, massive ash pellets (see Fig. 5c). This suggests that the unit 2 ash cloud experienced an increase in liquid water content in distal regions, leading to ash pellet formation. In contrast, unit 5 is a normally graded bed that is mostly well sorted at all vertical levels. However, east (downwind) of the axial ranges it has developed a weakly cohesive, low-density, moderately to poorly sorted top portion, which comprises up to 50% of the total unit thickness. There is a lack of visible aggregate textures, and this upper part is inferred to have been deposited by moist aggregation, in the form of snowflake-like particle clusters, as has been observed or inferred in recent eruptions including Mount St. Helens 1980 and Crater Peak 1992 (e.g. Durant and Rose, 2009; Durant et al., 2009).\nSeveral factors may have contributed to the distal aggregation in these drier units: (1) downwind fining increasing the availability of sub-250 μm particles, which aggregate more readily; (2) an influx of moist coastal air during plume transport toward the east side of the axial ranges, adding water to the cloud (Wilson, 2001); and (3) fallout and melting of ice particles carried downwind in the volcanic plume (Durant et al., 2009). Downwind aggregation has generated secondary thickness maxima in recent Plinian eruptions (e.g. Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982), but in the Oruanui, varying degrees of compaction and preservation have precluded identification of a secondary thickness maximum in any of the eruptive phases.\nAn interesting aspect of the drier eruption and dispersal of units 1, 2, 4 and 5 is that, despite generation of both a sustained, buoyant plume and PDCs in all cases, there is no evidence to suggest that interaction between the two led to large-scale aggregation in the relevant proximal areas. Two possible reasons for this are: (1) that there may not have been enough liquid water available in the buoyant cloud and PDCs, and (2) that the PDCs may have been too small (relative to the volume and dispersal power of the Plinian component) to produce significant updrafts capable of producing the larger, concentrically structured aggregates. Partitioning of erupted material into fall vs. PDCs (e.g. Neri et al., 2002) may thus be a governing factor in the development of complex aggregate structure."

    "heading": "6.1. Summary model: wet plume development and aggregation",
    "text": "Fig. 25 provides a summary sketch of aggregate-forming processes in the Oruanui eruption plumes. An important aspect of the proposed model is recognition of multi-level transport of particles from an eruption column that is frequently destabilized, generating simultaneously buoyant and non-buoyant material. Medium ash to lapilli-sized clasts (>250 μm) are partitioned into ground-hugging PDCs and a higherlevel plume, with the latter fed by a Plinian column and/or vigorous near-vent updrafts from proximal PDCs. In contrast, preferentially finer material is lofted into a lower-level (coignimbrite) cloud from PDCs as they travel farther away from vent. Aggregation in the hybrid cloud system occurs primarily where liquid is available during, for example, condensation on ash surfaces or melting of ice, promoting the growth of massive ash pellets by nucleation and coalescence. Regions of the plume at altitudes significantly colder than −15 to −20 °C (the nucleation freezing temperature of silicic ash: Durant and Shaw, 2005) are less likely to contain abundant and persistent concentrations\nof liquid water for wet aggregation. Therefore, cloud transport at these levels is relatively drier and less influenced by formation of substantial aggregates (although electrostatically-bound particle clusters will form). Assuming, for example, a sea level temperature of 10 °C and a tropospheric lapse rate of −5 °C/km for the North Island during eruption (cf. Drost et al., 2007), this dominantly ‘higher, drier’ transport in the spreading cloud would be above 5–6 km altitude (Fig. 25).\nIn scenarios where the ground-hugging currents generated from partial (or wholescale) column collapse are comparable to or more voluminous than the coeval high plume, interaction between the two components is inferred to generate more complex aggregates. This is illustrated in Oruanui unit 3 deposits, which only contain concentrically structured aggregates during or after emplacement of PDCs. We attribute this phenomenon to a “PDC wedge” (Section 5.1.1), whereby updrafts of warm, ash-laden air rising from ground-level currents converge with the higher, spreading umbrella cloud. Updrafts transport additional heat and water vapor from the lower atmosphere. The injections of condensed liquid in the ash cloud promote aggregate growth, while strengthened turbulent updrafts (due to additional latent heat release) sustain larger aggregates aloft. During the early stages of this interaction, before the low-level atmosphere is choked with ultrafine ash, aggregates may experience re-entrainment through increasingly\nstratified regions of the cloud system, and develop the concentric internal structure of layered accretionary lapilli. However,with continued column collapse and farther-traveled density currents, the lower atmosphere becomes laden with ultrafine vitric ash preferentially liberated from the flows. Aggregates passing through this region above the PDCs (sometimes multiple times) develop outer rims of dominantly ultrafine ash. Those dropping into the lower levels of the ground-hugging currents are wholly to partially fragmented.\nIn the case of the Oruanui hybrid cloud system, the expanding ash clouds would have met the axial ranges some 50–80 km downwind of vent (under a dominant westerly or northwesterly wind flow). This would have the effect of forcing low-level airborne material (b2 km above sea level) upward. Orographic lifting causes rapid cooling and condensation of moisture, accompanied by heavy precipitation and wet aggregation upwind, while on the downwind side, the material would deposit relatively drier. This effect is best seen in the unit 7 deposits, which exhibit a contrast between heavily aggregated basal deposits west of the ranges (Fig. 16c) and relatively matrix-poor equivalents to the east. Beyond the axial ranges, more than ~100 km from source, other Oruanui eruption phases (2 and 5) experienced late-stage aggregation in the finer grained, downwind cloud, possibly triggered by: (1) subsidence of the cloud to warmer levels of the\natmosphere (≤0 °C), followed by subsequent melting of cloud ice, and/or (2) incorporation of moist, oceanic air as the cloud approached the contemporaneous Pacific coastline (Fig. 25).\n6.2. Where do ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli form?\nCertain types of ash aggregates in the Oruanui (notably those with ultrafine ash outer rims) are found only in PDC deposits, or else just beyond their lateral extent. These observations are in agreement the hypothesis of Brown et al. (2010) that some aggregate types are closely linked with the passage of PDCs. Brown et al. infer that massive ash pellets are generated in the buoyant, lofted plume before subsequently dropping into the ground-hugging current below, where they grow concentric outer layers. Here we consider three pieces of evidence to suggest that the final stage of rim formation is likely to occur in buoyant, lofted plumes of coignimbrite ash rather than within ground-hugging density currents."

If, on one hand, the\ngrowth mechanism was predominantly dry (e.g. electrostatic attraction followed by rapid cementation), then one would expect to find concentric layers of fine ash coating pumice and lithic clasts (i.e. armored lapilli) throughout the entirety of the PDC deposits. But aggregate structures are only observed in the upper portions of the Tenerife ignimbrites considered by Brown et al. (2010), when moist ash aggregates were thought to have formed and begun dropping into the ground-hugging flows, suggesting that growth of aggregate layers does require involvement of some liquid. On the other hand, aggregation experiments using even small amounts of liquid water (b5 wt.%), however, have failed to reproduce sufficiently size-selective aggregation from a poorly sorted (ignimbrite-like) mixture (Van Eaton et al., 2012a). By contrast, layers composed purely of ultrafine ash formed readily during exposure to an ultrafines-dominated mixture and small degrees of liquid water (b10–15 wt.%). These conditions are more likely achieved in lofted plumes of fine coignimbrite ash than in the poorly sorted groundhugging density currents."

    "text": "In particular, ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli found in the Oruanui PDC deposits are, without exception, associated with abundant rim fragments (see Section 6.4 for more detail). The observations suggest that energetic inter-particle collisions within the more concentrated, laterally moving currents promote more abrasion and fragmentation than layering and growth. This field association supports growth in the more dilute, turbulent updrafts lofted from PDCs.\nThe distinction between aggregate growth in buoyant coignimbrite plumes rather than within laterally moving density currents is not purely semantic. It indicates that concentrically structured aggregates have the potential to form fall as well as PDC deposits, and highlights the utility of combining observations of support framework (i.e. matrix vs. clast-supported) and presence or absence of rim fragments in addition to aggregate internal structure to aid identification of vertically or laterally emplaced material, and associated hazards (e.g. Table 2).\n6.3. What is the mechanism of ultrafine rim formation?\nA number of mechanisms have been previously proposed to explain the presence of fine outer layers in ash aggregates. Hailstone-like growth involving mixed water phases, e.g. contact freezing of supercooled drops onto a pre-existing kernel (Knight, 1968; Prodi et al., 1986), is one process by which ash aggregates may grow and develop (Kato, 1986; Textor et al., 2006a, b). However, the direct involvement of ice particles has been shown experimentally to leave behind a porous texture after drying (Van Eaton et al., 2012a). Loosely packed ash particles are common in the cores of accretionary lapilli, but this mechanism is not compatible with the tightly packed, delicately preserved textures observed in the ultrafine ash outer rims (refer to Supplementary Video Content). We also considered an alternative mechanism: collection of ultrafine ash onto aggregates by electrostatic attraction at high, dry altitudes (well above the direct dynamic influence of PDCs). However, this would require a mechanism to suppress further growth as the aggregates settle through lower, water-rich (and coarser grained) levels of the ash cloud before landing. At present, no simple explanation exists to account for this requirement.\nWe propose a simple growth mechanism that is consistent with observations from thefield and lab, and builds on themodel of Brown et al. (2010). First, massive ash pellets form under liquid-saturated conditions in the poorly sorted regions of the cloud (i.e. the Plinian column or most vigorously lofted currents from PDCs). They grow dominantly by nucleation and coalescence from a combination of wet aggregation and ice-initiated growth (Brown et al., 2012; Van Eaton et al., 2012a), producing a poorly sorted, loosely packed structure, and sometimes preserving evidence for capture of other wet aggregates (e.g. Fig. 7c). The aggregates may cycle multiple times through stratified regions of the cloud, adding additional concentric layers (particularly after being boosted upward by convection above ground-hugging PDCs), as depicted in stage (ii) of Fig. 15. Over time, continued emplacement of multiple ground-hugging density currents leaves behind a low-level, airborne cloud of ultrafine ash, which is the last volume traversed by the settling,moist aggregates. By a combination of electrostatic attraction and small amounts of liquid water (b10–15 wt.%), ultrafine ash is layered onto the aggregates and cemented (see Section 6.4). As a result, the aggregates found in PDC deposits from the later stage of column collapse always have ultrafine outer rims. Aggregates dropping out after the passage of the coignimbrite ash clouds (or\nwell beyond their lateral extent) land as fall deposits with a simpler internal structure.\n6.4. How and where does fragmentation and breakup of the ultrafine rims occur?\nThe outer rims of ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli behave in a brittle manner during eruption, breaking off in angular cuspate or shell-like fragments. These cuspate morphologies, along with field relationships showing that whole aggregates and fragments were co-deposited in the distal area indicate that the rims were brittle before landing. Their brittleness cannot therefore be attributed to post-emplacement cementation. Gilbert and Lane (1994) emphasized the potential role of mineral precipitates in cementing aggregates\ntogether. Although the present study has found no evidence for macroscopic quantities of precipitates in Oruanui examples, it may be that only small amounts are required at particle contact points to keep maintain the aggregate structure. Brown et al. (2010) also addressed the possibility of heat in the PDCs providing a mechanism to dry the aggregates, promoting formation of secondary precipitates. We infer that the reactivity of freshly generated ultrafine glass fragments may also promote cementation through rapid glass alteration (Van Eaton et al., 2012a); this process would likely be aided by landing in the proximity of ground-hugging flows. Regardless of the cementation mechanism involved, it is evident that the process was rapid enough to allow rim fragments to be re-entrained into airborne clouds during continued eruption, and transported as coherent clasts to 100–120 km from source (Fig. 6g).\nThe abundance of rim fragments in the Oruanui PDC deposits (sometimes exceeding 75% modal volume in individual layers: Fig. 7h) indicates that aggregates broke up after landing in laterally-moving PDCs. Although it is expected that aggregates also have the potential to collide and break aloft, in the same fashion as normal hail and ice particles, the layered accretionary lapilli in clast-supported fall layers are overwhelmingly intact compared to those in PDC deposits."

    "text": "The occurrence of layered accretionary lapilli with diameters sometimes >1 cm in the Hawkes Bay region in unit 8, 100–120 km from vent (Berry, 1928), represents one of the farthest traveled examples of accretionary lapilli yet documented, with the exception of the ~1 Ma Kidnappers eruption, New Zealand (Alloway et al., 2004). Aggregates of this size have terminal fall velocities on the order of 10 m s−1 (Fig. 13d), indicating that the plume system must have been capable of sustaining updraft velocities of similar magnitude for >100 km, assuming that the aggregates were formed closer to vent and carried downwind. The alternative, that growth occurred during transport in the distal cloud (cf. distal pelletization in unit 2), is\nconsidered less likely. A consistent stratigraphy in the deposition of layered accretionary lapilli is recognized throughout the distal area and aggregates become systematically smaller away from source. Although there is likely to have been some growth during transport in the buoyant cloud, observations are consistent with extensive aggregate formation primarily closer to source, followed by simple fallout during distal transport. We propose that three factors may have contributed to this widespread dispersal of substantially-sized aggregates: (1) the large mass flux of the collapsing column associated with phase 8 promoting rapid, radial spreading of the ash cloud at or near the height of the tropopause (Van Eaton et al., 2012b); (2) the presence of far-travelled PDCs (up to ~90 km) providing buoyant vertical updrafts out to considerable distances; and (3) a contribution from ambient winds aloft."

    "heading": "6.6. How does ice formation in the volcanic cloud affect aggregation?",
    "text": "Central vacuoles are preserved in both layered and ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli, although they are comparatively less common in massive ash pellets and complexly layered accretionary lapilli. They are present in all accretionary lapilli-bearing units of the Oruanui eruption deposits, and in some layers up to 30% of the\naggregates contain vacuoles. Their presence strongly supports the existence of mm-scale snow pellet or coherent ice particle providing nuclei during wet aggregation (Van Eaton et al., 2012a). It is likely that ashy ice particles were falling into regions of the cloud where liquid water was abundant and wet aggregation could take place. Microphysical simulations of large-scale wet eruptions (Van Eaton et al., 2012b) indicate that the area within tens to hundreds of kilometers from source is showered by a curtain of graupel (snow pellets). These icy particles would therefore be falling into the groundhugging PDCs, associated coignimbrite clouds, and the areas beyond, providing effective nuclei for wet aggregation once melting occurs. In the Oruanui unit 3 deposits ~100 km from vent, the aggregates are reduced to weak, massive ash pellets 1–5 mm in diameter and smaller ash clusters, which are difficult to identify in the field. This distance roughly coincides with the distance at which the overall deposit starts to become finer with distance (Fig. 20a), that is, normal ‘dry’ processes take over. The change in aggregation style is also likely related to relatively lower water content in the cloud. The decrease in fallout of ice particles beyond ~100 km from vent in microphysical simulations after 3 hours of simulated eruption (Van Eaton et al., 2012b), support the idea of an overall decrease in the availability of water for wet aggregation. Aggregates deposited at distances of\n>~150 km (beyond mainland New Zealand) are likely to have been dominantly electrostatically-bound particle clusters formed under relatively dry conditions."

    "heading": "6.7. What promotes the formation of concentrically structured aggregates in some water-rich eruptions and not others?",
    "text": "Although the Hatepe and Rotongaio units of the 1.8 ka Taupo eruption (Self and Sparks, 1978;Walker, 1981a; Smith andHoughton, 1995) also incorporated abundant lake water and generated PDC deposits (albeit on amuch smaller scale than theOruanui), onlymassive ash pellets,mostly b3–4 mmdiameter, are preserved in the deposits. One of the primary differences between these examples and the Oruanui is the relative abundance of PDCs vs. fall deposits. The Oruanui eruption phases that saw production of abundant aggregates (units 3, 6, 7 and 8) are each associated with volumetrically comparable or dominant PDC deposits relative to material that was emplaced as fallout. The implication is that the formation of complex aggregates is promoted by highenergy interaction between PDCs and an overriding plume (whether co-PDC or vent-derived in origin). The PDCs in the Hatepe and Rotongaio eruption phases were simply too weak and/or small relative to the\n4, showing the transition between clast-supported massive ash pellet fall deposits and\nbuoyant cloud to generate turbulent currents capable of producing and supporting larger aggregates.\nAnother key comparison between the Oruanui and Taupo eruptions is the nature of coarsening of some deposits away from vent. Overall, the Oruanui unit 3 and 1.8 ka Hatepe ash deposits both become coarser grained with distance. However, Oruanui unit 3 coarsens up to ~110 km downwind of source, while the Hatepe only coarsens out to ~20 km (Smith, 1998). It is likely that this difference relates to eruptive dispersal power, as the Hatepe ash is approximately an order of magnitude smaller volume in comparison."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "The 25.4 ka Oruanui deposits exemplify the complexity of plume dynamics, cloud transport and depositional styles that result from large-scale wet volcanism. Using quantitative measurements of Oruanui aggregate structures in context with their mode of emplacement, we have developed a revised conceptual model for the dispersal and fallout of fine ash in water-rich volcanic clouds. Our main findings are summarized below:\n1. The role of externalwater is not simply in promotingwet aggregation, but is also expressed in its control on stability of the overall plume. Wet phases of the Oruanui eruption generated a hybrid cloud system. This plume structure is generalized by a dynamically unstable central column feeding a higher-level cloud augmented by finer grained coignimbrite updrafts lofting into lower levels of the atmosphere. 2. Occurrences of six aggregate types recognized in the Oruanui deposits are linked to two primary factors: (a) amounts of magma– water interaction at vent, and (b) interaction with PDCs. 3. Drier eruptive phases (e.g. units 2 and 5) in the Oruanui produced smaller proportions of PDCs, and aggregation occurred primarily downwind. Occurrence of late-stage aggregation in areas >100 km from source is attributed to: (a) distal cloud subsidence and melting of ice carried by the plume, and (b) influx of low-level moisture from\nthe Pacific coast. These events led to enhanced fallout of fine ash in the form of mm-scale massive ash pellets or weakly bound particle clusters, resulting in poorly sorted fall deposits with a low density, microvesicular texture. 4. For the majority of the Oruanui deposits (e.g., units 3, 6, 7 and 8), water in the plume was sourced primarily from water–magma interaction at the vent. These units are dominated by PDC deposits and contain evidence for abundant wet aggregation in the near-source area, followed by long-distance transport downwind (> 100–150 km in unit 8). Proximal aggregation characteristics in wet Oruanui deposits are linked to: (a) the timing, volume and grain size of fine ash lofted from ground-hugging PDCs, and (b) orographic forcing as buoyant and non-buoyant material interacts with the topography of the North Island under the influence of the dominantly west or northwest winds. 5. Water-rich unit 3 deposits in particular show an outwards coarsening of mean grain size to ~110 km from source before resuming outwards fining. This is attributed to a combination of multi-level plume transport and proximal fallout of b250 μm particles by wet aggregation in the near-source area, and may be a more common feature of aggregated deposits than previously suspected. 6. There is a clear association between aggregate facies and emplacement mechanisms in the Oruanui and elsewhere, which may serve to aid identification of fall vs. PDC deposits from water-rich eruptions. Fall deposits typically contain clast-supported massive ash pellets or layered accretionary lapilli. Laterally emplaced material hosts matrix-supported aggregates with well-developed concentric structure (typically complexly layered or ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli), and contains abundant rim fragments. 7. The formation of ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli is summarized in a three-stage conceptual model. (i) Massive ash pellets grow in a buoyant, water-rich plume by nucleation and coalescence of liquidsaturated ash. (ii) Early shedding of PDCs from the columndestabilizes the plume. This promotes particle recycling through grain size and water-stratified regions of the cloud, converting some of the massive\nash pellets to layered accretionary lapilli. (iii) Late-stage generation of voluminous PDCs lofts ultrafine ash into the lower atmosphere (likely below5–6 km).Moist ash pellets and layered accretionary lapilli accumulate layers as they circulate through this lower-level buoyant cloud, becoming ultrafine rim-type accretionary lapilli. During fallout, aggregates that drop into the laterallymoving currents become abraded and fragmented, while those dropping beyond the reaches of PDCs land as clast-supported fall deposits.\nWe hope this work serves to stimulate further field-testing of the hybrid cloud conceptual model using other eruption deposits (recent or prehistoric), numerical modeling and analogue experimentation.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2012.10.016."
