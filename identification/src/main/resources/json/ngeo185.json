ZEEBE1* AND KEN CALDEIRA2 1School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, Department of Oceanography, University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1000 Pope Road, MSB 504, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822, USA 2Department of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution, 260 Panama Street, Stanford, California 94305, USA *e-mail: zeebe@soest.hawaii.edu\nPublished online: 27 April 2008; doi:10.1038/ngeo185\nFeedbacks controlling long-term fluxes in the carbon cycle and in particular atmospheric carbon dioxide are critical in stabilizing the Earth’s long-term climate. It has been hypothesized that atmospheric CO2 concentrations over millions of years are controlled by a CO2-driven weathering feedback that maintains a mass balance between the CO2 input to the atmosphere from volcanism, metamorphism and net organic matter oxidation, and its removal by silicate rock weathering and subsequent carbonate mineral burial1–4. However, this hypothesis is frequently challenged by alternative suggestions, many involving continental uplift and either avoiding the need for a mass balance or invoking fortuitously balanced fluxes in the organic carbon cycle5–9. Here, we present observational evidence for a close mass balance of carbon cycle fluxes during the late Pleistocene epoch. Using atmospheric CO2 concentrations from ice cores10–12, we show that the mean long-term trend of atmospheric CO2 levels is no more than 22 p.p.m.v. over the past 610,000 years. When these data are used in combination with indicators of ocean carbonate mineral saturation to force carbon cycle models, the maximum imbalance between the supply and uptake of CO2 is 1–2% during the late Pleistocene. This long-term balance holds despite glacial–interglacial variations on shorter timescales. Our results provide support for a weathering feedback driven by atmospheric CO2 concentrations that maintains the observed fine mass balance.\nCarbon dioxide is released from volcanism and metamorphism to the atmosphere at a rate that would double the amount of carbon in the combined ocean–atmosphere system within less than 600 kyr (refs 13,14). Chemical weathering of Ca and Mg silicate rocks followed by carbonate burial removes CO2 from the atmosphere through weathering reactions. The weathering rates of the silicate rocks increase with soil CO2 concentration and temperature15. The long-term balance between carbon release and removal has been hypothesized to be maintained by a negative stabilizing feedback, which results from the influence of the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 on the Earth’s surface temperature and silicate rock weathering rates1–4. Note that there are different types of this feedback, for example, before and after the rise of land plants16. If the rate of carbon input to the ocean–atmosphere system would exceed the rate of chemical weathering, atmospheric CO2 and temperature would rise, thereby elevating weathering rates until a new balance is achieved and vice versa. Thus, CO2 levels over\nmillions of years would be controlled by a CO2-driven weathering feedback that maintains a mass balance between CO2 input to and removal from the atmosphere.\nOne school of thought has promoted this feedback as a key player in the long-term stabilization of the Earth’s climate16–18. However, this view is controversial and frequently challenged by conflicting hypotheses. These hypotheses often involve continental uplift and avoid the need for a mass balance or postulate organic carbon fluxes that coincidentally balance the cycle5–9. Until present, the advocates of the weathering feedback have theoretically argued that CO2 would undergo large variations within a few million years, if the feedback was absent19,20. Unfortunately, the mechanism is difficult to prove, partly because the involved fluxes cannot be measured directly over millions of years. As a result, the CO2-driven weathering feedback, which has probably prevented runaway greenhouse and icehouse conditions over timescales of millions to billions of years, remains speculative.\nTo provide observational constraints on long-term carbon fluxes, we have turned to recently generated ice-core CO2 records, now covering 650 kyr of the late Pleistocene epoch12. Previous studies have focused on analysing the causes of the glacial–interglacial variations. However, despite variations on the timescale of thousands of years, there is remarkably little trend on the timescale of hundreds of thousands of years. Here, we show that the lack of a strong trend in atmospheric CO2 or ocean chemistry over this time period implies a tight coupling between CO2 sources to and sinks from the atmosphere and oceans.\nWe have analysed Antarctic ice-core CO2 records spanning the past 650 kyr (refs 10–12) (Fig. 1). The calculated linear, long-term trends in CO2 based on different fit models (see the Methods section) range from −22 ± 2 p.p.m.v to +10 ± 6 p.p.m.v. per 610 kyr (Table 1). In other words, the mean, long-term atmospheric CO2 change during the past 610 kyr is at most 22 p.p.m.v. Superimposed on this trend are the well-known glacial–interglacial variations. In general, causes for a mean pCO2 change can be split into two categories (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1). (i) ‘Surface recycling’: a redistribution of carbon between or within surficial reservoirs of ocean (inventory =MocnC ), atmosphere (M atm C ) and terrestrial biosphere (M trrC ), with total carbon inventory M S C (refs 13,14):\nMSC = M ocn C +M atm C +M trr C ' 40,000 Pg C. (1)\n312 nature geoscience VOL 1 MAY 2008 www.nature.com/naturegeoscience\n© 2008 Nature Publishing Group\nfrom the truncated data sets (see Table 1). MIS: marine isotope stage. Solid black lines indicate long-term trends and errors based on linear regression of the truncated, interpolated data sets. The same trend in CO2 shifted vertically (dashed line) shows that maximum values have also declined during the past four interglacials.\n(ii) ‘Endogenic imbalance’: an imbalance between long-term carbon-cycle fluxes among endogenic reservoirs of mantle and upper crust involving volcanism/metamorphism, weathering and deep burial. In the case of surface recycling, MSC stays constant, whereas in the case of an endogenic imbalance, MSC is not constant.\nThe long-term trends in the CO2 data (Table 1) can be due to surface recycling or an endogenic imbalance, or both. However, if only surface recycling was responsible, then long-term fluxes were in perfect balance. In the following we will therefore examine the case that the pCO2 change was entirely due to an endogenic imbalance, which provides a maximum estimate for the mismatch between long-term carbon fluxes. If surface recycling was involved, then a finer balance is possible. For a given change in atmospheric CO2 (1pCO2), changes in the combined ocean–atmosphere inventory can then be constrained (for terrestrial biosphere, see Supplementary Information). We calculate the endogenic imbalance from mass balances of carbon and alkalinity (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1); stable carbon isotopes merely constrain partitioning of net degassing and organic carbon oxidation:\nMTC = M ocn C +M atm C (2)\ndMTC dt = +Fcw −Fcb +Fvm +Fgw −Fgb (3)\ndMTA dt = +2 Fcw −2 Fcb +2 Fsw (4)\nd(δTC M T C)\ndt = +δcw Fcw − (δ T C + εc) Fcb + δvm Fvm\n+ δgw Fgw − (δ T C + εg) Fgb, (5)\nwhere MTC is the total ocean–atmosphere carbon inventory (equation (1)), MTA is the alkalinity inventory and F terms are fluxes of CaCO3 weathering/burial (cw/cb), volcanism/metamorphism (vm), organic carbon (Corg) weathering/burial (gw/gb) and silicate weathering (sw); δ terms refer to carbon isotope compositions (δTC is the δ-value of M T C) and ε terms refer to fractionation factors; [δcw, δvm, δgw] = [+2, −1, −22]h and [εc, εg] = [+2, −25]h (ref. 13). For any pair of initial and final pCO2 and, for example, carbonate ion concentration ([CO2−3 ]), M T C and M T A and their time derivatives can be calculated21, whereas changes in δTC are determined from δ13C records in benthic foraminifera (see the\nSupplementary Information). Thus, given input values of Fcw,Fvm and Fgw (refs 13,16,19), the system can be solved for the unknowns Fcb,Fgb and Fsw (equations (2)–(5)). Finally, the imbalance between CO2 input to the atmosphere from volcanism/metamorphism and net Corg oxidation, and CO2 uptake by silicate weathering, I(inp-sw), is given by:\nI(inp-sw) = (Fvm +Fgw −Fgb)−Fsw (6)\nI ′ (inp-sw) = I(inp-sw)/(Fvm +Fgw), (7)\nwhere I ′ (inp-sw) is the imbalance relative to the sum of the input fluxes Fvm + Fgw. Note that potential effects of terrestrial biomass changes on I ′ are small and that I ′ is independent of the carbon isotope balance (equation (5)) and thus of isotopic compositions and fractionation factors (see the Supplementary Information). As a result, our imbalance does not depend on the carbon isotope value of buried organic carbon, for instance, or changes in the long-term partitioning of organic carbon burial between marine and terrestrial environments (with generally different isotopic values).\nGiven the long-term CO2 trends from our data analysis (Table 1), values for the imbalance over the past 610 kyr can now be calculated. For example, if pCO2 drops from 240 to 218 µatm at constant [CO2−3 ] = 224 µmol kg\n−1, I(inp-sw) is equivalent to a loss of 42 µmol kg−1 in total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) in the ocean at temperature and salinity of T = 18 ◦C and S = 35 (Fig. 2). In this case, loss of surficial carbon reduces CT and pCO2, which would also tend to increase [CO2−3 ] and thus the CaCO3 saturation state. However, the latter is effectively buffered by a process called calcite compensation22,23, which restores [CO2−3 ] on a timescale of ∼10 kyr. Thus, because [Ca2+] variations are small on glacial–interglacial timescales, at constant depth of the saturation horizon, CT and pCO2 decline along a line of [CO2−3 ] = const. (Fig. 2, blue line). After calcite compensation, the calculated carbon loss from the ocean due to flux imbalances is 42 µmol kg−1 (red line). A further 36 µmol kg−1 is lost owing to excess CaCO3 burial (green line). The flux-driven loss for the 22 µatm decline in pCO2 corresponds to a 2.2% drop in CT or a 840 Pg C loss relative to the combined ocean–atmosphere inventory of MTC ' 36,500 Pg C (ref. 14). Using Fvm = 0.06–0.10 Pg C y −1 and Fgw = 0.06–0.12 Pg C y −1 (refs 13, 16,19), the total input fluxes equal 73,200–134,200 Pg C and the total loss of 840 Pg C is equivalent to a relative imbalance of I ′ (inp-sw) = −0.6% to −1.2% over 610 kyr (1pCO2 = −22 µatm). We found that varying temperature and salinity had little effect on I ′ (±0.004% for T = 13–23 ◦C and S = 33–37).\nIf we allow for simultaneous trends in the saturation horizon depth, I ′\n(inp-sw) can be slightly larger or smaller, depending on the sign of 1[CO2−3 ] (Fig. 3). If a pCO2 drop is accompanied by a [CO2−3 ] decrease, that is, a shallowing of the saturation\nnature geoscience VOL 1 MAY 2008 www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 313\n© 2008 Nature Publishing Group\nvolcanism/metamorphism plus net Corg oxidation and silicate weathering (CT loss) for the case that a long-term trend in CO2 is entirely due to an ‘endogenic imbalance’ (see equation (6)). Labelled black lines are pCO2 contours (µatm) as a function of total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) and total alkalinity (A T) in the ocean. At constant carbonate ion concentration ([CO2−3 ]), the pCO2 drop (here from 240 to 218 µatm) occurs along the compensation line (blue). The reduction of pCO2 and ocean inventories is composed of two steps: the actual loss of carbon due to the imbalance (red line) and subsequent calcite compensation, that is, precipitation of CaCO3 reducing ocean CT and AT in a ratio of 1:2 (green line).\nhorizon depth by say 0.5 km, then the calculated flux imbalance is −1 to −2%. Conversely, if [CO2−3 ] increases, the flux imbalance is −0.2 to −0.4% of Fvm +Fgw. Note that despite glacial–interglacial variations, the evidence suggests a rather constant, average saturation horizon depth during the late Pleistocene24. Thus, the most likely scenario is constant [CO2−3 ]; long-term trends in saturation horizon depth larger than a few hundred metres over this timescale are very unlikely. In summary, the estimated maximum imbalance between CO2 inputs and uptake by silicate weathering over the past 610 kyr is probably 1–2% or smaller. These are very small numbers, despite the fact that a range of possible pCO2 and [CO2−3 ] changes have been included in our analysis (Fig. 3). Simulations with a 10-box ocean-sediment model25 yield very similar results, which are insensitive to changes in terrestrial biomass (see the Supplementary Information).\nOur results show that the net input–weathering balance closely holds on a long-term basis despite superimposed glacial–interglacial variations in CO2, temperature and potentially weathering regimes. If weathering changes with the phase of the glacial–interglacial cycle, then net input and silicate weathering are only in balance over the timescale of a full cycle, or longer. (This impedes quantification of the imbalance on shorter timescales because the signal-to-noise ratio drops and surface recycling becomes more important.) The evidence suggests that relative to interglacial stages, weathering in the interior of continents was reduced during glacial periods, whereas weathering on exposed shelves (particularly carbonates) was enhanced owing to lowered sea level. The combined changes are believed to have been small26,27. Nevertheless, differences in the net input–weathering balance\nand ocean inventories between glacial and interglacial stages are possible. Beyond the timescale of a full glacial cycle, however, long-term trends in ocean inventories and atmospheric CO2 require long-term trends in the endogenic imbalance (and/or surface recycling). Conversely, evaluation of scenarios solely caused by an endogenic imbalance allows the maximum mismatch between long-term carbon-cycle fluxes to be inferred from long-term trends in CO2. In the present approach, the trends are derived from ice-core data over the past 610 kyr (Fig. 1).\nThe major implication of our study is that over the late Pleistocene, CO2 inputs to the atmosphere from volcanism/metamorphism and net organic carbon oxidation were closely balanced by average continental silicate weathering uptake. Tectonically driven degassing, for instance, is entirely independent from weathering processes occurring at the surface of the Earth. The fine balance between the fluxes therefore requires\n314 nature geoscience VOL 1 MAY 2008 www.nature.com/naturegeoscience\n© 2008 Nature Publishing Group\nan efficient stabilizing feedback that links weathering rates to, for example, volcanic degassing (coincidental agreement to within less than 1–2% over more than half a million years is implausible). The most plausible explanation is that weathering rates are regulated by a feedback controlled by the concentration of atmospheric CO2 (refs 1–4). Previous arguments supporting the feedback were theoretical, projecting that in the absence of the feedback, significant shifts in atmospheric CO2 would occur within a few million years. We have provided the first observational evidence for the operation and efficacy of this feedback, which reveals its essential role for stabilizing the Earth’s long-term climate in recently generated ice-core CO2 records."

    "text": "We estimated linear trends in the long-term CO2 data using two different record lengths, two different time spacings and two different regressions, yielding eight different trend estimates (Table 1). The full and a truncated data set were analysed. For the latter, the time interval’s start- and end-points were both chosen in warm periods (Marine Isotope Stage ‘MIS’ 15.5 and Holocene epoch) to include full wavelengths of climate cycles. The full data set includes the glacial stage preceding MIS 15.5, which may bias the trend towards the cold climate phase in the oldest part of the record. Individual time intervals between succeeding ice-core measurements are generally different, which may lead to data clustering and scarcity in different parts of the record (Fig. 1). To eliminate possible biases associated with this non-uniformity, we also used a record interpolated to uniform time spacing (1t = const.).

  "abstractText": "Feedbacks controlling long-term fluxes in the carbon cycle and in particular atmospheric carbon dioxide are critical in stabilizing the Earth’s long-term climate. It has been hypothesized that atmospheric CO2 concentrations over millions of years are controlled by a CO2-driven weathering feedback that maintains a mass balance between the CO2 input to the atmosphere from volcanism, metamorphism and net organic matter oxidation, and its removal by silicate rock weathering and subsequent carbonate mineral burial. However, this hypothesis is frequently challenged by alternative suggestions, many involving continental uplift and either avoiding the need for a mass balance or invoking fortuitously balanced fluxes in the organic carbon cycle. Here, we present observational evidence for a close mass balance of carbon cycle fluxes during the late Pleistocene epoch. Using atmospheric CO2 concentrations from ice cores, we show that the mean long-term trend of atmospheric CO2 levels is no more than 22 p.p.m.v. over the past 610,000 years. When these data are used in combination with indicators of ocean carbonate mineral saturation to force carbon cycle models, the maximum imbalance between the supply and uptake of CO2 is 1–2% during the late Pleistocene. This long-term balance holds despite glacial–interglacial variations on shorter timescales. Our results provide support for a weathering feedback driven by atmospheric CO2 concentrations that maintains the observed fine mass balance. Carbon dioxide is released from volcanism and metamorphism to the atmosphere at a rate that would double the amount of carbon in the combined ocean–atmosphere system within less than 600 kyr (refs 13,14). Chemical weathering of Ca and Mg silicate rocks followed by carbonate burial removes CO2 from the atmosphere through weathering reactions. The weathering rates of the silicate rocks increase with soil CO2 concentration and temperature. The long-term balance between carbon release and removal has been hypothesized to be maintained by a negative stabilizing feedback, which results from the influence of the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 on the Earth’s surface temperature and silicate rock weathering rates. Note that there are different types of this feedback, for example, before and after the rise of land plants. If the rate of carbon input to the ocean–atmosphere system would exceed the rate of chemical weathering, atmospheric CO2 and temperature would rise, thereby elevating weathering rates until a new balance is achieved and vice versa. Thus, CO2 levels over millions of years would be controlled by a CO2-driven weathering feedback that maintains a mass balance between CO2 input to and removal from the atmosphere. One school of thought has promoted this feedback as a key player in the long-term stabilization of the Earth’s climate. However, this view is controversial and frequently challenged by conflicting hypotheses. These hypotheses often involve continental uplift and avoid the need for a mass balance or postulate organic carbon fluxes that coincidentally balance the cycle. Until present, the advocates of the weathering feedback have theoretically argued that CO2 would undergo large variations within a few million years, if the feedback was absent. Unfortunately, the mechanism is difficult to prove, partly because the involved fluxes cannot be measured directly over millions of years. As a result, the CO2-driven weathering feedback, which has probably prevented runaway greenhouse and icehouse conditions over timescales of millions to billions of years, remains speculative. To provide observational constraints on long-term carbon fluxes, we have turned to recently generated ice-core CO2 records, now covering 650 kyr of the late Pleistocene epoch. Previous studies have focused on analysing the causes of the glacial–interglacial variations. However, despite variations on the timescale of thousands of years, there is remarkably little trend on the timescale of hundreds of thousands of years. Here, we show that the lack of a strong trend in atmospheric CO2 or ocean chemistry over this time period implies a tight coupling between CO2 sources to and sinks from the atmosphere and oceans. We have analysed Antarctic ice-core CO2 records spanning the past 650 kyr (refs 10–12) (Fig. 1). The calculated linear, long-term trends in CO2 based on different fit models (see the Methods section) range from −22 ± 2 p.p.m.v to +10 ± 6 p.p.m.v. per 610 kyr (Table 1). In other words, the mean, long-term atmospheric CO2 change during the past 610 kyr is at most 22 p.p.m.v. Superimposed on this trend are the well-known glacial–interglacial variations. In general, causes for a mean pCO2 change can be split into two categories (see Supplementary Information, Fig. S1). (i) ‘Surface recycling’: a redistribution of carbon between or within surficial reservoirs of ocean (inventory =M C ), atmosphere (M atm C ) and terrestrial biosphere (M trr C ), with total carbon inventory M S C (refs 13,14):",
