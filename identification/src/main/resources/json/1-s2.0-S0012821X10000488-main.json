Carlson\nKeywords: strontium isotopes ocean water arc volcanism rivers erosion\nWe have re-assessed the Sr isotopic budget of the modern ocean taking into account the high erosion rates of volcanic islands, and especially of island arcs, emphasizing important contribution from subsurface weathering to global budgeting. We propose that intensive weathering on volcanic islands, island arcs and oceanic islands, coupled with large surface and subsurface water fluxes is the missing source of mantlederived 87Sr/86Sr (0.703) in seawater Sr isotope balance. In our approach, it represents 60% of the actual mantle-like input of Sr to the oceans, the remaining 40% supplied by ridge-crest hydrothermal activity and sea-floor low-temperature alteration of basalts. The seawater Nd isotopic budget is consistent with this interpretation and explains well the regional contributions from ridge crest and island arc activity among the oceans.\ne Guillemin B.P. 6009, F-45000\nll rights reserved.\n© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio measured in a marine limestone registers the ocean water composition at the time of the limestone deposition. Limestone 87Sr/86Sr ratios do vary with geological time. The question asked since the pioneeringwork of Veizer and Compston (1974) and Brass (1976) is how to interpret it? How can we extract information relative to ocean geological history?\nThe answer to this fundamental challenge to geochemistry depends on one key question: what is the quantitative explanation of the present-day oceanic 87Sr/86Sr, which is uniform worldwide.\nFor a long time it was admitted that seawater Sr isotopic ratio is inherited from the mixture of continental erosion products and ridgecrest hydrothermal fluids (Brass, 1976; Brevard and Allègre, 1977; Albarède et al., 1981; Chaudhuri and Clauern, 1986; Palmer and Edmond, 1989). This simple interpretation has been challenged recently and unsuccessful efforts have been made to give alternative explanations (e.g. Davis et al., 2003).\nIn the present paper, we give a new interpretation of the oceanic 87Sr/86Sr ratio, using the 87Sr/86Sr measurements on major rivers all over the world accumulated by our group and others. This model shows the fundamental importance of island arc contribution and opens the door to a reinterpretation of the geological oceanic 87Sr/86Sr record in limestone during the Whole Phanerozoïc (Allègre et al., 1996, in preparation)."

    "text": "The actual 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater is 0.709176±0.000003. This ratio is nearly constant all over the oceans as the strontium residence time in seawater is larger than 3 Ma and themixing time of the oceans is about 1500 years (or longer) (Broecker and Peng, 1982).\nSince the first studies of the seawater Sr isotopic variations through time as recorded in accumulated marine limestones (Gast, 1955; Hurley et al., 1965; Peterman et al., 1970; Veizer and Compston, 1974; Burke et al., 1982), it was admitted that the two major sources of strontium in the ocean were continental erosion transported by rivers and another component from the mantle, since the oceanic 87Sr/86Sr is different from the average continental values. Later on, with the discovery of hydrothermal circulation at ridge crests, it was admitted that this was the source of the Sr mantle component (Brass, 1976; Brevard and Allègre, 1977; Albarède et al., 1981; Palmer and Edmond, 1989). Different mass-budget estimates have since questioned this possibility on quantitative grounds (Fehn et al., 1983; Morton and Sleep, 1985; Sleep, 1991): the hydrothermal Sr flux is too low to explain the present-day 87Sr/86Sr of the ocean. Davis et al. (2003) tried to work out this problem by involving ophiolites or metamorphic processes, without success; they could not close the budget.\nWe have measured 87Sr/86Sr in 25 rivers of the world, completing the already existing data bank, which now gathers more than 30 principal rivers of the world (Table 1, data from Gaillardet et al., 1999 and references therein). The river discharge weighted average 87Sr/ 86Sr for this database is 0.7136±0.0002. Mid-oceanic ridge hydrothermal 87Sr/86Sr, measured by several authors, follows Albarède et al. (1981) and is 0.7029±0.0003.\n87Sr 86Sr ! SW = x 87Sr 86Sr ! M + ð1−xÞ 87Sr 86Sr ! CC\nð1Þ\nx being the mass fraction of Sr coming from the mantle. With the above Sr isotopic ratios for seawater, river and\nhydrothermal ridge end-members, we can compute that 41% of Sr is coming from the mantle and 59% from the continental crust.\nThe Sr input from theweathering of continental crust (CC) can also be split between carbonate (carb) and silicate (sil) rock weathering and a new mass-budget for strontium isotopic ratio assessed:\n87Sr 86Sr ! CC = y 87Sr 86Sr ! sil + ð1−yÞ 87Sr 86Sr ! carb\nð2Þ\ny being the proportion of Sr arising from silicate rock weathering. For the silicate rock weathering end-member, we have calculated an average 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the suspended loads carried by big rivers of 0.721±0.004, using our own measurements and other published results (Table 1). Phanerozoïc limestones show 87Sr/86Sr variations from 0.707 to 0.709 (Peterman et al., 1970; Veizer and Compston, 1974) and since the Sr recycling time in the sedimentation–erosion cycle is about 100 to 150 Ma (Ronov, 1964; Brevard and Allègre, 1977, Berner et al., 1983; Palmer and Edmond, 1989; Veizer and Mackenzie,\nWith the chosen values Eq. (2) leads to 43% of the continental river Sr coming from silicate rock weathering (without any apportioning to granitoïds, metamorphic rocks, shales or volcanic rocks) and 57% from carbonate rock weathering (limestone and dolomite) (Fig. 1).\nIn terms of fluxes, continental rivers, with a water flux of 3.74·1019 g/a (Meybeck and Ragu, 1997) and a mean Sr concentration of 44 ppb±15 (data fromGaillardet et al., 1999 and references therein), bring 1.65·1012 g of Sr per year to the oceans. The 41% Sr mantle input, previously defined by mass balance Eq. (1), leads then to a supposed ridge-crest hydrothermal Srflux of 11.6·1011 g of Sr per year. However, heatflowdata have shown that hydrothermalflux at ridge crest ismuch smaller than previously thought (Fehn et al., 1983; Morton and Sleep, 1985; Sleep, 1991) and consequently not quantitatively capable of balancing the continental input to the seawater Sr isotope budget. The most recent estimate of Davis et al. (2003) gives a Sr flux from ridgecrest hydrothermal and low-temperature sea-floor basalt alteration of 3.15·1011 g/a,which represents only 27%of themantlefluxneeded.We have tofindanothermantle-like source of Sr accounting for 8.47·1011 g of Sr per year."

    "text": "Classical estimations of the silicate weathering, and strontium, fluxes are based on studies of the largest rivers worldwide. However,\n2 (εNd)X={(143Nd/144Nd)X/(143Nd/144Nd)CHUR−1}⁎10,000, with CHUR=primitive mantle.\nsubsequent to publication by Milliman and Meade (1983), demonstrating the particularly high sediment fluxes from small mountainous rivers in South-East Asia, and the publication of Meybeck (1986) pointing out the variable weatherability of different lithologies, small and medium size “basaltic” rivers have received an increased attention (e.g. Benedetti et al., 1994; Gislason et al., 1996; Négrel and Deschamps, 1996; Louvat and Allègre, 1997, 1998; Louvat, 1997; Dessert et al., 2001, 2009; Rad et al., 2007, 2008; Das et al., 2005; Louvat et al., 2008). These studies demonstrated that weathering rates for basalts are the highest among silicate rocks other than the ultramafics, and that rivers draining volcanic rocks have to be considered as a separate input in the worldwide geochemical budgets. For example the atmospheric CO2 consumption by weathering of volcanic rocks represents 30 to 40% of the global consumption by silicate rock weathering (Dessert et al., 2003). While some rivers draining continental basalts are included in the average calculations of global weathering budgets, small or medium size volcanic islands are not, and they are also not included in the digitalized geographical/ geological world maps (e.g. Amiotte-Suchet et al., 2003).\nIn terms of water fluxes, the classical approach to the budget of water flowing into the ocean is to consider the river water fluxes as established by hydrological survey statistics. This is not satisfactory for volcanic islands. First, the riverine hydrological budgets on these islands, when they exist, often underestimate the annual quantities of water flowing in the river catchments because the biggest events during storms or cyclones are difficult to monitor. Second, as pointed out by several authors (e.g. Milliman andMeade, 1993), the amount of water that is transmitted outside river channels is great particularly for volcanic islands because their hydrological network is immature. As an example, on Réunion Island, on themore recent part of the Piton de la Fournaise volcanowith no rivers, the infiltratedwater represents almost 90% of the rain water once the evapo-transpiration is subtracted and for the most mature part of this island with the largest rivers it still represents 30% (Folio, 2001). In the Lesser Antilles, where pyroclastic flows widely distributed on the Martinique and Guadeloupe highly enhance the porosity within the river catchments, subsurface water flow is enhanced accordingly (Rad et al., 2007). For the estimation of IAs and OIs water flux to the oceans we have chosen another approach based on mean rainfall averages.\nFrom geographical and geological maps, we have calculated an approximate cumulative surface of 2.02·106 km2 for IAs and OIs worldwide, only the volcanic part of the island surface areas has been taken into account (Table 2). Extending this surface to a surface area weighted average rainfall of 2800 mm/a (Table 2), we deduce a water flux of 5.66·1018 g/a from volcanic islands (IAs plus OIs). Subtracting an evapo-transpiration ratio of 25%, yields about 4.24·1018 g of water per year. Thus, accepting that all this water ultimately returns to the oceans via permanent rivers, subsurface flows and groundwaters, a mean Sr concentration of 200 ppb in the IAs and OIs waters is needed to close the Sr isotope oceanic budget (required to generate a flux of 8.45·1011 g of Sr per year).\nOur study of subsurface water fluxes on the IAs of Antilles and the OI of Réunion (Rad et al., 2007) has shown that due to underground alteration, the underground contributions of Sr to the ocean are about 2 to 3 times higher than is the case for surface rivers. With subsurface water fluxes to the evaluated systematically for the whole Earth, the global geochemical budgets may be quite different fromwhat they are today.\nWe compiled Sr concentrations for rivers of different IAs and OIs (Fig. 2a). Despite the fact that this list includes only few island arc rivers (mostly Java, Lesser Antilles and Kamchatka), the distribution of Sr has a near-Gaussian shape centered at 35±10 ppb. This summary does not include hot and cold underground waters with longer residence time, many injected directly to the sea as springs. As shown by Rad et al. (2007) for the Antilles and Réunion islands, these underground waters are far more concentrated in Sr than the surface waters. The computed average Sr concentration for island arc and OI waters is thus a minimum value. Compilation of strontium concentrations for some thermal springs in Réunion, Iceland and Lesser Antilles (Louvat and Allègre, 1997; Rad et al., 2007; Louvat et al., 2008) yields a mean Sr concentration of 450±150 ppb (Fig. 2b). With such a concentration, an admixture of 40% of thermal springs and/or underground waters to the river waters is sufficient to reach 200 ppb, the needed Sr concentration.\nThe above considerations suggest that the continents and islands discharge 37.4·1018 g and 4.24·1018 g of water/a, respectively. Intuitively that ratio of 8.8/1 seems to be rather small. However, as pointed out by Milliman and Meade (1993)) the contribution of the island arc and small mountainous rivers with high erosion potential (e.g. small tropical rivers weathering basalts) to the global suspended sediment load is disproportionally high. We claim the same for the dissolved load and, if so, weathering of the island arc and OI is the missing flux that is necessary to close the seawater strontium isotopic balance."

    "text": "Nd has a much shorter residence time than Sr in seawater and, while not well established, its isotopic composition is variable among different oceans (Arsouze et al., 2007). For Nd, in contrast to Sr, hydrothermal circulation at ridge crest is not a significant source (e.g. Michard et al., 1983; Piepgras and Wasserburg, 1985; Rudnicki and Elderfield, 1993). Ultimately its isotopic composition in seawater reflects erosion of continental and volcanic sources.\nUtilizing the average Nd isotope ratio in seawater for the different oceans given in Arsouze et al. (2007) (Fig. 3), and weighing by the relative size of each ocean, we compute a world oceanic average (εNd)SW2of−6.9±1,which ismeaningful only for a globalmassbalance exercise and its comparison to Sr.\nGoldstein and Jacobsen (1987) in their study of rivers worldwide demonstrated that for river, the εNd of the suspended material was on average similar to the εNd of the dissolved load. We have used this\nrelationship and the database in Table 1), from which we compute a discharge weighted average (εNd)CC for the rivers of −12.0±1 (CC stands here for continental crust). The Nd input by dissolved loads from continental rivers thus cannot explain the seawater εNd and we need a complementary mantle type input with positive εNd. Since the attribution to ridge-crest hydrothermal input is precluded by empirical observations, weathering of volcanic islands is an opportune candidate, as already advocated or local considerations (Dia et al., 1992; Jeandel et al., 1998; Sholkovitz et al., 1999; Amakawa et al., 2000; Lacan and Jeandel, 2001; Goldstein and Hemming, 2003; Jones et al., 2008) but not at a global scale.\nA simple global mass balance based on continental erosional input with an average (εNd)CC of −12 and volcanic island erosional component with a (εNd)VI of +6, suggests that 70% of oceanic Nd comes from the continents and 30% from volcanic islands. Thus the ratio of continental to volcanic Nd input is 2.3, similar to a ratio of 2 for Sr, an acceptable agreement in view of the approximations of the present calculations.\nAn examination of the regional distribution of εNd among different oceans is also quite informative. Using the εNd of the principal rivers worldwide (Table 1), we can tentatively calculate the erosional input for each ocean. We did the computation by weighing each river εNd with its discharge and assuming that all rivers have the same Nd concentrations. Exceptions are the Arctic rivers, where we double the concentration because measured values appear to be very high (see Goldstein and Jacobsen, 1987). We obtain εNd of −12.8, −3.0 and −8.0 for the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, respectively, very close to the measured average εNd for each ocean (e.g. Arsouze et al., 2007). With the εNd summarized in Fig. 3, we propose that continental erosion accounts for 96% of the Nd in the Atlantic ocean (vs 4% from volcanics), 52% in the Pacific ocean (vs 48%) and 73% in the Indian ocean (vs 27%).\nFor the Atlantic this is not surprising since the world largest rivers (Amazon, Orinoco, Parana, Congo, Niger, and St Lawrence) discharge into this ocean, islands arcs are relatively scarce (mainly Antilles and Sandwich islands), and the largest oceanic islands are in relatively low\nrainfall regions (Iceland, Svalbard, Franz Josef Land…). In the Pacific, on the other hand, the εNd of seawater clearly reflects the presence of the largest active island arc systems of the world, from Kermadec to Tonga, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Japan, all the way to Kamchatka. The Indian Ocean, with an average εNd of −7.0±2.7, is slightly more complex because it receives water from the Pacific Ocean via the Indonesian Gateway. However, it also receives large quantities of erosional products from the Himalayan Rivers (Ganges, Brahmapoutra, Irrawaddy, Salween…)with average εNd of−13.3±1) aswell as from a portion of the very active Indonesian island arc that has rainfall among the largest in the world.\nWe contest the earlier assertion that the differences in εNd among the oceans are due to differences in the ages of the continents that surround them. The average continental εNd is almost the same for all oceans, or only slightly higher for the Pacific (Fig. 3) and the major difference is the relative distribution of island arcs among the oceans. It is the surface weathering of these and transport by surface and\nunderground waters that controls the εNd seawater mass balance of each ocean.\nSuch island arc contribution is clearly evident from regional studies of Nd transport through the Indonesian strait and in the vicinity of Papua New Guinea (Jeandel et al, 1998; Sholkovitz et al., 1999; Amakawa et al., 2000; Lacan and Jeandel, 2001), a feature not strongly emphasized in the original papers."

    "heading": "5. Conclusion",
    "text": "Following studies by Rad et al. (2007) in Lesser Antilles and Réunion that documented the fundamental importance of underground water input to the oceans, we argue that volcanic islands are indeed a major source of Sr in seawater, a scenario similar to Nd isotopes budget where ridge-cresthydrothermal input is negligible. This approach enablesus to refine the models that are based on 87Sr/86Sr evolution of seawater through geological time. During collision of two tectonic plates, island arcs are active prior to the continental collision but with the commencement of the actual collision continental erosion, linked with mountainsbuilding, increaseswhile island arc erosion stopsbecause the arcs are buried in the suture zone. Both effects tend to increase the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio during convergence and canbeused to interpret 87Sr/86Sr record through the Phanerozoïc."
