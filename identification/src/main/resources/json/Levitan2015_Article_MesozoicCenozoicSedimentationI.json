    "text": "Global lithological paleogeographic maps for the Mesozoic–Cenozoic were published by A.B. Ronov, V.E. Khain, and A.N. Balukhovskii in the late 1980s (Ronov et al., 1989). Revealed global tendencies were described by Ronov (1980). Two previous papers on the problems of the facies structure, quantitative parame ters, and sedimentation history of the Circum Arctic belt (territory between 60° N and the present day shelf break of the Arctic ocean) based on the volumetric method of Ronov were focused to the Triassic–Jurassic and Cretaceous–Paleogene, respectively (Levitan et al., 2014, 2015). In these papers, we mentioned fun damental and applied problems that should be taken into account using Ronov’s approach in this region. This paper represents the extension of the above men tioned researches to the Miocene–Pliocene sediments. It has the same structure as (Levitan et al., 2014, 2015), except for the sections “Introduction” and “Factual Materials and Technique”. Since this paper is final, a comparative analysis of some quantitative parameters of sedimentation history from the Early Triassic to Pliocene was performed not only for the Circum Arctic belt, but also on a global scale.\nOur approaches were considered in detail in the sec tion “Factual Material and Techniques” of the first paper. This work was based on the lithological–paleo geographic maps for the Neogene from the World Atlas\nof Lithological Paleogeographic Maps, published by A.B. Ronov, V.E. Khain, and A.N. Balukhovskii (Ronov et al., 1989). The corresponding descriptions of sections and maps are reported in the monograph His torical Geodynamics. Mesozoic and Cenozoic (Khain and Balukhovskii, 1993).\nThese maps for the Circum Arctic Belt have been edited by us at a fixed position of continents. The map was drawn using equal area azimuthal projection on a scale of 1 : 25000000, separately for each age section for the Eastern and Western hemispheres. The maps were edited using generalized data on large regions reported after publishing the atlas, for instance, for Spitsbergen and the Barents–Kara sea region (Smelror et al., 2009). We also used separate important publications for rela tively small areas, for instance (Rise et al., 2010; Gusev et al., 2009; Hegewald and Jokat, 2013, and others).\nBelow we present lithofacies maps (with isopachs) of the Circum Arctic belt for the Pliocene and Miocene (Figs. 1, 2). The age boundaries of the Neogene Series were rounded according to the geological scale (Grad stein et al., 2004), where Miocene is bracketed between 23.0 and 5.3 Ma (a duration of 17.7 Ma) and Pliocene, between 5.3 and 1.8 Ma (duration of 3.5 Ma). It should be noted that in his calculations, Ronov (1980) used other age boundaries: between 25.0 and 9.0 Ma for the Miocene (duration of 16 Ma), and between 9.0 and 2.0 Ma for the Pliocene (duration of 7 Ma).\nKeywords: Circum Arctic belt, Miocene, Pliocene, lithofacies zone, sedimentary rocks\nDOI: 10.1134/S0016702915110038\n938\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nLEVITAN et al.\n1 2\n3 4\n5 6\n7 8\n9 10\n11 12\n13 14\n15 16\n80°\n70 °\n60 °\n20°\n40 °\n10 0°\n12 0°\n14 0°\n16 0°\n180°\n> 12\n> 10\n17 0\n15 0\n70 13\n7 12\n0\n10 0\n17\n50 0\n85 0\n45\n14 1\n20 0\n90 0\n22 00\n85\n86\n50\n25 0\n60 0\n67\n60 00\n12 0 1\n00 17\n0\n44\n10 0\n100\n10 0\n80 °\n80°\n60° 0°\n70°\n60°\n(а )\nF ig\n. 1 .

    "text": "Miocene. In the Eastern Hemisphere, the Miocene coal bearing sequences are widespread at the territory of the Circum Arctic, from the Kara Sea and east of it (Fig. 1a). They are developed in the terrestrial facies in the Kara Sea and northern East Siberia, and in alterna tion of terrestrial facies with shallow marine sediments in the northwestern East Siberia and within the Verkhoyansk–Kolyma Mountainous system. The thickness of the Miocene coal bearing sequences is usually no more than few hundreds of meters.\nContinental sands are developed in the central and southwestern parts of the Barents Sea. Miocene marine clays (sometimes with diatoms) are described in the Norwegian–Greenland basin, while the same clays without diatoms were found in northernmost East Siberia.\nMiocene basalts are known in the Putorana Plateau area. Andesites and rhyolites were found in the several areas of the Okhotsk Chukotsk volcanic belt.\nIt is seen in the Miocene map of the Western Hemi sphere (Fig. 1b) that the southern and central parts of the Circum Arctic belt are occupied by giant eroded areas. A narrow band of sedimentary rocks is devel oped in the northern part of the studied region of North America, significantly expanding in the lower reaches and underwater delta of Mackenzie River, where the thickness of shallow marine clays exceeds 500 m, reaching 3700 m in the depocenter. In the west, this field is rimmed by a band of continental sands, which locally reach up to 800 m thick on the outer shelf. The coal bearing sequences few hundreds meters thick (up to 1000 m) exist in northwestern Alaska. The alternation sequence of shallow marine clays and sands surrounds Greenland, occupying its entire shelf, except for the northwestern part. Their thickness sometimes reaches a few thousands of meters, although, more frequently does not exceed a few hundreds of meters.\nPliocene. In the Eastern Hemisphere, the Circum Arctic Belt in the Pliocene (Fig. 2a) was also character ized by the wide development of eroded areas. Spacious zones occupied by continental sands are mainly described in the eastern part of the considered region, however, they are also known on the Norwegian shelf, where include coal bearing facies. Their thickness is usually no more than a few tens of meters, but increases\nto a few hundreds of meters while approaching marine basins of the Pacific Ocean or Norwegian–Greenland.\nThe shallow marine clays were accumulated in the Norwegian–Greenland Sea, mainly (sometimes in alternation with continental sands) in the northeast and east of the region, with diatom flask in the southern Okhotsk Chukotsk volcanic belt. Pliocene deep marine sediments are known in the basins of the eastern Bar ents Sea.\nThe areas of erosion and continental sedimentation increase in the Western Hemisphere (Fig. 2b). Shallow marine sedimentation is shifted to the north and marine basins formed in the Cenozoic (for instance, around Greenland). The coal accumulation is terminated prac tically elsewhere (except for Central Alaska). The thick ness of the Pliocene sediments in the Mackenzie depo center reaches 1500 m. The thickness of the continental Pliocene is usually no more than 100–200 m, becoming higher only in some basins."

    "text": "The facies structure of the Miocene is as follows: eroded areas occupy an area of 19962.5 thou km2; lithofacies zone of continental sedimentation, 2790.9 thou km2; shallow marine sedimentation spanned an area of 2775.2 thou km2, and deep marine sedimentation, 121.1 thou km2. The same parameters in the Pliocene were 19578.1, 4435.5, 2687.1, and 138.5 thou km2, respectively. This indi cates that the area occupied by continental sediments sharply increased from Miocene to Pliocene.\nVolumes, masses, and accumulation rates of sedi ments in the entire Circum Arctic belt and in separate lithofacies zones. The total volumes of accumulated deposits in the Miocene and Pliocene were 1690.3 and 492.7 thou km3, respectively. The distribution of sedi ments over lithofacies zones in the Miocene is as fol lows: zone of continental sedimentation 501.1, shallow marine sedimentation 893.9, deep marine sedimenta tion, 220.8 thou km3. The same values for the Pliocene are, respectively, 266.3, 220.6, and 2.9 thou km3.\nThe total mass of dry sediments was 4225.8 in the Miocene and 1231.8 Tt in the Pliocene. It shows the fol lowing distribution over the lithofacies (Pliocene in numerator, Miocene in denominator): continental sed imentation (665.8/1253.8), shallow marine sedimenta tion (551.5/2234.5), and deep marine sedimentation (7.3/552.0). Due to the different duration of Miocene and Pliocene, it is meaningless to discuss the revealed differences in the volume and mass of dry sediments between these systems.\nThe total sedimentation rate was 238.7 in the Miocene and 351.9 Tt/Ma in the Pliocene. It shows the following distribution over the lithofacies zones (Pliocene in numerator, Miocene in denominator):\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nMESOZOIC–CENOZOIC SEDIMENTATION IN THE CIRCUM ARCTIC BELT 943\ncontinental sedimentation (190.2/70.8), shallow marine sedimentation (157.6/126.2), and deep marine sedimentation (2.1/31.2). The total sedimentation rate in the Pliocene was much higher than in the Miocene, mainly at the expense of the lithofacies zone of continental sedimentation. This indicates an increase of erosion rate in the Pliocene as compared to the Miocene, which was probably related to the growth of neotectonic activity. Climatic factor pre sumably played a subordinate role, although it is impossible to estimate it quantitatively.\nMasses of the main types of sediments and their accumulation rates in the lithofacies zones. The masses of the main types of sediments (in Tt) show the follow ing distribution in the lithofacies zone of continental sedimentation: (Pliocene in numerator, Miocene in denominator): sand (453.5/913.8), clays (59.8/172.5), conglomerate (148.5/95.8), and coal bearing sedi ments (262.5/4891.5). Thus, the Miocene was domi nated by the coal bearing sediments, while Pliocene, by sands.\nThe masses of the main types of sediments in a zone of shallow marine sedimentation are as following (in Tt) (Pliocene in numerator, Miocene in denominator): sand (122.8/612.0), silt (5.3/0), clay (377.5/1548.3), conglomerate (0/64.0), glacial deposit (46.0/0), diatom ooze (0/3.8), nanoplanktonic ooze (0/1.8), and nano foraminiferal ooze (0/4.8). In this zone, the Miocene was dominated by clays, while sands were second in abundance. The same proportions preserved in the Pliocene.\nThe masses of the main types of sediments in the deep marine sediments (in Tt) are as follows (Pliocene in nominator, Miocene in denominator): sand (0/206.5), clay (7.0/206.5), flysch (0/78.3), and diatom ooze (0.3/0). This period, as Neogene, was dominated by clays.\nThe accumulation rate of the different types of sed iments was calculated on the basis of above presented data on their masses in the considered lithofacies zones. In particular, the following accumulation rates were determined for different rocks in the zone of con tinental sedimentation (in Tt/Ma) (Pliocene in nomi nator, Miocene in denominator): sand (129.6/51.6), clay (17.1/9.7), conglomerate (42.4/5.4), coal bear ing deposit (75.0/276.4). Thus, the Miocene was dom\ninated by the coal bearing sediments, while sands were second in abundance, which indicates the higher humidity at that time. The Pliocene was dominated by sand, while coal bearing sediments are the second main type.\nThe distribution of sediments in terms of sedimenta tion rate in a zone of the shallow marine sedimentation is as follows (in Tt/Ma) (Pliocene in denominator, Miocene in denominator): sand (35.1/34.6), silt (1.5/0), clay (107.9/87.5), conglomerate (0/3.6), gla cial deposits (13.1/0), diatom ooze (0/0.2), nanoplank tonic ooze (0/0.1), and nanoforaminiferal ooze (0/0.3). The main deposits in this zone are clays, and the second widespread rock is sand. The same proportions pre served up to the terminal Neogene. The Pliocene is characterized by the significant accumulation rate of marine glacial sediments related to the more severe cli matic conditions due to the continental glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe main types of deep marine sediments are char acterized by the following accumulation rates (in Tt/Ma) (Pliocene in nominator, Miocene in denomi nator): sand (0/11.7), clay (2.0/11.7), flysch (0.4/4), diatom ooze (0.1/0). Clays dominated during entire Neogene.\nAreas, volumes, masses, and accumulation rates of volcanic ashes and main types of volcanic rocks are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Analysis of these tables allowed us to conclude that (1) explosive and effusive activities were much more intense in the Miocene as compared to the Pliocene; (2) marine volcanic rocks are practically absent in the Pliocene; (3) continental intermediate felsic volcanic rocks dominated over mafic rocks in the Miocene, while mafic–intermediate rocks are predom inant in the Pliocene; (4) felsic volcanic rocks are absent in the marine Neogene."

    "text": "Comparative analysis of main parameters: relative sea areas, sedimentary mass, and sedimentation rates The corresponding data on all studied Mesozoic–Cen ozoic series are presented in Table 3. Some of the con\n944\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nLEVITAN et al.\nsidered parameters are correlated using the geological time scale (Figs. 3, 4).\nHigh positive correlation coefficient (0.77) revealed for variations of sea areas (Table 3, Fig. 3) indicates that the sequence of transgressions and regressions in the Circum Arctic region was determined by global trends. The periods of these first order variations caused by tectonic events were distinguished by Ronov (1980) and later confirmed in a summary on the global sea level fluctuations in the Phanerozoic by (Miller et al., 2005). It should be noted that the relative sea area in the Arctic region during the Mesozoic–Cenozoic (except for the first half of the Neogene) was higher than those on the continental blocks of the Earth. We believe that this fea ture is related to the continental margin position of the Circum Antarctic belt (including palinspatic recon struction). The Paleocene anomaly (Table 3) was pre sumably caused by active tectonic processes related to rifting and spreading of the Norwegian–Greenland\nBasin, Labrador Sea, and other marine basins formed in the region, which were filled by a giant amount of sea water. It is characteristic that the global Triassic–Early Jurassic geocratic epoch (Ronov, 1980) is poorly expressed in the Arctic region, unlike Cenozoic geo cratic trend, which was related to the neotectonic movements beginning from Oligocene (Khain, 2001) (Fig. 3). Such difference of the Triassic–Early Jurassic epoch is related to the absence of the deep water Arctic Ocean at that time.\nEven higher correlation coefficient of 0.89 was obtained for the masses of dry sediment. However, there are significant differences between geological scales applied by us (Gradstein et al., 2004) and Ronov (1980). Therefore, data on sedimentation rate were recalcu lated on a single time scale (Gradstein et al., 2004). As expected, the correlation coefficient decreased as com pared to that of sedimentary masses (Table 3), but remained sufficiently high (0.78). Thus, the consider\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nMESOZOIC–CENOZOIC SEDIMENTATION IN THE CIRCUM ARCTIC BELT 945\nation of this parameter also supports the conclusion that the global trend prevailed over regional trend in the studied region. With allowance for the presented above data on the sharp predominance of terrigenous clastic clayey material over biogenic material in the Circum Arctic region, the sedimentation rate was determined by tectonic, mainly global processes (including oro genic ones). This also follows from a drastic increase in the accumulation rate of sedimentary material in the Neogene (Fig. 4), which coincided with well expressed global (Khain, 2001) and regional (Knies et al., 2014; Solgaard et al., 2013) manifestations of the neotectonic epoch. The sedimentation rates in the Circum Arctic region in the Pliocene are sharply lower than global val ues, which is possibly related to the insignificant contri bution of the Alpine folded and orogenic belts in the Arctic region as compared to their global distribution. As known, precisely these belts are characterized by the Earth’s highest denudation rates (Herman et al., 2013).\nComparative analysis of the relative volume (%) of distribution of some sedimentary and volcanic rocks is presented in Table 4 and Figs. 5–7.\nLet us consider the main continental and marine clastic rocks of the sedimentary cover of the Circum Arctic belt. First, except for Pliocene, the marine rocks sharply dominated over continental rocks. Second, as compared to the average data on continents, the Arctic region contains less abundant continental clastic rocks (except for Eocene) and much more abundant marine\nrocks. As already mentioned, this important feature is caused by the marginal continental position of the Cir cum Arctic belt. The correlation coefficient between relative volumes of continental clastic rocks is 0.86, which indicates the dominant role of global trends caused by the evolution of tectonic movements. Much lower (0.46) correlation coefficient for marine clastic– clayey sediments is presumably caused by much higher sedimentation dynamics on the shelf as compared to the land (at the same sources of terrigenous material).\nNow consider the distribution of some climate dependent sediments. For instance, the continental coal bearing sediments are typical of the humid cli mate. Judging from Table 4, the Arctic climate was less humid (more dry) as compared to the global climatic characteristics. The absence of significant correlation coefficient (0.34) indicates the predominance of the regional climatic tendencies over global ones. The same conclusion follows from data on evaporites (Levitan et al., 2014, 2015), which are typical of the warm arid climate. True arid climate did not exist no during Meso zoic–Cenozoic in the Arctic region. The main part of carbonate (relatively warm water) deposits was described by us in the regions of terrane tectonics (on Alaska, along the northern Pacific margin), where they could arrive with terranes formed in the southerly (respectively, warmer) areas. The correlation coefficient of carbonate development on the continents and in the Circum Arctic belt (in percents of the total sediment\n946\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nLEVITAN et al.\nvolume) for the Mesozoic–Cenozoic was –0.32, which also characterizes the predominance of regional ten dencies above global ones. Thus, obtained data indicate that climatic variability in the studied region signifi cantly differed from global trends.\nLet us consider the proportions of the Mesozoic– Cenozoic global and regional trends for volcanic rocks (Table 4). The continental (terrestrial) volcanic rocks show correlation coefficient of 0.38, which indicates the predominance of regional tendencies over global ones. Marine volcanic rocks are characterized by the correla tion coefficients of 0.58, which rather support the sig nificant role of global trends. The development of con tinental volcanic rocks in the Arctic region significantly exceeded the global values during two epochs: Early–\nMiddle Triassic and Cretaceous–Eocene, which were related to the activity of the Siberian superplume in the former case and, in the latter case, to the regional man ifestation of magmatism in the northern Arctic region (HALIP—High Arctic Large Igneous Province) and the South Anyui ocean in the Cretaceous, and on the continental margins of marine and oceanic basins in the Paleogene.\nIn general, the distribution of marine volcanic rocks in the Arctic region is lower than global values (except for the Early Triassic, which was caused by the Siberian superplume, and to lesser extent, for the Miocene). In addition to the Triassic, the elevated development of marine volcanic rocks occurred in the Late Creta ceous–Paleocene, which was mainly related to the evo\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nMESOZOIC–CENOZOIC SEDIMENTATION IN THE CIRCUM ARCTIC BELT 947\nlution of the marginal Pacific volcanic belts, as well as with the Cretaceous stage of the HALIP formation (Levitan et al., 2015).\nThus, our data indicate that the global tectonic mechanisms played a leading role in the Circum Arctic belt during Mesozoic–Cenozoic history, while climatic and magmatic manifestations were mainly controlled by regional reasons."

    "text": "The general sedimentation conditions in the Cir cum Arctic belt in the Neogene were determined by a combination of regional and global tendencies. It should be noted that from 34 to 18–20 Ma (i.e., in the Oligocene–Aquitanian), the Arctic Ocean developed as a closed basin and had no link with other large oceanic basins (Jacobsson et al., 2007). The Early Miocene (Burdigalian) was marked by the opening of the Fram Strait. Starting from 17.5 Ma, when the width of the strait reached 40–50 km (Jakobsson et al., 2007) or 100 km (Thompson et al., 2010), the water flow from the North Atlantic into the Arctic region (under condi tions of Arctic ocean–Atlantic water exchange) became sufficiently powerful to provide a complete ventilation of the near bottom water of the Arctic Ocean, which resulted in a change of the weakly oxidized sediments by oxidized sediments. The water exchange with Pacific Ocean was provided by opening of the Bering Strait around 4.5 Ma (in the Early Pliocene) (Hegewald and Jokat, 2013). However, it was repeatedly terminated, especially during glaciations and related sea level fall, which is related to the very shallow depth of the Bering Strait. In particular, the examples of such changes are reported in our paper devoted to the Late Pleistocene sedimentation history on the underwater Shirshov Ridge in the Bering Sea (Levitan et al., 2013). The sharp warming by approximately 4°C occurred at 26 Ma (Late Oligocene). Warm conditions preserved to approximately middle Miocene (13 Ma) (Zachos et al., 2001). For instance, according to the paleofloral data, the eastern part of the Canadian Arctic region (Devon Island) in the Early Miocene was characterized by a moderate humid climate with the average annual water temperature varying from + 8 to +12°C. The atmospheric precipitation was estimated at 700– 800 mm (Eronen et al., 2012). The Middle Miocene climatic optimum was recorded on the Earth approxi mately from 17 to 15 Ma (Zachos et al., 2001). In the Great Britain, atmospheric precipitation exceeded 1500 mm/yr during optimum, and accounted for 1200–1500 mm/yr prior to and immediately after opti mum (Eronen et al., 2012). During the Langian (15.97–13.65 Ma), mixed deciduous–coniferous forest grew on the Arctic shore under cold climatic conditions at average annual temperature of 7–9°C (Pound et al., 2012). According to data of the same authors, the Sar ravalian (13.65–11.61 Ma) was characterized by the same types of vegetation, while the average air temper ature at 12 Ma decreased to 4°C/yr. A sharp decrease of the annual air temperature from + 11 to + 4°C was also noted on Central Alaska between 13 and 12 Ma (Will iams et al., 2008). Note that this event occurred approx imately 1 Ma later than the sheet glaciation in West Ant arctica. In the Tortonian (11.61–7.25 Ma), the coast of the Arctic Ocean was covered mainly by evergreen coniferous forests, which grew at the average annual temperature of 4 ± 1°С (Pound et al., 2012). In the Messinian (7.25–5.33 Ma), they gave way to the boreal deciduous forests, while the average annual air temper ature varied from –10 to +6°С. All described changes in the vegetation in the Middle–Late Miocene were asso ciated with a clear decreasing trend in the average humidity of atmosphere (Pound et al., 2011). In United States, the aridization trend became expressed from\n948\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nLEVITAN et al.\n14.8–12.1 Ma, was intensified 12.1–7.6 Ma, and reached maximum in the Early Pliocene (Eronen et al., 2012). Attempts to link the described temperature fluc tuations in the Miocene with partial atmospheric СО2 pressure gave ambiguous results. Some authors (Foster et al., 2012) suggest that this value accounted for 350– 400 ppm during the Middle Miocene climatic opti mum, and 200–260 ppm prior to and immediately after it. According to other researchers (Grein et al., 2013), the pCO2 value in the terminal Oligocene and early Miocene is estimated around 400 ppm and was not related to the climatic changes.\nGlacial–marine deposits became predominant in the deep water drilling core on the Lomonosov Ridge at 13 Ma (Backman et al., 2006), while pack ice appeared either at that time (Krylov et al., 2008) or 1 Ma earlier (Darby, 2008).\nThe Early Pliocene in the Arctic region was very warm: the average air temperature of + 5.5 ± 1.9°C/yr was determined for 5–4 Ma old peat from Ellesmere Island using complex technique, which includes isotope oxygen studies and measurements of the width of annual tree rings in Larix c.f. groenlandii. This temper ature is 14.2°C warmer than the present day tempera ture (Ballantyne et al., 2006). According to the later data (Csank et al., 2011), the average annual air temper ature in the Early Pliocene was even 18.3 ± 4.1°C higher than the present day temperature, while the rel ative humidity was 60–80%. These parameters are also typical of this region, which is situated 15–20° south of the indicated island. It is suggested that the sudden extremely strong warming of the Arctic atmosphere minimum at 10°C that occurred 4 Ma (Elias and Mat tews, 2002) is associated with the reduction of Arctic ice sheet and with increasing temperature of the surface water mass in the North Atlantic and northern part of the Pacific Ocean (Haywood et al., 2001). The Middle Pliocene thermal optimum (Dowsett et al., 1996) factu ally spanned the entire Late Pliocene. Judging from numerous data on marine ostracodes, the average win ter and summer seawater temperatures along Arctic margins between 3.5 and 2.0 Ma exceeded, respectively, 0°C and + 3°C (Cronin et al., 1993). This denotes that the ice free areas existed at least in summer. In the Piacenzian stage (3.6–2.6 Ma), boreal forests migrated further northward (Pound et al., 2011). For instance, pine and birch forests grew on the area of the present day shelf of Chukchi Sea and Vrangel Island (Gusev et al., 2009).\nAt the same time, precisely Piacenzian stage was marked by the mountainous glaciations of the Barents– Svalbard region (3.6–2.4 Ma) (Knies et al., 2009), Scandinavia (2.8 Ma) (Rise et al., 2010), and northern Cordilleras (2.64 Ma) (Hidy et al., 2013), which approximately correspond to the beginning of the con tinental glaciations in the Northern Hemisphere at 2.75 Ma (Venti et al., 2013).\nThe local manifestations of glaciations coincided locally with active neotectonic uplifts (Knies et al., 2009, 2014; Solgaard et al., 2013), which led to the clear increase of the accumulation rate of terrigenous sedi ments, for instance, on the North Alaska shelf (Hege wald and Jokat, 2013). In addition to the neotectonic events, an important tectonic processes that occurred in the Neogene in the Circum Arctic belt were widening and deepening of the Eurasian deep water basin, which was accompanied by the propagating of the ultra low spreading Gakkel Ridge, as well as the possible deepen ing of the Amerasian deep water basin. Note that the deep water drilling on the Lomonosov Ridge discov ered a sufficiently rapid change of relatively shallow water facies by deep water sediments in the Late Miocene (Backman et al., 2006)."

    "heading": "CONCLUSION",
    "text": "The main conclusion of this study is that the Meso zoic–Cenozoic sedimentation in the Circum Acrtic belt was characterized mainly by the precipitation of terrigenous sediments under continental and shelf con ditions of a sublatitudinal zone localized on a high lati tude continental margin. This conclusion is also consis tent with all plate tectonic reconstructions, which sug gest northward migration of the Circum Arctic belt area during Mesozoic.\nThe comparison with global data set showed that the intensity of terrigenous sedimentation, the relative role of continental clastic rocks, and land–sea proportions are determined by global tectonic trends. This indicates that the tectonic evolution of the studied region was determined by a global tectonic “breath” of the Earth.\nAt the same time, the main features of climatic and magmatic changes in the region are mainly defined by regional factors. Among the latter are the Siberian superplume at the Permian–Triassic boundary, Arctic plume in the Late Jurassic–Late Cretaceous, and for mation and development of deep water marine and oceanic basins in the Paleogene–Neogene. Obtained data on the relative area of seas on global and regional scales lead us to conclude that spacious deep water oce anic basins did not exist in the framing of the Circum Arctic belt prior to at least beginning of the Cenozoic (South Anyui paleoocean was characterized by rela tively small sizes).\nIn spite of the mainly regional control of climatic fluctuations, we managed to demonstrate that the glo bal trend of the Cenozoic cooling, which was disturbed by short term well expressed warmings (PETM, Early Eocene, Middle Miocene, Middle Pliocene thermal maxima) and accompanied by aridization trend (Miao et al., 2012), manifested itself in the studied region. The relative role of changes in the partial atmospheric CO2 pressure requires additional studies. The general conti nental glaciation in the Northern Hemisphere started in the Pliocene (more exactly, in the Late Pliocene),\nGEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL Vol. 53 No. 11 2015\nMESOZOIC–CENOZOIC SEDIMENTATION IN THE CIRCUM ARCTIC BELT 949\nalthough pack ices in the central Arctic Ocean have existed already at least 14–13 Ma, while episodic sea sonal sea ice have been known in Arctic since Campa nian (Early Maastrichtian in question), i.e. in the Late Cretaceous (Davies et al., 2009) and in the Middle Eocene (Tripati et al., 2008).\nBased on obtained quantitative parameters of sedi mentation (Levitan et al., 2014, 2015, and this work), the Mesozoic–Cenozoic sedimentation history of the Circum Arctic belt may be subdivided into the follow ing periods: (1) Triassic, (2) Jurassic, (3) Cretaceous, (4) Paleogene, (5) Miocene–Pliocene. According to preliminary data, the end of the Pliocene and Quater nary period should be ascribed to the next, last stage in the sedimentation evolution."

  "abstractText": "Recent literature data on the Circum Arctic belt were compiled to revise the global lithological– paleogeographic maps for the Neogene series published by Ronov, Khain, and Balukhovskii in 1989. The Cir cum Pacific belt is bounded by the present day break of continental shelf of the Arctic Ocean in the north and by 60° N latitude in the south. The legend was simplified by removal of climatic and tectonic informa tion, with emphasis placed on mapping the lithofacies zoning. The areas and volumes occupied by sediments of distinguished lithofacies zones and definite rock groups were calculated for each map. Based on these data, the masses of dry sedimentary and volcanic matter, as well as their accumulation rates were determined. The revealed tendencies in the distribution of these quantitative parameters of the Circum Arctic belt were com pared to the corresponding global trends for separate Mesozoic–Cenozoic stages, except for the Quaternary period. The contribution of regional factors was established for sedimentation and magmatism. It was con cluded that the sedimentation history in the region was mainly controlled by global tectonic trends and may be subdivided into several stages."
