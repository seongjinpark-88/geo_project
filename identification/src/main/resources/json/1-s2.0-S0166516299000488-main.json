    "text": "The Late Permian Moranbah Coal Measures are developed throughout the northern and central Bowen Basin, eastern Australia, and are subject to large-scale opencut coal mining activity. They were deposited in a rapidly subsiding retroarc foreland basin, during frequent base-level changes. Contemporaneous compressive deformation and volcanism facilitated the supply of abundant volcanoclastic sediments, resulting in rapid, but punctuated, basinal aggradation. To the south and east, transgressive–regressive cycles were marked by the inter-digitation of paralic–shallow Ž .marine and alluvial strata. Lonestones dropstones are common within the marine deposits and are attributed to ice-rafting indicative of a cold-climate depositional regime. Two basin-wide chronostratigraphic units, the P-tuff bed and the Harrow Creek superseam, have been used to evaluate the facies architecture of the stratigraphic interval they enclose. The lithofacies mosaic of the 25–75 m thick sequence has been examined by means of 26 widely distributed coreholes and two detailed district-scale studies based around the Moranbah–Goonyella and German Creek minesites. Eight alluvial–shallow marine facies associations have been recognised. Their architectural and temporal relationships allow the accurate reconstruction of the coal-bearing depositional Ž . Ž .system. Two dissimilar, stacked, depositional systems tracts, A organics and B clastics are recognised. The P-tuff bed is enclosed by facies of tract A, forming a thick, low-ash, coal-bearing interval which was emplaced essentially synchronously across the basin. It represents a time of clastic sediment starvation when basin-wide peat mire accumulation prevailed. Four similar extensive coal-bearing intervals within the Moranbah Coal Measures are also considered to represent basin-wide episodes of peat accumulation. This pattern is in strong contrast to traditional views of coal measure development, which argue that coals formed within a contemporary facies\n) Corresponding author.

    "text": "The recognition and interpretation of coal-bearing cyclothems has intrigued geoscienŽtists for decades Weller, 1930, 1956; Wanless and Weller, 1932; Klein and Willard, .1989 . Recently, the cyclicity represented in coal-bearing sequences has become the Žsubject of renewed attention e.g., Arditto, 1991; Diessel, 1992; Hamilton and Tadros, 1994; Aitken and Flint, 1995; Heckel, 1995; Herbert, 1995; Surlyk et al., 1995; Bohacs .and Suter, 1997; Van Wagoner, 1998 , drawing on the concepts and analytical methodology developed within the framework of sequence stratigraphy. The application of these new stratigraphic techniques to non-marine coal measure sequences, however, is a new frontier and remains inadequately tested.\nThe key parameter impeding the assessment of sequence stratigraphic models for non-marine successions is the lack of detailed chronostratigraphic control, which is notoriously difficult to obtain in such depositional systems. The markedly cyclic Upper Permian Moranbah Coal Measures and lateral equivalents are extensively developed in Ž .the northern and central Bowen Basin, eastern Australia Fig. 1 . They are unique in that they contain the P-tuff bed, which is a key chronostratigraphic marker horizon of regional extent. The bed is a tephra event unit in the sense of Fischer and Schmincke Ž .1984 , the product of a large-scale volcanic eruptive episode. The unique circumstance of this basin-wide marker has been used to evaluate sequence stratigraphic concepts for the Moranbah Coal Measures and its laterally equivalents. The approach in this study has been to use the P-tuff bed to provide a temporal snapshot of the facies mosaic sealed immediately beneath the marker bed, and that of the sedimentary package between the marker and a regionally developed coal seam variously known in the Bowen Basin as the Goonyella Middle–Harrow Creek–Aquilla seam. This seam is interpreted as approximating to a chronostratigraphic unit.\nThe lithofacies mosaic of this sequence has been evaluated using logs from 26 widely Ž 2 .distributed drillholes and two district-scale ca. 50–75 km studies. The latter were conducted in the Moranbah and German Creek districts and are primarily based on Ž .extensive highwall exposures in coal mines at Goonyella and German Creek Fig. 2 . Additional information from drillcores in areas adjacent to the highwalls has provided an exceptional opportunity to reconstruct an entire depositional complex. Integration of\n( )P. Michaelsen, R.A.

    "heading": "2. Basinal context of the Moranbah Coal Measures",
    "text": "The Moranbah Coal Measures comprise the lower interval of the Blackwater Group, Ž .a major sediment system of the Bowen Basin Koppe, 1978 . The group is of Late Ž .Permian age and is divided into three coal-bearing formations Fig. 3 . It has a Ž .maximum thickness of 1550 m and is distributed throughout the Bowen Basin Fig. 1 . Equivalents to it are developed throughout the Bowen–Gunnedah–Sydney Basin System which extends for ca. 2000 km along the east Australian continental borderland. The Bowen Basin is considered to have had a polyphase tectonic history consisting of an Early Permian extensional phase, a mid-Permian phase of thermal recovery and a Late Permian–Mid Triassic foreland phase associated with tectonisation of the New England Ž .Orogen lying to the east Murray, 1983 . Ž .The Moranbah Coal Measures Koppe, 1978 comprise the basal formation of the Blackwater Group. To the south they interfinger with the markedly cyclic German Creek Ž .Coal Measures and MacMillan Formation Fig. 3 . Further south, the German Creek Coal Measures pass into the shallow marine Crocker Formation. The Moranbah Coal Measures comprises the most extensive coal measures in the northern Bowen Basin. Thick, laterally continuous, clean coal seams of medium to low volatile bituminous rank are subject to large-scale mining activity, and tens of kilometres of exceptional alongŽ .strike exposure is afforded by opencut coal mines cf. Johnson, 1984 . The thickness of the Moranbah Coal Measures on the western margin of the basin is relatively uniform Ž .250–300 m , but increases eastwards towards the depocenter where it has a maximum Ž .development of 760 m Mallett et al., 1995 . To the south, the laterally equivalent ŽGerman Creek Coal Measures are approximately 100 m thick Falkner and Fielding, .1993 . Five master coal-bearing intervals, informally termed coal superseams herein, are recognised within the Moranbah Coal Measures. Superseams may consist of a single\nŽ .Fig. 3.

Individual superseams are traceable for over 200 km along strike Ž .Mallett et al., 1995 . The basin-wide distribution of such coal-bearing intervals demands their stratigraphic recognition and justifies the use of the informal term superseam. The two lowermost superseams, the Dysart and Harrow Creek, are the most notable within the measures. The great lateral extent of these seams led Falkner and Ž . Ž .Fielding 1993 and Michaelsen 1995 to suggest depositional control by external Ž . Žbase-level changes. Sandstone composition Fig. 4 and palaeocurrent data cf. Falkner .and Fielding, 1993; Veevers et al., 1994 show that the German Creek Coal Measures are quartz-rich, derived from the craton to the west, whereas the Moranbah Coal Measures are lithic-rich and derived from a magmatic arc flanking the basin to the Ž .northeast represented by the Eungela–Cracow Mobile Zone Fig. 1 . The existence of five basin-wide coal superseams extending across the Moranbah and German Creek Coal Measures indicates a clear temporal and genetic link in sedimentary dynamics between the two depositional systems.\nBased on the strong development of growth rings in petrified woods and a low floral Ž .diversity, Johnson 1984 suggested that deposition of the Moranbah Coal Measures Žoccurred in a cold-climate setting. To the south, basement-derived lonestones drop.stones , considered to reflect ice-rafting, are common in the German Creek Coal Ž .Measures and the MacMillan Formation see also Draper, 1983 . Palaeomagnetic data Žindicate that the basin was located at ca. 658 south during the Late Permian Embleton, .1984 . On a global scale, abundant evidence from the sedimentary record shows that the ŽPermian System was characterised by dramatic glacioclimatic instability e.g., Veevers .et al., 1994; Ross and Ross, 1994 , especially at high latitudes. Climatic oscillations in the Late Permian Period were coupled with restricted mountain glaciations and sea level Ž .fluctuations on a 0.75–3 million year cycle e.g., Ross and Ross, 1994; Erwin, 1996 .\n( )P.

It is unique within the Moranbah Coal Measures, where it Ž .represents the only thick ca. 1–2 m pyroclastic unit. Tuffs are common in coal seams Ž .throughout the formation e.g., Koppe, 1978; Mallett et al., 1995 , but these are Ž .generally thin -5 cm and of suspect continuity. The P-tuff bed is ash-rich and lithologically distinctive by virtue of abundant, bronze-coloured biotite of medium-coarse sand grade. Its crystal content includes abundant quartz, suggesting a rhyolitic derivation.\nThe bed is clearly exposed in open cut coal mines at Goonyella, Peak Downs and ŽGerman Creek. The compilation of core-logs from 26 widely distributed drillholes Fig. .2 confirms the regional extent and significance of the P-tuff bed. It is present Žthroughout the northern Bowen Basin. A detailed study of this unit Michaelsen, .unpublished shows that it is a composite deposit which recorded a short-period tephra event.

    "text": "Coal seams characterise the sedimentary interval associated with the P-tuff bed throughout the northern and central Bowen Basin. The succession beneath the P-tuff bed Ž .is shown by a selection of cores representative of the northern Bowen Basin Fig. 5 . The tuff-above-coal sequence shown in the highwall of the German Creek coal mine is typical of regional relationships.\nThe P-Lower seam is regionally developed immediately beneath the tuff in the northern and central Bowen Basin. In the Moranbah area, the P-Lower seam and the ŽHarrow Creek superseam are amalgamated, resulting in a ca. 3.5 m thick coal bed Figs. . Ž .5 and 6 . However, two areas i.e., Moranbah–Goonyella and Peak Downs–Saraji are characterised by fine-grained, distal overbank deposits in this interval. The characteristics of the interval are well shown in the highwall of the Goonyella mine. Here the P-tuff bed directly overlies ca. 3 m of carbonaceous shale, interpreted as marsh deposits, representing facies transitional between clastic and organic sediment accumulation.\nIt is clear that a high proportion of the northern Bowen Basin sedimentary substrate was occupied by peat swamp at the instant in time when the tuff was emplaced. Prior to the deposition of the P-tuff bed, the underlying peat precursor of the regionally developed P-Lower seam, accumulated over abandoned fluvial tracts on a broad coastal plain. This argues strongly for a clastic sediment starved depositional system, characterised by basin-wide biogenic deposition, with very restricted fluvial channel systems which produced little clastic sediment accumulation.\nŽ .The tuff is capped by the regionally developed P-Upper seam Fig. 5 . Exposures and core intersections from the Moranbah North–Goonyella district show that the seam varies in thickness from -25 cm to 2.42 m. The seam is up to 1 m thick at German Creek, 1.4 m on the eastern flank of the basin in drill core from South Kemmis Creek 1\n( )P. Michaelsen, R.A.

This shows that a similar peatland environment was developed immediately subsequent to deposition of the P-tuff bed. However, as with the underlying P-Lower seam, this coal is not uniformly developed. Drillhole records show Ž .that the seam is missing in Dabien Holding 1 DH 1 , located north of Goonyella Mine, Ž .

Coalified logs, siderite and rip-up clasts, and clast-supported pebble conglomerate units up to 25 cm thick are associated with the basal contact. The bases of the channels are typically positioned 1–4 m above coal horizons, but are known to scour coal locally. Bedding is generally medium to very thick, and sedimentary structures are dominated by very well developed, large- to very large-scale trough cross-stratification. Fine sandstone and siltstone heteroliths and uniform to laminated siltstone constitute a minor component of this facies. Type 1B comprises isolated, ribbon-shaped, medium-grained, sandstone bodies, up to 30 m thick and 500 m wide, with aspect ratios of ca. 5–20. This facies is characterised by planar and trough-cross bedding, and an erosive basal contact. Laterally the channels interfinger with heterolithic deposits. Type 1B facies deposits are well developed in the northern sector of the basin, but not to the south.\nFacies 1A is interpreted as representing the active fill of deep, large-scale, lowsinuosity, trunk river channels, the fill of which is thought to have aggraded rapidly.

It comprises thinly laminated to medium bedded, fine sandstone and siltstone rhythmites, sharply based fine to medium grained sandstone and massive siltstone. Depositional structures include small-scale scours, slumps, low-angle reactivation surfaces, rootlets, mud cracks, ripple marks with internal cross-lamination, and lenticular, wavy and parallel bedding. Fine disseminated plant debris is common on bedding planes.\nBased on the assemblage of sedimentary structures, gross grain size characteristics and the intimate lateral relationship with Facies 1, Facies 2 is interpreted to represent a Ž .leveerproximal crevasse splay complex. Godfrey 1978 reported linguoid current ripples indicating high flow velocity from siltstone beds of Facies 2 from Goonyella. The occurrence of vegetation on the raised levees is shown by rootlets. It is thought that colonisation of the channel bank by dense vegetation would have enhanced stabilisation Ž .of the channel. Johnson 1984 described deposits similar to Facies 2 from the Goonyella highwall, and pointed out that it was impossible to differentiate between levee and proximal crevasse splays because the bulk of the levee complex accumulated as splays. The prominence of such splay deposits in the northern part of the basin suggests that crevassing played a particularly important role during deposition of the Moranbah Coal Measures, and supports the interpretation of raised levees on the floodplain. However, crevasse splays seems to be less developed in the southern part of the basin."

Rare Vertebraria occur at the base of the Facies 4 intervals. Finely macerated organic debris and moderately well preserved leaf imprints on bedding planes are very common. Facies 4 is well developed in the northern part of the basin, but poorly developed to the south.\nFacies 4 is interpreted to represent deposition of fine-grained, terrigenous sediments and organic deposits of a marsh environment, located distally to active channels. The fine-grained sediments probably accumulated as distal overbank deposits during floodŽ .generated inundation of a floodbasin. Johnson 1984 reported abundant whole Phyllotheca and Cladaphlebis, Vertebraria and broken Glossopteris and Gangamopteris as well as common in situ tree trunks 0.5 m in diameter in this facies at Goonyella.

Consistent seam thickness might indicate slow and regular subsidence, approximating Ž .the rate of peat accumulation cf. Johnson, 1984 . The bright to dull character of Type Ž .5A seams is consistent with findings by Beeston and Draper 1991 who concluded that dulling-up profiles are typical of coal seams in the Permian of Australia, and represent ‘‘drying out’’ of the peat swamp with subsequent in situ oxidation.\nŽ .Facies 5B is in turn interpreted to represent short-lived ?1–10 ka , district scale, blanketing to pod-like peat mire systems, and may represent reliable time markers. The rider seams probably developed during relatively short interruptions in sediment flux, most likely as a result of upstream channel avulsion. The abundance of thin rider seams within the Moranbah Coal Measures suggests that, in the absence of active clastic sedimentation, peat mires extended across abandoned depositional lobes. As such, the seams are very important tools in reconstructing facies interrelationships within coalbearing strata, where stratigraphic control is almost universally wanting."

The interval is exposed over a distance of 2.9 km in highwall segments G and Ž .R Fig. 2C . The laterally extensive Aquila seam, equivalent to the upper part of the Harrow Creek superseam, has a uniform sheet-like appearance with a maximum development of 2.4 m in an area ca. 2 km northeast of Highwall G. It has a thickness of ca. 1.5 m in Highwall G and R, and is characterised by a jarosite-stained top. Total sulphur increases from ca. 0.5–1% to 2.2% to the southeast, possibly indicating a marine Ž .influence in that direction cf. Diessel, 1992 . The seam splits and deteriorates to the Ž .northeast Fig. 2C . Raw ash percentage increases from ca. 9–11% in the southwest of the study area to 30–35% in the northeast.

Depositional structures in the lower element are dominated by planar lamination, low-angle lamination and wavy and Ž .trough-cross bedding sets generally ca. 20–35 cm thick , and rare herringbone strucŽ .tures, epsilon- and hummocky cross stratification HCS . The HCS is confined to the basal part of the sandstone body, whereas the herringbone structures are sporadically developed in a laterally continuous bed of medium-coarse grained sandstone, up to 45 cm thick, positioned some 2–3 m above the base of the sandstone body and traceable for )1 km. A laterally persistent surface, some 0.4–1 m above the base of this element, is characterised by scattered rounded to angular, pebbles ranging to 9 cm in size. These are of variable composition but mainly chert and quartz. The surface may be erosional and related to transgressive stepping of the energetic shoreface zone across the adjoining Ž .coastal-plain during a drowning event cf. Weimer, 1988 . A low-density ichnofossil Ž .assemblage dominated by sand-filled S. linearis up to 22 cm in length , D. parallelum and ichnofossil escape structures, characterises the basal part of the sandstone body. The two sandstone elements are generally separated by a laterally persistent unit of lenticular and wavy bedded heterolith, ca. 15–20 cm thick.\nThe upper sandstone element is similar to the element below, also assigned to Facies 8. However, its trace fossil assemblage is somewhat different and it lacks hummocky\n( )P. Michaelsen, R.A.

The ichnofossil assemblage is characterised by low-diversity, opportunistic taxa, including dwelling traces of robust, thickwalled, I and J-shaped Skolithos isp., Diplocraterion yo-yo, and Rossellia isp. up to 55, 30, and 10 cm in length, respectively. The increase in size and the robust nature of the ichnofabric probably reflect a decrease in rate of deposition, compared with the Ž .underlying sandstone element cf. Bromley, 1996 . The overall ichnofossil assemblage in the lower sandstone body is characteristic of the opportunist Skolithos ichnofacies, indicative of relatively high levels of wave or current energy, subject to abrupt erosion Ž .or deposition Bromley, 1996 . The upper sandstone body is assigned to Facies 1. It lacks ichnofossils, and is Žcharacterised by well sorted, medium-grained sandstone and lineated rip-up clasts up to .14 cm in size . The bounding surface between the upper and lower sandstone bodies is sharp and planar. Trough cross bedding is well developed, generally with sets of 0.5 m. Bedding planes are lined with abundant organic debris. Siltstone partings are characterised by planar lamination, abundant mica and organic debris. Large-scale organic fragments up to 4=55 cm were also noted in this unit. This sandstone unit is interpreted as active fill of a large-scale trunk river channel.\nThe channel sandstone body passes upwards into a ca. 2.5–4 m thick tabular sheet of fining upward planar laminated sandy carbonaceous siltstone assigned to Facies 3. Its lower bounding surface is sharp and planar. Organic debris, including Glossopteris Ž .leaves, increases upwards. Coal stringers up to 1 m=2 cm occur but are very rare. Rootlets, including Vertebraria, are well developed. In the southernmost end of Highwall G this unit thickens dramatically from 2.5 to 4 m over a lateral distance of ca. 10 m. This relationship is interpreted to represent localised passive fill of the underlying fluvial channel. The rest of this package is considered to represent fine-grained floodbasin deposits.\nThe Pleiades seam which underlies the P-tuff bed, is equivalent to the P-Lower seam elsewhere. The bounding surface between the seam and underlying strata is generally planar and sharp, with rootlets extending from the seam into the carbonaceous siltstone unit beneath. The seam is generally 1 m thick in the German Creek district. It is overlain by the P-tuff which is divided into two beds by a high-ash coalrcarbonaceous claystone Ž .unit up to 0.8 m thick Fig. 9 . The vertical facies stacking pattern at German Creek shows peat mire deposits conformably overlain by paralic and shallow marine deposits. The superposition of alluvial systems above these deposits argue persuasively for a transgressive–regressive nature for the emplacement of the Aquila to P-tuff bed sediment package."

Župper coastal plain i.e., Moranbah district to )2% on the lower coastal plain i.e., .German Creek district to the south. Thickness trends of the basinwide coal seams within the northern and central Bowen Basin, coupled with the spatial distribution of facies tracts, indicate that the most favourable area for peat mire development was ca. Ž .50–100 km from the palaeoshoreline. In a similar relationship, McCabe 1984 found that the disposition of thick coals within Upper Cretaceous strata in Alberta, USA, suggested that mire conditions were most favourable for the accumulation of thick peats some 40–60 km landward of the shoreline. It is worth noting that the lateral dimensions of the entire Bowen Basin depositional complex are unknown. However, the existence Ž .of paralic and shallow marine deposits to the south and east Fig. 7 indicates an opening to the Palaeo-Pacific Ocean in that direction.\nThe singularity of basin-wide Facies type 5A coal seams is complicated at a district scale, where seam splitting may occur. Such splits represents expansion of peat mire environments across abandoned clastic alluvial lobes accumulated during relatively brief periods of clastic sediment emplacement at district scale during depositional systems tract B times.\nPeat accumulation rates for temperate climate peat mire systems have recently been Ž .documented by Holdgate et al. 1995 , based on Tertiary strata in the Gippsland Basin, Australia. These authors determined an average peat accumulation rate of about 1 mr4200 years and a minimum of 1 mr9300 years. Considering that the climate during deposition of the peat mires in the Bowen Basin was somewhat colder, slower accumulation rates seem likely. With a conservative compactional ratio of 10:1 for peat Ž .to bituminous coal cf. Diessel, 1992 , 1 m of bituminuous coal may thus approximate 42,000–93,000 years of biogenic accumulation."

Each channel complex seems to have developed at the toe of the previously emplaced fluvial channel and associated leveercrevasse splay complex. The well developed channel tracts were relatively stationary in position over enduring periods, and developed thick sediment Ž .accumulations up to 50 m . The thickness of trunk river channel fill appears to be proportional to the thickness of the underlying peat deposits, with the thickest deposits of channel fill developed above the thickest accumulations of peat. Thus the fluvial channels in the Moranbah North area are up to 30 m thick, and the underlying Harrow Creek superseam 4.5 to 6.5 m thick. However, to the north at Goonyella the coal seam increases to ca. 9 m in thickness and the trunk river channel fill ranges up to 50 m.\nThis study highlights that composite crevasse splay deposits are very well developed as lateral accumulations to trunk river channel deposits, and are an important component of depositional systems tract B. Successive crevasse events appears to have distributed significant amounts of sediment across the floodplain, and ar considered to represent frequent events of catastrophic flooding. The abundance of crevasse splay deposits, associated with the low sinuosity nature of the trunk river channels, probably indicates a Ž . Ž .perennial type 4 fluvial system see Jones, 1977 .

This figure shows that depositional systems tract A coals developed during a prolonged period of clastic sediment starvation, and probably formed over most of the time involved in a single base level cycle. In a sequence stratigraphic\n( )P. Michaelsen, R.A. Hendersonr International Journal of Coal Geology 44 2000 19–48 43\ncontext, this time frame probably incorporates the entirety of regressive and lowstand systems tracts as well as the early phase of the transgressive systems tract. Depositional systems tract B, in turn, is considered to have been coupled to the middle and late phases of the transgressive systems tract and the highstand systems tract. This period may only represent a small part of the time involved in a single base level cycle, and the sedimentary record is suggestive of rapid clastic aggradation during depositional systems tract A times. These significant stratigraphic changes are best rationalised in terms of base-level shifts coupled with dramatic fluctuations in clastic sediment supply. Clastic Ž .sedimentation was probably controlled by basinal drainage patterns rainfall , linked to Ž .orbital climatic forcing cf. Perlmutter and Matthews, 1989 . Interestingly, the generation of peat-mire is autocyclic and decoupled from the constraint of accommodation space which exerts a powerful influence on the accumulation of clastic sediment.\nŽ .The stacking pattern of major facies associations Fig. 10 shows marine intercalations sitting immediately above peat mire intervals, with fluvial sediments absent. This implies short period transgression with passage from relative sea level lowstand to highstand too abrupt to support the general development of fluvial systems. Conversely, the thick fluvial packages succeeding marine intercalations imply relatively slow regression.\nŽ .Age constraints for the Blackwater Group Michaelsen et al., in review indicate a span of ca. 9 My, suggesting that deposition of the Moranbah Coal Measures, the lower of its three component formations which are of similar character, took some 2–3 My. The full Moranbah Coal Measures sequence contains five intervals representing depositional systems tract A. Each cycle incorporating a peat mire system would have had a duration of perhaps 400 to 600 ky. This places the cycles within the range of 4th order Žsea level changes reported from various Late Permian settings on a global scale e.g., .Arditto, 1991; Ross and Ross, 1994; Veevers et al., 1994 .\nGiven the foreland setting of the Bowen Basin, it could be argued that the cycles are Ž .due to pulses of tectonism. However, as Van Wagoner 1998 pointed out, the time scale of thrust loading events and foreland basinal response is of the order of 1 My or longer. Primary tectonic control of the stratigraphic architecture therefore seems unlikely."

    "text": "The existence of thick, basin-wide, low-ash coal superseams within the Moranbahr German Creek Coal Measures cannot be satisfactorily rationalised in terms of a deltaic Ž .depositional model for their development. Falkner and Fielding 1990 postulated an upper delta plain setting for the Moranbah Coal Measures based on its lateral equivalence to the German Creek Formation which they regarded to be of lower delta plain Ž .origin. Clearly, as Diessel 1992 pointed out, such a setting for the German Creek Ž .Formation falls far short of explaining: i the occurrence of thick laterally extensive Ž . Ž .coal seams; ii the lack of lobate delta front sands; iii the occurrence of lagoonal Ž .sediments; and iv texturally mature sandstones with beach lamination in the floors of Ž .some coal seams. Diessel 1992 suggested that some of the stratigraphically lower German Creek Formation coals might have been generated in a strand-plain depositional\n( )P. Michaelsen, R.A. Hendersonr International Journal of Coal Geology 44 2000 19–4844\nsystem, which graded both laterally landward and upward temporally into a riverdominated alluvial plain setting.\nSignificantly, the basin-wide distribution of the coal seam enclosing the P-tuff bed suggests a similar origin of the other thick, laterally extensive, coal superseams within the measures. This is in marked contrast to traditional views of coal measure development, which argue that coals formed in a lateral facies mosaic representing mire accumulations within a plexus of fluvial channels, levees and crevasse splays, as Žcommonly developed in a fluvio-deltaic setting e.g., Horne et al., 1978; Flores et al., .1984 .\nIn a sequence stratigraphic assessment of Late Permian coal measure sequences in the Sydney Basin, the southern-most extension of the Bowen–Gunnedah–Sydney System, Ž .Arditto 1991 noted that deltaic depositional models for the accumulation of thick, laterally extensive coals fall far short of explaining their occurrence. Instead, Arditto Ž .1991 argued for coal genesis by coastal ponding during transgression, as coals are best developed at the top of aggradational sequences. However, this model does not explain the sequence architecture developed in the north-central Bowen Basin. The lack of palaeosol development within the succession is notable and indicates that peat mire Žaccumulation represents the default conditions of sedimentation. Clearly, thick up to 12 . Ž .m , regional extensive )250 km along strike peat mire systems must have accumulated over significantly longer time spans than those implied by a relatively brief period of base-level rise. The thick, basin-wide coal intervals within the MoranbahrGerman Creek Coal Measures which, like those of the Sydney Basin, occur on top of clastic aggradational packages are here considered to be associated with a wet climatic regime Žduring a much longer time frame associated with lowstand to early sea-level rise Fig. .10 . The marine intercalations in the southern part of the basin must represent transgressive deposits. The alluvial deposits which follow and which are more thickly developed to the north are most likely related to transgressive and highstand systems tracts and associated with rapid basinal aggradation.\nThis study shows that the facies assemblage and sedimentary architecture observed in the Late Permian Moranbah Coal Measures depositional system of the German Creek district bear a strong resemblance to the Early Permian Collinsville Coal Measures and the laterally equivalent Gebbie Formation in the northern apex of the Bowen Basin as Ž .documented by Martini and Johnson 1987 . The strong similarity argues for uniform depositional conditions during emplacement of much of the non-marine Permian succesŽ .sion of the north-central Bowen Basin. Martini and Johnson 1987 pointed out that in contrast to many models of coal-forming environments, no clearly defined deltaic or interdistributary bay-fill sequences were identified for the Collinsville Coal Measures and associated units. Instead, these authors argued for vast freshwater wetlands, fronted by low gradient progradational coast with local barriers.\nThe transgressive–regressive coal-bearing depositional sequences of the Moranbah Coal Measures were formed over periods comparable to the classic 4th order CarŽ .bonifererous cyclothems of North America e.g., Weller, 1930; Heckel, 1995 . However, the depositional sequence architecture of the Bowen Basin differs significantly from these North American cyclothems, which are characterised by well developed carbonate Ž .units cf. Heckel, 1994 . The difference in depositional character is attributed to\n( )P. Michaelsen, R.A. Hendersonr International Journal of Coal Geology 44 2000 19–48 45\ncontrasts in clastic sediment supply, drainage pattern and palaeogeographic setting. The Moranbah Coal Measures were emplaced during compressive deformation and active volcanism in a cold climate foreland setting, which facilitated the supply of abundant Ž .volcanoclastic sediments and resulted in rapid but punctuated basinal aggradation. The North American cyclothems in comparison were generated in a setting of less active tectonism and warmer climate, characterised in relative terms by reduced clastic sediment input. Sequence boundaries generated during sea level lowstands are significantly different within the two depositional sequence motifs. Whereas lowstands are Ž .associated with substantial erosion and sedimentary bypassing disconformities in the Ž .North American cyclothems cf. Aitken and Flint, 1995 , the architecture of the Bowen Basin cyclothems shows that the sequence boundaries are characterised essentially by clastic omission surfaces but lack unconformities. In the Bowen Basin depositional complex, peat mire environments simply aggraded during this time, keeping up with slow and regular basinal subsidence to form thick, low-ash, regionally extensive coal superseams. In North America, facies stacking patterns indicate that the coal seams are associated with the transgressive systems tracts following the omission surfaces associŽ .ated with lowstand e.g., Heckel, 1994, 1995; Aitken and Flint, 1995 ."

The facies patterns have been evaluated by means of district-scale documentation based primarily on large-scale exposures afforded by open-cut coal mining and regional-scale documentation based on a network of deep core-holes.\nSuccessional relationships and lateral continuity of these two systems tracts indicate that they are elements of a cyclothemic succession, considered to be driven by Late Permian 4th order sea-level cycles with a duration of 400–600 ky. Systems tract A, characterised by the deposition of peat-mire, represents relative sea-level low-stand. At these times, trunk rivers traversing the northern and central Bowen Basin were competent in transporting the clastic sediment supply beyond the basinal confines. The autocyclic deposition of peat, now represented by basin-wide low ash coal superseams, became the enduring, default style of sedimentary accumulation and was independent from the constraint of basinal accommodation space. Systems tract B represents relative sea-level high-stand during which time accommodation space was enhanced. It is characterised by a fluvial facies mosaic, and its emplacement is considered to have been relative rapid.\nThe basin-wide alternation of systems tract A and B and their cyclothemic association cannot be rationalised in terms of a fluvio-deltaic facies mosaic in which peat-mire assemblages are incorporated as the temporal equivalent of clastic sedimentary packages. Rather, their geometries and relationships argue strongly that event stratigraphy driven by climatic and sea-level cycles external to the tectonic context of the Bowen\n( )P. Michaelsen, R.A.

  "abstractText": "The Late Permian Moranbah Coal Measures are developed throughout the northern and central Bowen Basin, eastern Australia, and are subject to large-scale opencut coal mining activity. They were deposited in a rapidly subsiding retroarc foreland basin, during frequent base-level changes. Contemporaneous compressive deformation and volcanism facilitated the supply of abundant volcanoclastic sediments, resulting in rapid, but punctuated, basinal aggradation. To the south and east, transgressive–regressive cycles were marked by the inter-digitation of paralic–shallow Ž . marine and alluvial strata. Lonestones dropstones are common within the marine deposits and are attributed to ice-rafting indicative of a cold-climate depositional regime. Two basin-wide chronostratigraphic units, the P-tuff bed and the Harrow Creek superseam, have been used to evaluate the facies architecture of the stratigraphic interval they enclose. The lithofacies mosaic of the 25–75 m thick sequence has been examined by means of 26 widely distributed coreholes and two detailed district-scale studies based around the Moranbah–Goonyella and German Creek minesites. Eight alluvial–shallow marine facies associations have been recognised. Their architectural and temporal relationships allow the accurate reconstruction of the coal-bearing depositional Ž . Ž . system. Two dissimilar, stacked, depositional systems tracts, A organics and B clastics are recognised. The P-tuff bed is enclosed by facies of tract A, forming a thick, low-ash, coal-bearing interval which was emplaced essentially synchronously across the basin. It represents a time of clastic sediment starvation when basin-wide peat mire accumulation prevailed. Four similar extensive coal-bearing intervals within the Moranbah Coal Measures are also considered to represent basin-wide episodes of peat accumulation. This pattern is in strong contrast to traditional views of coal measure development, which argue that coals formed within a contemporary facies ) Corresponding author.
