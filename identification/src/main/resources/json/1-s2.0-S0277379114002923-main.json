Here we present a new and detailed tephrochronological framework for the time period 25,000e45,000 a b2k that brings together results from 4 deep Greenland ice-cores. In total, 99 tephra deposits, the majority of which are preserved as cryptotephra, are described from the NGRIP, NEEM, GRIP and DYE-3 records. The major element signatures of single glass shards within these deposits indicate that 93 are basaltic in composition all originating from Iceland. Specifically, 43 originate from Grimsv€otn, 20 are thought to be sourced from the Katla volcanic system and 17 show affinity to the Kverkfj€oll system. Robust geochemical characterisations, independent ages derived from the GICC05 ice-core chronology, and the stratigraphic positions of these deposits relative to the Dansgaard-Oeschger climate events represent a key framework that provides new information on the frequency and nature of volcanic events in the North Atlantic region between GS-3 and GI-12. Of particular importance are 19 tephra deposits that lie on the rapid climatic transitions that punctuate the last glacial period. This framework of well-constrained, time-synchronous tie-lines represents an important step towards the independent synchronisation of marine, terrestrial and ice-core records from the North Atlantic region, in order to assess the phasing of rapid climatic changes during the last glacial period.\n© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "The Greenland ice-cores have provided an unprecedented insight into the nature of abrupt climatic changes (DansgaardeOeschger (DO) events) during the last glacial period (e.g. Dansgaard et al., 1993; NGRIP Members, 2004). With an independent annually-resolved chronology (Andersen et al., 2006; Rasmussen et al., 2006; Svensson et al., 2006; Vinther et al., 2006), these records represent significant archives for establishing the history of volcanic events during this time-interval. Both volcanic aerosol (ice acidity and sulphate records) and tephra particulate matter (or glass shards) preserved in the ice permit the reconstruction of volcanic history, but only the volcanic glass shards allow the geochemical identification of the volcanic source and their employment as isochronous marker horizons between\nurne).\ndisparate archives. A major disparity exists between the number of volcanic events recorded by these two methods, with over 800 events being identified in the GISP2 sulphate record over the past 110,000 years (Zielinski et al., 1996) but only 68 tephra deposits have been recognised to date from four of the deep ice-cores (Abbott and Davies, 2012 references therein; Coulter et al., 2012; Bourne et al., 2013). As such, there is untapped potential to explore the full record of tephra deposits in the Greenland ice-cores as early work focused predominantly on the presence of easily identifiable visible layers (Gr€onvold et al., 1995; Zielinski et al., 1996). More recently investigations have moved to search for cryptotephra deposits that contain a low concentration of volcanic glass particles or shards and, as such, are invisible to the naked eye (e.g. Davies et al., 2010; Abbott et al., 2012; Coulter et al., 2012). However these studies focused on a limited number of samples, typically around peaks in ice acidity and sulphate thought to relate to volcanic activity. It has become apparent, however, that in some instances, glass shards from volcanic events can be present in the\nice without an associated acidity or sulphate peak suggesting the relationship between the two records of volcanism may be more complex than previously thought (e.g. Davies et al., 2010, 2014).\nHere we investigate the cryptotephra content within four deep ice-cores from Greenland spanning 25e45 ka b2k as part of the TRACE project (Tephra constraints on RApid Climate Events). TRACE employs tephra deposits to facilitate the high-precision correlation of palaeoclimatic archives that preserve a record of rapid climate changes that characterised the last glacial period. A systematic search for cryptotephra deposits is undertaken to reduce an overreliance on chemical indicators in order to build a comprehensive framework of volcanic events preserved within Greenland ice-core records. A lattice of this kind, which combines robust geochemical signatures with well-constrained age estimates, is essential for the wider application of tephrochronology and especially to circumvent any potential mis-correlation that may arise due to an incomplete record of volcanic history. Common tephra deposits that can be traced between the Greenland ice-cores and North Atlantic marine records will provide a robust chronological foundation to test the lead/lag relationships between the atmospheric and oceanic systems over rapid climatic events and permit an assessment of potential causal mechanisms. We report the discovery of 73 new tephra depositse all of which are available for the precise correlation of marine, terrestrial and ice-core records spanning 25e45 ka b2k. This framework represents a significant advancement on the previously published results from this period with just 26 tephra deposits identified in the Greenland ice-cores by Davies et al. (2010) and Bourne et al. (2013). We highlight which of the deposits are potentially most valuable for the synchronisation of palaeoclimate archives. Moreover, our focus on four different ice-cores, provides an insight into the tephra dispersal and preservation patterns over the Greenland ice sheet and also presents an independent method (and test) by which an ice-core chronology can be transferred between cores.\nUntil recently only a handful of tephras could be traced between different ice-cores including the widespread Saksunarvatn and North Atlantic Ash Zone II (NAAZII; Z2) deposits identified as visible layers in three ice-cores (Gr€onvold et al., 1995; Ram et al., 1996; Zielinski et al., 1997; Mortensen et al., 2005; Svensson et al., 2008). Recently, however, the intensified focus on cryptotephra deposits in different ice-cores has allowed Rasmussen et al. (2013) to use 5 new coeval tephras in NEEM and NGRIP in tandem with acidity match points to transfer the GICC05 timescale to the NEEM ice-core. A further 9 tephra deposits were used as an independent test of this timescale transfer. A similar approach was applied between NGRIP and GRIP by Seierstad et al., (submitted for publication) where 20 new tephra pairs support the synchronisation of these two records. The tephra deposits utilised for the aforementioned timescale transfer processes are components of the overall framework for Greenland presented here."

    "text": "Sampling was undertaken on four deep Greenland ice-cores: NGRIP, NEEM, GRIP and DYE-3 (Fig. 1). Observations made by Davies et al. (2008; 2010), Abbott et al. (2012) and Coulter et al. (2012) have shown that glass shard particles can be present in the ice without an associated sulphate peak. Therefore a more continuous sampling approach was employed to explore the volcanic record preserved only in cryptotephra form. Sampling was based on the following criteria:\n1. Ice spanning rapid climatic transitions (particularly the warming transitions);\n2. The likely position of widespread volcanic events yet to be located in the Greenland ice, such as the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption of the Campi Flegrei, dated to 39.28 ± 0.11 ka (De Vivo et al., 2001) and the Dawson tephra deposit from the Aleutian Arc -Alaska Peninsula region of southwestern Alaska, dated to 30.433-30.014 cal ka BP (Demuro et al., 2008); 3. For the NEEM ice core, the likely positions of selected tephra deposits previously identified in the NGRIP ice core by Davies et al. (2008, 2010) and the presence of glass shards in lowresolution (1.1 m) water samples collected from the NEEM continuous flow analysis (CFA) set-up.\nThis amounted to 113.3 m of NGRIP ice between 1823.80 m and 2178.00 m and 97.35 m between 1617.55 m and 1845.25 m in the NEEM ice core. The GRIP and DYE-3 cores were largely sampled to investigate the second criterion and therefore the ice sampled is limited to 97.9 m between 1998.15 m and 2231.35 m in the GRIP ice core and 34.10 m between 1865.60 and 1914.00 m in the DYE-3 ice core (Table 1).\nIce cross-sections of 2 cm2 were removed from the edge of 55 cm long archive core sections stored at the University of Copenhagen. These 55 cm long samples were then cut into 3 subsamples of either 15 or 20 cm length for NGRIP, NEEM and GRIP. As the DYE-3 record is a lower temporal resolution at these depths, the DYE-3 samples were cut into 6 sub-samples of 10 or 5 cm length. These individual ice samples were melted at room temperature and centrifuged to concentrate any particulate matter. The particulate material was dried onto frosted microscope slides and embedded in epoxy resin. Samples were then examined for tephra shards using optical light microscopy. Any samples containing 5 or more glass shards were subsequently prepared for geochemical analysis. Thin sections of the tephra shards were produced by grinding and polishing the samples using silicon carbide paper and 9, 6 and 1 mm diamond suspension.\nElectron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) of the identified glass shards took place during ten analytical periods at the Tephra Analytical Unit at the University of Edinburgh. A Cameca SX-100 electron microprobe with five vertical wavelength dispersive\nspectrometers was employed to analyse oxide values for 10 major and minor elements within individual glass shards. Both a 3 and 5 mm beam diameter were used, according to the grain-size of the samples, and the operating conditions followed those outlined by Hayward (2012). Secondary standard analyses of Lipari Obsidian and BCR2G basalt were run at the beginning and end of each day, as well as at regular intervals between samples. The full geochemical results, including the operating conditions, beam diameter employed for each sample and standard data are provided in the Supplementary data.\nIn all cases, the tephra deposits identified have been given a unique label. This is derived from the name of the ice core and the basal depth of the sample containing the glass shards. For example, the label for the tephra layer in NGRIP sample 2065.45e2065.65 m will be NGRIP 2065.65 m.\nThe tephra horizons can be assigned ages using the annual-layer counted chronology, the GICC05 timescale for the NGRIP core (see; Andersen et al., 2006; Svensson et al., 2006; 2008 for details of the layer counting). This timescale has been transferred to the NEEM and GRIP ice cores using a series of reference horizons (chemostratigraphy as well as tephra horizons), which allows GICC05 ages to be assigned to any tephra horizons identified within NEEM and GRIP (Rasmussen et al., 2013; Seierstad et al., submitted for publication). The GICC05 timescale has errors on the ages based on the concept of maximum counting errors (MCE), which can be viewed as 2s errors (see Andersen et al., 2006; Rasmussen et al., 2006; Svensson et al., 2008). There is no GICC05 chronology for the DYE-3 sections studied here, therefore ages for tephra deposits found in that record are approximations and are inferred from their stratigraphic position and wiggle matching of the DYE-3 isotope\ne-cores. Each tephra deposit is represented by a red line and plotted against the oxygen 05 timescale for 25e45 ka b2k (Andersen et al., 2006). The four time periods used to own alongside the oxygen isotope record with GI (interstadial) events shown according\nrecord to the NGRIP isotope record. Correlation of tephra deposits between ice-cores may improve the precision of these ages.\nThe most likely volcanic source for each tephra deposit is suggested based on comparison to the best available published data. Due to the limited preservation of pre-Holocene deposits on Iceland, no proximal tephra records in the 25-45 ka b2k time-interval are available for comparison (Haflidason et al., 2000). Furthermore, distally-preserved tephra data-sets from Icelandic eruptions between 25 and 45 ka b2k are sparse and dominated by the Grimsv€otn-sourced Faroe Marine Ash Zones described in Wastegård et al. (2006). The major producers of basaltic tephra during the Holocene are the Grimsv€otn, Katla, Veidv€otnB ardarbunga, Kverkfj€oll and Vestmannaeyjar systems (Larsen and Eiríksson, 2007), whilst the central volcanoes that have predominantly erupted silicic tephra during the Holocene are Hekla, Askja, €Orӕfaj€okull, Torfaj€okull, Snӕfellsj€okull, Eyjafjallaj€okull and Katla. We employ Holocene glass data-sets (Larsen et al., 2002; Meara, 2012; Oladottir et al., 2008, 2011a,b) and whole rock data (Jakobsson, 1979, 2008) from Icelandic samples/records for these most productive source volcanoes. These data-sets are also supplemented by distal tephra glass occurrences from both Holocene and last glacial eruptions (Boygle, 1994; Hunt et al., 1995; Dugmore and Newton, 1998; Haflidason et al., 2000; references within; Davies et al., 2001; Wastegård et al., 2001, 2006; Andrews et al., 2002; Mortensen et al., 2005).\nCorrelation of tephra layers between ice-cores is initially based upon major element geochemistry. However, where major element geochemistry alone is not distinctive, the Greenland event stratigraphy,which isbasedonhigh-resolutionGreenlandd18Oandcalcium records (Rasmussen et al., submitted for publication), can be used to discriminate between tephra with similar geochemical signatures positioned indifferent climate periods (i.e. different interstadials and stadials). In caseswheremultiple eruptionswith similargeochemical composition are located in very similar stratigraphic positions, a potential tephra correlation can be tested according to whether it is consistent with the depthedepth relationship from the chemostratigraphic tie-points between the cores which assumes that the ratio of the layer thickness is slowly varying (Seierstad et al., submitted for publication; Rasmussen et al., 2013).\nTephra correlations identified between NGRIP and NEEM and NGRIP and GRIP are presented in Rasmussen et al. (2013) and Seierstad et al., (submitted for publication) respectively. These individual tephra deposits are described for the first time and are present in the descriptive biplots of Figs. 3e7. However, details of the correlations are not dealt with here. The full geochemical data for these deposits are outlined for the first time in the supplementary information. Similarly, tephra geochemical data from Davies et al. (2010) and Bourne et al. (2013) are not plotted in biplots alongside the new data here and the full data-sets are available in the original publications. However, all previously published tephra deposits from Davies et al. (2010), Bourne et al. (2013), Rasmussen et al. (2013), Seierstad et al. (submitted) are included in the overall tephrochronological framework tabulated in Tables 2 and 3."

    "text": "Within our time-window, 42 cryptotephra deposits were identified in NGRIP, of which 39 are basaltic in composition. Twenty tephra deposits were identified in NEEM, of which 17 exhibit a basaltic affinity and one is a visible layer. Twenty-two cryptotephra deposits were identified in GRIP all of which are basaltic in composition and 15 cryptotephra deposits were identified in DYE-3 with 14 of basaltic composition (Fig. 2). A number of these deposits fall close to rapid transitions on the d18O records (Fig. 2).\nFor clarity, the results from all four ice cores will be considered in four time periods (Fig. 2). These periods are determined by the areas of GRIP and DYE-3 that were sampled and consist of: Period 1 from 25 ka to 32 ka b2k encompassing GS-3 to GS-5.2, Period 2 from 32 ka to 37 ka b2k encompassing GI-5.2 to GS-8, Period 3 from 37 ka to 41 ka b2k encompassing GI-8 to GS-10 and Period 4 from 41 ka to 46 ka b2k encompassing, GI-10 to GI-12 (Table 1). The number of tephra layers, amount of ice sampled and average grain size in each time period is shown in Table 1. These results include six NGRIP tephra deposits in Period 1 which were previously published by Davies et al. (2010) and twenty tephra deposits in Period 3 (5 in NEEM and 15 in NGRIP) that were previously published by Bourne et al. (2013) (Table 1).\n3.1. Period 1e25e32 ka b2k, GS-3 to GS-5.2\nThe ice sampled in this time period consisted of 55.55 m from NGRIP (46% of total ice from the period), 30.8 m fromNEEM (44% of total ice), 52.8m fromGRIP (48% of total ice) and 15.4m fromDYE-3 (Table 1). A total of 37 tephra layers are present within this time period, 8 fromNGRIP, 9 fromNEEM,12 fromGRIP and 8 fromDYE-3. Within this time period six tephra deposits have been previously identified in NGRIP (Davies et al., 2008, 2010) and the stratigraphic positions, ages, chemical compositions and source volcanoes of both new and published tephra layers are shown in Table 2.\nAverage grain-size for these tephra layers varies between cores with larger shards present in DYE-3 with an average grain size of 57.3 mm (Table 1). In contrast, the average grain size of the GRIP tephra deposits is 36.8 mm, 33.5 mm for NGRIP deposits and 27.1 mm for the NEEM deposits (Table 1).\nWithin this time period 35 of the deposits are basaltic in composition with just two of rhyolitic composition, NGRIP 1888.10m and NEEM 1636.45m (Fig. 3A).With only one glass shard analysed from NEEM 1636.45 m it is difficult to pinpoint a source volcano (Fig. 4). NGRIP 1888.10 m, however, shows closest affinity to products from Hekla (Fig. 4). Several of the basaltic deposits exhibit similar geochemical signatures (Fig. 3A, Table 2). The majority of the glass shard analyses for NGRIP, NEEM and GRIP tephra deposits reveal homogenous and tightly-clustered populations. However, one or two outlying analyses are observed in some of the deposits e.g. GRIP 2002.20 m, GRIP 2070.20 m, and NEEM 1669.25 m (Fig. 3C and D). In contrast, the 8 deposits present in DYE-3 exhibit marked heterogeneous geochemical signatures. For instance SiO2 and FeO/TiO2 values for shards fromDYE-3 1865.80m vary between 46.70 and 59.62 %wt and 3.19 and 7.00 %wt respectively (Fig. 3A and E). As such glass shards from this one sample fall within geochemical fields for Katla, Grimsv€otn and Veidiv€otn (Fig. 3E). This heterogeneity is common to all DYE-3 tephra deposits and therefore it is not possible to assign these deposits to one source volcano. The only tephra deposit that does exhibit some homogeneity is DYE-3 1869.15m, which can be tentatively assigned to the Grimsv€otn volcanic source (Fig. 3E).\nTephra deposits of transitional alkali and tholeiitic basalt composition dominate this period with 12 deposits clustering within the Katla field and 13 deposits falling within the Kverkfj€oll/ Grimsv€otn fields (Fig. 3B, C and D). Two distinct tholeiitic tephra deposits are separated from the Katla and Kverkfj€oll geochemical clusters observed in Fig. 3B and C. NGRIP 1894.05 m and NEEM 1636.65 m are geochemically distinct from the other basaltic horizons with an FeO/TiO2 ratio of >6 (Fig. 3B and C). Although Veidiv€otn is a likely source for NGRIP 1894.05 m, the source for NEEM 1636.65m is uncertainwith SiO2 values ranging between 49.22 and 52.17 %wt and an FeO/TiO2 ratio of between 7.66 and 8.69 %wt (Fig. 3B and C).\nDYE3 1865.70 DYE3 1865.80 DYE3 1865.90 DYE3 1866.00 DYE3 1866.10 DYE3 1866.40 DYE3 1866.60 DYE3 1869.15 GRIP2002.20 GRIP2049.50\nGRIP2061.40 GRIP2064.35 GRIP2066.75 GRIP2067.85 GRIP2070.20 GRIP2070.75 GRIP2079.40 GRIP2081.05 GRIP2081.40 NEEM1626.15 NEEM1636.45 NEEM1636.65 NEEM1648.90 NEEM1656.50 NEEM1664.95 NEEM1669.25 NEEM1671.85 NEEM1677.60 NGRIP1882.10 NGRIP1882.50\nNGRIP1894.05 NGRIP1908.70 NGRIP1913.10 NGRIP1929.95 NGRIP1931.60\nGrimsvötn\nKverkfjöll\nVeidivötn\nKatla\nHekla/Vatnafjöll\nVestmannaeyjar\nA)\nP ic\nro ba\nsa lt\nB as\nal t\nB as\nal tic\nan de\nsi te\nA nd\nes ite\nD ac\nite\nRhyolite Trachyandesite\nBasaltic trachyandesite\nTrachybasalt\nTephrite Basanite\nPhonotephrite\nSubalkaline/Tholeiitic\n40 50 60 70 80\n0 5\n10 N a 2 O + K 2 O ( % w t )\nSiO2 (%wt)\nB as\nal t\n46 48 50 52\n1 2\n3 4 5 N a 2 O + K 2 O ( % w t )\nSiO2 (%wt)\n)C)B\n)E)D stisoped3-EYDstisopedPIRG\nstisopedMEENstisopedPIRGN\nNGRIP1888.10\nGRIP2060.85\n8.0\n10.0\n44 46 48 50 52 54\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\nF e O\n/ T\ni O\n2\nSiO 2 (%wt)\n8.0\n10.0\n44 46 48 50 52 54\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\nF e O\n/ T\ni O\n2\nSiO 2 (%wt)\n8.0\n10.0\n44 46 48 50 52 54\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\nF e O\n/ T\ni O\n2\nSiO 2 (%wt)\n8.0\n10.0\n44 46 48 50 52 54\n6.0\n4.0\n2.0\nF e O\n/ T\ni O\n2\nSiO 2 (%wt)\n11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 9.0\n9.5\n10.0\n10.5\n11.0\n11.5\n12.0\nC a O\n( %\nw t )\nFeO (%wt)\n2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 2.6\n2.8\n3.0\n3.2\n3.4\n3.6\n3.8\nT i O\n2 ( %\nw t )\nFeO/MgO\n)G)F Tholeiitic GRIP, NGRIP and NEEM Trans. Alkali GRIP, NGRIP and NEEM\nIt is very difficult to separate the Katla tephra deposits based on geochemical results alone (Fig. 3F). Small variations, however, can be observed between some of the tephra deposits e.g. NEEM 1669.25 m has CaO values of 11e11.7 %wt whereas the CaO values for GRIP 2049.50 m and NEEM 1656.50 m range between 9.5 and 11 %wt. There is however, a great deal of overlap between these Katla deposits and difficulties may arise in using these for correlating to tephra deposits in other sequences when only one deposit is present. The stratigraphic position of these Katla deposits should, therefore, be used in tandemwith the geochemical results to avoid any potential mis-correlations. For instance, NGRIP 1882.10 m and NEEM 1648.90 m have been correlated according to their geochemical signatures and their stratigraphic position within GS4 by Rasmussen et al. (2013) (Table 2). These are the only transitional alkali basalts deposited during GS-4 and, thus, can be discriminated from the other layers shown in Fig. 3B, C and F. Likewise, GRIP 2070.20 m is the only tephra of Katla origin deposited during GI-5.1 and NGRIP 1929.95 m, NEEM 1677.60 m and GRIP 2079.40m all relate to the same volcanic event during GS5.2 and are, thus, stratigraphically distinct. However three layers are located in GS-3 (NEEM 1626.15 m, NGRIP 1855.80 m and NGRIP\nFig. 3.

For example GRIP 2002.20 m has TiO2 values of 3.6e3.7 %wt whereas GRIP 2064.35 m has TiO2 values of 3.2e3.3 %wt. Some layers for example NEEM 1664.95 m and NEEM 1671.85 m cannot be discriminated using geochemical signatures (Fig. 3G), however their stratigraphic position (GS-5.1 and GI-5.1 respectively) does allow for discrimination between these layers (Table 2).\n3.2. Period 2e32-38 ka b2k, GI-5.2 to GS-8\nThe ice sampled in this period consisted of 50.05 m from NGRIP (40% of total ice in this period) and 26.4 m from NEEM (37% of total ice) (Table 1). Nine tephra layers are present in this time period, 5 fromNGRIP and 4 fromNEEM (Table 2, Figs. 4 and 5). GRIP and DYE3 were not sampled during this time period. The NGRIP grain size average is 30.6 mm, with an averagemaximum grain size of 51.0 mm.\nA) Total Alkalis vs. Silica diagram (Le Bas et al., 1986).

NGRIP 1954.70 m, NGRIP 1952.15 m and NEEM 1690.35 m originate from Katla, Iceland (Fig. 5BeD). NGRIP 1952.15 m and NEEM 1690.35 m exhibit overlapping geochemical signatures and are believed to relate to the same volcanic event (Rasmussen et al., 2013) (Fig. 5). Despite the Katla origin, NGRIP 1954.70 m is distinct from NGRIP 1952.15 m and NEEM 1690.35 m (apart from 2 outliers) due to its lower SiO2 and higher TiO2 values (Fig. 5BeD). The remaining four layers originate from Kverkfj€oll (Fig. 5BeD) and can be separated into two groups based on their Al2O3 and TiO2 values (Fig. 5B). Moreover, these tephra deposits can also be distinguished based on their stratigraphic positions as NGRIP 1950.50 m and NEEM 1689.25 m fell during GI-5.2 and NGRIP 1973.16m and NEEM 1702.40mwere deposited during GI-6. NGRIP 1950.50 m and NEEM 1689.25 m have lower TiO2 and higher Al2O3 values (Fig. 5B) and were assigned to the same volcanic event by Rasmussen et al. (2013). NEEM 1693.45 m and NGRIP 2009.15m are dacitic to rhyolitic in composition and show geochemical affinity to Hekla products (Figs. 4 and 5a).\n3.3. Period 3e37e41 ka b2k, GI-8 to GI-9\nWithin this time period 45.65 m of NGRIP ice (91% of the available ice-core representing this interval), 26.4 m of NEEM ice\n(86% of total ice), 45.10 m of GRIP ice (100% of total) and 18.70 m of DYE-3 ice (100% of total) was sampled and 19 previously unreported tephra layers were identified (Table 1). Of these, two are from NEEM, 10 from GRIP and 7 from DYE-3 (Table 2, Figs. 4 and 6). In addition to these layers another 20 tephra deposits in this time periodwere reported by Bourne et al. (2013) and are included in the overall framework in Table 2 but are not plotted in Fig. 6. Of these twenty tephras, 15 were identified in NGRIP and 5 in NEEM and the geochemical results reveal that they all fall within the compositional envelope of the marine Faroe Marine Ash Zone III deposit (Bourne et al., 2013).\nDYE-3 again has the largest average grain size in this time period (54.6 mm, Table 3) compared to the GRIP average of 45.6 mm, the NGRIP deposits of Bourne et al. (2013) have an average grain size of 29.3 mm and all the NEEM tephras deposits have an average grain size of 25.0 mm.\nOf the new deposits reported here, 17 are basaltic in composition (Fig. 6A), with 16 originating from Grimsv€otn and one, GRIP 2213.05 m, originating from Katla (Fig. 6 BeC). DYE-3 1895.55 m, DYE-3 1901.80 m, DYE-3 1904.10 m, and DYE-3 1904.15 m are more homogenous than those identified in Period 1, and plot within the Grimsv€otn field (Fig. 6AeC). However DYE-3 1900.80 m and DYE-3 1912.35 m still show geochemical heterogeneity (Fig. 6B and C) but all show geochemical affinity to Grimsv€otn. NEEM 1784.46 m has a mafic composition, falling in the basaltic andesite composition of the TAS plot (Fig. 6A). The only rhyolitic tephra from this period is DYE-3 1898.65 m (Fig. 6A) and based on TiO2 and FeO values is\nthought to originate from Hekla, as is NEEM 1784.46 m (Fig. 4). The 16 eruptions from Grimsv€otn are geochemically very similar, however small differences in the TiO2 values do allow these eruptions to be split into three main groupings (Fig. 6C) but with only limited stratigraphical separation. Within the highest TiO2 grouping (3.0e3.5 %wt) both GRIP 2227.15 m and GRIP 2227.90 m are located in GS-10, and thus stratigraphic position cannot be used as an additional discriminatory tool for these tephra deposits (Fig. 6C, Table 2). Slightly lower TiO2 values (2.75e3.00 %wt) for GRIP 2195.45 m, GRIP 2197.25 m, DYE-3 1895.55 m, DYE-3 1901.80 m, DYE-3 1904.10 m and DYE-3 1904.15 m, give these a somewhat distinctive character. Both GRIP layers are positioned in GI-8c, meaning stratigraphic discrimination is not possible (Table 2, Fig. 6C). Finally in the lowest TiO2 group (2.00e2.75 %wt) NEEM 1747.10 m and GRIP 2190.65 m are located in GI-8c (Table 2), and GRIP 2200.75m, GRIP 2201.50m, and GRIP 2207.00m are located in GS-9 (Table 2), meaning some limited additional discrimination based on stratigraphy is possible. Thus, small geochemical variations allow the discrimination of tephra deposits within these three groupings, but using their stratigraphic positions as an added discrimination tool in this particular context is limited.\nThis time period was sampled intensively to detect whether the Campanian Ignimbrite (CI) tephra layer was present in a Greenland ice-core. This is one of the largest eruptions of the Late Quaternary in the Mediterranean region (Pyle et al., 2006) and dated to\n39.28 ± 0.11 ka (De Vivo et al., 2001). Tephra from this eruptionwas not present in NGRIP or NEEM (Bourne et al., 2013) and no tephra layers with trachy-phonolitic geochemistry, typical of the CI were identified in GRIP or DYE-3 either.\n3.4. Period 4e41e46 ka b2k, GS-10 to GS-12\nWithin this time period 30.25 m of NGRIP ice (34% of available ice) and 8.8 m of NEEM ice (18% of total ice) was sampled (Table 1), no ice was sampled from GRIP or DYE-3. Eight tephra deposits are present in this time period, all of them from NGRIP, as only a small amount of NEEM ice was sampled. The stratigraphic positions, ages, chemical compositions and source volcanoes of the tephra layers are shown in Fig. 7 and are summarised in Table 2. The average grain size of glass shards within the NGRIP deposits in this time period is 24.1 mm, which is consistent with the results from this core location in other time periods. Each of the deposits in this time period are tholeiitic basaltic in composition and all originate from the Grimsv€otn volcano (Fig. 7), although NGRIP 2163.35 m also contains a sub population of dacitic shards that appear to originate from Hekla (Fig. 4), suggesting two closely spaced eruptions that are not stratigraphically resolved in the 20 cm sample. All of the Grimsv€otn deposits, are geochemically very similar, however they can be split into two groups based on the CaO composition with NGRIP 2150.90 m, NGRIP 2162.05 m and NGRIP 2185.70 m forming\none group with lower CaO and TiO2 values (Fig. 7B and D). These 3 deposits can also be separated stratigraphically and fell during GI11 (NGRIP 2150.90m), GS-12 (NGRIP 2162.05 m) and GI-12c (NGRIP 2185.70 m) (Fig. 2, Table 2). NGRIP 2162.60 m, NGRIP 2163.35 m, NGRIP 2164.10m and NGRIP 2188.25m form the second groupwith a lower FeO/TiO2 ratio and higher CaO values (Fig. 7C and D). Stratigraphically NGRIP 2188.25 m can be distinguished from the other 3 layers, as it is positioned in GI-12c, as opposed to GS-12. NGRIP 2186.80 m is the most geochemically distinct layer in this time period with lower FeO and higher CaO values and can, thus, be easily discriminated from the younger NGRIP tephras in this period (Fig. 7D)."

    "text": "An investigation of tephra deposits preserved within 4 different Greenland ice-cores provides a detailed record of Icelandic volcanism over the glacial period between 25 and 45 ka b2k (Table 2). Together with the previously published tephra deposits in Davies et al. (2008, 2010) and Bourne et al. (2013), 99 tephra layers are identified during this interval. This framework represents a significant advancement in our understanding of the Icelandic volcanic history and is an important first step towards widening the use of tephra horizons for the synchronisation of the ice-cores with other palaeoclimatic archives. Some tephra deposits within this\nframework will be more valuable than others as marker horizons, but a detailed history of volcanic events is important to preclude any potential mis-correlations. When assessing the potential of individual tephra deposits for correlation purposes, the most valuable deposits will be: i) robustly characterised and geochemically distinct, ii) widespread in extent and iii) well-dated and deposited close to an event of rapid change (Davies et al., 2012)."

    "heading": "4.1. Assessing the value of individual tephra deposits: geochemical characterisation",
    "text": "All of the layers identified here have been robustly geochemically characterised but several deposits exhibit similar geochemical signatures. Their use as time-parallel marker horizons is subject to careful scrutiny of geochemical results and, where possible, the stratigraphic position of the tephra in question. In particular, ninety-four of the layers are basaltic in composition with 43 originating from Grimsv€otn, 17 deposits are from Kverkfj€oll, which has previously been suggested to form a single volcanic system with Grimsv€otn (Gr€onvold and J ohannesson, 1984), and 19 are from Katla. Whilst several of these layers are geochemically similar, 70 of the layers can be discriminated based either on small geochemical differences or their stratigraphic position (provided this can be adequately resolved in other sequences). Often, however, the small geochemical differences are between 0.2 and 0.5 %wt and, thus, it is\nessential that geochemical analysis of any potential correlatives is bracketed by analysis of international secondary standards.\nThis large number of basaltic horizons is in contrast to the number identified in the same time-interval within the European INTIMATE tephra framework, where only 2 basaltic horizons are identified (Blockley et al., 2012; Davies et al., 2012). This difference in the number of basaltic tephra layers found in Greenland and in terrestrial European records could be due to the preferential dispersal of basaltic eruptions from Iceland towards Greenland or could reflect the fact that routine density separation techniques employed to detect cryptotephra in terrestrial records does not allow detection of basaltic material (Turney, 1998; Blockley et al., 2005; Larsen and Eiriksson., 2007). This situation may well change with the wider application of a magnetic separation technique for the isolation of glass shards of basaltic composition from sedimentary deposits (e.g. Mackie et al., 2002; Griggs et al., 2014)."

    "heading": "4.2. Assessing the value of individual tephra deposits: geographical extent",
    "text": "As yet, the geographical extent of these tephra deposits outside of Greenland is currently unknown, but by investigating the tephra record within the different ice-cores, we can reconstruct the extent of ash deposition over the ice sheet. NGRIP and NEEM correlations and NGRIP and GRIP correlations have been outlined previously by Rasmussen et al. (2013) and Seierstad et al., (submitted for publication), respectively (Table 2, Fig. 8). We advance this work by highlighting 11 new correlations here giving particular attention to those tephras that can be traced between more than 2 ice-cores. A summary of all ice-core correlations, both new and published, is presented in Table 3. Statistical analyses (similarity coefficient and statistical distance) support these correlations and none of the statistical distances exceed the critical value, therefore no correlations are statistically different (Table 3).\nWithin Period 1, major element results indicate that the Katlasourced deposit found within NGRIP 1895.24 m and NEEM 1656.50 m by Rasmussen et al. (2013) can also be extended to GRIP 2049.50 m (Fig. 9A). Secondly GRIP 2060.85 m can be correlated to both NGRIP 1908.70 m and NEEM 1664.95 m, which were themselves correlated by Rasmussen et al. (2013) (Fig. 9A). Finally, GRIP 2079.40 m can be correlated to NEEM 1677.60 mwhich has already been correlated to NGRIP 1929.95 m by Seierstad et al., (submitted for publication) (Fig. 9A). In Period 2, NGRIP 1973.16 m and NEEM 1702.45 m can be correlated for the first time (Fig. 9B), their ages of 33,686 ± 1207 yrs b2k and 33,692 ± 1208 yrs b2k (Table 2) support this correlation. This correlation also provides a further independent test for the volcanic matching method used to transfer the GICC05 timescale to NEEM.\nWithin Period 3, five correlations can now be made between GRIP tephra layers presented here and the NEEM data published in Bourne et al. (2013). The GRIP to NGRIP correlations are considered by Seierstad et al., (submitted for publication). GRIP 2195.45 m correlates to NEEM 1755.60 m, GRIP 2197.45 m to NEEM 1757.10 m, GRIP 2201.50 m to NEEM 1759.85 m, GRIP 2207.00 m to NEEM 1764.25 m and finally GRIP 2227.15 m to NEEM 1780.20 m (Fig. 9C). Each tephra correlation has a similarity coefficient greater than 0.97 and the statistical distance does not exceed the critical value (Table 3), supporting the geochemical correlations (Fig. 9C). Correlations to other GRIP layers in this period e.g. GRIP 2200.75m and GRIP 2202.40 m can be excluded based on their stratigraphic position (Figs. 2 and 8). Whilst the DYE-3 tephra layers appear to correlate with some of the GRIP layers (Fig. 6), it is clear from their FeO/MgO ratios that DYE-3 1901.80 m, DYE-3 1904.10 m and DYE-3 1940.15 m are offset from GRIP 2195.45 m and GRIP 2197.25 m (Fig. 9C). Therefore, whilst the DYE-3 layers in this time period reveal more geochemically homogenous populations than in Period 1, they do not correlate with layers in the other ice-cores.\nThe correlation of GRIP 2197.45 m to NEEM 1757.10 m also implies a correlation to NGRIP 2066.95 m as the NEEM and\nNGRIP layer were correlated by Rasmussen et al. (2013). This is supported by the geochemical data (Fig. 9C, black triangles), however, the correlation of NGRIP 2066.95 m and GRIP 2197.45 m is stratigraphically inconsistent with the recent synchronisation of the NGRIP and the GRIP cores based on chemo-stratigraphic records (Seierstad et al. submitted). According to the chemostratigraphic matching the two tephra layers are separated by 5e13 years (according to the actual stratigraphic position of the tephra deposit within the 15 cm ice sample) (Seierstad et al., submitted for publication). Thus, the geochemical signatures support a tephra correlation, but the inconsistencies with the chemo-stratigraphic matching prevents a firm correlation (dashed red line, Fig. 8).\nWith the new tephra correlations outlined here, 8 tephra horizons are common to GRIP, NGRIP and NEEM (Fig. 8). A further four correlations are present between NGRIP and NEEM (green lines) and one additional correlation links NGRIP and GRIP (orange line) (Fig. 8). The layers that only correlate between NGRIP and NEEM are\nfound in Period 2 and late in Period 1, where the GRIP core was not sampled, indicating that with further targeted sampling of GRIP more correlations between all three cores may be identified. Single age estimates for these correlating tephra deposits are shown in Fig. 8. These ages represent the basal age of the NGRIP sample, as the glacial part of the GICC05 chronology was based on NGRIP annual layer counting. If these layers are traced beyond Greenland then the ages presented in Fig. 8 represent the age of the tephra deposit. No correlations were possible with the DYE-3 deposits due to their geochemical heterogeneity (especially in Period 1) and geochemical offsets with Period 3 deposits (Figs. 3 and 9C). Glass shards from the same samples in DYE-3 show affinities to Katla, Grimsv€otn and Veidiv€otn (Fig. 3E). Many deposits are found within consecutive samples and the heterogeneous geochemical signatures suggest mixing of different tephra deposits. It is possible, that the lower temporal resolution of DYE-3 during the glacial is too low (~100m) to isolate deposits from individual eruptions as seen in the other cores. Secondly, Ram and Gayley (1991) discuss whether the\naggregates from the Z2 eruption (which is spread over 78 cm in DYE-3) were caused by melt and refreeze, which could also be the cause of the geochemical heterogeneity observed here. Alternatively, as DYE-3 is the most southerly ice-core (Fig. 1) it is possible\nthat storms from Iceland could redeposit tephra on the ice-sheet surface (Prospero et al., 2012; Arnalds et al., 2013).\nThe deposits that correlate between GRIP, NGRIP and NEEM suggest a northerly dispersal of ash from Iceland, and they\nrepresent the most widespread deposits identified to date (Fig. 8). The decrease in tephra grain size with increasing northerly latitude supports this direct transport route in a north westerly direction from Iceland to the Greenland core sites (Fig. 10). This decrease appears to be a consequence of increasing distance from Iceland, which holds true when considering the distance of the ice-cores from Katla (Fig. 10A), however GRIP is actually closer to Grimsv€otn (the most common source of tephra layers here) than DYE-3 (Fig. 10B). DYE-3 is at a lower altitude (2480 m above sea level (asl), than GRIP (3230 m asl) (Vinther et al., 2006) (Fig. 1) suggesting that ash travelling to the GRIP drill site still has further to travel than that reaching DYE-3. The length of a typical air mass trajectory from Iceland to the drill sites may be the cause of the grain size decrease. This is very much dependent on the pathway of cyclones over the North Atlantic as retrograde transport relative to the overall westerly flow is required. On the whole, the decreasing grain-size trend with increasing latitude suggests ash is transported directly to the core sites from source. Whether or not these deposits are widespread beyond Greenland remains to be seen, and will require high-resolution investigations of sequences in the North Atlantic region and north and west of Greenland (if available). Until then, it is unknown whether volcanic ash from these eruptions was also dispersed eastwards towards Europe."

    "text": "In order to optimise the application of tephrochronology to establish the phase relationships between different proxy records, the most valuable tephras are those that fall close to rapid climatic events. In this case a tephra deposit is considered to fall close to a rapid climate event if its age is within 100 years of the age of the\nstratigraphic boundaries defined by Rasmussen et al., (submitted for publication). Of the most widespread deposits only two, NGRIP 2066.95/NEEM 1757.10 m/GRIP 2197.45 m (no. 11 on Fig. 8) and NGRIP 2071.50 m/NEEM 1759.85 m/GRIP 2201.50 m (no. 12 on Fig. 8), constrains a rapid climate event (GI-8c onset) evident in the NGRIP d18O curve (Fig. 11).\nHowever, five deposits common to both NGRIP and NEEM were deposited during the warming and cooling transitions of GI-3, GI-4, GI 5.2 and GI-6 (Fig. 11). Finally a further 5 tephra deposits present only in NGRIP, 3 deposits found only in NEEM and 4 found only in GRIP are also found on rapid warming or cooling transitions (Fig. 11). Thus, 19 tephra deposits within this framework (but 28 tephras from different cores) constrain rapid climate events of interest within the Greenland ice cores. Despite their useful stratigraphic position, their potential value to link different records rest on their distinct geochemical composition relative to other tephras close in age. Of these 19 tephra deposits NEEM 1636.65 m, NGRIP 1861.55 m (Fig. 12A), NGRIP 1882.50 m, NGRIP 1888.10 m (Fig. 12B), NGRIP 1950.50/NEEM 1689.25 m, NGRIP 1952.15 m/NEEM 1690.35 m (Fig. 12D), NGRIP 1973.16 m/NEEM 1702.45 m, NGRIP 2009.15 m (Fig. 12E), NGRIP 2100.65 m and NEEM 1784.46 m (Fig. 12G) are all compositionally unique from the other layers that sit in similar stratigraphic positions to these key layers, making these the most useful layers for tracing into other archives. NGRIP 1882.10 m/NEEM 1648.9 m cannot be chemically distinguished from NGRIP 1895.24 m/NEEM 1656.50 m/GRIP2049.50 m, however they fall in GS-4 and GS-5.1, respectively, so could be distinguished from one another if found in other well-resolved archives. However, NGRIP1915.50 m/NGRIP1915.63 m/NEEM 1669.25 m, GRIP 2067.85 m, GRIP 2070.20 m, GRIP 2070.60 m, NEEM 1671.85 m, NGRIP2066.95 m/NEEM1757.10 m/GRIP2197.25 m, GRIP2200.75 m and NGRIP 2071.50 m/NEEM1759.85 m/GRIP2201.50 m are all geochemically indistinguishable from other tephra deposits within the same stratigraphic unit (Fig. 12C and F) suggesting that robust correlations of these deposits to other sequences will be more challenging.\nTherefore the 10 layers that fall close to rapid climate events and are geochemically distinctive (layers in bold italic, Fig. 11) are the most useful layers for establishing the phase relationships between different proxy records. NGRIP2066.95 m/ NEEM1757.10 m/GRIP2197.25 m, GRIP2200.75 m and NGRIP 2071.50 m/NEEM1759.85 m/GRIP2201.50 m (numbers 11 and 12 Fig. 8) are valuable as they are widespread and fall on a rapid transition, however they are geochemically similar to other tephra layers of a similar age and therefore care is needed if these are correlated to other archives. Likewise the other widespread deposits that are found across Greenland (Fig. 8) may also represent valuable isochrons for future correlations to other disparate sequences."

    "heading": "4.4. Chemical indicators of volcanism in ice-cores and their relationship to tephra deposits",
    "text": "Initial work on tephra deposits preserved in ice cores focussed on horizons that were visible in the record or sections of ice where large sulphate spikes were present (Gr€onvold et al., 1995; Mortensen et al., 2005). However recent research has begun to questionwhether using the sulphate record is a reliable method for locating tephra deposits (e.g. Coulter et al., 2012). Our investigation of more than 400 m of ice allows a detailed insight into the imprint of volcanic aerosol fallout (especially sulphate) in the ice alongside the stratigraphic position of volcanic glass shards. The position of tephra deposits are considered relative to the NGRIP electrical conductivity measurements (ECM, Fig. 13A) (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2002) and NGRIP concentrations of sulphate, dust and calcium as\nwell as the conductivity of the liquid phase (Bigler, 2004) with a particular focus on the continuously sampled portion of ice spanning GI-9, GS-9 and GI-8 (Fig. 13B and C).\nIsolating and detecting volcanic sulphate spikes above a fluctuating and climatically-driven background level is complex (Fig.13). Sulphate concentrations in ice cores have a complex origin, sea salt, mineral dust, biogenic H2S/SO2 and volcanism contribute to the sulphate concentrations observed and a volcanic eruption will often give rise to sulphate spikes with concentrations of 3e10 micro equivalent/kg (6e20 mmol/kg) (Steffensen, 1995). When climate variability is low (e.g. during the Holocene and interstadial periods) the background level of sulphate in the ice is around 1-2 micro-equivalent/kg and natural variability in sulphate concentration is also low (1-2 micro-equivalent/kg inter annually) (Fig. 13A and B). During these warm episodes the large sulphate spikes often stand out above background signals and are clearly detectable (Fig. 13B and Ci). However during GI-8, NGRIP 2065.65m is the only\ntephra layer to coincide with one of these large sulphate peaks that are discernible from the background signal (Fig. 13Ci). The oldest tephra in this interval (NGRIP 2066.95m) is accompanied by a small peak in sulphate of 200 ppbw and no discernible signal is evident for NGRIP 2064.55m (younger tephra). Large sulphate spikes in this interval e.g. at 2067.36 m do not coincide with glass shard deposition.\nOn the other hand, during the cold stadials of the last glacial, the amount of continental dust and other impurities in the ice are 10e20 times higher (see Fig. 13B), giving a slightly alkaline signal to the ice. Most of the sulphate present in the ice during these times is derived from CaSO4 resulting from increased calcium ions caused by increased dustiness, which reacts with the naturally occurring sulphate in the ice. The background levels of sulphate are about 5 times higher than in interstadials, as is the natural variability. As such the increased input of sulphate from a volcanic eruption is masked and is not always a useful indicator. Therefore during cold\nstadial periods elevated sulphate values due to increased dustiness or volcanism are difficult to be discerned (Steffensen, 1995; Svensson et al., 2013). During the cold stadial of GS-9, the four tephra deposits present coincide with a peak in sulphate and other chemical indicators (Fig. 13Cii). However, the sulphate is no greater than the general background level, which suggests that, whilst there is a link between the tephra deposition and the sulphate record, this would not be diagnostic if considering the sulphate record alone.\nOur results suggest that the relationship between tephra deposition and coeval volcanic aerosol fallout is complex and it is unclear whether or not it is solely controlled by prevailing climatic conditions, which supports similar findings reported in Davies et al. (2014). Tephra deposits do fall in association with increased levels of the chemical indicators but the records are so variable that it is\ndifficult to know whether or not they are related to each other or whether it's just coincidental. Therefore it is recommended that future tephra sampling be guided by time periods of interest and not peaks in the chemical records."

    "heading": "5. Conclusions",
    "text": "A detailed Greenland ice-core tephrochronological framework for GS-3 to GI-12 (25,000e45,000 yrs b2k) has been outlined. This framework builds on the work of Davies et al. (2010) and Bourne et al. (2013) and includes 99 geochemically characterised tephra deposits identified within the NGRIP, NEEM, GRIP and DYE-3 icecores. An examination of the relationship between tephra shards and chemical composition of the ice shows that, whilst tephra\ndeposits do occurwith small peaks in sulphate, this is not a sufficient diagnostic to use as an indicator of the presence of tephra deposits.\nThis study improves our understanding of Icelandic volcanic history and is a crucial first step to facilitate the synchronisation of the Greenland ice-cores with other palaeoclimatic archives. In particular, fourteen tephra deposits are traced in at least 2 ice-cores (Fig. 8) and their extensive nature adds value as potential isochrons. In addition, 19 tephra deposits constrain the rapid warming and cooling transitions that characterise this time period and 10 of these are geochemically distinct (Figs. 11 and 12) also revealing their value as isochrons. Therefore tephra deposits outlined in both Figs. 8 and 11 should be an important focus for tracing these cryptotephra deposits in distal and high sedimentation areas of the North Atlantic region, where some of the Greenland tephra layers may also be preserved.\nGiven the large number of basaltic tephra layers present in the Greenland ice-cores it would be particularly beneficial to employ extraction methods such as the magnetic separation technique that also allow the identification of basaltic cryptotephra deposits within mineral-rich marine and terrestrial sediments (e.g. Griggs et al., 2014). Once identified, potential correlatives to the tephra deposits described here also require robust geochemical characterisation for rigorous comparison to the ice-core tephra deposits, to ensure that they are correlated robustly."

  "abstractText": "Tephra layers preserved within the Greenland ice-cores are crucial for the independent synchronisation of these high-resolution records to other palaeoclimatic archives. Here we present a new and detailed tephrochronological framework for the time period 25,000e45,000 a b2k that brings together results from 4 deep Greenland ice-cores. In total, 99 tephra deposits, the majority of which are preserved as cryptotephra, are described from the NGRIP, NEEM, GRIP and DYE-3 records. The major element signatures of single glass shards within these deposits indicate that 93 are basaltic in composition all originating from Iceland. Specifically, 43 originate from Grimsv€ otn, 20 are thought to be sourced from the Katla volcanic system and 17 show affinity to the Kverkfj€ oll system. Robust geochemical characterisations, independent ages derived from the GICC05 ice-core chronology, and the stratigraphic positions of these deposits relative to the Dansgaard-Oeschger climate events represent a key framework that provides new information on the frequency and nature of volcanic events in the North Atlantic region between GS-3 and GI-12. Of particular importance are 19 tephra deposits that lie on the rapid climatic transitions that punctuate the last glacial period. This framework of well-constrained, time-synchronous tie-lines represents an important step towards the independent synchronisation of marine, terrestrial and ice-core records from the North Atlantic region, in order to assess the phasing of rapid climatic changes during the last glacial period. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
