Henderson\nKeywords: Deccan volcanism Iridium Meghalaya KT boundary mass extinction\nThe Um Sohryngkew section ofMeghalaya, NE India, located 800–1000 km from the Deccan volcanic province, is one of the most complete Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (KTB) transitions worldwide with all defining and supporting criteria present: mass extinction of planktic foraminifera, first appearance of Danian species, δ13C shift, Ir anomaly (12 ppb) and KTB red layer. The geochemical signature of the KTB layer indicates not only an extraterrestrial signal (Ni and all Platinum Group Elements (PGEs)) of a second impact that postdates Chicxulub, but also a significant component resulting from condensed sedimentation (P), redox fluctuations (As, Co, Fe, Pb, Zn, and to a lesser extent Ni and Cu) and volcanism. From the late Maastrichtian C29r into the early Danian, a humid climate prevailed (kaolinite: 40–60%, detrital minerals: 50–80%). During the latest Maastrichtian, periodic acid rains (carbonate dissolution; CIA index: 70–80) associated with pulsed Deccan eruptions and strong continental weathering resulted in mesotrophic waters. The resulting super-stressed environmental conditions led to the demise of nearly all planktic foraminiferal species and blooms (N95%) of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria cretacea. These data reveal that detrimental marine conditions prevailed surrounding the Deccan volcanic province during the main phase of eruptions in C29r below the KTB. Ultimately these environmental conditions led to regionally early extinctions followed by global extinctions at the KTB.\nll rights reserved.\n© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "For the past 30 years, the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (KTB) mass extinction has been attributed to an extraterrestrial impact based mainly on the presence of a global Ir enrichment in a thin KTB red clay layer (Alvarez et al., 1980), which was subsequently attributed to the Chicxulub impact crater on Yucatan that distributed impact glass spherule ejecta near the KTB in Central and North America (e.g., Pope et al., 1991; Schulte et al., 2010; Smit et al., 1996). This theory and its corollary interpretations have remained controversial because of contradictory evidence (Keller, 2010), including the discovery of the oldest impact spherule layer in late Maastrichtian sediments in NE Mexico and Texas that indicates a pre-KT age for the Chicxulub impact (e.g., Keller et al., 2003, 2007, 2009a).\nAlso for the past 30 years, Deccan volcanism has been advocated as potential cause for the KTB catastrophe (e.g., Courtillot et al., 1986, 1988; Duncan and Pyle, 1988; MacLean, 1985). But this hypothesis\nwas considered unlikely because volcanism was generally believed to have occurred over about one million years prior to the mass extinction leaving sufficient time for recovery between eruptions. More recently, major studies of the Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP) have greatly improved understanding of the age and tempo of eruptions, revealing three major phases: initial phase-1 in C30n at ~67.4 Ma, the main phase-2 in C29r just before the KTB, and the last phase-3 in the early Danian (base C29n). Phase-2 is the most critical period of Deccan volcanism as it accounts for ~80% of the entire 3500 m thick Deccan lava pile, and erupted in rapid pulses over a short interval in C29r just prior to the KTB mass extinction (Chenet et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; Keller et al., 2008, 2009b,c). In another interpretation, Hooper et al. (2010) suggest that although the bulk of the major eruptions started in C29r, it continued into C29n. New data from ten deep wells in the Krishna-Godavari Basin support Chenet et al.'s model of two separate volcanic phases with the major phase-2 in C29R below the KTB and Phase-3 in C29N (Keller et al., 2011). It cannot be ruled out that minor volcanic eruptions continued in C29R above the KTB, although these would have been locally more restricted. Phase-2 created the world's longest lava flows, spanning N1500 km across India and into the Gulf of Bengal (Keller et al., 2011;\nSelf et al., 2008). These lava flows ended at or near the KTB mass extinction (Keller et al., 2008), as revealed in intertrappean sediments overlying phase-2 basalt flows in Rajahmundry quarries (Andra Pradesh) and Jhilmili (Madhya Pradesh, Keller et al., 2009a,b). These studies strongly suggest that the biotic and environmental effects of Deccan volcanism at KTB time may have been vastly underrated.\nThis report investigates the climatic and environmental consequences of Deccan phase-2 volcanism in themost complete KTBmarine sequence known from India and comparable to the most complete sequences worldwide (e.g., Tunisia, Texas, Spain). The section is exposed along the Um Sohryngkew River in Meghalaya, NE India, and is about 800–1000 km from themain Deccan volcanic province (Fig. 1). A thin red clay layer enriched in Ir and other Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) marks the KTB (Bhandari et al., 1993, 1994; Garg et al., 2006; Pandey, 1990). Our investigations are based on the same sequence studied by these workers and employ a multi-proxy approach that includes: 1) biostratigraphy to provide high-resolution age control and evaluation of the biotic effects of Deccan volcanism; 2) carbon isotope stratigraphy as independent marker of the KTB; 3) sedimentology, microfacies analysis andbulk rockmineralogy to identify environmental changes; 4) clay mineralogy to infer paleoclimatic conditions, and comparisonwith data fromother sites in India; 5) platinumgroup, trace andmajor elements geochemistry to evaluate evidence for an impact at the KTB; and 6) major and trace element geochemistry to identify a causal-relationship between Deccan volcanic activity and periods of high-stress conditions in marine environments."

    "text": "The Um Sohryngkew section was examined in the field for lithological changes, burrows and shell layers, which were described,\nmeasured and photographed (by RG and VP). A total of 143 samples were collected at an average of 50 cm, except for the KT transition where samples were taken at 10 cm intervals. In the laboratory, samples were processed for foraminiferal extraction using standard methods (Keller et al., 1995).\nCarbon and oxygen isotope measurements were carried out on powdered bulk rock samples at the stable isotope laboratories at the University of Bern, Switzerland, using an Optima (Micromass, UK) ratio mass spectrometer equipped with an online carbonate preparation line (Multi Carb) with separate vials for each sample and a VG Prism II ratio mass spectrometer, respectively. The results were calibrated to the PDB scale with standard errors of 0.05‰ for δ13C.\nMajor and trace elements were analyzed at the Geological Institute of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, by XRF spectroscopy with a PANalytical PW2400with a RX tube (Rh anode). PGEswere analyzed at the Institute for Mineralogy and Geochemistry, University of Karlsruhe, by isotope dilution HR-ICP-MS (Axiom, VG Elemental) after pre-concentration and matrix reduction by Ni-fire assay (Gertsch et al., 2011).\nBulk rock and clay mineral assemblages were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (Xtra ARL Diffractometer) at the Geological Institute of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, based on procedures described by Adatte et al. (1996). The semi-quantification of bulk-rock mineralogy is based on XRD patterns of random powder samples by using external standards with an error margin between 5 and 10% for the phyllosilicates and 5% for grain minerals. Clay mineral analysis follows the methods described by Adatte et al. (1996). The intensities of the identified minerals are measured for a semi-quantitative estimate of the proportion of clayminerals, which is therefore given in relative percent without correction factors, because of the small error margin (b5%)."

    "text": "The Meghalaya area is located in northeastern India, north of Bangladesh, and characterized by the Shillong Plateau, which includes Garo, Khasi, Jaintia and Mikir hills (Fig. 1). The Shillong Plateau is tectonically related to the formation of Himalaya and corresponds to an uplifted Precambrian massif of the peninsular India shield formation with up to 6 km of Cretaceous through Miocene marine to continental sedimentary rocks that unconformably overlie the basement along the eastern, western and southern limbs (Alam et al., 2003; Clark and Bilham, 2008; Das Gupta and Biswas, 2000; Ghosh et al., 2005; Rao et al., 2008; Reimann, 1993; Rowley, 1996).\nThe Um Sohryngkew section lies on the southern side of the Shillong Plateau near the village of Therria along the Um Sohryngkew river. The sedimentary record shows uninterrupted marine shelf sedimentation from the Campanian to the Eocene during the formation of a gulf on the northeastern edge of greater India due to rifting along the Indo-Burmese orogen (Acharyya and Lahiri, 1991; Banerji, 1981; Krishnan, 1968; Nagappa, 1959; Reimann, 1993). Sediments consist mainly of thick sandstone layers, marls, shale and carbonates characteristic of coastal, estuarine and nearshore environments (Banerji, 1981; Krishnan, 1968; Nagappa, 1959).\nFor this study, investigations focused only on the Maastichtian– Danian interval of the Um Sohryngkew section. Sediments in the lower part of the section (0–14.26 m) consist of bioturbated clayey marls (0–8 m), silty sandy shales (8–10 m), clayey marls (10–14.26 m), and three 10–40 cm thick sandstone beds (2.4 m, 4.5 m, 13.3 m; Fig. 2). The KTB (14.26–14.28 m) ismarked by a 2 cm thick rust-red-colored sandysilty layer with abundant subangular quartz in a red-brown matrix enriched in Ir and other PGEs, but devoid of calcite and microfossils (Figs. 2, 3A, B). In the lower Danian, silty, sandy shalewith a 10 cm thick bioturbated sandstone layer (15.3–15.4 m) is followed by shales, clayey marls, marls, and marly limestones (15.5–30 m)."

    "text": "Previous micropaleontological studies of the Maastrichtian to Paleocene Um Sohryngkew section of Meghalaya based on planktic foraminifera failed to identify the KTB red layer and PGE anomalies, possibly because different intervals or sections were collected, or sampling intervals were too large (e.g., Mukhopadhyay, 2007). In contrast, nannofossil and dinoflagellate studies (Garg et al., 2006; Nandi, 1990) were based on sample collections of the same intervals where PGE anomalies were identified (Bhandari et al., 1993, 1994; Pandey, 1990). This report is based on planktic foraminifera from the same section and samples previously reported by Garg et al. (2006), and represents the first documentation of the mass extinction across the KTB transition of the Um Sohryngkew section. Age and biozones are based on the combined planktic foraminiferal zonal scheme of Keller et al. (1995, 2002), and Li and Keller (1998)."

    "text": "The latest Maastrichtian nannofossils zone Micula prinsii marks the 4 m below the KTB (Garg et al., 2006), which correspond to planktic foraminiferal zones CF2 and CF1 (Keller et al., 2009d). Planktic foraminiferal assemblages in this interval are dominated byGuembelitria blooms (N95%) that characterize zone CF1 and CF2 in shallow-water environments globally (see reviews in Keller and Abramovich, 2009; Pardo and Keller, 2008). The remaining assemblage consists of rare and\nsporadic occurrences of heterohelicids, planoglobulinids, pseudoguembelinids, racemiguembelinids, globotruncanids and rugoglobigerinids (Fig. 3). However, in the 0.6 m below the KTB only rare, dwarfed and stress-resistant species are present (e.g., heterohelicids and guembelitrids). The exclusionof all subsurfacedwellers suggests a shallower inner neritic environment. Enhanced carbonate dissolution in this interval may be linked to Deccan volcanism. In the Micula murus zone only rare planktic foraminifera are preserved in the predominantly sandy-silty shales, clayey marls and sandstones."

    "text": "The Um Sohryngkew section contains the most complete KTB transition in India, which can be correlated to the El Kef stratotype section and point (GSSP) in Tunisia (Cowie et al., 1989; Keller et al., 1995; Remane et al., 1999). As at El Kef, the KTB is identified by the mass extinction of planktic foraminifera followed by the first appearances of Danian species in zones P0 and P1a (e.g., Parvularugoglobigerina extensa, P. eugubina, Woodringina hornerstownensis, Globoconusa daubjergensis; Keller et al., 1995, 2002; Molina et al., 2006). Also present are the same three KTB-supporting criteria, the negative δ13C shift, the Ir anomaly and other PGEs in a thin red layer. The δ13C excursion at the Um Sohryngkew section shows the same trend as in the complete and expanded KTB sequences in Tunisia and Texas (Keller et al., 2002, 2009a).\nThe mass extinction pattern differs from the deep-sea record by its lower diversity (24 species as compared with over 30 in comparable shallow environments, Keller andAbramovich, 2009), the rare, sporadic pre-KTB species occurrences in the 4 m below the KTB, and blooms (N95%) of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria cretacea (Fig. 3). These faunal assemblages reflect super-stressed environmental conditions at the time of Deccan phase-2 eruptions in C29r below the KTB, coincident withM.prinsii andCF1 zones (Keller et al., 2011). SuchhighGuembelitria blooms are best known from the aftermath of themass extinction in the earliest Danian, but they have also been observed below the KTB (zone\nCF1) in sections throughout the Tethys, such as Bulgaria, Israel, Sinai, Egypt, Texas and in the volcanically active Ninetyeast Ridge (reviews in Keller and Abramovich, 2009; Pardo and Keller, 2008).\nIn the earliest Danian at Um Sohryngkew, normal low diversity assemblages evolved with the first index species, P. extensa and P. eugubina present at 10 cm and 20 cm, respectively, above the KTB red layer, marking zones P0 and P1a (Fig. 3). The first appearances of Parasubbotina pseudobulloides and Subbotina triloculinoides at 1.15 m above the KTB red layer mark the subdivision of zone P1a into subzones P1a(1) and P1a(2). The top of subzone P1a(2) is defined by\nthe last appearance (LA) of P. eugubina at 19.8 m (Fig. 3). The presence of these early Danian biozones indicates a relatively continuous and high rate of sediment accumulation."

    "heading": "5. Carbon isotopes",
    "text": "In the Um Sohryngkew section, δ13C was measured on selected bulk-rock samples that contain N10% carbonate. The δ13C values are generally very negative (−1 to −7.5‰) but their global trends are comparable to former studies (Barrera and Keller, 1990; Keller and Lindinger, 1989; Stueben et al., 2002; Zachos et al., 1989). Diagenetic influence on the δ13C values in Um Sohryngkew is evaluated by oxygen isotope values (−8.39 to −5.64‰) and the coefficients of correlations between δ13C values and calcite percentages (R2=0.19), and δ13C and δ18O (R2=0.62) respectively. Very low negative δ18O values suggest strongdiagenesis (dissolution–precipitationprocesses), but their effects on the δ13C trends across the KTB are limited in Um Sohryngkew as indicated by low coefficients of correlation between δ13C values and calcite percentages, and δ13C and δ18O respectively.\nIn the late Maastrichtian, negative values vary between −2 and −3‰ (11.75–13.75 m, Fig. 3). No data is recoverable in the 50 cm below the KTB due to strong carbonate dissolution. However, just below the KTB red layer δ13C values show a drop to−4‰ followed by rapid decrease to −7.25‰, forming a trough (14.35–14.70 m) in zones P0 and P1a(1). The return to pre-KTB δ13C values of −2‰ is observed in zone P1a(2) (16.25–19.75 m; Fig. 3). In the Um Sohrynkew section, carbonate is very low (b20%) and the dissolution and re-precipitation processes in tropical environments, such as precipitation from waters enriched in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with low δ13C due to oxidation of organic matter, may explain the very negative δ13C values (Tucker and Wright, 1990)."

In lower Danian (P1a zone) sediments, calcite rapidly increases and dominates (25–40%), whereas phyllosilicates and unquantified minerals decrease.

The largest group includes Al, K, Mg, Na, Si and Ti, which show relatively stable high concentrations in the lower part of the section, followed by a gradual pre-KTB decrease (K, Mg, Ti), or abrupt KTB drop (Al, Na, Si). All reach minimum values at the KTB and constant low values in the lower Danian. Ca shows an inverse trend, with low concentrations in the upper Maastrichtian M. prinsii zone, a sharp increase just above the KTB, and constant high values in the lower Danian. In contrast, Fe and P show stable low concentrations throughout the section, interrupted only by peak values at the KTB (Fe=214,782 ppm (21.5 wt.%), P=3582 ppm (0.36 wt.%); Fig. 5).\nTrace elements (TEs) were normalized with Al based on Van der Weijden (2002) for two reasons: 1) The detrital fraction composed of quartz, phyllosilicates, Na-plagioclase and K-feldspars is dominant (60–90%), whereas calcite content is usually low (0–40%) (Fig. 4). 2) Al shows the second lowest coefficient of variations (Table A, see supplementary material). Trace element trends normalized to Al reveal important changes across the KTB (Fig. 6). Nearly constant ratios are observed in As, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, V and Zn during the upper\nMaastrichtian and lower Danian but with major positive peaks at the KTB. Cu ratios remain relatively high with no enrichment at the KTB. In contrast, Mn, Sr, U, and Zr show low Al-normalized values in the upper Maastrichtian relative to the lower Danian, but differ in their response to the KTB event (Fig. 6, Table 1).\nPGEs were analyzed across the KTB transition to quantify Ir, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru concentrations (Fig. 3A, B). All PGEs show similar patterns with low concentrations in the upperMaastrichtian and lower Danian, and peak values in the KTB red layer (Fig. 3A, B). Below the KTB red layer, Ir, Rh and Ru concentrations are stable with 0.1, 0.15, and b0.3 ppb, respectively; Pd concentrations are at or below the detection limit (b0.9 ppb), and Pt values range from less than 2 ppb to 2.84 ppb. All PGEs peak within the KTB red layer (Ir: 11.79 ppb, Pd: 73.86 ppb, Pt: 86.48 ppb, Rh: 93.44, Ru: 108.24 ppb). In the basal Danian, all PGE concentrations return to low background values. Ir, Pt, Rh and Ru values are gradually decreasing and Pt decreases rapidly to form a trough (4.16 ppb) followed by a slight increase."

Nevertheless, there are variations prior to, at and after the KTB (Fig. 4). For example, very low calcite (0–20%) and very high detritus (80–90%) below and at the KTB change to higher calcite (20–40%) and lower detritus (60–80%) in the basal Danian. ME trends are similar to detritus, except for Ca content, which increases in the lower Danian. MEs show a sharp drop at the KTB followed by constant low values in the lower Danian zone P1a(1) with constant detrital input, including Al, K, Mg, Na, Si, and Ti (Fig. 5).\nnto three groups with similar trends: (A) High late Maastrichtian contents followed by er values in the early Danian; (C) Constant late Maastrichtian and the early Danian\nME and TE trends can be assessed by calculating enrichment factors (EFME=Y/Yaverage shale, where Y is a specific major element; EFTE=(X/Al)/(X/Al)average shale, where X is a specific trace element) using average shale values of Wedepohl (1971). Fig. 8A and B shows this calculation for the upper Maastrichtian (pre-KTB), lower Danian (post-KTB), the Maastrichtian–Danian combined, and separately for the KTB red layer. Average EFME and EFTE calculated for the entire interval are generally close to 1, which indicates a major and trace element composition nearly similar to average shale (Fig. 7A, B). Exceptions are Mg, Na, Cu, and Mn, which are slightly depleted relative to average shale, whereas Ca, U, and Zr, are enriched relative\nto average shale (Fig. 7A, B). For pre-KTB and post-KTB intervals, most average EFsME and EFsTE remain relatively close to the averages calculated for the entire interval (Fig. 7A, B), except for small differences in the average EFTE between pre-KTB and post-KTB sediments (Fig. 7A, B).\nThe KTB red layer composition in MEs and TEs differs significantly from upper Maastrichtian and lower Danianmarls and shales (Fig. 7A, B). MEs record enrichments in Ca, Fe and P, whereas all other major elements are slightly depleted (Fig. 7A). TE enrichment factors display a distinct composition relative to average shale with important enrichments in As, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn, whereas all other TEs show\nrs and Grevesse, 1989), crust (Wedepohl, 1995), deccan basalts (Crocket and Paul, 2004,\nEFsTE close to 1. These enrichments correlate with large peaks in Ir, Pd, Pt, Rh and Rh and confirm the unique geochemical composition of the KTB red layer (Figs. 3A, B, 7A, B)."

For example, CIA values for fresh basalt (30–45) and granite (45–55) are very low (Nesbitt and Young, 1982). Illite, montmorillonites and beidellites, which are formed under contrasting dry and seasonal climates, show CIA values of 75–85. Kaolinite, a clay mineral produced under constant humid conditions, yields highest CIA values N90. CIA\nvalue for average shales ranges from70 to75 (Nesbitt andYoung, 1982). In the Um Sohryngkew section, CIA, PIA and CIW yield similar trends with relatively constant values (60) during the upper Maastrichtian, followed by a gradual increase (70–80) in the uppermost Maastrichtian (13.5–14.26 m, Fig. 8).

Na/K and K/(Fe+Mg) ratios reveal the balancebetweendetrital andvolcanogenic input and are interpreted to reflect the increase or decrease of riverine siliciclastic flux relative to background volcanic input (Sageman and Lyons, 2003). In Meghalaya, Na/K ratio showsmostly steady low values in the upper Maastrichtian, a gradual increase prior to the KTB, and constant higher values in the lower Danian, whereas K/(Fe+Mg) ratio\nshows the opposite trend (Fig. 8).

However, in the Um Sohryngkew section, these ratios show opposite trends that render the use of these ratios invalid as geochemical proxies for subaerial Deccan volcanism in marine sediments (Fig. 8). This indicates that Meghalaya was not part of the drainage domain of the Deccan volcanic province (Dessert et al., 2003)."

The Al/(Al+Fe+Mn) ratios show a negative peak that is linked to the presence of goethite at the KTB, and not related to a potential hydrothermal influence. These trends are corroborated by single elements, which record constant values in the Maastrichtian and Danian, but peak only in Pb and Zn at the KTB (Fig. 6)."

The Ni/Cu ratio has been used as extraterrestrial proxy due to the similar Cu contents in chondrite and continental crust, and also because of the large concentrations of Ni (10,624 ppm) present in C1-chondrite in comparison to continental crust (47 ppm) (Munsel et al., 2011). In the Um Sohryngkew section, Ni/Cu ratios peak at the KTB (213.5) and suggest an extraterrestrial source, but are constant during the upper Maastrichtian (2) and lower Danian (4). A slight difference between Maastrichtian and Danian Ni/Cu ratios likely results from lower oxygen conditions in the early Danian, rather than from increased input of extraterrestrial dust because neither element is enriched relative to average shale (Fig. 7B). PGEs, including Ir, Pd, Pt, Ru and Rh, are common proxies used to detect extraterrestrial impact(s) due to their rare occurrence on Earth (Wedepohl, 1991, 1995). In the Um Sohryngkew section, a marked peak in all PGEs occurs at the KTB, but no significant enrichment in PGEs is recorded during the late Maastrichtian and early Danian (Fig. 3)."

Strong weathering indices indicate intense chemical weathering in nearby continental areas of the Um Sohryngkew section and are likely due to acid rains resulting from SO2 emissions from Deccan volcanism (Self et al., 2006). The acidic waters lead to super-stress conditions in the Meghalaya area inhibiting CaCO3, production, which favored blooms of the small thin-shelled surface dwellers Guembelitria blooms and explains the intermittent strong dissolution of planktic foraminiferal assemblages (Fig. 9A, B). Similar Guembelitria blooms indicating highstress conditions are observed in the latest Maastrichtian and early Danian throughout the Tethys and into the South Atlantic (e.g., Egypt, Israel, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Texas, Argentina) (Abramovich and Keller, 2002; Adatte et al., 2002; Keller, 2002; Keller et al., 2007)."

High calcite content generally indicates deeper environments, diminished erosion and low continental runoff, whereas high detritus input suggests shallower environments and high continental runoff.\nIn Meghalaya, detrital minerals in bulk-rock assemblages are dominant and calcite is low but fluctuating in the upper Maastrichtian marls and shale, which suggests deposition in a shallow water environment (b100 m depth) with high terrigenous influx. For example, the thin sand layer at 13.3 m (0.66 m below the KT boundary) coincides with a marked decrease in species richness of planktic foraminifera and the absence of deeper dwelling species, which indicates a drop in sea level to inner neritic depth (Fig. 3A). Enhanced carbonate dissolution between this sandstone layer and the KTB may be due to the sandy, shallow water environment and/or acid rain linked to the main phase of Deccan volcanism in C29r (Chenet et al., 2007). Above the sandstone layer, sea level gradually increased and reached a maximum at the KTB clay layer. Similar sea-level changes have been observed in KTB sections from Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Texas, and Mexico (Adatte et al., 2002; Keller et al., 2003, 2007).\nAcross the KT transition and in the lower Danian high detrital input continues into a relatively shallow though deepening marine environment. The sandstone layer marks a small sea level drop and possibly short hiatus, as indicated by the abrupt increase in Danian species coincidentwith the P1a(1)/P1a(2) subzone boundary (Fig. 3). A hiatus at this interval has been documented from many lower Danian sequences (Keller et al., 2003). A deepening and more open marine environments dominated by carbonate sedimentation prevailed during the lower Danian (Figs. 3 and 4)."

    "heading": "9.3. Climate proxies: clay and bulk-rock mineralogy",
    "text": "Clayminerals are byproducts resulting from the interplay between climate, continental morphology, tectonic activity and sea-level variations, and therefore can be used as climatic and environmental proxies (Chamley, 1989). In the Um Sohryngkew section, clay assemblages are dominated by kaolinite, which is formed in tropical soils under constant warm and humid conditions, and illite, which is a byproduct of tectonic uplift and physical weathering (Chamley, 1989; Robert and Chamley, 1990). Illite is poorly crystallized, which\nindicates significant chemical weathering caused by hydrolysis. Illite/Smectite (I/S) mixed layers are poorly ordered (R=0) and contain 25–50% of expandable layers. Smectite is a “smectoid”, an I/S mixed layers with around 80–90% of expandable layers. High I/S mixed layers and low smectite contents suggest a diagenetic overprint linked to high burial depths (N3 km, Reimann, 1993) that resulted in the transformation of smectite into I/S mixed layers (Chamley, 1989). Smectites and I/S mixed layer are therefore not reliable paleoclimatic proxies.\nThe paleoclimate of Meghalaya is characterized by predominantly humid conditions and strong chemical weathering, as indicated by high kaolinite, poorly crystallized illite and high kaolinite/illite ratios (Fig. 4). The dominant detrital minerals (Fig. 6), high weathering indices and palynological data (Nandi, 1990) support this general pattern (Fig. 8). All of these indices suggest that predominant chemical weathering in combination with physical weathering under humid conditions prevailed across the KTB in near-shore environments of Meghalaya.\nHigh kaolinite and poorly crystallized illite contents linked to increasingly humid conditions across the KTB transition are not restricted to Meghalaya but are encountered worldwide from low to middle latitudes, except in areas close to India (Abramovich et al., 2002; Adatte et al., 2002, 2005; Keller et al., 1998; Madhavaraju et al., 2002; Pardo et al., 1999; Robert and Chamley, 1990). Terrestrial and marine sections from central and eastern India close to the DVP show dramatically different compositions of clay mineral assemblages with high smectite and absent kaolinite, which reveals predominantly arid to semi-arid conditions with seasonal wet and dry cycles (Keller et al., 2008, 2009c).\nMost studies relate the global increase in kaolinite and poorly crystallized illite input into the oceans to the short warm event of the latest Maastrichtian (zone CF1), which generated wetter conditions, more rainfall and intensified continental runoff probably linked to Deccan volcanism and its gas emissions (see reference above). Local aridity close to the DVP is interpreted as a result of “mock aridity” (e.g. volcanically induced xeric conditions and extreme geochemical alkalinity in the context of a regionally more humid climate) induced by Deccan volcanism (Harris and Van Couvering, 1995; Khadkikar et al., 1999). In this context, paleoclimatic information gathered from the Um Sohryngkew section reveals that the “mock aridity” zone caused by Deccan volcanism across the KTB transition is restricted to the Deccan volcanic province with gradually decreasing intensities from central India to the rim of the DVP (Fig. 9A, B)."

    "heading": "9.4. KTB red layer geochemistry and potential origins",
    "text": "On a global basis, the KTB red clay layer shows peak concentrations in PGEs (Ir, Rh, Ru, Pd, Pt) accompanied by enrichments in several major (Fe, P) and trace (As, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Sb, Sc, Th, U, V, Zn) elements, which are all postulated to originate from a single extraterrestrial impact based mainly on the Ir and siderophile elements (e.g. Co, Ni) (Alvarez et al., 1980; Bhandari et al., 1993, 1994; Joyce Evans et al., 1993; Martinez-Ruiz et al., 2006). In the Um Sohryngkew section, the KTB red layer has high silt content (Fig. 4) with peak concentrations in major, trace and platinum group elements, except for Cu (Figs. 3, 5, 6). Maximum values in PGEs, specific TEs (e.g. Cr) and the Ni/Cu ratio suggest an extraterrestrial origin (Figs. 5, 6, 8; Table 1), as previously observed by Bhandari et al. (1993, 1994). Normalized PGEs relative to chondrite, which are commonly used to identify extraterrestrial signals at the KTB, show a fairly flat line but all values fall in the “extraterrestrial origin” field defined by Kramar et al. (2001) and are similar to values of the KTB red clay layer at Stevns Klint, Denmark (Fig. 7C). Based on the observations that the Chicxulub impact predates the KTB (Keller et al., 2003, 2007, 2009a), the Ir and PGE anomalies at the KTB in Meghalaya and worldwide is likely from another large impact for which no impact crater is known to date.\nNevertheless, the impact hypothesis can only partly account for the PGE and TE enrichments at the KTB. Based on major and trace element concentrations of chondrite, an extraterrestrial impact cannot explain the peaks in As, Pb, U, and V, or the low Mn concentrations observed in the KTB red layer at Um Sohryngkew (Table 1). Enrichment factors based on average chondrite composition (EFchondrite=(X/Fe)/(X/Fe)chondrite, where X is a specific major, trace or platinum group element), are very low for most trace elements (Cr, Ni) and high for P (Fig. 8C), which does not support an extraterrestrial origin. Thus, elemental enrichments in the KTB red clay layer clearly show that an extraterrestrial impact alone cannot be the sole source of this geochemical signature.\nSeveral studies have proposed intense phase-2 Deccan Trap volcanism as alternative cause for the KTB mass extinction and as alternative source for the trace and platinum group element enrichments in the KTB red layer (Courtillot et al., 1986; MacLean, 1985; Toutain and Meyer, 1989; Zoller et al., 1983). In Meghalaya, the volcanic proxies used in this study to investigate the volcanic influence in the KTB show no causal link (Fig. 8, Table 1), though single element concentrations cannot rule out volcanism as direct (e.g. triggered by a sudden eruption) or indirect (e.g. intense basalt weathering) source, as hypothesized by Bhandari et al. (1993, 1994). At Um Sohryngkew, normalized PGEs relative to continental flood basalts show high and fluctuating values for the KTB red clay layer, but these results do not correlate with normalized PGEs for the KTB at Stevns Klint and Caravaca (Fig. 7D). These contrasting results suggest that further investigations are needed to evaluate the influence of Deccan volcanism on the KTB geochemistry.\nHydrothermal activity is a frequently overlooked or underestimated factor in KTB enrichments, and its proxy (Al/[Al+Mn+Fe]) indicates a significant influence in the KTB red layer (Fig. 8). However, several problems remain: 1) Neither hydrothermal activity nor submarine volcanism is known to be prevalent at the KTB and Deccan volcanism was predominantly continental with limited interaction with marine environments (Keller et al., 2008; Self et al., 2008). 2) Environmental perturbations, such as lower seawater pH and acids rains, due to lava–seawater interaction could be locally restricted (Edmonds and Gerlach, 2006). And 3) sediments affected by hydrothermal activity are generally enriched in both Fe and Mn (Chester, 2000), not only Fe as in the Um Sohryngkew section (Fig. 5).\nIn the Um Sohryngkew section, goethite (FeO(OH)) is the main mineral in the KTB layer and results from late diagenetic alteration of pyrite after deposition, as observed globally (e.g. Elles, Tunisia), except for rare localities, where a hematite-rich layer occurs at the KTB (Adatte et al., 2005; Pardo et al., 1999). Very high enrichments in some TEs (As, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni), high Fe contents, and highly significant correlation rate (R2=0.8–1) of As, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, U, V and Zn with Fe (Table B, see supplementary material) support the primary precipitation of pyrite under sulfidic redox conditions in the KTB red layer during deposition and compaction of sediments (Gavrilov, 2010; Pujol et al., 2006; Schmitz, 1985, 1992). However, enrichment factors of the redox-sensitive proxies U and V are not high enough to confirm sulfidic conditions (Fig. 7; Algeo andMaynard, 2004; Brumsack, 2006; Tribovillard et al., 2006). Although present-day weathering may have partly leached redox-sensitive trace elements, environmental conditions are not drastically reducing, but only dysoxic, by the time of the deposition of the red clay layer to trap abundant Fe, S andmost pyritelinked TEs at or below the sediment–water interface.\nReduced sedimentation rates across the KTB, which are known to concentrate MEs, TEs and PGEs (Bruns et al., 1997; Donovan et al., 1988), are likely significant factors in the KTB geochemistry, as observed by extremely large PGE and P concentrations in Meghalaya. These results suggest a strongly condensed sedimentation in the KTB red layer linked to a rapid sea-level rise culminating in the maximum flooding surface globally observed at or near the KTB (Fig. 3; Adatte et al., 2002, 2005; Donovan et al., 1988)."

    "heading": "9.5. Depositional scenario across the KT boundary",
    "text": "During the late Maastichtian C29r (zone CF1) Deccan volcanism reached its maximum (phase-2) accumulating 80% of the entire 3500 m thick Deccan lava pile with some mega-flows spanning over 1500 km across India and out into the Bay of Bengal (Chenet et al., 2007, 2008; Keller et al., 2008; Self et al., 2008). Volcanic phase-2 ended at or near the KT mass extinction as evident from planktic foraminifera in intertrappean sediments in deep wells of the KrishnaGodavari Basin (Keller et al., 2011), as well as shallow sequences from Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh and Central India (Jhilmili, Madhya Pradesh, Keller et al., 2008, 2009b,c).\nIn Meghalaya to the northeast, the late Maastrichtian at the Um Sohryngkew section was deposited in a shallow near-shore sea (b100 m) about 800–1000 km from the Deccan volcanic province. In this coastal area of India, climate change due to Deccan volcanism resulted in humid conditions that contrasted with the semi-arid conditions and “mock aridity” that dominated the center of the Indian continent (Fig. 9A, B). Abundant precipitation, high continental runoff and high weathering resulted in a major influx of detritus (quartz, K-Feldspars, plagioclases), which led to increasingly turbid and mesotrophic waters. These high-stress environmental conditions were amplified by periodic acid rains associated with Deccan pulses, which increased chemical weathering (Fig. 9A, B) and led to the exclusion of most planktic foraminifera and blooms of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria. Similar Guembelitria blooms correlate with the main phase-2 of Deccan volcanism in C29r below the KTB in shallow water sequences worldwide (Keller and Abramovich, 2009; Pardo and Keller, 2008).\nPrior to the KTB mass extinction increasing volcanic intensity and SO2 release led to acid rains that raised the pH of seawater and inhibited or reduced carbonate precipitation and production leading to the early disappearance of many planktic foraminiferal species. Well prior to the KTB mass extinction these conditions favored the survival of small species leading to dwarfism, and particularly small thin-walled species that resulted in the observedGuembelitria blooms. In the Um Sohryngkew section, the mass extinction coincides with a silty red layer, a major Ir anomaly and the negative δ13C shift that marks the productivity crash due to the mass extinction. Danian species evolved shortly thereafter as also observed globally (Figs. 3, 9A, B).\nAt the KTB red layer, the origin of PGEs and trace element enrichments (e.g., As, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, U and Zn, Figs. 3, 5 and 6) indicate an extraterrestrial source from a second major impact postdating Chicxulub (Keller et al., 2003, 2007, 2009a), but not as sole origin. Other enrichment processes, including fluctuating redox conditions and condensed sedimentation likely contributed to the KTB geochemical signature. During the early Danian marine productivity gradually recovered (upper part of zone P1a) and diversity slightly increased, but species remained very small, indicating continued high-stress conditions (Fig. 3). In NE India humid conditions and abundant precipitation lead to steady detrital input into the ocean, whereas on the Indian continent semi-arid to arid (“mock aridity”) conditions prevailed (Fig. 9A)."

An extraterrestial origin is supported in part, but condensed sedimentation, fluctuating redox conditions at the time of deposition, and secondary redox fluctuations likely account for the relatively high enrichments observed at Um Sohryngkew.\nSupplementarymaterials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2011.08.015."
