Changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry, particularly the climate-sensitive carbon and sulphur cycles, are among the most probable processes for inducing global environmental stress. However, the interactions and feedbacks between volcanism and these cycles are numerous and complex, making the characterisation of the response to a LIP challenging. Here we summarise the sources and sinks of carbon and sulphur from large scale volcanism and magmatism using information frommodern and ancient systems. For the sources, we review the current understanding of volcanic emissions, and explore the relative contributions and importance of magma-derived degassing versus volatile release from sediments affected by igneous intrusions and lava. In addition, we explore the various ways in which LIPs can reduce atmospheric concentrations of these same elements. The relative influences of each source and sink are in part determined by the mode of LIP emplacement and eruption style, along with the subsequent timescales of such effects. We focus on a few key examples, including the Siberian Traps, the Paraná-Etendeka, and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), to demonstrate how the environmental impact can vary considerably with differing modes of emplacement, LIP duration, and eruption styles. In particular, we show that the host rocks can have a dominant role as a source or sink of emissions, depending on the lithologies affected by the LIP emplacement.\n© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "There have been periods during Earth’s history when huge volumes of magma have been produced and erupted over a wide area in a short period of time, driven by large mantle-derived thermal and material fluxes into the shallow crust. Such events are termed Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) and their occurrence appears independent of regional plate tectonics prior to emplacement (e.g. Coffin and Eldholm, 1994). LIPs are characterised by pulses of activity during a short timeframe (104–106 years) that erupt the bulk of the total LIP volume (e.g. Bryan et al., 2002, 2010; Knight et al., 2004; Chenet et al., 2007). Their present day geographical extents can exceed 105 km2 and reconstructed maximum extents could have exceeded 107 km2 (e.g. McHone, 2003; Bryan and Ernst, 2008). The emplacement style and surface expression of a LIP can vary considerably, based primarily on the lithosphere present above the risingmagma (e.g. Jerram et al., 2016). In continental settings, LIPs form flood basalt provinces (Jerram and Widdowson,\n2005) coupled with sizeable intrusive complexes (e.g. Svensen et al., 2004; Polteau et al., 2008) that can be intricately linked with volcanic passive margins (Planke et al., 2000). In marine settings, they form oceanic plateaus, marine basin flood basalts and hyaloclastites, seamount groups, and submarine ridges (e.g. Neal et al., 1997; Greene et al., 2008). There have been numerous LIPs throughout the Phanerozoic and likely the Proterozoic and Archean as well, with many examples partially exposed at the Earth’s surface (Fig. 1).\nA correlation exists between LIPs, extinction events, and rapid climate change during Earth’s history (Fig. 2), suggesting that large scale volcanism can have a detrimental impact on conditions suitable for life (e.g. Stothers, 1993; Courtillot, 1999; Wignall, 2001; Bond and Wignall, 2014). Specifically, alterations to the climate-sensitive carbon and sulphur cycles are among the most probable causes of ecosystem stress. The interactions and feedbacks between volcanism and these cycles are numerous and complex, making it difficult to characterise the climatic response to each LIP emplacement. Here we review the potential sources and sinks of carbon and sulphur from LIPs. We explore the current scientific understanding of volcanic emissions, and consider the relative importance of mantle-derived degassing versus degassing from sediments heated or incorporated by igneous intrusions and\nlava. In addition, we consider the various ways in which the emplacement of LIPs can sequester these same elements. The relative contributions of each source and sink are in part determined by the mode of LIP emplacement, the host lithologies of intruded and extruded material and eruption style, alongwith the subsequent timescales of such effects. Therefore, we explore how the environmental impact can vary considerably depending on these variables."

    "heading": "1.1. The emplacement of a LIP",
    "text": "Large igneous provinces can be broadly grouped into volcanic and sub-volcanic domains. Volcanic domains include volcanoes, lava flows, and ashes from eruptions, while sub-volcanic domains comprise plutons, sills, and dikes emplaced in sedimentary basins or other shallow parts of the crust (e.g. Jerram and Bryan, 2015). Chemically, LIPs can bemade up of predominantly mafic, mixed mafic and silicic, or primarily silicic material, depending in part on the geotectonic setting and the\nprevalence of partial melting of surrounding material (Bryan et al., 2002; Bryan, 2007). Mafic-dominated LIPs are themore common variety found (e.g. Jerram, 2002), especiallywhen emplaced into ocean crust. In continental settings LIPs can be predominantly mafic, but have varying proportions of a silicic component in their melt generations, reflecting the variety of inclusion and melting of crustal material, remelting of underplatedmaterial, and fractional crystallisationprocesses. In rare occurrences this silicic component comprises a substantial fraction of the total melt generated (N104 km3), particularly during the peak and final stages of flood volcanism (Peate, 1997; Marsh et al., 2001; Jerram and Widdowson, 2005; Ukstins Peate et al., 2005). Instances where the LIP is predominantly silicic have been termed ‘silicic large igneous provinces’ (SLIPs; e.g. Bryan et al., 2002).\nThe most common volcanic product is mixed volumes and styles of tholeiitic basalts. These form compound-braided, tabular-sheet flows, or hyaloclastites, in the order of 1 to 1000’s km3 in volume (Jerram, 2002; Bryan et al., 2010). In subaerial settings the larger sheet flows\nring the Phanerozoic. Row (A) shows magnetic polarity (Eide and Torsvik, 1996; Gee and ron.

The predominant style of eruption for these large mafic units is effusive fire fountaining that feeds extensive lateral pahoehoe lavas with peak effusion rates in excess of 4000 m3s−1 and sustained eruption lifetimes of tens of years (e.g. Self et al., 1997; Thordarson and Self, 1998). For comparison, the fissure eruption that began at Holuhraun, central Iceland, in August 2014 had initial lava effusion rates of 100–150m3s−1, covering ~75 km2 in the first 3months of the eruption (Gislason et al., 2015). LIPs can also include volcaniclastic deposits frombothmafic and silicicmelts.Mafic explosive activity is often found at the onset or during the early stages of LIP emplacement, due to higher volatile concentrations and shallow water-rock interactions. Although their occurrence is less well reported (e.g. Ross et al., 2003), more examples of mafic volcaniclastic and pyroclastic deposits are being found in several LIPs worldwide. For example, mafic ash layers have been observed in Emeishan (Ukstins Peate and Bryan, 2008; Sun et al., 2010), Karoo-Ferrar (McClintock et al., 2008), and the North Atlantic (Jerram et al., 2009) igneous provinces. Silicic melts are typified by explosive volcanism, leading to widespread dispersal of tephra. Phreatomagmatic eruptions can also produce more localised deposits. Given the poor preservation potential of volcanic tuffs, and indeed poor exposure at the basal parts of many LIPs, the prevalence of explosive activity during many LIP formations remains unclear and possibly underestimated (Bryan et al., 2002; Ross et al., 2003; Jerram et al., 2016).\nThe sub-volcanic intrusive components of continental LIPs are volumetrically important, as evidenced by the extent of outcrops of sills and dykes now exposed in LIPs such as the Siberian Traps. In provinces such as the Paraná-Etendeka, Karoo-Ferrar, the North Atlantic igneous province (NAIP), the Siberian Traps, and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP),many of these intrusions are emplaced into large sedimentary basins (Fig. 1). This allows considerable interaction between magma and the surrounding host rocks, which has important implications for the potential effects of contact metamorphism (e.g. Planke et al., 2005). In the Karoo Basin, sills are estimated to comprise 15–30% of the basin stratigraphy (Svensen et al., in press) with a total volume of ~270,000 km3. In the Siberian Traps, sills intruded into the ~12 km thick Tunguska Basin are calculated to have a volume in excess of 700,000 km3, where individual sills may reach N3000 km3 (Vasil’ev, 1999). The large scale emplacement of sills led to contact metamorphism and de-volatilization of host sedimentary rocks, where the contact aureole volume is typically double the sill volume (Svensen et al., 2007; Aarnes et al., 2010, 2011). Moreover, sedimentary rocks may have contaminated the ascendingmagmas, leading to increased volatile loads in degassing lavas (e.g. Ripley et al., 2003; Starostin and Sorokhtin, 2011; Black et al., 2012)."

    "text": "The evolution and diversification of life on Earth has been punctuated with mass extinctions in both populations and species of biota (Fig. 2). The largest extinction events havewiped out N50%of total global species (Sepkoski, 1996). The causes of mass extinctions have been a hotly debated topic for several decades,with one of themost commonly cited causes being the emplacement of LIPs (e.g. Stothers, 1993; Wignall, 2001). There is a strong temporal correlation between the formation times of LIPs and extinction events for four of the five largest extinction events and every minor crisis since the Permian (Stothers, 1993; Courtillot, 1999; Wignall, 2001). It is important to note that not all LIPs are accompanied by mass extinction events and vice versa (Fig. 2), particularly for oceanic plateau volcanism (Bond and Wignall, 2014). However, there is evidence for marine anoxic events associated with marine basalt emplacement (Sinton and Duncan, 1997; Kerr, 1998). The largest known extinction event is the end-Permian crisis, where over 90% of marine species were wiped out and severe devastation occurred to terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. Erwin, 1994; Retallack,\n1995). The emplacement of the Siberian Traps is believed to be the key player in the crisis, both in the oceans and on the continents, likely due to a combination of rapid global warming, reduced pH andO2 in the oceans, and ozone depletion followed by high UV-B stress (Bond and Wignall, 2014; and references therein).\nThe geological record also shows that there have been abrupt changes in atmospheric chemistry throughout Earth’s history (Eldholm and Thomas, 1993; Milkov, 2004; Kemp et al., 2005; Lourens et al., 2005). There are pronounced negative carbon isotope excursions in marine and terrestrial sedimentary rocks that correlate strongly with mass extinctions and LIP emplacements (e.g. Bond and Wignall, 2014; Table 1). Such events suggest a rapid destabilisation of the carbon cycle, primarily through the release of vast amount of isotopically light 12C to the shallow ocean–atmosphere–biosphere system that triggers global warming. The source(s) can be magmatic degassing, release from contact metamorphism, and/or some positive feedback mechanismsuch as thedissociation ofmarinemethanehydrates. Themore depleted the source is in 13C, the less total carbon is needed to affect the global surface δ13C signal. For example, methane hydrates are typified by δ13C values of−60‰ (e.g. Kvenvolden, 2002), while historic volcanic emissions are closer to −5‰ (e.g. Dunkley-Jones et al., 2010). The surficial carbon cycle, dominated by marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), has δ13C values around 0.4 to 2‰, whereas thermogenicmethane from contact metamorphism has δ13C values around −35 to −25‰ (e.g. Dunkley-Jones et al., 2010). Therefore, the volume of volcanically derived C needs to be an order of magnitude greater than from heated sedimentary rocks or gas hydrates to cause the same excursion in surficial δ13C values.\nThe climatic response to LIP volcanism appears to be varied, with a lack of correlation between lava extrusion volume and extinction magnitude (Wignall, 2001; Courtillot and Renne, 2003; Bond et al., 2010a). Moreover, the scale of carbon isotope excursions does not showa strong correlationwith the size ofmass extinctions (Table 1). Numerousmechanisms have been suggested for inducing ecosystem stress, including marine anoxia and/or acidification, toxic metal poisoning of aqueous systems, global warming, and depletion of atmospheric oxygen and ozone (Benton and Twitchett, 2003; Visscher et al., 2004; Racki and Wignall, 2005; Wignall, 2007; Svensen et al., 2009; Sanei et al., 2012; Black et al., 2014a). The subsequent impact of an LIP emplacement is also critically dependent on the country rocks affected by contact metamorphism. The two largest mass extinction events, the end-Permian and Triassic-Jurassic, are temporally linked to the major intrusions of sills into evaporite-rich sedimentary basins in Siberia (Siberian Traps) and in Brazil (CAMP), respectively. This has led to the hypothesis that evaporite heating can be a significant factor for ecosystem crises (Svensen et al., 2009). Other affected sedimentary basins are characterized by a dominance of clastic sediments such as the Karoo in South Africa., often with carbon-rich shales. The difference in climate impact between LIPs is likely due to variations in eruption durations, recurrence times, volume, chemistry, the composition of the intruded sedimentary rocks, susceptibility of global ecosystems to stress, and the background composition of the atmosphere and oceans."

    "heading": "2. General overview of volcanic gases",
    "text": "The main emitted volcanic gases from eruptions are H2O, CO2, and SO2. Minor species include highly poisonous gases and acids such as HF and HCl, which can be substantial in basaltic eruptions (e.g. Giggenbach, 1996). Remobilisation of acids can cause considerable damage to affected ecosystems, particularly those with a low turnover rate, such as ponds, lakes, and soils (e.g. Frogner-Kockum et al., 2006). Each volcanic gas species has a different behaviour, dispersal, and atmospheric residence time. Here we summarise the emissions and consequences of the three main gas species H2O, SO2, and CO2 in turn."

    "heading": "2.1. H2O",
    "text": "AlthoughH2O is a potent greenhouse gas, volcanic emissions areminiscule in comparison to the volumes of surface reservoirs. Approximately 97% of the Earth’s water (~1.4 × 1024 g) is held in the oceans. Residence times of degassed H2O in surface reservoirs are therefore governed by the established hydrological cycle. The negligible increase in concentrations, coupled with the short atmospheric residence time, means water vapour can only act as a positive feedback mechanism to atmospheric warming (and vice versa) from other sources. However, H2O added to the stratospheremay be important for the residence time of volcanogenic sulphur, and tropospheric sulphur can influence the regional hydrological cycle (Yuan et al., 2011), which is discussed below."
  }, {
    "heading": "2.2. SO2",
    "text": "The sulphur cycle is integral to biological activity, weathering, mineralisation and a host of other surface processes. The lithosphere is the greatest reservoir, containing around 2 × 1023 g of sulphur (Fig. 3).\nThe oceans and marine sediments are also considerable surface reservoirs. In contrast, the atmospheric sulphur reservoir is considerably smaller, principally because gaseous species are unstable and are precipitated out relatively rapidly. The principal atmospheric sources are from sea spray and from volcanic degassing, with terrestrial release from land biota, soils, and fires comprising the rest of the dominant inputs (Fig. 3). Combined, these sources outweigh the total atmospheric reservoir by a factor of 5–12, giving an average atmospheric residence time of ~1–2 months. The return avenue is dominantly through precipitation of sulphate aerosol particles, which then become reincorporated into the biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere to complete the cycle.\nVolcanically derived SO2 and H2S are the dominant atmospheric source for sulphur species. Hydrogen sulphide quickly oxidises to SO2, with further reactions with H2O over hours to weeks leading to the formation of H2SO4, sulphuric acid aerosol (Fig. 4). Tropospheric sulphate aerosols have an atmospheric lifetime of a couple of weeks due to the rapid incorporation into the hydrological cycle (Robock, 2000; Stevenson et al., 2003). However, if the intensity of an eruption allows for injection above the tropopause, the lifetimes of aerosols are considerably extended due to the lack of removal by precipitation.\nharlson et al. (1992), Farquhar et al. (2002), and Van Loon and Duffy (2011). The volcanic ler et al. (2002). Other atmospheric fluxes are taken fromPenner et al. (2001). DMS stands\nStratospheric residence times are instead governed by gravitational sedimentation, which takes between 1 to 3 years for historic eruptions (Robock, 2000). Modelling suggests that larger eruptionswould not significantly increase atmospheric residence times (e.g. Pinto et al., 1989). Sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere have a large effect on the radiation budget, either by direct or indirectmeans. The direct forcing is by H2SO4 particles that have a typical radius of ~0.5 μm, comparable to the peak wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum from the Sun. Sulphate aerosol particles have a single-scatter albedo of ~1, strongly scattering shortwave radiation (Andronova et al., 1999). Incoming radiation is both forward scattered and back scattered, leading to an increase in downward diffuse radiation and a decrease in direct radiation (Fig. 4). The net result is an increase in the planetary albedo and reduction of shortwave radiation reaching the surface, resulting in a net surface cooling during the day (Harshvardhan, 1979). This phenomenon is known as a “Volcanic Winter” (Rampino et al., 1988). A contemporaneous effect is that H2SO4 particles also partially absorb longwave radiation, meaning it acts as a greenhouse gas for radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface. This leads to heating of the surrounding atmosphere, particularly in the tropicswhere the insolation from the Sun is highest. If the sulphur cloud reaches the stratosphere, the increase in latitudinal temperature gradient can strengthen the polar vortex (Robock, 2000, 2002), affecting the positions and strengths of jet streams (Jones et al., 2005; Driscoll et al., 2012) and altering processes such as the latent heat transfer between the oceans and the atmosphere.\nThe indirect forcing of sulphate aerosols in the troposphere is caused by their contribution to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and therefore the cloud droplet number concentrations and the albedo of clouds (Twomey, 1977; Albrecht, 1989; Fig. 4). The minimum nucleus size for H2O condensation to occur is ~0.1 μm, and nuclei include dust, salt, and aerosol particles from a variety of sources. There have been numerous observations that demonstrate a clear regional impact of volcanic degassing on the micro-physical properties of clouds (Tu et al., 2004; Gassó, 2008; Boulon et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2011), potentially having a substantial effect on the regional hydrological cycle (Schmidt et al., 2012). Low level clouds play amajor role in the Earth’s radiation budget (e.g. Klein and Hartmann, 1993), so indirect forcing of tropospheric sulphate aerosols could be considerable (e.g. Gettelman et al., 2015). Historical observations suggest that volcanogenic cloud condensation can cause a shortwave radiative forcing up to −20 W m−2 (Yuan et al., 2011). The climatic impacts of clouds are notoriously difficult to constrain as there is a balance between radiative albedo cooling and greenhouse retention of IR radiation, with the former dominant for lowaltitude clouds and the latter dominant for higher altitude clouds (Fig. 4). Therefore, the climate impacts of tropospheric sulphate aerosols\nis poorly constrained and likely to be subject to considerable changes from modest perturbations to the fluxes of sulphur from a large eruption, the pre-existing aerosol budget of the atmosphere, and the altitudes at which clouds are seeded from volcanogenic CCN (e.g. Schmidt et al., 2010; 2012). Until further research is conducted, the role of CCN as a volcanic forcing must be considered speculative."

    "heading": "2.3. CO2",
    "text": "The carbon cycle has received a great deal of attention as it is an integral component of all biological activity and the radiative properties of the atmosphere. Unlike sulphur, carbon is present in considerable quantities in all of the surface reservoirs, with the fluxes between each reservoir being varied, voluminous, and complex. It is common to conceptualise the global carbon cycle as two distinct domains, a fast domain and a slowdomain. The fast carbon cycle consists of the active reservoirs at the surface, including the atmosphere, ocean, freshwaters, the biosphere, and terrestrial and marine sediments (Berner and Caldeira, 1997). The fluxes between reservoirs are extensive and rapid, leading to residence times ranging from a few years for the atmosphere to decadal to millennial scales for terrestrial and oceanic realms (Fig. 5). The slow domain of the carbon cycle is comprised of the enormous carbon reservoirs in rocks and sediments. The main sources are chemical weathering, erosion, and volcanic emissions, while the dominant sink is the burial and gradual incorporation into sedimentary rocks (Sundquist, 1986; Berner, 1992). Thefluxes in and out of the lithosphere are several orders of magnitude smaller than the fast cycle fluxes (Fig. 5), meaning that changes to the fluxes from the slow domain typically affect the fast carbon domain over thousands to millions of years. The exception is when a slow source undergoes a huge increase in carbon release, such as rapid thawing of permafrost and marine methane hydrates, or the current anthropogenic release from fossil fuel reservoirs. Throughout the Earth’s history thesefluxes and reservoir volumes have varied due to changes in global climate and vice versa. The fast carbon cycle has remained in relatively steady state throughout the Holocene (Pongratz et al., 2009), but isotopic evidence suggests that the atmosphere and oceans have experienced rapid changes at certain points during Earth’s history.\nThe two dominant compounds of carbon in the atmosphere are carbon dioxide (CO2) andmethane (CH4), both of which act as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Methane has the stronger greenhouse effect but has a shorter lifetime due to rapid oxidisation to form CO2. Consequently, the ratio between CO2 and CH4 is ~76:1 (mol C) in today’s atmosphere. Increases in CO2 and CH4 concentrations lead to amplified warming of the atmosphere, with the enhanced capacity of heated air\nto hold H2O vapour acting as a positive feedback mechanism to warming. Several units have been used to denote volumes and fluxes in the scientific literature. In particular, there are instances where the mass of C is used and others where CO2 is used. Carbon (12.011 g mol−1) and two oxygen (15.999 g mol−1) atoms combine to the total mass of CO2, such that one tonne of C equals 3.664 tonnes of CO2 and 1.336 tonnes of CH4. Here we standardise each value to either Mt (1012 g) C or Gt (1015 g; 1 Pg) C. Historic volcanic emissions worldwide are calculated to be in the order of 35–120 Mt(C) a−1\n(Gerlach, 2011; Fig. 5). Along with weathering processes, this flux is the most important carbon source from the slow domain. However, given the small size of the flux in comparison to the fast domain, it would take an increase in flux of several orders of magnitude over several hundred years to alter the surficial carbon cycle. For comparison, this historic volcanic flux is around 100 times smaller than the current anthropogenic CO2 flux (8.9 ± 1.4 Gt(C) a−1; IPCC, 2013)."

    "heading": "3. LIP gas emissions",
    "text": "Predicting gas emissions from LIPs is difficult, as there are large uncertainties in the chemistry, volume, and timescales of degassing. The chemistry of released gases can be extremely diverse and from a variety of sources. With the exception of CO2, volatiles tend to increase with higher silicamagmas, and alkali melts are richer in volatiles than tholeiiticmelts (Schminke, 2004). Speciation of gases also varies considerably between magmas, with H2O comprising 37–97 wt% of the total gases emitted (Symonds et al., 1994). Water-rich volatiles are most common for rhyolitic and subduction zone magmas. Conversely, C, S, F, and Cl species form a greater fraction of basaltic volatiles, although not necessarily an increase in the total weight percentage of a melt. Carbon dioxide typically comprises 1–50wt% of emitted volcanic gases fromhistoric eruptions, while S species cover 0.5–30 wt% (Symonds et al., 1994; Schminke, 2004). Addition of volatiles from surrounding country rocks can provide significant additional gases (see Section 3.2). However, quantifying this secondary contribution relative to mantle volatiles and separating the two processes of incorporated material and thermogenic release is particularly difficult. Also there can be cryptic degassing of magmas that are involved in the LIP emplacement but never reached\nthe shallow crust (Sobolev et al., 2011; McKay et al., 2014). Below we consider the main LIP-related gas emissions in terms of sulphur and carbon and then consider the influence of the style of emplacement on gas emissions."

    "heading": "3.1. LIP SO2 emissions",
    "text": "Estimating the average volcanic degassing flux is complicated by the complexity of global monitoring and the sporadic nature of volcanic eruptions (e.g. Andres and Kasgnoc, 1998). For sulphur, this is particularly important given the importance of volcanic emissions as an atmospheric source of SO2 (Fig. 3). Themost commonmethods of estimating SO2 emissions are satellite measurements (e.g. Bluth et al., 1997) and petrological analysis of melt inclusions (Devine et al., 1984). Integrated monitoring and extrapolation for volcanism in the 20th century gives a global sulphur flux of 6.5–10.5 Mt(S) a−1, equal to 13–21 Mt(SO2) a−1 (Andres and Kasgnoc, 1998; Hamler et al., 2002; Fig. 3). Estimations of sulphur emission from eruptions that predate the advent of satellite measurements are reliant on petrological methods alone. For historic basaltic eruptions, the two methods of petrological analyses and satellite monitoring appear to correlate reasonably well (Sharma et al., 2004). Sulphur dioxide emissions are predicted to be high from LIP basalts (Palais and Sigurdsson, 1989; Sigurdsson, 1990). However, even the most recent LIP lavas are millions of years old. The combination of weathering and the lack of abundant phenocrystsmean that melt inclusions are sparse and likely altered from their original composition (Self et al., 2005). There are exceptions to this rule, such as the porphyritic Roza lava from the Columbia River flood basalt group. This ~1300 km3\npahoehoe lava is estimated to have released 6250 Mt(S) in as little as a decade (Thordarson and Self, 1996), approximately 4.8 Mt(S) per km3. This compares well with the eruption of Laki in Iceland during 1783–1784, where 60 Mt(S) was released from ~15 km3 of basaltic lava (Thordarson and Self, 1993, 2003), equivalent to 4 Mt(S) km−3\n(Table 2). For further comparison, the recent 2014–2015 eruption at Holuhraun from Bárðarbunga volcano emitted an estimated 5.3–5.9 Mt(S) from 1.6 ± 0.3 km3 of effusive lava (Gislason et al., 2015), corresponding to 3.3–3.7 Mt(S) km−3. Estimates for the total release of sulphur from the Siberian Traps, based on melt inclusions, range from\n6300 to N10,000 Gt(S) (Black et al., 2012, 2014b). Isotopic analyses suggest that the proportion of this magmatic sulphur originating from crustal material is around 10% (Black et al., 2014b). One of the sulphur sources in the Norilsk sulphide deposits is identified as incorporated anhydrite from Tunguska Basin evaporite deposits (Ripley et al., 2003). Thermogenic degassing from metamorphism is likely to increase the crustal derived component further (Table 2; Svensen et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2013).\nThe estimates of sulphur emissions from LIP volcanism are considerably higher than average fluxes from historic volcanism. If a lava 1000 km3 in volume was erupted in a decade, this would equate to a flux of 330–480 Mt(S) a−1 based on the estimates above. Even if an eruption of this sizewas erupted over a hundred years, the global volcanic S fluxwould be 4–7 times higher than 20th century levels (Fig. 3). As previously mentioned, SO2 residence times are on the order of weeks (tropospheric) to years (stratospheric), with only slight variations in atmospheric lifetimes with increased loading (Robock, 2000; Jones et al., 2005; Timmreck et al., 2010). The enhanced atmospheric loading caused by an eruption would dissipate within a decade of the cessation of volcanism. Therefore, the disturbance to the sulphur cycle follows a timeframe comparable to the duration of the degassing. Recurrence times of individual eruptions within a LIP emplacement do not permanently change atmospheric concentrations, as sulphur species in the atmosphere have very short residence times compared to the timescales of recurrences of LIP lavas. However, the timeframe between eruptions will be important for ecosystem recovery from the effects of a volcanic winter and acid rain deposition, as fragile ecosystems can take up to a few thousand years to recover from volcanic acid deposition (Kilian et al., 2006; Jones, 2015). Atmospheric modelling of Siberian Traps volcanism suggests that the LIP emplacement was accompanied by severe acid rain (Sephton et al., 2005; Black et al., 2014a), leading to regional ecosystem stress. The greatest environmental impact is achieved if volcanic eruptions are emitted to both the troposphere and stratosphere, due to the global transport and extended atmospheric residence times in combination with the effects of acid rain."

    "text": "Carbon dioxide is relatively insoluble in magmas and is not readily\nincorporated into primarymineral phases, meaning that CO2 exsolution begins to occur from relatively deep in the crust. This leads to efficient degassing from extrusive lavas, explosive eruptions, and shallow magmatic intrusions. As a result, residual abundances of CO2 in glass inclusions are rarely similar to the original melt composition (Wallace and Anderson, 2000). Basaltic lavas typically have CO2 concentrations in the order of 0.2–0.6 wt% (Leavitt, 1982; Caldeira and Rampino, 1990; Cervantes and Wallace, 2003). A simple calculation of 100% degassing of 0.5 wt% CO2 injects approximately 3.5 Mt(C) km−3 of magma (Self et al., 2005; Table 2). Therefore, an individual eruption 1000 km3\nin size with 100% degassing would add 3.5 Gt(C) to the atmosphere. If eruptions are protracted in duration then annualfluxes are considerably diminished. A decade-long eruption of this volume would result in a flux of 350 Mt(C) a−1. This is not a large increase on historic volcanic\nemissions of 35–120 Mt(C) a−1 (Gerlach, 2011; Fig. 5), and nowhere near the current anthropogenic emissions of 8.9 ± 1.4 Gt(C) a−1\n(IPCC, 2013). The extent of volatile release, the duration of an eruption, and the\nlength of hiatuses between eruptions are integral to any subsequent perturbation to the surficial ‘fast’ carbon cycle. Assuming a release of 3.5 Mt(C) per km3, ~170,000 km3 of lava and magma would need to completely degas to equal the equivalent mass of carbon in the (preindustrial) atmosphere. Most estimates of total magma volumes put continental LIPs around 1–10 × 106 km3 (Ernst, 2014; and references therein). Using the same assumption of CO2 content of magma gives the potential release of between 3500 and 17,500Gt(C) for the total lifetime of the LIP. In the case of the Siberian Traps, one estimate of CO2 degassing calculated at least 8200Gt(C) based on a total volumeestimation of 3 × 106 km3 (Courtillot and Renne, 2003). Alternate estimates, invoking larger melt volumes and/or incorporation of significant recycled crust in the melt, predict degassing may have ranged from 17,500 to 46,000 Gt(C) (Beerling et al., 2007; Sobolev et al., 2011)."

    "heading": "3.2.2. Secondary degassing",
    "text": "There is considerable evidence that suggests that volcanic degassing\nincludes a significant component from crustal sources. For example, Iacono-Marziano et al. (2009) recently showed that the current degassing from Vesuvius in Italy is characterized by up to 96–98% of limestone-sourced CO2 frommetamorphism around sub-volcanic intrusions. Assimilation of C-rich material into a melt is controlled by the magmatic saturation state. At depth, where CO2 is undersaturated, external material can be directly incorporated into the melt. At shallow crustal levels, magmas are typically supersaturated with respect to CO2, meaning that further incorporation of crustal material will not readily dissolve in the melt (Black et al., 2014b). Carbon will instead be volatised and driven off intrusions to form carbonates or be released to the atmosphere. This thermogenic degassing may even lead to the formation of hydrothermal vent complexes. Field studies have shown the presence of extensive degassing chimneys rooted to sill complexes within volcanic basins (Svensen et al., 2004, 2007). The vents number in their hundreds, varying in size with many having craters up to ~1 km wide at the palaeo-surface (e.g. Polozov et al., 2016), clear evidence of explosive release akin to phreatomagmatic pseudocraters. It is interpreted that these breccia pipes represent conduits for voluminous gas migration from the deep basins to the atmosphere (e.g. Svensen et al., 2007; Polozov et al., 2016). The transformation of organic carbon in shales in close proximity to the sills suggests that the baking of kerogen in sedimentary rocks could generate great volumes of greenhouse gases, potentially 1000’s Gt(C) of methane. In the case of the Siberian Traps, the contact metamorphic gas production from shales is estimated to be in the order of ~30,000 Gt(C) (Svensen et al., 2009). The gases were then released to the surface system via the pipes. Contact metamorphic volatile generation and release has been suggested to have played an integral role in rapid climate change events and mass extinctions such as the early-middle Cambrian (Kalkarindji LIP), end-Guadalupian (Emeishan Traps), end-Permian (Siberian Traps), end-Triassic (CAMP), the Toarcian (Karoo-Ferrar Traps), the PETM (NAIP), and the mid-Miocene climatic optimum\n(Svensen et al., 2004, 2007, 2009; McElwain et al., 2005; Heydari et al., 2008; Retallack and Jahren, 2008; Ganino and Arndt, 2009; Wignall et al., 2009; Aarnes et al., 2010; Bond et al., 2010b; Pang et al., 2013; Jourdan et al., 2014;McKay et al., 2014). Contact metamorphism associatedwith sill emplacement, which typically has a volume double the intrusive host (Svensen et al., 2007; Aarnes et al., 2010, 2011), would lead to considerable volatile generation. Assuming a conversion of 1.5% organic matter into volatile phases in the contact metamorphic aureole would generate up to ~70 Mt(C) per km3 of magma intruded into a sill (Table 2). If a considerable proportion of these gases make it to the surface (see Section 4.2.3), then the perturbations to the surficial carbon cycle would be considerably amplified. The formation of hydrothermal vent complex or breccia pipes would facilitate the efficient release of these volatiles to the atmosphere.\nThere is compelling evidence to suggest that sedimentary rocks are able to contaminate ascending magmas, increasing the volatile loads (Fig. 6A–B; Ripley et al., 2003; Starostin and Sorokhtin, 2011). While shallow crustal melts are commonly supersaturated with respect to CO2, open system degassing can allow for the effective loss of mantle CO2. This drives the incorporation of CO2 from surrounding material and enables further degassing to occur. Field studies suggest a common association between sill intrusions, lavas, and petroleum in sedimentary basins, underling the potential importance of organic contamination of shallow melts (e.g. Powers and Clapp, 1932; Rogers et al., 2006). In the Siberian Traps, several areas are characterised by bitumen occurrences in lava flows (Ryabov et al., 2005). The bitumen has been baked at high temperatures (~700 °C), providing evidence for incorporation of petroleum during emplacement. Potential magma-organic matter interactions are also indicated by the presence of native iron and native copper in sills and lavas, as organic matter may act as a reductant. During this process, the generated gases will be in a reduced state, and dominated by CH4 and H2 during high pressure conditions and CO and H2 at lower pressure (e.g., Iacono-Marziano et al., 2012; Solovova et al., 2002).\nThe isotopic composition of the mantle carbon (δ13C) is assumed to be close to−6‰ (VPDB), but this represents an uncertain value and has never been measured from any of the major LIPs (Saunders, 2005). The isotopic composition of degassed CO2 will be very different from the mantle values if organic material is incorporated into the melt. For instance, organic matter and petroleum with a marine origin typically have δ13C values between −27 and −44‰ (Dunkley-Jones et al., 2010). Solid bitumen (anthaxolite) samples from Siberian Trap lavas have reported δ13C values from −18 to −31.4‰ (Dymkov et al., 2007; Ryabov and Lapkovsky, 2008). In the Karoo Basin, graphitewithin a sill complex has a measured δ13C of −20.4‰ (Fig. 6B; Henning et al., 1997), indicating that organic matter maintains its light isotopic signature even after significant heating (~1200 °C). Therefore, the magmatic incorporation of organic material, combined with thermogenic degassing of sedimentary rocks, may account for at least part of the negative δ13C excursions observed to be coincident with LIP emplacements without requiring a speculatively high magma volume or an alternative (e.g. gas hydrate) source."

    "text": "The volumes of CO2 from direct and indirect sources underline the potential of LIPs to disturb the surficial carbon cycle. However, depending on the timescales of release, this impact can be considerably dampened by the rapid partitioning between surface reservoirs (see Section 4.2.2). Modelling of an instantaneous pulse of 500 Gt(C) into the oceans as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) raises atmospheric CO2 from 278 to 314 ppmv, followed by a gradual decay back towards prerelease CO2 concentrations over several thousand years (Ridgwell, 2005). In comparison, the cumulative anthropogenic release of fossil fuels is estimated to be 365 ± 30 Gt(C) (IPCC, 2013), leading to an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations to 400 ppmv so far. A\nthousand(s) year timescale of relaxation to this perturbation is also predicted by modelling (e.g. Archer, 2005).\nDating has confined the duration of most LIPs to within b2 Myr (Courtillot and Renne, 2003; Bryan et al., 2010; Kravchinsky, 2012), with the main emplacement periods taking place on a much shorter timescale (Svensen et al., 2012; Blackburn et al., 2013) that are comparable to the durations (~104 year) of even rapid extinction events (e.g. Bond and Wignall, 2014; Burgess et al., 2014). While the magnitude of individual eruptions/intrusions and the recurrence times between each event are poorly understood, it is clear that trap emplacement consists of successive individual eruptions (Chenet et al., 2009; Moulin et al., 2011; Courtillot and Fluteau, 2014). Both the total volume and rate of degassing are critical to the climate response. If a LIP with a total volume of 5 × 106 km3with 0.5wt% CO2 is emplaced over amillion year period, the total carbon added to surface reservoirs is 17,500 Gt(C) at an average rate of 17.5Mt(C) a−1. This volume is approximately 41% of the size of the combined present day surficial carbon reservoirs (Fig. 5), although volume of carbon in the fast domain has been considerably larger in the early Phanerozoic (e.g. Ridgwell, 2005; Section 4.2.2). While the total volume is a considerable fraction of the total surface reservoirs, the emissions averaged over a 1Myr period represents an insubstantial increase in flux from the slow carbon domain (Self et al., 2005; Wignall, 2005). This flux can be effectively offset by partitioning throughout the fast domain and increases in carbon sinks. It therefore appears likely that to significantly alter the surficial carbon cycle, the majority of CO2 degassing from LIP volcanism needs to occur on timescales of b105 years."

    "text": "Gas emissions can be heavily affected by the mode of emplacement, with different gas species being perturbed in distinctive ways. Firstly, the volume and timing of gas release varies considerably between extrusive and intrusive rocks. Lavas and tuffs have direct contact with the Earth surface, leading tomore extensive degassing. Previous studies have shown that lavas continue to degas up to 15% of their volatile budget away from the vent (Thordarson and Self, 1996), suggesting that shallow magma intrusions would retain a greater proportion of their volatiles that could subsequently form solid phases (see Section 4.2.3). The second variable for the fate of emitted volatiles is whether the LIP is subaerial or submarine, for example an oceanic plateau or continental flood basalt province. Deep submarine eruptions transfer nearly all of their volatiles to the surrounding water. A portion of gases are emitted to the atmosphere during upwelling, but the disparity in increase to atmospheric CO2 between models injecting carbon into the atmosphere and into the ocean (e.g. Archer, 2005; Ridgwell, 2005) suggests that volatiles can be exported through other avenues such as burial in sediments. As previously mentioned, the addition of CO2 to the marine realm can affect seawater pH and the availability of dissolved oxygen (Sinton and Duncan, 1997; Kerr, 1998; Huybers and Langmuir, 2009). Both of these effects have the potential to contribute to severe marine mass extinction events, but limit the impact on the atmospheric sulphur and carbon cycles.\nThe third variable for volatile species is the dominant style of eruption for extruded material. This has a strong impact on the dispersal and atmospheric lifetime of SO2 as H2SO4 aerosols, where explosive eruptions capable of injecting material into the stratosphere prolong residence times from weeks to years (Robock, 2000; Fig. 4). Due to the predominantly mafic character of most LIPs, effusive activity is more common than explosive activity. Field studies of the eruption of Laki in 1783–1784 suggest that violent fire fountaining can occur during prolonged flood basalt eruptions, perhaps even reaching N1 km in height (Thordarson and Self, 1998). Transport of volcanic gases to the stratosphere is more likely at high latitudes as the tropopause is lower in altitude than at the tropics, and notable LIPs that were erupted at least partially N60° include the Siberian Traps, Karoo-Ferrar, and the\nNAIP (Bryan, 2007). It has also been postulated that the heatflux fromextensive lavaflows could lead topenetrative convectionof volcanic plumes into the stratosphere through the establishment of large convection cells\n(Kaminski et al., 2011). Nevertheless, it is most likely that radiative changes to the atmosphere through sulphate aerosol loadingwill be dominantly tropospheric. The climate response will likely be manifest as\nregional acidification and indirect radiative forcing of CCN in addition to aerosol induced surface cooling (e.g. Schmidt et al., 2010) (Fig. 4)."

Atmospheric modelling suggests that acidity of rain water could be reduced to pH ~2–3, based on a background atmospheric CO2 concentration of 3550 ppmv and a yearlong eruption of 240 km3 lava (Black et al., 2014a). Tropospheric emissions would instigate a strong regional impact on pH, while stratospheric emissions would result in a more dilute global response. While the radiative effects can be severe, the short atmospheric lifetime of sulphur species dictate that these effects are effectively syn-volcanic. Rapid cycling through the atmosphere and biosphere results in rapid transference to the oceans and fresh water aquifers. The oceanic reservoir is too large and highly buffered to be affected by additional sulphur, even from the largest predictions of LIP emissions. Fresh water ecosystems can be adversely affected due to the much lower buffering capacity (e.g. Frogner-Kockum et al., 2006), and pH ~2 rain is sufficient to disfigure plants, leading to restricted growth and/or death (Howells, 1990). The lasting impact of LIP sulphur emissions is restricted to biosphere damage through radiative changes and acid rain, although these effects could be sufficient to trigger terrestrial mass extinctions (Black et al., 2014a)."

However, there are considerable differences in magnitudes and timescales of these feedbacks. Here we address the five main negative feedbacks to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations."

This can enhance the rate of carbon burial in soils and in marine sediments. Photosynthesis can adapt within a year or two to increased CO2 concentrations, but has the potential to become restricted by the\nlimitation of other nutrients such as N, P, and Fe (Walker and Kasting, 1992). In terrestrial ecosystems biological activity is most often limited by the availability of phosphate, given the comparative difficulty in making phosphate bioavailable from minerals such as apatite. Elevated plant growth speeds up soil weathering, but there is often a limited supply of phosphate-bearing minerals in soils and denudation of nutrients by water limits bioavailable phosphate for further biological growth (Peltzer et al., 2010). The oceans are most often limited by the availability of N, P, and Fe, depending on their relative abundance (e.g. Mills et al., 2004; Arrigo, 2005). Higher pCO2 levels will increase the rate of photosynthesis but also the rate of limitation by one of these nutrients, such that unless some other process leads to significant changes in the cycles of N, P, and/or Fe, the buffering by the biosphere will be transient and restricted in extent (e.g. Howarth, 1988). Moreover, primary productivity can only function as an enhanced carbon sink in the absence of environmentally damaging effects of LIP volcanism. For example, significant disruptions to ocean nutrient balances is one of the most probable methods for inducing marine anoxia (Jenkyns, 2003; Erba, 2004; Mattioli et al., 2009; Flögel et al., 2011), along with ocean stratification in response to high pCO2 conditions (Bralower and Thierstein, 1987; Tyson, 2005)."

    "heading": "4.2.2. Oceanic buffering",
    "text": "The largest buffer of atmospheric CO2 over timescales of 10’s to 1000’s years is uptake by the oceans. The fluxes of carbon between the atmosphere and ocean are considerable, and intermediate and deep ocean waters have the capacity to hold considerable volumes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The oceans contain approximately 88% of the total surficial carbon (Fig. 5), dominating the fast domain. The atmosphere and oceans reactwith each other tomaintain partial gas pressure (pCO2) equilibrium, offset slightly by the rate of ocean overturning. Carbon dioxide reacts with H2O and carbonate ions (CO32−) to form bicarbonate (HCO3−), or with H2O to form HCO3− and H+ ions via carbonic acid (H2CO3) (Table 3). This system is a powerful buffer to acidification, as association of HCO3− and H+ ions to form H2CO3 significantly lessens the increase in acidity from H+ ions alone. However, elevating pCO2 leads to increased acidity of waters through H2CO3 production. The oceans currently have estimated reservoirs of ~37,000 Gt(C) of HCO3− and ~1300 Gt(C) of CO32− (Kump et al., 2009), a sizeable buffer to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While the oceans were generally a net source of CO2 during the Holocene to counteract atmospheric removal by photosynthesis and weathering (Fig. 5), approximately 1/3rd of the current anthropogenic emissions are being sequestered into ocean waters (2.3±0.7 of 8.9±1.4 Gt(C) a−1; IPCC, 2013). Significant CO2fluxes to surface reservoirs must either occur extremely rapidly (b100 years) of be of sufficient volume to overcome this buffering capacity in order to instigate substantial increases in atmospheric CO2. If, however,\n1992). The photosynthetic and marine sequestration potentials are estimated from the in). Silicate and carbonate weathering flux estimates fromMunhoven (2002). Subsurface\nsufficient carbon is liberated to overcome this buffer, then further reactions may even become a positive feedback mechanism to atmospheric CO2 increase. Ocean acidification affects the carbonate saturation horizon, which in turn affects carbon export to marine sediments (Huybers and Langmuir, 2009). The volume of carbon required to induce carbonate dissolution is considerable. For example, geochemical modelling suggests that a minimum release of 10,000 Gt(C) in less than 100 kyr would have been required to cause carbonate dissolution at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (Berner and Beerling, 2007).\nThe ocean carbon reservoirs have seen two fundamental changes in the biogeochemical cycling of CaCO3 during the Phanerozoic. The advent of biomineralization in the early Cambrian allowed thefirst removal of weathering products through metabolic expenditure (Wood et al., 2002), while the mid Mesozoic proliferation of planktic calcifying organisms opened up the deep ocean as a significant depositional environment for calcite (Martin, 1995; Ridgwell, 2005; Ridgwell and Zeebe, 2005). Prior to this planktic diversification in the late-Triassic/ early-Jurassic, the oceanswere susceptible to periods of extreme saturation as the locus of calcite precipitation was restricted to shelf environments. Oscillations in sea level therefore had a strong influence on the available surface area for carbonate platform development (Algeo and Seslavinsky, 1995). The creation of a responsive deep-sea carbonate sink allowed for a much greater degree of saturation state regulation and therefore a diminishment of the total surficial carbon inventory through faster and more extensive CaCO3 precipitation. The combined surface reservoirs are calculated to have been around 3 times larger in the Palaeozoic than present day volumes, having important implications for the size of perturbations to the carbon cycle based on the interpretation of δ13C excursions (Ridgwell, 2005)."

    "text": "Degassed volatiles may become dissolved in fluid phases or fixed in\nsolid phases before being released to the atmosphere. The possible mechanisms whereby magmatic gases could be sequestered in the subsurface prior to atmospheric release require reactions on short timescales between the degassing magma, the contact rocks and surrounding aquifers. This could occur at depth, in the shallow subsurface, and also where degassing lavas are in contact with porous sediments at surface conditions. Sulphur can form solid phases in both oxidised and reduced conditions, in addition to being highly soluble in water. Therefore, deep and shallow intrusions have a lesser impact on the surface sulphur cycle than eruptions. In particular, the absence of forceful injection into the atmosphere would significantly diminish the radiative forcing of H2SO4 aerosols. Carbon becomes more readily incorporated into solid phases at lower temperatures in the carbonate stability field. Vesicles and fractures in igneous rocks are commonly filled with carbonate and zeolite minerals (Fig. 6C-D). If these secondary phases grew during the emplacement of igneous material, then they could hold/sequester magmatic CO2. For submarine and phreatomagmatic eruptions, the formation of highly fragmented hyaloclastites can lead to very early carbonate diagenesis (e.g. Watton et al., 2014).\nIt has been noted that when dykes, sills, and lava flows are in contact with sandstone that carbonate cements are common (Fig. 6E-H; Jerram and Stollhofen, 2002; Grove, 2014). At such contacts the porosity is completely occluded by carbonate cements that are sourced from CO2 degassed from the magma and Ca from the degradation of the igneous body and country rocks. This phenomenon is often restricted to the first ~1 m of the contact zone but is pervasive at these contacts, completely occluding the porosity. A good example of this process can be found in the Paraná-Etendeka LIP, which was emplaced into a large aeolian sand sea around 132 Ma (Jerram et al., 2000; Waichel et al., 2008). In the Etendeka flood basalt province, northwest Namibia, numerous indurated/cemented zones occur at the base of lava flows and along the contacts of sills and dykes intruding the thick sandstone sequences (Fig. 7). The carbonate cements at contact zones comprise 10–16% of the rock by volume (19.5 wt%), and are pervasive along\nthese well exposed contacts. This equates to 529 kg of calcite per m3 of country rock in the contact zone, equivalent to 63 kg(C)/m3 (63Mt(C) per km3 contact zone). The estimatedmagmatic CO2 concentrations are 3.5 Mt(C) per km3 of igneous material (Self et al., 2005). Therefore, a 10 m wide dyke with 1 m cemented zones each side (Fig. 6F) has a 5:1 volume ratio between intrusion and contact zone. This means the sequestered carbon in the contact cement is approximately 3.6 times greater than the original volume of carbon in the adjacent intrusion (Table 3). This implies that either there was persistent degassing of magma flowing through the dyke, and/or that a significant fraction of the carbon in the calcite is from an external source. Dykes in Etendeka can be 10 km in length and intersect ~100 m thickness of sandstone, sequestering around 0.13 Mt(C) in the contact zone of each dyke. Such dykes and sills intruding sandstone sequences are numerous in Etendeka (Jerram et al., 2000), suggesting that these intrusive parts of this LIP had diminished fluxes of CO2 to the atmosphere.\nThere is further evidence of more diffuse diagenesis away from the contact zones, where sandstones have become ‘bleached’ by CO2-rich hydrothermal fluids (Fig. 6E-H). Plagioclase and orthoclase feldspars have been altered to kaolinite, bӧhmite, and calcite by this process (Grove, 2014). Calcite concentrations in these bleached sands are ~4 wt%, equivalent to around 13 Mt(C) per km3 of affected country rock. A conservative estimate of sandstone outcrops in the Huab Basin (NW Namibia) is ~2100 km2, which assuming an average thickness of 100 m and 50% proportion of altered sandstone (Mountney et al., 1998; Jerram and Stollhofen, 2002) gives a total storage of ~1.36 Gt(C) within calcite for this more diffuse alteration. The Etendeka comprises just 5% of the Paraná-Etendeka LIP, so the combination of calciterich contact zones and diffuse sequestration of CO2 in country rocks can equate to large volumes over thewhole province. However, these calculations suggest that the total sequestration is unlikely to be greater than 100’s Gt(C), a minor curtailment of total LIP degassing volumes. Clearly, porosities and lithologies of host rocks play a dominant role on the sequestration of CO2 with sandstone host rocks well suited for precipitation of calcite in pore spaces. Both the Paraná-Etendeka and the Karoo-Ferrar LIPs affect thick sequences of porous sandstones, while in other provinces the proportion of sandstone country rocks is more varied. It is interesting to note that the climatic impact of the ParanáEtendeka LIP is somewhatmuted, with onlyminor anoxic events occurring around this time (e.g. Erba et al., 2004)."

Outgassing of CO2 from volcanic and metamorphic sources is completely balanced by weathering over such timescales. Primary silicate minerals are susceptible to weathering at the Earth’s surface, reacting to form clays that consumeatmospheric CO2 (Table 3). Theprocess occurs in two stages, weathering and precipitation. An example of the weathering stage is this reaction for plagioclase feldspar:\nCaAl2Si2O8 þ 2 CO2 þ 3 H2O → Al2Si2O5 OHð Þ4 þ Ca2þ þ 2 HCO3− ð1Þ\nThe bicarbonate molecules and alkali earth ions are preferentially denuded from the weathering site and transported to the oceans. Once there, they form carbonates by:\nCa2þ þ 2 HCO3− → CaCO3 þ CO2 þ H2O ð2Þ\nThe net effect of these reactions is the consumption of one mole of CO2 for each mole of Ca2+ and Mg2+ weathered and transported to the oceans (Berner, 2004). This process is a gradual one, for example it would take 0.5–1 million years to consume the equivalent volume of the atmospheric CO2 reservoir. However, silicate weathering is able to\nadapt to changes in surface conditions. Weathering rates increase with higher temperatures, while chemical and physical denudation rises with greater runoff. Studies of basaltic river catchments in Iceland have shown a 14% increase in Ca2+ and HCO3− dissolved fluvial fluxes per 1 °C warming, with the total CO2 fixed by catchments rising in response to global warming over recent decades (Gislason et al., 2009; Eiriksdottir et al., 2015). Increased runoff also dramatically increases fluxes of river suspended material, encouraging the chemical breakdown of mechanically weathered material in marine environments. Given the high surface area of such particles and their disequilibrium with sea water, this effect may be just as important for land-to-ocean transfer of material and therefore the weathering feedback mechanism (e.g. Pearce et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2014). The sluggish responsemeans that this feedback mechanism is unable to offset rapid increases in CO2 emissions, even with elevated weathering in warmer, more humid conditions.\nTerrestrial weathering of silicates and carbonates are the main sources of DIC and alkalinity in the oceans, balanced by the sedimentary burial of CaCO3. The component ionic parts, Ca2+ and CO32−, are intrinsically linked through the solubility ratio Ω = [Ca2+] × [CO32−]/Ksp. Therefore, an increase in weathering will increase the net concentrations of Ca2+ ions, driving CO32− in the other direction. Concentrations of Ca2+ ions in combination with the carbonate saturation state and atmospheric CO2 concentrations thus have a direct influence on ocean pH. There is evidence that there has been considerable variation in [Ca2+] throughout the Phanerozoic (Horita et al., 2002; Lowenstein et al., 2003). The production and burial of CaCO3 is dependent on the supply of HCO3− from the terrestrial sources. In the modern system the supply of HCO3− from silicate weathering is estimated to be 144 Mt(C) a−1, slightly less than the 216 Mt(C) a−1 from weathering of carbonates (e.g. Munhoven, 2002). However, the atmospheric CO2 consumed in this weathering of process is re-released once incorporated into CaCO3 again (Eq. (2)), meaning that on timescales N105 years the net effect of carbonate weathering on pCO2 concentrations is negligible."

The rate of weathering is intrinsically linked to the available surface area available for fluid-rock interactions. Continental uplift above a rising plume, as with tectonic orogenies, leads to the development of highrelief terrain. This increases slope gradient and therefore erosion rates (Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; Berner, 2004; Goudie and Viles, 2012). Regional uplift also affects elevates precipitation and runoff in the affected area, which exerts a first order control on the weathering rate (e.g. West et al., 2005). Milliman and Farnsworth (2011) estimate wet, young, and mountainous rivers currently comprise just 14% of the cumulative drainage basin area, yet transport ~40% of the global dissolved fluvial flux and N60% of the river suspended sediment flux. Therefore, increasing the total surface area of high relief has a disproportionate effect on global weathering fluxes.\nA crucial factor during the emplacement of a LIP is the extrusion of primary silicate material as lavas and tephra. Many of the mineral phases that are primary components of LIP lavas, such as olivine, pyroxenes, and plagioclase feldspars, are unstable at the Earth’s surface. Basaltic material is an order of magnitude more weatherable than granitic continental crust (Gaillardet et al., 1999; Dessert et al., 2003).Moreover, field and laboratory experiments indicate that fresh silicate material is initially highly reactive but that chemical weathering rates decrease rapidly with time exposed at the surface (Porder et al., 2007; Vance et al., 2009). Current surface exposures of basaltic terrains are estimated to be 6.85 × 106 km2, around 4.6% of the total continental surface area, yet contribute between 30 and 35% of the terrestrial silicate weathering flux (Dessert et al., 2003). Increasing the subaerial exposure of volcanic products will increase the reactive surface area available for hydrolysis, thereby having a disproportionately high effect on global silicate weathering rates. Elevated silicate weathering through the subsequent\nweathering of LIP lavas has been suggested for both the Deccan Traps and the CAMP (Dessert et al., 2001; McHone, 2003; Schaller et al., 2011, 2012). Estimates of the CAMP’s eruptive area are around 1.12 × 107 km2 (McHone, 2003), 1.6 times the total present day basaltic terrain exposure. LIP volcanic rocks typically have CaO concentrations ranging from 8.6 to 12.4 wt%, and MgO concentrations of 6.4 to 7.6 wt% (e.g. Ewart et al., 2004; Fitton and Godard, 2004), representing a carbon sink potential of 11 to 15 Mt(C) per km3 of lava if all Ca2+ and Mg2+\nions are weathered and form carbonates (Table 3). This is greater than CO2 degassing estimates frombothmagmatic volatiles and incorporated crustal material (Table 2). Therefore, the full life cycle of basaltic material, from eruption/intrusion, complete erosion, and incorporation into carbonates, is a net sink of CO2 (e.g. Jones et al., 2011).\nAn enhanced weathering feedback is dependent on various factors, not least the proportion of LIP material that is erupted. If the emplacement of a LIP is dominated by intrusions, such as the Siberian Traps appear to be, or by cryptic degassing of magma at depth, then the increase in availability of fresh weatherablematerial exposed at the surface is diminished. There are still considerable outcrops of sills throughout the Tunguska Basin today, 250 Ma after the LIP emplacement (Fig. 1). Combined with the thermogenic release of CO2 from sedimentary rocks in the basin, this particular example of LIP emplacement is characterised by elevated CO2 release and less of an increase in global silicate weathering rates due to the high proportion of the LIP emplaced as intrusions. The lack of an efficient deep-ocean carbonate sink in the end-Permian also slows the regulation of pCO2 through silicate weathering (Fig. 8). The estimated volume of the Siberian Traps LIP is ~4 × 106 km3, while the area inundated by lavas was ~7 × 106 km2\n(Sobolev et al., 2011; Ivanov et al., 2013). In contrast, the CAMP is estimated to have had a subaerial extent of N1.12 × 107 km2 (McHone, 2003) but this figure is poorly constrained because very few of the CAMP outcrops remain; the majority of the LIP has been eroded away. Elevated silicateweathering due to the extrusion of large volumes of igneous material is believed to have reduced pCO2 below pre-LIP concentrations, based on modelling and palaeo-atmospheric reconstructions (Fig. 8; Schaller et al., 2012). Previousmodelling of elevatedweathering of theDeccan Traps drew the same conclusion (Dessert et al., 2001). The relaxation rates of pCO2 in the twomodels differ, but that may just be a function of the initial CO2 release and timescale of degassing assigned in the models. The subaerial extent of the Deccan Traps was estimated to be ~1.8 × 106 km2 (Hooper et al., 2010; Sheth and Vanderkluysen, 2014), significantly less than both the Siberian Traps and the CAMP\n(Fig. 8). The geographical location of the LIP and the climate play important roles in the weathering of igneous products. Humid, low latitude environments lead to faster weathering rates than emplacement in arid mid-latitudes. This is argued as a further difference in subsequent weathering rates between CAMP and Deccan (Schaller et al., 2012). High latitude emplacements of LIPs would result in slower weathering rates due to lower temperatures. However, glaciation leads to rapidmechanical erosion of uplifted areas (e.g. Pedersen et al., 2010), which would increase the overall weathering rate of high-latitude LIPs during icehouse conditions.\nThe style of an eruption has a strong influence on the subsequent weathering potential. Explosive eruptions create volcanic products that are disintegrated and dispersed over a wide area. This significantly increases the surface area of erupted products and therefore the surface area available for weathering. For example, the small (~1 km3\nmagma) eruption of Mount St. Helens produced tephra with an estimated total specific surface area of 5 × 108 km2, comparable to the Earth’s surface area (Ayris and Delmelle, 2012). The causes of explosive eruptions are high volatile concentrations, phreatomagmatism, and/or high silica contents. High silica products are more resistant to weathering than basaltic material, lessening any surface area effects. Tephra deposits are by nature poorly consolidated, and are easily eroded and denuded. This makes estimating their contribution to LIP volcanism difficult to quantify. Moreover, poor preservation and weathering of deposits can sometimes lead to difficulties in recognising the original facies assemblage where the different rock properties of the facies vary (e.g. Nelson et al., 2009). The weathered tops and crusts of lava flows in the Siberian Traps, for example, have been mistakenly identified as interbedded tuffs and lava flows (on available geological maps), overemphasising their contribution and distribution throughout the province (Jerram et al., 2016). Thick tuff deposits are present in the central/southern part Tunguska basin in Siberia, but are apparently absent from north-western outcrops (Ross et al., 2003; Jerram et al., 2016). For some flood basalt provinces such as Karoo-Ferrar and Paraná-Etendeka, tuff layers are thin and restricted in extent (Jerram and Widdowson, 2005). While field evidence is limited, explosive deposits in mafic-dominated LIPs appear to be localised in nature, suggesting an external driving mechanism such a phreatomagmatic eruption caused by interaction with groundwater or surface waters (McClintock et al., 2008). Therefore, it is still unclear whether explosive activity leads to voluminous quantities of easily weathered tephra during LIP emplacements.\nmosphere (after Walker and Kasting, 1992; Dessert et al., 2001; Schaller et al., 2011).

    "heading": "5. Concluding remarks",
    "text": "• There is a strong correlation between mass extinction events, rapid climate change, and the formation of LIPs, suggesting that LIPs have a causal influence on the timing of these perturbations. Possible sources of ecosystem stress include marine anoxia, marine acidification, global warming, ozone depletion, and/or acid rain (Visscher et al., 2004; Wignall, 2007; Bond and Wignall, 2014; Cui and Kump, 2014). Along with halogens, emissions of sulphur and carbon provide the most plausible avenues for instigating such climatic changes. Sulphur rapidly oxidises to form sulphuric acid aerosol particles in the atmosphere, altering the planetary albedo, leading to surface cooling during eruptions. The sulphate aerosols can also act as cloud condensation nuclei that alter the radiative properties of the atmosphere, although this process is currently poorly understood. The incorporation of SO2 into the hydrological cycle can lead to quite severe acid rain (Black et al., 2014a). Current best estimates for sulphur concentrations in LIP magma range from 3.3 to 4.8 Mt(S) per km3 magma (Thordarson and Self, 1993, 1996, 2003; Gislason et al., 2015). Total sulphur release estimates from LIPs may exceed 10,000 Gt(S) (Black et al., 2012, 2014b), over amillion times greater than current annual volcanic emissions. Therefore, if degassed over a short timeframe, the extent of ecosystemdamagewould be considerable. The rapid deposition and incorporation into the hydrosphere means that the atmospheric disturbances through sulphur emissions are restricted to the duration of degassing, although the repercussions may last considerably longer.\n• Elevating atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and CH4 will exacerbate the greenhouse effect and lead to sustained global warming. There are numerousnegative feedbacks that regulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations,which can also increase in response to higher pCO2 levels. Primary productivity can fix carbon in organicmatter and carbonates, which are then buried in soils and marine sediments. The most important shorttermbuffer is the oceans,where the formation ofHCO3− regulates atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This process also leads to an increase in acidity, inducing ecosystem stress at sufficiently low pH values. This buffering capacity has changed markedly throughout the Phanerozoic (e.g. Ridgwell, 2005). Over longer timescales, the most important regulator is silicate rockweathering,which erodes the constituent parts necessary to form marine carbonates (e.g. Walker et al., 1981; Berner, 2004). This process increases in response to higher pCO2 levels, but given the sluggish nature of silicate weathering as a CO2 sink, voluminous degassing on timescales b104 years can overcome this buffer and increase carbon concentrations in both the atmosphere and oceans. The large surface reservoirs dictate that only extreme emissions of carbon would significantly disrupt the status quo. Nevertheless, abrupt changes in δ13C values highlight the rapid perturbation of the carbon cycle during the emplacement of numerous LIPs. In the case of the Siberian Traps,magmatic CO2 emissions have been estimated to be between 8,200 and 46,000 Gt(C) (Courtillot and Renne, 2003; Beerling et al., 2007; Sobolev et al., 2011). Even these considerable volumes need to be emitted rapidly in order to overcome the surface buffers of pCO2 (e.g. Self et al., 2005).\n• The emplacement of a LIP into the lithosphere results in large intrusive complexes and extrusive deposits. Eruptions allow for the direct transference of gases to the surface. The extrusive rocks are most commonly effusive lavas, although explosive tuffsmay be an important component (e.g. Ross et al., 2003). Due to the wide dispersal and poor preservation potential of tuffs, the prevalence of explosive activity remains speculative (e.g. Bryan et al., 2002). Intrusive components of LIPs include sills and dykes emplaced into shallow parts of the crust, often into sedimentary basins. These igneous complexes can have volumes N700,000 km3, with individual units in excess of 3000 km3 (Vasil’ev, 1999). The interactions of igneous bodies with the host rock lithologies have a controlling influence on the generation and fate of volatile phases. Incorporation of crustal material into magmas can significantly alter\nvolatile chemistries and volumes (e.g. Ripley et al., 2003; Sobolev et al., 2011). Large scale emplacement can also lead to extensive contact metamorphism and de-volatilization of host rocks (e.g. Aarnes et al., 2010, 2011), which can be transported to the surface via hydrothermal vent complexes and breccia pipes (e.g. Svensen et al., 2004). For the Siberian Traps, this secondary gas productionmay have released an additional ~30,000 Gt(C) (Svensen et al., 2009). Conversely, host rocks may also act as a sink for volatile phases. Metal sulphide and carbonate deposits in contact zones can limit the extent to which subterranean degassing affects the surface system. In particular, the intrusion of dykes and sills into massive sandstone sequences leads to the widespread formation of carbonate cements (e.g. Grove, 2014). For the Paraná-Etendeka and the Karoo-Ferrar LIPs this effective sequestration may have diminished the extent of CO2 degassing. • The response of silicate weathering to changes to surface cycles warrants particular attention. Silicate weathering will vary in response to the degree of pCO2 change, uplift associated with LIP emplacement, and the volume of lavas and tephra erupted by the LIP that would enhance surface weathering rates. In particular, increasing the subaerial exposure of volcanic rockswill have a strong influence on global silicate weathering rates and therefore the recovery of high pCO2 conditions. This process appears especially important for the CAMP,where effective and rapid erosion of lavas at humid low latitudes sequestered atmospheric CO2 to below pre-LIP concentrations (Schaller et al., 2011, 2012). In contrast, the intrusive-dominated Siberian Traps may have had a more limited ability to regulate atmospheric CO2, especially since the LIP was emplaced at high latitudes and the Permian oceans had a less efficient deep-ocean carbonate sink. All of these factors need to be addressed when considering the interactions between the emplacement of a LIP and the climatic response."
