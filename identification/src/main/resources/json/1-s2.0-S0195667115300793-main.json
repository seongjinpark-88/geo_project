All rights reserved.\na b s t r a c t\nVolcanism is a natural climate force that causes variations in temperatures. The Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE-1a) was preceded by a prominent negative C-isotope excursion attributed to major volcanism of the Ontong Java plateau (OJP), which presumably resulted in a pCO2 increase and a climatic change. However, the OJP alone may not adequately explain some important isotopic signatures such as the negative strontium-isotope excursion from 125 Ma to 113 Ma that is recorded in the corresponding marine deposits. We present an independent and hitherto undocumented case, the giant Aptian volcanism in the Songliao Basin and northeast Asia (SB-V) on the Cretaceous active continental margin between the Eurasian and the Pacific plates, which covered an area of ca. 2.3 106 km2, nearly matching the simultaneous case of the OJP. Intensive strong, explosive volcanic eruptions of the SB-V occurred at 121e109 Ma and introduced a large volume of fine-grained volcanic ash and degassing volatiles into the atmosphere. The Aptian isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb) of marine carbonates from the Mid-Pacific shift in values between their Barremian pre-excursion high values and the negative magmatic values of the SB-V. The transient global cooling at the onset of the OAE-1a coincided with the beginning of the violent acidic eruption of the SB-V (119.9e120.2 Ma). We therefore infer that the SB-V must have played a role in the Aptian global climatic changes and OAE-1a through the heavy fall of volcanic dust and the outgassing of aerosol and greenhouse gases.\n© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "Several important global geological events occurred during the Aptian, including the Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE-1a, ~120 Ma) and various climatic changes (Zakharov et al., 2013). The OAE-1a is characterized by quasi-global deposition of organic-rich black shale (Misumi, Yamanaka, & Tajika, 2009). Climatic warming resulted from a prominent increase of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (F€ollmi, 2012). Notable contemporaneous changes in various stable isotopes of marine deposits have been recognized both in the Tethys and Pacific Oceans (van Breugel et al., 2007). Modern observations have confirmed that volcanic eruptions are an important natural cause of climate change at many time scales (Robock, 2000; Sigl et al., 2013). Cretaceous volcanic activities, including large igneous provinces (LIPs) and continental flood basalt provinces (CFBPs), also showed a causal relationship with the paleo-\ne of Earth Sciences, Jilin Uni-\ngreenhouse climate (Keller, 2008; Wang et al., 2014). The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP), which was an Aptian giant flood\nbasalt event in the Mid-Pacific, was considered to be the major cause for the OAE-1a and corresponding climatic warming (Keller et al., 2011). However, the OJP alone cannot explain some key facts concerning the geochemical signatures recorded in the Aptian marine deposits. For example, the 87Sr/86Sr in marine deposits showed a generally continuous negative trend throughout the entire Aptian from 121Ma to 113Ma (Jenkyns&Wilson,1999). This is contradictory to the genetic explanation regarding an isotopic shift mainly caused by OJP volcanism because the OJP appears to have been formed rapidly at approximately 120 Ma (Fitton, Mahoney, Wallace, & Saunders, 2004), while the negative excursion of 87Sr/86Sr recorded in the marine deposits climaxed at approximately 113 Ma (Jenkyns & Wilson, 1999), which was much later than the OJP event. In addition, after the OAE-1a, the OJP became quiescent and the strontium-87 radioactive source from continental weathering increased, both of which could have had caused a positive excursion of the strontium isotope relative to the intensive OJP episode either in marine water or in sediments\naccording to the geological principle 87Sr/86Sr ratios (Larson& Erba, 1999). There was also an inconsistency between isotopes of lead and osmium recorded in the Aptian marine deposits when only the OJP was considered. 187Os/188Os records from the Mid-Pacific Mountains and the Alps of northern Italy showed similar trends, although they were very distant from each other in the Early Cretaceous. This has been explained by very efficient ocean mixing and elevated rates of silicate weathering on the continents due to global warming during the OAE-1a (Bottini, Cohen, Erba, Jenkyns,& Coe, 2012). However, the Pb isotopic compositions from the Pacific and Italy showed very different features. The Pb isotopic composition from the Pacific showed rapid fluctuations between unradiogenic and radiogenic values, while Pb isotopic composition from Italy remained unchanged, with values mostly identical to those of the upper continental crust. Thus, a limited dispersion of Pbcarrying particles out of the Pacific Ocean was proposed to explain the lead isotope record (Kuroda et al., 2011). To explain the isotope excursion problems discussed above, we proposed a new model that attributes the isotopic signatures of the Aptian marine deposits to a possible impact of the giant Aptian volcanism in the Songliao Basin and northeast Asia (SB-V) through the fallout of wind-driven volcanic ash.\nOther geological events independent from the OJP volcanism should be considered in relation to the OAE-1a and the global climatic changes in the Aptian. Large-scale volcanic phases have been recognized in the Songliao Basin and the entire region of northeast Asia, which were located on the active continental margin of the Eurasian plate during the mid-Cretaceous (Wang, Xie, et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015). The strongest explosive acidic volcanic eruptions occurred between 121 and 109 Ma, and the predominant eruption types were Plinian and phreatomagmatic, which had generated large volumes of fine-grained volcanic ash into the atmosphere (Figs. 1e4). The fine volcanic dust had reasonably provided a magmatic origin for the negative isotopes of strontium and lead, which may have significantly contributed to the marine sediments, especially those adjacent to northeast Asia. We further concluded that the SB-V could be a possible cause for global climate change and OAE-1a through the heavy fall of volcanic dust and the outgassing of aerosol and greenhouse gases."

    "text": "Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks were recognized and mapped over widespread areas in northeast Asia, both on the continent and in the adjacent oceanic crust (Petrov, Leonov, & Pospelov, 2014; Ren, Niu, Wang, Jin, & Xie, 2013). These volcanic associations have experienced regional differential subsidence since the Late Cretaceous, which resulted in mountain building, basin filling, and fault-block tilting (Ren, Tamaki, Lia, & Zhang, 2002). Although the present landforms in the region include lowlands, highlands, and mountain ranges, both volcanic and sedimentary successions formed within all of these morphologic elements, even on the present Great Xing'an mountain range, in the Aptian and Albian. The middle and lower parts of the basin fills over the entire region are typically composed of Lower Cretaceous volcanogenic successions. The distribution patterns of the volcanic successions have been identified as a result of both petroleum exploration and geological surveys (e.g., DPGC, 1993; IGS, 1991; Khanchuk, 2012).\nThe Songliao Basin (SB) is the largest sedimentary basin in northeast Asia, with a presently preserved area of 2.6 105 km2 (Fig. 1). The SB has had an annual crude oil production of approximately one-half million tons (ca. 3.5 million barrels) and thus has received considerable attention since the late 1950s. The Aptian to lower Albian volcanic rocks, called the Yingcheng Formation (YFm.) locally, have become major types of petroleum reservoirs in\nthe SB exploration since late 1990's (Feng et al., 2011). More than 500 wells have been drilled, and high-quality 3-D seismic data are available for the buried volcanoes in the SB. Petrological, geochemical, and radiogenic isotope studies for the volcanogenic successions have been thoroughly conducted in the past 15 years (e.g., Wang, Liu,Wang,& Song, 2002;Wang, Ren, et al., 2002;Wang, Chen, Chen, Siebel, & Satir, 2006). These studies provide us with reliable constraints on the time and space distributions of the volcanic rocks (Figs. 1 and 2).\nAlthough much work has been conducted on the Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the Songliao Basin and northeast Asia (SBV), the possible relationship between the SB-V volcanism and the Aptian global climatic event has hitherto been undocumented."

    "text": "The AptianeAlbian volcanic rocks within and around the SB were the primary focus in this paper. New data on the volcanic rocks were obtained by field observation, subsurface geological mapping, and chemical analysis of bulk compositions (178 samples), isotopes of RbeSr (14 samples) and PbePb (24 samples), and zircon UePb dating (8 samples). Major elements were analyzed with an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (PW1404/10) at the analytical center of Jilin University, Changchun, China. Whole-rock RbeSr and PbePb isotopic composition was measured on a Finnigan MAT-262 mass spectrometer at the Laboratory of Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China. Details on the analytical techniques were provided by Chen, Hegner, and Todt (2000). Individual zircon crystals were used for zircon UePb dating, which was performed using SHRIMP II at Beijing SHRIMP Center, Institute of Geology, CAGS, Beijing and LA-ICP-MS at the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China. The analytical procedure of SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS is the same as that described by Williams (1998) and Yuan et al. (2004), respectively.\nThe lithofacies and thickness of buried volcanoes in the SB were mapped (Fig. 1) using seismic data, well logs, drill cores, and cuttings data that were obtained during exploration of the SB. The characteristics and recognition of proximal, medial, and distal facies associations were described in detail by Wang and Chen (2015, in Table 3). In addition, 53,001 m of volcanogenic succession from 167 representative boreholes was used for lithology and facies study. Lithologic definitions are based on LeMaitre (1989). The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3. The eruption styles of the SB-V were studied on outcrops, focusing on their structure, texture, and the assemblages of the volcanic ejecta (Fig. 4).\nThe statistical data used in the paper are based on both our own work on volcanic radiometric dating (such as Fig. 5) and the published literature (see data source of Table 1), the bulk composition of primary fluid inclusions hosted in the volcanic rocks (see description of Table 2), and the regional geology and stratigraphy of northeast Asia (see Table 3 and figure caption of Fig. 6). The regional stratigraphic correlations shown in Table 3 and Fig. 6 are mainly based on the radioisotopic ages of the corresponding volcanogenic successions. We have assigned two isotopic ages for each stratigraphic column at its upper and lower parts (Fig. 6①e⑦). They are mostly the Aptian to lower Albian successions.\n4. AptianeAlbian volcanism in the Songliao Basin (Yingcheng Formation)\nThe Yingcheng Formation volcanic successions (Y-Fm.) experienced two episodes of eruption during the Aptian and Albian. The first episode is characterized by large-scale rhyolitic explosive\neruptions, although minor intermediate to mafic rocks can also be found, most of which were dated between 121 and 109 Ma. The second episode includes predominantly effusive andesitic and mafic volcanic rocks dated between 108 and 103 Ma (Figs. 3 and 4).\nThe proximal facies associations in Fig. 1 indicate paleo-volcanic explosive centers, as described by Wang and Chen (2015). The densely populated buried volcanic architectures and fault systems shown in Fig. 1 indicate the presence of one large volcano every 80 km2, which suggests awidespread breaking of the continent and intensive eruptions in the region during the Aptian to Albian. The large scale of strong acidic explosive eruptions began at approximately 199.9e120.2 Ma, and then lasted episodically and decreasingly in magnitude up to ca. 103 Ma. After the early Albian, ca. 108 Ma, they changed into predominantly effusive eruptions with intermediate to mafic lavas (Figs. 3, 5). Plinian and phreatomagmatic eruptions were dominant at the early stage of the\neruption, which generated a large volume of fine-grained volcanic ashes, as shown in Fig. 4. The abnormally high abundance of vesicles and gas pipes interbedded with primary lava flow structures suggests that the molten lava experienced degassing processes at a large scale (Fig. 4e). The volcanic rocks of the Y-Fm. contain residual volatile compounds (volatiles) that are hosted in the present-state hard rocks because they generally have a high content of los-onignition (LOI) in their bulk chemical composition (Fig. 5). Two separate lithologic groups can be identified within the volcanic rocks of the Y-Fm. Fig. 5a presents rhyolitic volcanic rocks and intermediate to mafic volcanic rocks. Both rock types indicate inverse correlations between silica and LOI weight percentages in which there are declining LOI levels with increasing silicon dioxide concentrations. The magmatic differentiation index (MDI) compared with LOI levels indicates a significant correlation (with a confidence interval of 0.05) between volatile loss and magmatic evolution\nTable 1 (continued )\nNo. Sample no.

The relationship indicates that volatiles captured in the crystallized rocks and represented by LOI decrease with magmatic differentiation. This characteristic, coupled with the gas-escape structures shown in Fig. 4e, suggests that the volatiles should be predominantly magma-derived. The index of A/CNK (molar ratio of Al2O3/(CaO þ Na2O þ K2O) is rock type-dependent, as shown in Fig. 5c, in that most of the intermediate andmafic volcanic rocks are metaluminous with A/CNK values less than 1.08, and most of the rhyolites are peraluminous. Nevertheless, the majority of the volcanic rocks are not significantly altered because only 15% (26/178) of the samples show A/CNK values greater than the critical number of alterations, 1.4 (Siebel et al., 1997), which is equivalent to a value of 58 for the chemical index of alteration (CIA) by Price and Velbel (2003). The 26 samples with A/CNK values 1.4 were considered to have undergone alteration and have been taken out of the statistics. The other 152 samples used in Fig. 5a, b can be reasonably considered not to have been substantially affected by pedogenic processes. The composition of the volatiles enclosed in the volcanic rocks consists primarily of H2O, CO2, CH4, and other compounds of sulfur, carbon, chlorine, nitrogen, and hydrogen (Table 2). These compounds, when ejected into the atmosphere, could have affected the climate as both greenhouse gases, e.g., CO2 and CH4 (Shindell, Schmidt, Miller, & Rind, 2001), and volcanic aerosol from sulfurrich gases (Metzner et al., 2014)."

    "heading": "5. Simultaneous volcanism in northeast Asia",
    "text": "We subdivided the entire continental region into 7 stratigraphic successions involving SB and northeast Asia volcanic rocks. Stratigraphic columns were correlated among different areas, focusing on the Aptian to lower Albian succession (Fig. 6). The marine facies of the Lower Cretaceous sequence decrease rapidly from the\ncontinental edge of the Eurasian plate westward to the inland area. The general stratigraphic sequence in the entire region is characterized by volcanogenic successions commonly intercalated by pyroclastics, black shale, and coal beds (Fig. 6), indicating a regional warm climate (Huang, Tan, Yang, Cao, & Li, 1999).\nTable 3 lists the estimation of area, thickness, and volume of the volcanic rocks erupted in the northeast Eurasian continental margin during the Aptian and early Albian. Although the data can only provide a reasonable range for the distribution parameters, the mean values provide reasonable descriptive constraints on the volcanic successions. The area of the continental region is approximately 5.43 106 km2, which is covered by Lower Cretaceous volcanics over an area of approximately 2.34 106 km2. The mean thickness of the volcanics is from 0.35 to 1.2 km, which had been determined by drilling data and outcrop measurements. The actual thickness should be substantially greater than those listed in Table 3 if the related underlying igneous systems are considered. The total volume of the volcanic associations that erupted between the Aptian and early Albian reached a magnitude of at least 1.8 106 km3 on the continental margin. If the LOI value of the SB volcanics in Fig. 5 is used as a reference number for the volatile contents trapped in the volcanic rocks, the total weight of the volatiles hosted in the volcanics of the region would be up to 1.26 1014 tons. However, the amount of volatiles ejected into the atmosphere during the AptianeAlbian eruption would be 1.89 1014 tons if a value of 1.5 is used as the ratio between the degassing of primary volatiles into air and the host lava inclusion of primary volatiles (Leavitt, 1982). This indicates that the large amount of volcanic gases listed in Table 2 (H2S, CO2, CH4 and analogues) would have been ejected into the atmosphere during the Aptian eruption in the region. Because the eruptions were strong, explosive Plinian and phreatomagmatic eruptions, a large portion of the volcanic gases and ashes would have risen to the stratosphere (Fig. 4) (Bonadonna & Costa, 2013)."

    "heading": "6.1. Isotopic anomalies in marine deposits",
    "text": "It has been demonstrated in geologic history that fallout from tremendous volcanic explosions can change isotopic signatures in marine water and/or sediments. For example, a large drop in seawater 87Sr/86Sr during the middle Ordovician was associated with large volcanic ash falls (Young, Saltzman, Foland, Linder, &\nKump, 2009). The initial ratio of (87Sr/86Sr)i of the Aptian volcanic rocks and fallout exploded from the Songliao Basin and adjacent area (in short SB-V) ranges from 0.70187 to 0.70660, and the ratios of (206Pb/204Pb)i, (207Pb/204Pb)i, and (208Pb/204Pb)i from the SB-V range between 17.70 and 18.41, 15.51 and 15.58, and 37.53 and 38.22, respectively. The shift in (87Sr/86Sr)i is commonly from the pre-excursion value of 0.70750 to the most negative value of 0.70720 recorded in marine deposits during 125e113 Ma (Jenkyns, 2010). All of the shifting values are within the pre-Aptian high level of 0.70750 and the mean value 0.70433 for the SB-V. Similarly, the lead isotopic record of BarremianeAptianmarine deposits indicates values between the pre-excursion high values of 18.8 (206Pb/204Pb)i, 15.66 (207Pb/204Pb)i, and 38.7 (208Pb/204Pb)i and the mean values of 18.15, 15.55, and 37.98, respectively, for the SB-V (Fig. 7). It is therefore reasonable to conclude that rhyolitic volcanic ash falls from the violent Aptian eruptions of the SB-V must have contributed to the isotopic signatures of the contemporaneous marine deposits according to the following three factors. The first factor is that the time period matched with each of the two events, the SB-V and negative isotope excursions of marine deposits in the MidPacific. The second factor is space affinity because the SB-V volcanoes were developed on the active continental margin of the circum-Pacific domain. The third factor is that the Aptian eruptions of the SB-V were mainly strong and explosive, and therefore generated a high volume of fine-grained volcanic ash that could potentially reach a high altitude in the atmosphere. It should be noted that the SB-V appears to have had an insignificant impact on the strontium isotope excursion after 112 Ma (Fig. 7), which may be appropriately explained by the changes in eruption types. The Aptian eruptions were acidic and predominantly explosive, with a large portion consisting of fine-grained volcanic ash (Fig. 4). However, following a short eruption quiescent episode, the Albian eruptions were primarily intermediate and mafic effusive eruptions, withmuch less volcanic ash. In addition to the eruption types, the transport of volcanic ash would be through wind-driven processes (Man, Zhou, & Jungclaus, 2014), and the dust fall from the volcanic eruptions would be randomly deposited. As a result, the volcanic ash contribution to marine deposits should be expected to be irregular. This characteristic of volcanic fallout may better explain the contrast in isotopic signatures of lead and osmium recorded in the Aptian marine deposits from both the Pacific and Italy (Bottini et al., 2012; Kuroda et al., 2011) because in some cases, the signatures may be influenced by volcanic ash components and be controlled by paleo-wind direction rather than by paleo-ocean circulation. Further work would be required to consider the\ntephra chronology and geochemical correlation between volcanic ash of the SB-V and possible ash components enclosed in the simultaneous marine deposits."

    "heading": "6.2. Global climate change and OAE-1a",
    "text": "The link between volcanism and climate is complicated (Zielinski, 2000). Volcanic eruptions may cause climate change in different ways (Zielinski et al., 1994), either through cooling resulting from scattered solar radiation caused by both volcanic aerosol and ash dust, especially for the Plinian eruptions (Metzner et al., 2014), or through warming resulting from the greenhouse gases ejected into the atmosphere (Self, Widdowson, Thordarson,& Jay, 2006). However, the cooling impact on climate would typically be shorter and stronger relative to the long-term accumulative greenhouse effect (Moriya, 2011; Robock, 2000; Shindell, Schmidt, Mann, & Faluvegi, 2004; Stenchikov et al., 2006). The Aptian volcanic eruptions in the Songliao Basin and northeast Asia (SB-V) were volatile-rich Plinian and phreatomagmatic eruptions that ejected a large volume of volcanic ash and gases into the atmosphere (Figs. 2, 4), including both aerosol and greenhouse gases (Table 2). Transient global cooling at the onset of the early Aptian OAE-1a was indicated by isotopes of contemporaneous shallow marine carbonates and was probably triggered by changes in radiative forcing (Kuhnt, Holbourn, & Moullade, 2011). DeBond, Oakes, Paytan, and Wortmann (2012) proposed a model regarding the forcing of volcanic particles in the global sulphur cycle based on the isotopic signatures of marine deposits at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) site 765 in the western Indian Ocean. This model assumed a sevenfold increase in the mantle degassing rate from 121 Ma to 120 Ma. The extremely strong, explosive eruptions of the SB-V began at approximately 119.9e120.2 Ma (Table 1), which is in agreement with the timing of the transient global cooling and the worldwide abrupt isotopic changes in marine deposits. A magnitude of ca. 1.89 1014 tons of volcanic volatiles was ejected into the atmosphere from the SB-V Aptian eruption (Table 3) and a large portion of themwere gases that form aerosols, such as hydrogen sulfide (Table 2). In addition to volatiles, a large amount of volcanic dust was generated and a large portion of the dust would have potentially entered the stratosphere (Fig. 4). We therefore infer that the SB-V must have played a role in the early Aptian global climate changes by causing changes in solar radiation and global circulation patterns of climate, and modifications of the global carbon cycle, which may be similar to the observed modern processes described by Langmann (2014)."

    "heading": "6.3. Comparison between the OJP and the SB-V",
    "text": "The area of the AptianeAlbian volcanic province in the Songliao Basin and northeast Asia (SB-V) is comparable in size to the OJP but formed in two phases within 20 Myr (Fig. 2), whereas the emplacement of the OJP seems to have occurred only in the early Aptian (Fitton et al., 2004). Thus, it appears that the northeast Asia volcanism might have been important for the long-term climatic trends but not as important in the short term, such as during the OAE-1a. However, the SB-V strong, explosive Plinian and phreatomagmatic eruptions (Fig. 4) could raise the massive clouds of ejected dust and gases high enough to reach the stratosphere (Bonadonna & Costa, 2013), which would have the capability of cooling global climate for several years after each eruption similar to the recent cases described by Zielinski (2000). We therefore infer that the transient global cooling at the onset of the OAE-1a\n(~120 Ma, Kuhnt et al., 2011) could be impacted to some extent by the SB-V because the acidic explosive mega-eruptions in the SB also began at approximately 119.9e120.2 Ma (see Table 1 and Fig. 2)."

    "heading": "7.1. The SB-V",
    "text": "The time span, lithology, eruption type, and magnitude of the SB-V are as follows. The AptianeAlbian volcanism was widespread in the Songliao Basin and northeast Asia, covering an area of ca. 2.3 106 km2, which may match the magnitude of the contemporaneous Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) flood basalt in the western Pacific (area of 2.0 106 km2, Wignall, 2001; Fitton et al., 2004). The mean thickness of the SB-V confirmed by borehole and outcrop\ndata ranges from 0.35 to 1.2 km and has a total volume of at least 1.8 106 km3. If the underlying igneous systems are considered, the total volume of the SB-V would be much greater. The intense, explosive volcanic eruptions occurred successively from 121 Ma to 109 Ma. The large scale of the strong, explosive eruptions of the SBV resulted in a large volume of volcanic ash and at least 1.89 1014 tons of volcanic volatiles were ejected into the atmosphere (Table 3)."

Similarly, lead isotopes in Pacific marine deposits showed shifting values between preexcursion levels and mean magmatic values of the SB-V (Fig. 7). It was therefore probable that volcanic dust contributed to the isotopic record of marine deposits, considering the time, space, and eruption type of the SB-V."

    "text": "The massive volcanic dust and degassing compounds ejected high into the atmosphere from the SB-V began in the early Aptian (119.9e120.2 Ma), which was the same time of the transient global cooling at the onset of the OAE-1a (Kuhnt et al., 2011). The abrupt cooling could be attributed to an increase in the reflection of sunlight caused by a dramatic increase of the atmospheric burden of aerosol/volcanic dust, partly due to the contemporaneous SB-V. The greenhouse gases outgassed from the SB-V 121e109 Ma (Figs. 2, 4) may have played a role in the subsequent long-term global warming and increasing partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the atmosphere from the Aptian to the early Albian."

  "abstractText": "Volcanism is a natural climate force that causes variations in temperatures. The Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE-1a) was preceded by a prominent negative C-isotope excursion attributed to major volcanism of the Ontong Java plateau (OJP), which presumably resulted in a pCO2 increase and a climatic change. However, the OJP alone may not adequately explain some important isotopic signatures such as the negative strontium-isotope excursion from 125 Ma to 113 Ma that is recorded in the corresponding marine deposits. We present an independent and hitherto undocumented case, the giant Aptian volcanism in the Songliao Basin and northeast Asia (SB-V) on the Cretaceous active continental margin between the Eurasian and the Pacific plates, which covered an area of ca. 2.3 106 km2, nearly matching the simultaneous case of the OJP. Intensive strong, explosive volcanic eruptions of the SB-V occurred at 121e109 Ma and introduced a large volume of fine-grained volcanic ash and degassing volatiles into the atmosphere. The Aptian isotopic ratios (87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb) of marine carbonates from the Mid-Pacific shift in values between their Barremian pre-excursion high values and the negative magmatic values of the SB-V. The transient global cooling at the onset of the OAE-1a coincided with the beginning of the violent acidic eruption of the SB-V (119.9e120.2 Ma). We therefore infer that the SB-V must have played a role in the Aptian global climatic changes and OAE-1a through the heavy fall of volcanic dust and the outgassing of aerosol and greenhouse gases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
