    "text": "This paper concerns the synchronous periodic activation of groups of earthquakes and volcanoes in cases in which the intensity of the events and the distances separating them seem to exclude direct interaction and mutual triggering. The theme appears sporadically in the scientific literature, but the research in this field is often frustrated by the lack of reliable observations over long time periods. Here I tried to give some contributions looking at the particular case of Italy, which has high-quality historical catalogs covering about the last millennium.\nThe periodic or quasiperiodic recurrence of earthquakes on faults is a key point for time-dependent seismic hazard analysis, supported by the elastic rebound theory [Reid, 1911] and by observations, like paleoseismological data [Scharer et al., 2010]. Extending the analysis to systems of faults, it is possible that large earthquakes trigger other large earthquakes on nearby structures, leading to synchronization [Scholz, 2010], but there is no study evidencing a joint cyclic behavior. On the other hand, far earthquakes, even of intermediate magnitude, can synchronize [Bath, 1984; Tsapanos and Liritzis, 1992; Liritzis et al., 1995], possibly with periodic recurrence [Liritzis and Tsapanos, 1993], which is explained as the effect of an external forcing. Various authors have studied the possible role played by cycles of solar irradiance, solar/lunar tides, and Earth’s rotation rate changes [Liritzis and Tsapanos, 1993; Mazzarella and Palumbo, 1989; Riguzzi et al., 2010; Sidorenkov, 2009]. The most recent study is that by Scafetta and Mazzarella [2015], who analyze the spectral coherence between climate oscillations and the worldwide occurrence of M≥ 7 earthquakes since 1900. By power spectrum estimation, they find that global seismicity has a major spectral peak at a period between 50 and 60 years, which is tentatively related to solar/lunar cycles and to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.\nCycles of activity are recognized for volcanoes. For example, Carta et al. [1981] propose amodel for the behavior of the Vesuvius that involves the sequence of four phases: repose, persistent activity, intermediate eruption, and final eruption (the limits of this model are discussed by Scandone et al. [2008]). Nearby volcanoes can synchronize among them, both on single episodes or over long time periods [Walter et al., 2014], possibly triggered by earthquakes [Marzocchi et al., 2004; Walter et al., 2009]. Recently, Palladino and Sottili [2014] investigated on the possible global synchronization of strong eruptions in relationship with variations of the angular velocity of Earth’s rotation, which is characterized by some periodicity. Finally, considering earthquakes and volcanoes together, it is known that they are connected in various ways. For southern Italy, Nostro et al. [1998] investigated the relationship between Vesuvius eruptions and earthquakes, considering the interaction through elastic stress transfer. But, for what I know, neither this paper nor other similar studies evidence a synchronized activity with periodic characteristics.\nBRAGATO SEISMO/VOLCANIC CYCLES IN ITALY 134\n• The findings have implications for geological hazard in Italy\nCorrespondence to: P.

(69 earthquakes in the magnitude range 6–7.4 with aftershocks removed) to assess the existence of some periodicity. I found that, superimposed to the long-term trend, there is a seismic cycle lasting about 55 years. The cycle involves the entire country (an area extending more than 1000 km in latitude) and synchronizes earthquakes occurring on north, in a mainly compressive domain, with those occurring on center and south, where normal faulting prevails [Montone et al., 1999]. The periodicity is strong enough to emerge also in the earliest part of the catalog, when the level of seismicity was lower and the information about earthquakes less reliable: with a break between 1500 and 1600, the 55 year cycle can be likely extended back to 1100. The oscillation has a correspondence in the eruptive activity of some of the major volcanoes in Italy, in particular of Vesuvius. The distance and the relatively low magnitude of the events induce to exclude their direct interaction and suggest the existence of an external controlling mechanism. I focused my attention on climate processes involving huge mass redistribution, like oceanic circulation, ice and snow melting, and intense rainfall. Through loading and unloading, they can change stress conditions and influence the activity internal to the geosphere [McGuire, 2010, 2013, and references therein]. The interest for such processes arises because they are characterized by a 60 year periodicity [Klyashtorin et al., 2009; Scafetta, 2014a] similar to that of Italian seismicity and volcanism. The oscillation is observable for climate indexes like the global surface temperature [Klyashtorin and Lyubushin, 2003; Scafetta, 2010; Courtillot et al., 2013], the global sea level [Jevrejeva et al., 2008; Church and White, 2011; Chambers et al., 2012], the North Atlantic Oscillation [Mazzarella and Scafetta, 2012], the Pacific Decadal Oscillation [d’Orgeville and Peltier, 2007], and the monsoon rainfall in different regions of Asia [Agnihotri and Dutta, 2003]. Recent works go beyond the statistical characterization and try a physical explanation of the phenomenon. Wyatt and Curry [2014] suggest that the oscillation emerges internally to the Earth climate system, thanks to a complex network of mutual interactions among different climate processes. According to Scafetta [2013, 2014b], the periodicity should be driven externally by solar cycles, which in turn depend on movements of Jupiter and Saturn. Among the periodic climate processes, sea level changes are of particular interest. In fact, their role on controlling seismic and volcanic activities is suggested by a number of observations and physical/numerical models at different timescales, from millennial to seasonal [McGuire et al., 1997; Tolstoy et al., 2002; Hampel et al., 2010; Guillas et al., 2010]. Moreover, the conformation of Italy and the relative position of the seismic sources (Figure 1a) might amplify the effect [Luttrell and Sandwell, 2010]. In the following, after observing the strict synchronization of the oscillations, I suggest that sea-related triggering is one of themain factors governing the periodicity of earthquakes and eruptions in Italy."

I extended CPTI11 up to the end of the year 2013 with data from the Italian Seismological Instrumental and Parametric DataBase [ISIDe Working Group, Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, 2010], with local magnitude ML replaced by Mw drawn from the EuropeanMediterranean Regional Centroid Moment Tensor Catalog [Pondrelli et al., 2011], available online at http://www.bo.ingv.it/RCMT (last accessed January 2015). Statistical analysis based on the fit of the frequency-magnitude distribution of earthquakes to the Gutenberg-Richter model [Woessner and Wiemer, 2005] shows that the catalog is complete for magnitude Mw≥ 6. I considered such part of the catalog with aftershocks removed, the latter individuated with the algorithm by Gardner and Knopoff [1974]. The selected data set includes 92 earthquakes that occurred between 1117 and 2009 (69 since 1600) with magnitude in the range 6–7.4 (circles in Figure 1a).\nFor the volcanoes, I considered the eruptions that occurred in Italy since 1000A.D. reported in the Smithsonian’s Global Volcanism Program (GVP) database (Siebert et al. [2010], http://www.volcano.si.edu).\nBRAGATO SEISMO/VOLCANIC CYCLES IN ITALY 136\nthe case, for example, of the last eruption of Vesuvius: according to GVP it started in 1913, lasted for 31 years, and the VEI 3 is attributed considering the final phase, occurred in March 1944. For this work I referred to the initial dates of the eruptions, because they gave the best correspondence with the time distribution of earthquakes."

    "heading": "3. Analysis",
    "text": "I compared the smoothed time density of earthquakes and eruptions estimated with the Gaussian kernel method [Bowman and Azzalini, 1997]:\nf̂ tð Þ ¼ 1 N XN i¼1 φ ti t; hð Þ; (1)\nwhere t1,…, tN are the times of occurrence of the events,ϕ(z;h) is the kernel function (normal density function in z with mean 0 and standard deviation h), and h is the smoothing parameter (I used the two values 10 and 40 years to analyze the short-term and the long-term trends, respectively). The uncertainty of the estimate is captured by the interval\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi f̂ tð Þ q ± ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi α 4Nh p 2 where α ¼ ∫φ2 z; hð Þdz (2)\ncalled variability band, which is an approximation for the confidence interval f̂ tð Þ±σ (σ the standard error). The distribution of earthquakes since 1100 is illustrated by the blue curves in Figure 1b. In particular, the long-term behavior (thick blue line, computed for h= 40 years) evidences low activity in the Middle Age, a strong increase between 1600 and 1700, persistent high activity till about 1850, and an abrupt decrease in the last century. It is debatable if the drastic changes are real features of seismicity or rather due to shortages of the catalog. The former hypothesis is supported by the strong correspondence with the long-term activity of the Vesuvius (thick red line in Figure 1b), deriving from independent observations. In particular, I focused on the almost synchronous short-term oscillation, well visible in the period of strongest activity, after 1600 (thin blue and red lines in Figure 1b, computed for h=10 years). The periodic behavior of seismicity since 1600 is analyzed into detail in Figure 2. To assess the characteristics of the oscillation, I fitted the smoothed time density (blue line in Figure 2a) by nonlinear regression using the function\nf tð Þ ¼ aþ bx þ cx2 þ A sin 2π t t0ð Þ=Tð Þ a ¼ 9:05; b ¼ 0:010; c ¼ 2:8 10 6; A ¼ 0:036; T ¼ 55:3; t0 ¼ 1902\n(3)\n(continuous red line in Figure 2a) including a quadratic component for the long term (dashed red line in Figure 2a), and a sinusoid for the oscillatory part. The estimate has residual standard error σ =0.04, with\nBRAGATO SEISMO/VOLCANIC CYCLES IN ITALY 137\nTo judge the persistence in time of the oscillation, I compared the sine curve estimated after 1600 with the detrended time density of the 23 earthquakes that occurred between 1100 and 1600 (red and blue lines in Figure 3, respectively). I obtained the\nbest correspondence after shifting the sinusoid by 15 years toward the past. The agreement is good, with seven out of nine theoretical peaks present and well synchronized in the observed time series.\nThe detrended curves of seismic and volcanic activities are compared in Figure 4. The best match occurs between the Italian earthquakes and the eruptions of the Vesuvius (blue and red lines in Figure 4a, respectively). The two time series have six corresponding peaks, four of which are well synchronized. The Vesuvius missed only the peak around 1970, but in that period its broad area was struck by two phenomena that could indicate the preparatory phase of an eruption. One is the moderate seismic swarm of 1978–1980 (M< 3) located by the volcanic edifice [Scandone et al., 2008]. The other, of larger impact, is the bradyseism (slow vertical ground movement) of the Campi Flegrei caldera [Lima et al., 2009], with two uplift episodes: one of 1.7m between 1969 and 1972, the other of 1.8m between 1982 and 1984 (the overall period 1969–1984 is indicated in Figure 4a). Although the Campi Flegrei are located about 30 km west of the Vesuvius, there is evidence that the two volcanic systems are related or even linked [Danyushevsky and Lima, 2001; Walter et al., 2014].\nBRAGATO SEISMO/VOLCANIC CYCLES IN ITALY 138\nThe overall eruptive activity of Vulcano and Stromboli, in the Aeolian Islands, is summarized in Figure 4b (red line). There is an evident oscillatory behavior that roughly agrees with that of seismic activity, although with a time shift of 25 years (about half the duration of a seismic cycle). In comparison with the shifted sine curve of earthquakes (green line), the volcanoes have six corresponding peaks of activity and miss two peaks, one around 1650, the other after 1950.\nThe last volcano considered in this study is the Etna, which is the most active in Italy, with 99 eruptions since 1600 (Figure 4c). In this case there is no clear correspondence with the short-term variations of seismicity. Furthermore, in the last century it is characterized by overall increasing activity, in opposition with Vesuvius and earthquakes.\nI considered the possibility that the eruptions of Vesuvius are triggered by earthquakes. Such hypothesis appears contradicted by Figure 4a, where in at least four cases the peak of eruptions precedes that of seismicity. More in detail, of 25 eruptions occurred since 1600, just 7 were preceded by an earthquake in the previous year, 3 of which located at more than 300 km from the volcano (such number increases from 7 to 16 considering the 3 years before each eruption)."

    "heading": "4. Discussion and Conclusions",
    "text": "The observed 55 year oscillation appears to be a significant common feature involving the Italian seismicity and the volcanic activity at Vesuvius and at the Aeolian Islands. It is important for seismic hazard analysis, because the number of events added/subtracted to the long-term rate is significant (±0.58 earthquakes in about 27 years). Such result confirms at the local level, but for a much longer time period, that obtained by Scafetta and Mazzarella [2015] for worldwide strong earthquakes (M≥ 7) occurred since 1900. In their analysis, global seismicity is dominated by a major harmonic component having a period between 50 and 60 years, with peaks of activity that precede those of the Italian seismicity by about 10 years. The extreme regularity over a large spatial scale and for two different geophysical processes (earthquakes and volcanic eruptions) suggests the existence of an external forcing. I decided to investigate the possible contribution of sea level changes. The first reason for this choice comes from studies at the global level, which show a similar 60 year oscillation [Chambers et al., 2012]. Furthermore, the direct effect of sea level variations on crustal stress accumulation is well documented in the literature [Luttrell and Sandwell, 2010; Hampel et al., 2010]. It is also hypothesized that the variable sea load could modulate the seasonal occurrence of earthquakes in Japan [Murakami and Miyazaki, 2001] and the recent activity of volcanoes [McNutt, 1999]. For eastern Italy, the nontidal oceanic loading (NTOL) of the Adriatic Sea has significant effects on the vertical deformation at the seasonal timescale [Zerbini et al., 2004]. There is no similar assessment for the horizontal deformation, but an analysis conducted for the nearby area of Pyrenees [Ferenc et al., 2013] indicates that NTOL dominates on such component. Furthermore, the induced horizontal strain has amplitude comparable to that of tectonic origin so that it could affect and modulate the occurrence of earthquakes. For my analysis, in the absence of instrumental multicentury time series for Italy, I referred to the reconstruction of global sea level (GSL) by Jevrejeva et al. [2008] and the derived GSL rate (mm/yr). Such reconstruction covers the time period 1700–2002 and is entirely based on tide gauge measurements, the earliest of which collected in northern Europe, at Amsterdam, Liverpool, and Stockholm. Such data evidence the monotonic increase of GSL (about 300mm since 1700), with substantial acceleration in the last two centuries (GSL rate increasing from about 0.5mm/yr to 3mm/yr). I considered the two time series of GSL and GSL rate smoothed by nonparametric Gaussian kernel regression [Bowman and Azzalini, 1997] using a bandwidth of 10 years. Furthermore, I removed the long-term trend, estimated by quadratic fit. The resulting curves (green lines in the two panels of Figure 5, note the use of a reversed y scale) appear roughly anticorrelated with the seismicity of Italy. Cross-correlation analysis indicates that the hypothetical causal effect should involve the GSL rate rather than the GSL itself. In fact, for the couple GSL rate/earthquakes the Pearson correlation coefficient reaches the absolute minimum value r= 0.58 for a time lag τ =+6years (the behavior of seismicity follows in time that of the GSL rate, compatibly with a causal relationship). For GSL and earthquakes the anticorrelation is higher (r= 0.70), but it is reached for a negative time lag (τ = 8), which is against the hypothesis of a causal effect of GSL. The results are similar for the Vesuvius activity, in which case correlation analysis gives r= 0.42 and τ =+9 years for the GSL rate and r= 0.60 and τ = 7 years for GSL.\nBRAGATO SEISMO/VOLCANIC CYCLES IN ITALY 139\nfind that a 60 year oscillation of sea level is common to the northern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. A more subtle question concerns the physical mechanism according to which the variable oceanic loading affects seismicity and volcanism. There are accurate models on how such loading stresses the lithosphere, either at the millennial timescale [Luttrell and Sandwell, 2010] or seasonally [van Dam et al., 2012]. In particular, such works evidence how stress accumulation is amplified by particular geographical features, like the presence of narrow strips of land or the proximity to semienclosed bays or seas, all conditions that apply well to the Italian territory. The interaction of such additive stress with earthquakes is complex and depends on the geometry and the strength of faults [Luttrell and Sandwell, 2010]. Despite of this, I found that seismic cycles are synchronous in different tectonic domains, involving both normal and reverse faults. Such common behavior could be explained by the model developed by Hampel et al. [2010]: under loading, the variation of horizontal stress caused by flexure of the viscoelastic lithosphere is larger than that of vertical stress caused by the load, which inhibits seismicity in both extensional and contractional domains. I note that the model considers a fault placed just under the load and its validity at some distance from the coast, like for earthquakes in Italy, should be carefully evaluated. For the volcanic activity, there is evidence that it is accelerated by both loading and unloading, depending on the geometry of the stress changes and the characteristics of the volcano [McGuire et al., 1997]. For example, in a study at the millennial timescale Glazner et al. [1999] find that volcanic eruptions in eastern California preferentially occurred during interglacial periods, when the ice load in the area was at its minimum. Differently, McNutt [1999] finds a significant positive time correlation between the eruptions of Pavlof Volcano in Alaska and the yearly nontidal increases in sea level. Specifically for the area of Vesuvius, Paterne and Guichard [1993] find a periodicity of 24,000 years in volcanic activity and suggest a control by glacio-eustatic pressure variations. My previous correlation analysis showed that seismic and volcanic activity is more likely triggered by changes of GSL rate rather than by changes of the GSL. The finding agrees with the conclusions reached in previous studies: both Toda et al. [2002] and Bettinelli et al. [2008] furnish evidence that sesimicity is better controlled by the stressing rate rather than by the absolute level of stress; for volcanism in the Mediterranean area,\nBRAGATO SEISMO/VOLCANIC CYCLES IN ITALY 140\nMcGuire et al. [1997] find that the activity is more intense when the sea level rate is at its extreme values (both positive and negative).\nIn the long term (thick lines in Figure 1b) the reduced activity of earthquakes and Vesuvius in the last century almost coincides with the GSL acceleration described by Jevrejeva et al. [2008]. For the Vesuvius, the acceleration could be one of the causes for its current long-lasting rest, in alternative or in parallel to other causes, like those internal to the volcano discussed by Scandone and Giacomelli [2013]. For earthquakes, the increased oceanic load could have a much larger effect and justify the decreasing seismicity observed in the entire Northern Hemisphere since 1900 [Bragato and Sugan, 2014].\nThe activity of Vesuvius may help to clarify the role of volcanoes in the climate change. It is known that the aerosols produced by large eruptions can cause a significant reduction of the global surface temperature in the following few years (e.g., 3 years for the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines [Self et al., 1996]). More complex and controversial the impact of the volcanic activity at longer timescales. Here I concentrate on the cyclic changes. Otterå et al. [2010] find that volcanoes could affect the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which has a quasi 60 year period [Delworth and Mann, 2000]. The case of Vesuvius seems rather an indication for the inverse. Since its emissions are, in general, moderate (it reached VEI 5 only for the eruption of 1631), and apparently insufficient to act at the global level, it is more likely that its periodicity follows that of the climate rather than controlling it.\nAs a final point, I evidence how the strict correspondence between seismic and volcanic historical activities mutually support and reinforce the confidence on their source catalogs, demonstrating that they are valuable tools for geophysical investigation."

  "abstractText": "The analysis of the time distribution of the major earthquakes that occurred in Italy since 1600 reveals that seismicity alternates periods of higher and lower activities over cycles of about 60 years. The same rhythm is present in the eruptive history of the Vesuvius. The large spatial scale of synchronization leads to suppose an external forcing. A hint on its possible origin comes from climatology, where a quasi 60 year cycle is found for various parameters and processes. A hypothesis, also supported by other studies, is that seismicity and volcanism are controlled by cycles of sea level rise. The mechanism could justify similar regularities observed for seismicity in other areas (e.g., cycles of earthquakes in the southern San Andreas Fault, in California) or for strong earthquakes at the global level. The increasing oceanic load of the last century could be coresponsible of the current long-lasting rest of the Vesuvius.",
