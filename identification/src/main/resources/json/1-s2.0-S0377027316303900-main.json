A new analysis has shown that the geomorphological traces offluvial or lacustrine processeswithinMangala Valles can be better explained by fluid lava flooding the channels and filling pre-existing impact craters. As for the circum-Chryse outflow channels, where no clear source of water or mechanism able to replenish water at its hydraulic head is observed, there is no geologic trace of a sudden removal of a volume of water (ice) necessary to carve Mangala Valles. Neither maars nor rootless cones, typical volcanic features indicative of interaction between lava and ground ice, were found. Past works suggested that the formation of Mangala Valles occurred in late Amazonian age when the climate of Mars was similar to that seen today, that is absolutely not liquid water friendly. The present work shows how the origin of Mangala Valles may go back to Noachian or even Pre-Noachian when other studies have concluded that the climate was not liquid water friendly. Even assuming limited periods of obliquity favourable to liquid water in the history of Mars, which is at odds with the widespread presence of unaltered olivine and jarosite, it is very difficult to find plausible mechanisms of aquifer recharge or signs of catastrophic water release at the Notch of Mangala Valles that could feed the multiple episodes, or even a single episode, of fluvial flooding suggested in the literature. This evidence and other analysis will show that the presence of water and, eventually, ground ice is not incontrovertible in the equatorial regions and should not be given for granted as commonly done so far in the literature. The geomorphological analysis of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) images provided in this paper, combined with THEMIS and MOLA data, showhowMangala Fossa, fromwhichMangala Valles originated as a breakout, is an erosional channel formed by the flow of lava in a original tube coming fromDaedalia Planum rather than a tectonic graben or the sign of a dike rupturing to the surface.\n© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "Mangala Valles is a ~900–1000 km-long, 165 km-wide, outflow channel always thought as formed by catastrophic flooding of water (Baker and Milton, 1974; Ghatan et al., 2005) initiated through mobilization of shallow aquifers by volcanic intrusions (Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Dohm et al., 2001; Hanna and Phillips, 2006; Leask et al., 2007a, b; Basilevsky et al., 2009; Burr et al., 2009; Bargery andWilson, 2011). The head ofMangala Valles is located along the ~220 km-long, ~6 km-wide, and ~1 km deep, Mangala Fossa on a volcanic flood plain sloping towards Amazonis Planitia (Fig. 1). A volcanic-only origin was initially proposed for several other outflow channels located in the largest volcanic provinces of Mars, but not for Mangala Valles (Carr, 1974). Other works suggested alternative hypotheses of formation, including glacial erosion (Lucchitta, 1982), debris flow (Nummedal and Prior, 1981),\nand eolian erosion (Cutts and Blasius, 1981). Volcanic (Leverington, 2004) and mixed volcanic-fluvial processes (Keske et al., 2015) regained consideration. A description of all thesemechanisms of formation will be given in the discussion section. Several other papers have suggested the volcanic origin of the outflow channels (Jaeger et al., 2007; Leverington, 2007; Leverington, 2011; Leone, 2014) and one of them mentions the problems related to the poor stability of liquid water in the low-pressure atmosphere of Mars (Leverington, 2011). New evidence supports a volcanic-only erosional origin for Mangala Valles without any water and tectonism involved. The most important evidence is observed along Mangala Fossa and along the course of Mangala Valles. Mangala Fossa was interpreted in the past as a graben opened by the intrusion of a dike from which water trapped in the cryosphere spilled out to carve Mangala Valles (Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Ghatan et al., 2005; Leask et al., 2007a). However a dike or a sill rupturing to the surface should leave trace of lateral flows (e.g. perpendicular to thefissure) all or partially along its length.Magma coming out from tectonic fractures showing vertical and/or horizontal displacement\nwas observed at Prometheus Patera (Leone et al., 2009) and Zal Patera (Bunte et al., 2008) on Io, but does not seem to be the case at Mangala Fossa. Also, the hypothesis of a dike approaching but not reaching the surface to potentially warm up the putative cryosphere to release groundwater (Wilson and Head, 2004) was analysed. These hypotheses raised several questions. Howmuchwater is required to carve Mangala Valles? Was this water potentially available underground? How can water be replenished or a cryosphere be present in sufficient amounts at the hydraulic head of Mangala Valles to feed multiple episodes of flooding suggested by Tanaka and Chapman (1990), Zimbelman et al. (1992), and Basilevsky et al. (2009)? How can liquid water survive in the low atmospheric pressure of Mars after phreatomagmatic (explosive) activity? Why does magma coming from depth not raise at different heights the sides of Mangala Fossa? Why is no significant tectonic displacement observed along Mangala Fossa (i.e. a large scale strikeslip fault)?Which type of tectonic stressmight selectively produce fractures inside a pre-existing impact crater and none on its rim crossed by Mangala Fossa? This paper will answer these questions and will show how the erosional power of lava flowing in a tube (Greeley et al., 1998) or in channels (Hurwitz et al., 2010) can provide an alternative\nexplanation to water or to a dike rupturing onto the surface for the formation of both Mangala Fossa and Mangala Valles. The lack of any kind of displacement shown by MOLA profiles along the sides of Mangala Fossa (Fig. 2) raises doubts about a putative tectonic origin. This does not necessarily mean that other fossae onMars might not be of tectonic origin, every situation must be evaluated case by case based on the available evidence.\nThe direct observation of lava flows through high resolution CTX and HiRISE imagery, combinedwith a global geomorphological andmineralogical analysis of the surface of Mars, was fundamental to understand the volcanic origin of Valles Marineris, of several other circum-Chryse outflow channels, and of all the valley networks once thought to be fluvial networks (Leverington, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2011; Leone, 2014, 2016). The same approach will be used here to better understand the origin of Mangala Valles. The available geological maps of Mangala Valles made by Chapman and Tanaka (1993), and particularly by Keske et al. (2015), provided a basis for the discussion and the new interpretation of the geological units. An alternative interpretation of several geologic units will be given in this paper and will be compared to that made by Keske et al. (2015), every description and age of the\nunits that will be discussed in this paper refers to their geologic map. The description of the geomorphology will start from the source of Mangala Fossa through the head of Mangala Valles and then will follow its whole course, including all the distributaries, to the mouth at Amazonis Planitia. The bed-floors of Mangala Valles and its distributaries are dusty but there is enough visual and alreadymapped evidence of lava flows (Keske et al., 2015) and of unaltered olivine (Ehlmann et al., 2010) to confirm theflowof fluid lava of likely basaltic composition. The exact sources of the lava flows and of the geological units within Mangala Fossa were unspecified in the work of Leverington (2007) and partially specified in that of Keske et al. (2015) so this work will clarify the possible sources of the geological units, including eventual correlations outside Mangala Valles.\nLastly, this work will discuss the formation of Mangala Valles in the context of the overall volcanic history of Mars, which is now enriched of new important information (Leone et al., 2014; Leone, 2016). This work will provide a better understanding of the formation of single features at regional scale, focusing particularly on the nature of Mangala Fossa (e.g. erosional vs. tectonic), which is crucial to determine the source(s) of the lava flows that draped Mangala Valles."

    "heading": "2. Mangala Fossa and the source of Mangala Valles",
    "text": "THEMIS and CTX images, supported by MOLA data, show in detail the sources of both Mangala Valles and Mangala Fossa (Fig. 3). The source of Mangala Valles is directly connected to Mangala Fossa (Fig. 3a), through a bottleneck informally called “the Notch” (Ghatan et al., 2005), and it is geomorphologically very similar to the breakouts observed in volcanic channels along Valles Marineris (Leone, 2014) and Jovis Fossae (Plescia, 2013). The youngest lava flows coming from Daedalia Planum have embayed a ridge that divides Mangala Valles from Daedalia Planum (see Fig. 4i for a close-up). These flows appear geomorphologically very similar to other fluid lava flows erupted from Arsia Mons (Crown and Ramsey, 2016). The lava flows coming from Daedalia Planum, channelized into Mangala Fossa, were able to slightly enlarge a wedge into the ridge and this wedge continues towards a pit chain across the ridge (Fig. 3b). Immediately beyond the western side of the ridge, the floor of Mangala Fossa is enlarged and contains a thin central chain of mounds and isolated mesas morphologically similar to those visible in central Coprates Chasma. Mangala Fossa shows a breakout about 50 km from the ridge, becomingMangala Valles (Fig. 3a), and continues its course to the west (Fig. 3c). The local gradient of topography, declining both to thewest and to the north as inferred by the altimetry in Fig.1 of this paper and by the profile in Fig. 2 of Leverington (2007), favoured the opening of the lateral breakout and diverted the main stream of lava towards Mangala Valles. The opening of the breakout was further aided by the presence of a bottleneck in the narrowest\nsection of Mangala Fossa just west of the Notch (Fig. 3a), a process previously seen along Valles Marineris (Leone, 2014). The geomorphology still shows a narrow section of Mangala Fossa immediately west of the Notch and a wide section to the east (Fig. 3a). The terraces located on both sides of Mangala Valles after the Notch indicate the gradually decreasing flow of lava from Mangala Fossa once the eruption faded out. However, the stream of lava to Mangala Valles was sustained long enough to carve its whole course, including several other breakouts along the course of Mangala Valles and several tear shaped structures (henceforth TESS) that will be described in the next sections. The geological map made by Keske et al. (2015) provided a useful coverage of Mangala Fossa in the section between the two ridges that border Mangala Valles. The lava flows inside Mangala Fossa were included in their volcanic unit Asp3 that formed the main channel of Mangala Valles. No overflows were reported along the whole section of Mangala Fossa, as would be expected in a fissure eruption from a dike reaching the surface, but lava was primarily channelized through the Notch. The source of Mangala Fossa shows two nested channels of different section and a smaller one separated by the others (black arrows in Fig. 3f). The smallest and northernmost of these channels (indicated by the black arrow on top of Fig. 3f) is separated from the others, but still retains the typical morphology of the pit chain because has not received enough lava flows to bewell eroded and enlarged. In fact, it is located in a lateral andmore sheltered position from the Daedalia Planum lava flows. The smaller of the two nested channels is at an intermediate stage, in which the nested tip still retains the rounded shape of the pit chain whereas its flooded part looks more like a fossa (black central arrow in Fig. 3f). The larger channel is at a more advanced stage of fossa and crosses the breached rim of an unnamed crater eroded by lava flows coming from Daedalia Planum. The lava flows are still visible and clearly channelized in several points to flow into Mangala Fossa (southernmost black arrow in Fig. 3f). Thus, the stage of pit chain is still visible across the ridge that separates Mangala Valles fromDaedalia Planum (Fig. 3b) as well as at the source of Mangala Fossa (Fig. 3f).\nMOLA data along the whole course have shown that there is neither vertical nor horizontal displacement between the sides of Mangala Fossa (Fig. 2a, b, and c). The rims of the craters and the ridges crossed by Mangala Fossa retain their original shapes and show no displacement. This is particularly evident on a crater crossed along the lower course and centred at coordinates 19.19 S–152.43 W (Fig. 3c and e); the northern and southern rim appear perfectly intact. All that can be observed in the area is a tributary crossing the nearby ridge on the eastern rim (Fig. 3e), and a distributary on thewestern rimwith sub-parallel overflows according to the gradient of topography, which declines from east to west (Fig. 3c).\nMOLA data also gave important information on the depth and the section's shape of Mangala Fossa along its length. Mangala Fossa is\nsimilar to Coprates Chasma due to the same mechanisms of erosion in original lava tubes (Leone, 2014):\na) The flattest in its upper course where there is more direct access to lava filling coming from Daedalia Planum. b) The deepest in its median and lower course where there is less direct access to lava filling from Daedalia Planum; profiles reveal an average depth of 600–400 m along the lower course and 1000– 500 m along the median course while the average depth at the source and along the upper course is only 400–200 m; profiles along the median and the lower course still show a V-shaped bed-floor.\nIt is worth noticing that Mangala Fossa does not receive significant contributions from tributaries. Some lava flows try to outflank the ridge from the south, but they do not reachMangala Fossa (black arrows in Fig. 3c). The only possible feeder could be the lava tube located in the shallow underground below the ridge alongMangala Fossa as indicated by the pit chain shown in Fig. 3b. The width of such a tube can be estimated by the width of the pit chain observed on the ridge and should\nbe nomore than ~5–6 km. The slopemight be inferred by the difference of height between the two sides of the ridge (around 500m). This information will be useful to roughly estimate the flow of lava that can pass through it per unit of time."

    "heading": "3. The upper course of Mangala Valles",
    "text": "The upper course of Mangala Valles is characterized by TESS, mapped as Asp2 unit and likely shaped as teardrops by the stream of lava corresponding to the unit Asp3 along the main channel. The walls of the main channel exhibit terraces indicative of several episodes of flooding (Fig. 4c), or decreasing level of lava during a single episode, and several parts of chaotic terrain (Fig. 4b). The chaotic terrain was mapped in two distinct geological units, (polygonal blocks with dissecting canyons) Apb and (small knobs) Ask units (Keske et al., 2015). Although surrounded and evidently embayed by the Asp3 volcanic unit these TESS were interpreted as of fluvial origin (Keske et al., 2015), assuming the term “fluvial origin” as formed by a flow of liquid water. The Apb and Ask units are still part of the same island in which the Asp2 unit is also present and appear embayed by the Asp3 unit\n(Fig. 4b). The related presence of the Asp2 unit on this and other islands located within the channel and the superposition relationships among the various units involved suggest that the Apb and Ask units were just chunks of Asp2 volcanic terrain eroded by the Asp3 flow unit. Already for this reason the differentiation between Apb, Ask, and Asp2 should not have been made. The ages obtained from the crater counts by Keske et al. (2015) show some visible inconsistencies. The Ags unit was considered younger than the Asp2 unit although the Asp2 is superposed on it (Fig. 5). The contact between these units was even interpreted as fluvial cataracts (Keske et al., 2015), without details on\nthe possible water sources. The geomorphological analysis of the Fig. 4b shows how the Asp2 unit is a volcanic unit located on top of the stratigraphic column on both sides of the channel, including the islands located in the middle of the channel. Then, the Asp3 volcanic unit carved its way across this sequence of layers forming Mangala Valles as we see it today. Lava of the Asp2 unit flooded the corridor between two ridges, starting from the inter-crater plains in Terra Sirenum (Fig. 1). A contributing source of the Asp2 lava flooding, tracked back as far as Terra Sirenum, seems also the couple of Noachian volcanoes Sirenum Mons and Sirenum Tholus.\ntext image for the upper-median course ofMangala Valles focused on the cataracts located is figure.

(2015). These units were formed by the same flow front (the ridge) dividing Daedalia Planum fromMangala Valles. A similar argument applies to the other ridge on thewestern side of Mangala Valles. The eHv was formed by the same flooding episode that formed the Asp2 unit. The Asp3 unit, erupted from Daedalia Planum and channelized throughMangala Fossa, is the result of the episode that produced a subsequent erosional stage controlled by the preexisting topography (Fig. 4b) and thus formedMangala Valles. The Asp3 flow started to erode the Asp2 unit and then continued downwards through the whole stratigraphic sequence eroding older units, being the Ags unit below the Asp2. Themounds of theAsk unit were previously polygonal blocks similar to those of the Apb unit before being further eroded and rounded by the streamof the lavaflow that formed the Asp3 unit. The space among the mounds, which appears filled by the lavas of the Asp3 unit, was once the network of dissected channels still visible in the Apb unit. The network of dissected channels of the Apb unit ends up into two larger channels that leave the island to the north, showing how the Asp3 lavaswere able to cross thewhole island. The same network of dissected channels is also observed in the Apb units located on the right side of themain channel, to the east of the island, along the direction of the stream of (Asp3) lava (Fig. 4b). The eastern part of the island, labelled as Asp2 unit, is not eroded because located on a topographic high and thus out from the reach of the Asp3 lava flows. Although the stream of (Asp3) lava eroded the older (Asp2) flow fields, forming a TESS around an impact crater located in themiddle of themain channel (Fig. 4c), the channel at the left of the TESS wasmapped as being of fluvial origin (Ast) while the channel at the right of the TESS was mapped as volcanic (Asp3) by Keske et al. (2015). The analysis of the position of the units in Fig. 4c shows that the Asp3 unit appears younger than the Ast unit just before the TESS, but suddenly Keske et al. (2015) interpreted it as older (Ast superposed on Asp3) just after the TESS (top left corner of the Fig. 4c). The observations in this area revealed other geological inconsistencies among the units mapped by Keske et al. (2015). A few mounds not completely eroded away by the Asp3 flows arewhat remain of the older Asp2flows in themiddle of the channel (Fig. 4d). Thesemounds, already seen at the erosional stage of larger\nFig. 6. The geological units indicated in the panels of this figure are Keske's units.

(2015), the text; the dashed semi-circular line indicates the original rim, extrapolated from the shape\nislands in the southern section of the main channel, were mapped both as Hrt and Asp2 units with Ast terraces (Fig. 4c). In the sector of the channel imaged in Fig. 4d these units were mapped as a whole new Alk unit, which also includes the terraces of the Ast unit.\nMoving further northward along the left side of the channel, it is possible to see an impact crater with its eastern rim completely eroded away and its floor flooded by the stream of lava (Fig. 4e). The breach in the rim of this crater was considered the result of Asp3 volcanic flooding but its floor not mapped as an Asp3 unit by Keske et al. (2015). Another breached and flooded crater further to the north, also located on the same left side of the channel, was instead mapped as Asp3 (Fig. 4a and f). There is even evidence of backwash lava flows out of the crater interferingwith the lava stream in the channel (Fig. 4f).\nMoving eastward, away from the main channel, it is still possible to follow the stratigraphic sequence of volcanic layers seen in the upper course ofMangala Valles. The Asp2 unit is still on top of the stratigraphic column but a new and older Asp1 unit suddenly appears to the north just below the Asp2 unit in themap of Keske et al. (2015). Their geologic map indicates as the source of this unit a breach 1.5 km wide into the northwest rim of a filled crater obliterating the northern side of the ridge that divides Daedalia Planum from Mangala Valles (Fig. 4g). First, the breach in the crater rim is not a geologic boundary, lava in the unit AHv cannot suddenly become another unit Asp1 after passing the breach; second, its age cannot become older than that of the unit Asp2 because it is superposed on it. So an older Asp1(=AHv) than Asp2 in themedian course ofMangala Valles is a geological inconsistency. Another comparison of ages comes from the superposition relationships between the Asp2 and Ags units, the latter still being considered a younger unit of fluvial origin by Keske et al. (2015). The geomorphological analysis has shown that the Ags unit is an older volcanic layer than the Asp2 unit instead, being the latter superposed on the former (Fig. 4h). The same superposition relationship was observed to the south (Fig. 4b) and in the cataracts (Fig. 5). The geomorphological analysis of these unitswas facilitated by the observation of the available CTXmosaics from different perspective to improve the view and thus the interpretation. The Ags unit is found only on the eastern side of the main channel along the upper course of Mangala Valles (Fig. 5a), where the\nntext image for the lower-median course of Mangala Valles, here the main channel forms\nain channel breaches a crater rim on its western side to feed Labou Vallis as far asMedusae\n33040_1731_XN_06S155W, centred at 6.98 S–155.85 W and taken at the mouth of Labou\nrections (black arrow at the centre of the image).

(2015), appears superposed on the Ags unit (Fig. 5f). It is evident in all the images how the putative fluvial erosion of the Ags unit is not affecting the Asp2 unit. Morphologically, any fluvial activity that formed the Ags unit must have eroded the Asp2 unit all the way along the channel but this is not the case (Fig. 5f). The Ags unit surrounding the streamlined features is located stratigraphically below the Asp1 and Asp2 units. This would indicate that these areas were probably produced by the lava flows of a flooding episode preceding the emplacement of the Asp2 unit. No volcanic features typical of interaction between lava and ice are observed in the images thus suggesting that no ground ice was present before the emplacement of the Asp2 unit."

    "text": "Labou Vallis\nThe median course of Mangala Valles is characterized by an increased number of breakouts, the main of which is Labou Vallis, which formed a network of interconnected channels and some chaotic terrains (Fig. 6a). Lava of the Asp3 unit flowed westward to Labou Vallis to\ndischarge into the Medusae Sulci, the stream of lava is still visible on the bed-floor (Fig. 6b). The formation of Labou Vallis is quite interesting. The stream of lava opened a breach by both thermal and mechanical erosion into the rim of an impact crater, according to a mechanism well explained by Hurwitz et al. (2010), and flooded in. Another hypothesis in which lava may have flooded through pre-existing inlets and outlets of the craters formed by water (Goudge et al., 2012) should show typical features formed by the interaction of lava with previous water (ice) left in the interstitial pores of the ground, but these are not present here as well. Nevertheless, aided by the local topography, the lava flows did not get out from the crater back into the Mangala Valles channel but opened another breach on the opposite side of the crater rim and flooded into a confining larger crater continuing through all the impact craters encountered along the way (Fig. 6a and c). While opening its way across the craters and across a damof roughHrt terrain, the lava stream carved the Labou Vallis' main channel towards the Medusae Sulci through a small network of interconnected channels (Fig. 6c). According to the geologic map of Keske et al. (2015), lava of the Asp3 unit breached the impact crater and formed Labou Vallis. The continuity of the Asp3 stream of lava from Mangala Valles is very easy to see but, strangely, was suddenly interpreted as Ast unit beyond the largest impact crater crossed by Labou Vallis in the Keske et al. (2015) map (see also Fig. 6c). Other inconsistencies are the TESS labelled as\nAlk, although these were clearly carved into the Hrt unit, and the floors of some impact craters labelled as “flat craters floors” when it is even clearer that they were flooded by the same lava of the Asp3 unit (Fig. 6c). Similar inconsistencies can be seen going back to the main channel of Mangala Valles where the Asp3 lava flows were mapped again as scoured terrain Ast (Fig. 6d and e), TESS were mapped as Alk (Fig. 6c), a new unit Asp4 appeared as continuation of Asp3/Ast (Fig. 6d), a terracing was mapped as Ats just before the entrance of Labou Vallis (Fig. 6d), and a knobbed terrain was mapped as scoured terrain Ast (Fig. 6d). Near the entrance to Labou Vallis, Mangala Valles formed a first bifurcation: an eastern channel and awestern channel divided by an island of Hrt and Asp2 units (Fig. 6d). Keske et al. (2015) mapped the western channel as Ast unit and the eastern channel as Asp3 unit although it is clear that both units were formed by the same eruptive episode Asp3 (Fig. 6e). The Asp2 unit is here reduced by lava erosion in a thin dam that closes the central bed-floor (Fig. 6f). From this point onwards, Mangala Valles bifurcated again in two distinct channels: the right branch heading to north-north-east and the left branch heading to north. The left branch is subdivided in two other channels: Sabis Vallis and Minio Vallis. These channels formed interesting circular features similar to roundabouts in the Asp2 unit that filled pre-existing impact craters. The first of these features is found along Sabis Vallis and is here informally named “The Little Roundabout” (Fig. 6g). Sabis Vallis surrounded the Little Roundabout (Fig. 6g) and opened a breach (Fig. 6h) into a couple of nested impact craters (see also Fig. 6a for a larger context view). These craters, logically crossed by Asp3 lava as seen in Fig. 6d, were simply mapped as flat floored craters by Keske et al. (2015). Minio Vallis formed “The Big Roundabout” around a larger crater (Fig. 6h), this informal name is also given here for the first time. From these roundabouts onwards, sinuous channels carved their own paths across the Asp2 and Hrt units connecting Minio Vallis to Sabis Vallis (Figs. 6h, 7b and c). Along the main channel ofMangala Valles the streamof lava of the Asp3 unit eroded a crater and left a crescent shaped sediment mapped as flat-floored crater (ffc) unit by Keske et al. (2015), see exclamation mark in Fig. 6i. A semi-circular dashed black line inferred from the shape of the crater indicates the missing part (Fig. 6i)."

This network is as complex as the one coming out from the roundabouts. A breakout from Minio Vallis discharged directly into Amazonis Planitiawhereas other breakouts formed sub-channels bringing lava to Minio Vallis (Fig. 7d). A few chaotic terrains are found along Minio Vallis (Fig. 7e). A flat-topped deposit of remnant lava flows can be found along the course of Sabis Vallis as far as its mouth towards Eumenides Dorsum; these are likely lava flows of the Asp3 unit (Fig. 7f). A close-up of the lava flows observed at the mouth of Mangala Valles (Fig. 7d and h) shows consistency with those observed at the mouth of Sabis Vallis (Fig. 7g), Minio Vallis (Fig. 7h), and Labou Vallis (Fig. 6b). This observation indicates that the lava flows of the Asp3 unit discharged directly to Amazonis Planitia along the various distributaries. The flow fronts and their superposition relationships observed in Amazonis Planitia suggest that the Asp3 flows coming fromMangala Valles are older than the lHt flows coming from the channel located at the south of Amazonis Mensa (Fig. 7h), exactly the opposite of what estimated by the crater counts in Keske et al. (2015). The geomorphological analysis of the Mangala Valles' mouth revealed that the origin of Padus and Asopus Vallis is not fluvial, as stated by Keske et al. (2015), but rather volcanic. A breakout of Mangala Valles diverted Asp3 lava into the lateral Hrt unit to the east and fed the flows that carved Padus Vallis and then Asopus Vallis as a breakout of Padus Vallis (Fig. 7i)."

The geomorphology of water and lava are quite similar (i.e. Dietterich and Cashman, 2014) and only the analysis of several factors characterizing the environment of Mars may allow the exclusion of water in favour of lava as the likely fluid that carved the channels. Among these factors, the low atmospheric pressure assumes a key role for the instability of water. The same environmental factors do not affect the eruption of lavaflows and the formation of rivers of lava on the surface of Mars."

    "text": "The sculpture by glacial erosion was suggested as an obvious mechanism after the observation of the brines deposited on the surface of the planet (Lucchitta, 1982). However, this mechanism remains highly hypothetical and not supported by any direct observation of glaciers in the equatorial regions of Mars. These glaciers should already be visible at the resolution of the MRO imagery but nothing was ever seen so far. Observations have instead shown that water and dry ice sublimate between night and day in the cold weather of Mars at equatorial latitudes (Thomas and Schimel, 1991; Thomson and Schultz, 2007). The observations at the Phoenix landing site have shown how ice sublimated in about four sols even at higher latitudes (around 66° North) than Mangala Valles when brought to the surface from the shallow underground (Smith et al., 2009). There is no surviving glacier, underground ice, or any other under formation observed at equatorial latitudes between ±30° (Cutts and Blasius, 1981; Dundas et al., 2014; Brough et al., 2016). Somewell-formed glaciers should be observable at the equator in the current cold climate if a source of atmospheric water was available, but there is no reported case. Lucchitta (1982) also proposed that wet based ice would have moved readily by slipping over the ground. Bargery and Wilson (2011) postulated that this particular process has negligible erosional capability onMars and further detailwill be given in the next subsection. Even assuming a temporary increase of the temperature by punctuated volcanism (Halevy and Head, 2014), the main problem for the stability of ice or liquid water on the surface of Mars is the low atmospheric pressure."

    "text": "Themechanism suggested by Bargery andWilson (2011) is based on a short-lived (17.9 h) turbulent flow ofwater-ice slurry located beneath ice rafts, which becomes of an admitted (by the same authors) negligible erosional capability as soon as the flow becomes laminar. Even assuming that sufficient water might be available at the source of Mangala Valles and stay liquid above the volcanic heat, which is already unrealistic because of the low pressure environment of Mars, themechanism proposed by Bargery andWilson (2011) is also afflicted by a lack of information on grain size distribution, including unrealistic sediment load of the turbulent flow phase, unrealistic porosity of the putative source aquifer, and unrealistic volume of water stored underground when compared to the eventual trace of subsidence/collapse that a sudden and catastrophic removal of such a large volume ofwater ice should leave on the surface. The estimates of water volumes made by Bargery andWilson (2011) to carve Mangala Valles were based on the unrealistic sediment load of 40% suggested by Komar (1980), and even 100% at its distal end, whereas water volumes up to two or three orders of\nmagnitude were suggested as more plausible (Andrews-Hanna and Phillips, 2007; Leverington, 2011), and on the unrealistic permeability of 10−7 m2, ~300 times larger than the most permeable aquifer on Earth (Ghatan et al., 2005). Even assuming eventual fractures increasing permeability underground, suchhyperconcentratedflows are not possible at all through erosion alone, wall collapse is needed all along the course of Mangala Valles (Kleinhans, 2005; Bargery and Wilson, 2011). The complete coverage of images of Mangala Valles showed that such a wall collapse may have occurred only in a limited sector of the upper course (Fig. 4b) and thus not enough to saturate all the volume of water required to carve the channel. The already low surface pressure of 6.1 mbar assumed by Bargery and Wilson (2011) to keep the slurry stable might have been even overestimated given that measurements within Gale crater showed variations from 2 to 6 mbar (Guzewich et al., 2016). The source of Mangala Valles is located at a height well above Gale crater (around 0 km of height, Fig. 1) and thus likely at a lower average pressure than Gale. Such a lower pressure would favour the phreatomagmatic activity proposed by Wilson and Head (2004) becausewould enhance the explosivity of the putative volcano ice interactions. However, there is no geomorphological trace of explosive activity (i.e. maars, tuff rings, tuff cones) in the whole area of Mangala Fossa – Mangala Valles but just evidence of fluid and quiet lava flows."

    "heading": "6.1.3. Eolian erosion",
    "text": "Cutts and Blasius (1981) disagreed with the sudden release of groundwater suggested by Carr (1979) and with the debris flow by Nummedal and Prior (1981) dismissing these hypotheses as “catastrophist views” based on “events that transformed the surface of Mars in nomore than a few days”. Cutts and Blasius (1981) noticed the absence of glaciers on the surface of the planet outside the polar areas and pointed out that the eolian hypothesis is based on processes “that acted over an extended period of time” still at work on Mars and thus implicitly preferable to “catastrophic events of which there is little evidence”. Although the views of Cutts and Blasius (1981) may be partially shared here, the main problem with eolian erosion is that their model is both statistically unlikely and unrealistic (Carr, 1979). The process is statistically unlikely because thewind should selectively remove thematerials from the ground only at the places where the outflow channels are located. Winds blow all over the planet but the outflow channels are only in the equatorial regions. Cutts and Blasius (1981) suggested that the material removed from the equatorial regions at a rate of 1600 × 106 tons/year was transported to the north polar region of the planet. They also stated that continuous eolian transport is highly unrealistic suggesting periodic events of transport of the order of 106 years occurring only 1/10% of the time. I can share the view that wind could be periodical (i.e. Ullán et al., 2017), even assuming preferential zones over pyroclastic deposits in which excavation may initiate, but I do not see why these same zones cannot be refilled with material transported by the wind from elsewhere. Global observation of dunes on Mars has indeed shown that 75% of the dunes are located between 70 and 85°N of latitude, but common sediment transport is towards the east and the west thus suggesting sediment source in local layered deposits (Hayward et al., 2013). The eolian hypothesis was previously debated by Greeley et al. (1976), who noticed a mismatch between the direction of the channels and the direction of the winds, but Cutts and Blasius (1981) invoked different atmospheric patterns in the past to justify the mismatch. However, invoking winds that may carve sinuous outflow channels directly proportional to the size of the volcanic provinces is more difficult to envision. Leone (2014) pointed out the proportionality between the size of the outflow channels and the size of the related volcanic provinces, something that might be more comfortably explained by eruption rates directly proportional to the extent of the volcanic provinces (Wilson and Head, 1994). The observation of the dunes onMars has also shown sand fluxes similar to those of Victoria Valley, Antarctica, implying similar rates of landscape modification\n(Bridges et al., 2012). By the way, no desert or pyroclastic deposit area on Earth shows outflow channels similar to those observed on Mars."

    "text": "The debris flow hypothesis by Nummedal and Prior (1981) for the formation of the outflow channels and associated chaos terrains was geomorphologically based on the observation of poor resolution Viking images andwas thought to be triggered by underground fluid escape. In the images published in their paper, the mounds of the chaos terrains may indeed appear as blocks of landslide material formed by retrogressive slumping of the head of the channel. They dismissed wind (Cutts and Blasius, 1981) and lava (Carr, 1974) as possible erosional agents because wind failed to explain the sinuosity of the channels and because “no volcanic deposits were positively identified in the region”. Although the former statement about the wind is plausible, the second statement about the lack of volcanic deposits is more difficult to accept given that the outflow channels are locatedwithin large volcanic provinces and on the slopes of large volcanic centres. Furthermore, Nummedal and Prior (1981) admitted the difficulty in assessing the triggering mechanism of the retrogressive slumping from geomorphology alone. They speculated on a variety of triggering mechanisms, including seismic events, meteorite impacts, and gradual reduction of internal strength, but ignored how lava carved channels on the slopes of well visible volcanoes. Observations along Valles Marineris, one of the larger and spectacular outflow channels that Carr (1974) excluded from being formed by lava erosion, have shown that indeed landslides enlarged the channel but these were triggered by the erosional flow of lava into the bedfloor according to Leverington (2009, 2011) and Leone (2014). Last but not least, Mangala Valles is not even mentioned in the Nummedal and Prior (1981) work as one of the possible examples for the debris flow mechanism of formation."

    "heading": "6.1.5. Tectonic origin",
    "text": "Mangala Fossa was also interpreted as a graben of tectonic origin (Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Basilevsky et al., 2009; Leverington, 2007). This view is not supported by the evident lack of both vertical and horizontal displacement all along both its sides and along some craters that the fossa crosses. There aremorphological similarities between the crater described in Section 2 and other floor-fractured craters (ffc) seen on the Moon (Schultz, 1976) and on Mars (Leone, 2016) but these have nothing to dowith large scale tectonic stresses. These craters can be better explained with thermal and mechanical erosion by lava (Hurwitz et al., 2010). The putative extensional pull that would have opened the putative fractures is neither accommodated by any compressional feature of proportional extent nor by any subduction zone elsewhere. Even invoking stresses formed by the rise of magma in the crust does not help, faults on Io formed by this mechanism have shown either vertical or horizontal displacement with lava spilling out all along the length of the fracture (Bunte et al., 2008; Leone et al., 2009). Tectonic processes on Earth have also shown aminimumvertical displacement rate of 0.5 mm/a (Fuhrmann et al., 2014); at such a rate a vertical displacement of 5 km on both sides of the walls should have formed in just 10 Ma and be visible along Mangala Fossa. The floor of Mangala Fossa should have been lowered also across the ridge as tectonic fractures ignore the topography. However, this does not seem to be the case even assuming the 800–700Ma of formation time estimated by Keske et al. (2015). The pit chain crossing the ridge along Mangala Fossa has an alternative explanation for its formation and this is not related to tectonism. It was already shown at Noctis Labyrinthus and Valles Marineris how pit chains can also be related to the presence of lava tubes or underground feeders (Wyrick et al., 2004; Leone, 2014). Thus, the pit chain that is visible on the ridge separatingMangala Valles from Daedalia Planum might be the sign of a shallow lava tube. Other authors have suggested the formation of pit chains with collapse processes related to lava tubes on Mars (Cushing et al., 2007; Léveillé and Datta, 2010) and to generic collapse processes associated to chasmata\non Venus (Wyrick et al., 2004). Other processes related to surface manifestation of dykes and faulting were suggested (i.e. Wilson and Head, 2002; Wyrick et al., 2004) but these are not applicable to Mangala Fossa for the lack of lateral flows coming out from the fossa along its whole length as already seen on Io (i.e. Bunte et al., 2008) and on Valles Marineris (Leone, 2014). The possibility that the pit chains may have a tectonic origin is excluded for the whole Mangala Fossa as well as was excluded for VallesMarineris but this does not exclude tectonic hypotheses of formation for other pit chains on Mars. Also, from the observation of Fig. 8, it should be quite straightforward to understand that the ridge might be the front of a previous large lava flow coming from Arsia Mons. Upon cooling, this ridge protectedMangala Valles from further lavaflooding. This interpretation should not be surprising considering the huge size and the huge amounts of lava erupted by the Tharsis volcanoes, Elysium Mons, and even Tyrrhenum Mons in their stages of formation. The same reasoning can also be applied to thewrinkle ridges, previously interpreted as of tectonic origin (Plescia, 1991),which can be smaller lava flow fronts instead (Leone, 2016). It is worth noting here that Mars never had plate tectonics forming mountains (O'Rourke and Korenaga, 2012) so the preferred interpretation in this work, supported by the geomorphological analysis, leans towards the volcanic hypothesis. Given that water cannot stay liquid onMars today or in the past (see also Section 6.3), and cannot produce ridges this large, the ridge bordering Mangala Valles might be a previous lava flow front probably coeval\nof the initial formation time of the lava tube that then evolved into Mangala Fossa by lava erosion during the late stages of activity of Arsia Mons. MOLA charts in Fig. 8 show how common are these thick flow fronts in the largest volcanic provinces of Mars."

    "text": "Fluvial events alternate to lava flowswere also proposed by Keske et al. (2015) but several inconsistencies in their geological mapping were found. Keske et al. (2015) interpreted the origin of the Asp3unit as spilling from the ridge bordering the eastern side of Mangala Valles, but the lava flows in the Asp3 unit are morphologically very similar to the lava flows found at the source and in the section of Mangala Fossa located within Daedalia Planum. The possibility that the origin of the Asp3 unit interpreted by Keske et al. (2015) could be only the debouchment of the original lava tube alongMangala Fossa, indicated by the pit chain crossing the ridge, is thus more than intriguing. Aside that they never suggested a plausible source for the liquid water, the Ags – Apb – Ask units interpreted by Keske et al. (2015) as the result of fluvial activity eroding the Asp2 volcanic unit are not in direct continuity with the Notch of Mangala Valles but appear rather patchy in the upper and median course and absent in the lower course.Where present, these “fluvial” units are limited to the contact among the Asp2 unit and the Ast and Asp3 units in a few sectors along the main channel. The Ast unit in\nws indicate the arcuate ridges at the border between the westernmost edge of the Tharsis spect to the latestflowsmantlingDaedalia Planum;Mangala Fossa and the SirenumFossae at emplaced the ridges. B) Global MOLA context image for the Northern Tharsis volcanic rupted from Olympus Mons and from Alba Mons. C) Global MOLA context image for the w fronts erupted from Elysium Mons. D) Regional MOLA context image for the Tyrrhena w fronts forming ridges.\nparticular showed the same geomorphological characteristics of the volcanic Asp3 unit and was observed in evident continuity to it along both Mangala Valles and Labou Vallis. So the mapping as Ast from here onwards is not shared in this paper, the continuity as Asp3 lava flow unit is recommended instead. This new interpretation is also supported by the similarity ofmorphology of the Asp3 lava flows seen near the source of Labou Vallis (Fig. 6d) with those seen along the upper course of Mangala Valles (Fig. 4c). Lava of the Asp3 unit eroded the Asp2 unit forming channels and polygonal blocks or knobby terrains that were then mapped as Apb and Ask, respectively, by Keske et al. (2015). Another inconsistency is the mapping of flooded craters as ffc units. The recommended interpretation all along Mangala Valles would be that fluid lava forming the Asp3 unit carved the bed-floor of Mangala Valles through the Hrt and Asp2 units, the Ast and ffc units should be replaced by the Asp3 unit, and the Ats unit should be replaced by Asp2 and/or even by Hrt unit (Table 1). The different degree of erosion of the same unit does not and should not make another unit. As seen in the upper and median course of Mangala Valles, and as seen all along Valles Marineris (Leone, 2014), the chaotic terrains are also here largely the result of lava erosion of the volcanic Asp2 unit. The terraces and the impact craters located between the Asp2 and the Asp3 units were flooded by lava (Figs. 4d, g, 6c, e, i), thus suggesting that the Asp2 unit was eroded by the lava flows that formed the Asp3 unit in all the Mangala Valles' channels."

    "heading": "6.1.7. Erosional origin by lava flows only",
    "text": "The geomorphological observation of the source of Mangala Fossa showed a direct continuity in the system of the channels carved by the lava flows of the Asp3 unit as far as the mouth of Mangala Valles. Lava tubes are frequently associated with eruptions of fluid lava flows (Cushing et al., 2007; Léveillé andDatta, 2010) andhave shown erosional evolution in fossae first and outflow channels afterwards at Valles Marineris on the opposite side of Tharsis with respect toMangala Valles (Leone, 2014). So it would be perfectly plausible that the same volcanic processes at Valles Marineris occurred at Mangala Valles as well. A lava tube may have thus formed naturally during the eruptions that emplaced the flow fronts bordering Mangala Valles, at the edge of Daedalia Planum, and may have then evolved into a fossa. The location of the original lava tube can be easily tracked because it was along the direction of Mangala Fossa heading into the wedge of the ridge (Fig. 1b). This wedge was already interpreted as flooded by volcanic lavas (Leverington, 2007) and as the source from which lava came out and moved to the east (Basilevsky et al., 2009). This interpretation was based on the observation at low resolution of some of the latest flow fronts that seem to depart from the base of the ridge and move to the east (Fig. 4a). The observation of the high resolution CTXwithin the context of the THEMIS imagery suggests that these lava flows came from Daedalia Planum instead and: a) flooded and almost buried an already well formed Mangala Fossa (Fig. 3f); b) embayed the ridge dividing Daedalia Planum from Mangala Valles (Fig. 4i); and c) were even bounced back by the ridge like the waves of the sea when reach a shore (Fig. 4i). This is confirmed by a CTX mosaic of a section of the ridge that shows how the lava flows embay it and do not erupt from it (Fig. 4i). A global view of the main volcanic provinces of Mars shows how common are the ridges similar to those bordering Mangala Valles and how their more or less arcuate patterns follow the borders or are even part of huge lava fields (Fig. 8). Thus, from the overall observation\nof the source area of Mangala Valles (Fig. 3c), it is reasonable to infer that the lava flows have not been erupted by any fissure but travelled from the lava fields of Daedalia Planum to cross the ridge through the tube alongMangala Fossa. A bottleneck or a dam intoMangala Fossa located to the west of the ridge favoured the opening of a breakout that formed the Notch and thus Mangala Valles. The gradient of topography declining from south to north from the Notch, see again Fig. 1 of this paper and Fig. 2 of Leverington (2007), and the strength of the stream favoured the channelling of lava through Mangala Valles in a network of dissected channels according to the mechanism of the preferential pathways suggested by Bleacher et al. (2015). The channelized stream of lava formed the TESS and then further deepened the Mangala Valles' channels mainly by mechanical erosion. Topography is also important for themechanism bywhich lava opens its way through craters forming inlets and outlets, thermal erosion is more effective on gradual slopes whereas mechanical erosion is more effective on steeper slopes (Hurwitz et al., 2010). Many craters crossed by lava through inlets and outlets are visible both along Mangala Valles and Labou Vallis. This observation combined with the arguments against the stability of water on Mars given in Section 6.3 ahead and with the acknowledgement of the Asp3 as volcanic unit contributes to strengthen the role of lava for the formation of Mangala Valles. It is thus likely that the formation of Mangala Valles might not be linked to the latest episodes of volcanism of Arsia Mons (i.e. lHt), but more related to a previous event (Asp3) to which Mangala Fossa had direct access through the shallow lava tube indicated by the pit chain. So it is important to explore the timeline of the volcanic events to see if there is any consistency with this view."

The ages inferred for the terrains on which the Mangala Valles are carved, including the ridge mapped as rough terrain (Hrt), range from 3.59 to 3.77 Ga (Keske et al., 2015). The geo-chrono-stratigraphic map of Mars indicates these terrains as Hesperian (Tanaka et al., 2014) so there is a substantial agreement among these ages regardless of the uncertainties related to the crater counts (Robbins et al., 2013). There are several issues that must be taken into account when estimating absolute ages through crater counts (Leone, 2016): a) the reduced flux of large impactors after the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) (i.e. Bottke et al., 2007), if LHB ever happened (i.e. Morbidelli et al., 2012), may have dramatically altered the clock and thus explain the apparently young lava flows of Arsia Mons from which Mangala Fossa originated; b) the ages of the geo-chrono-stratigraphic map of Mars (Tanaka et al., 2014), for example, rely on a crater database that has high uncertainties with the quasi-circular depressions (Robbins and Hynek, 2012), there are many craters that are half-buried under the lava flows just beyond the ridge borderingMangala Valles and Daedalia Planum (Leone, 2016), manymore are surely buried under the flanks of Arsia Monsmaking this volcano older than it appears; c) an evident example of such a discrepancy is also given in another region of Mars, the Cumberland sample was dated 4.21 ± 0.35 Ga through K-Ar measurements with respect to a younger (3.7–3.5 Ga) formation age of Gale crater estimated through crater counts (Farley et al., 2014). Leone (2016) showed how the lava flows coming from Tyrrhenum Mons reached, breached, and filled Gale crater via Farah Vallis finding an exit via Peace Vallis through the erosional mechanism explained by Hurwitz et al. (2010). So the age of the Gale lava filling might be strongly indicative of the age of Tyrrhenum Mons' activity. These issues raise the intriguing hypothesis that even the youngest lava flows of Daedalia Planum might not be as young as shown in the Tanaka et al. (2014) geo-chrono-stratigraphic map of Mars thus bringing the clock back in time along the whole stratigraphic column. The Asp3/Asp4 volcanic unit of Mangala Valles was even dated between 0.4 and 0.3 Ga (Keske et al., 2015). Such a relatively recent formation age for the volcanism\nwas also suggested for some late episodes on the flanks of Arsia Mons dated with the crater counts (Werner, 2009). However, such young ages are quite difficult to reconcile with both the thermal history and the thick crust of the planet. The observational evidence shows that the Asp3 lava flows were channelized into Mangala Fossa through Daedalia Planum, so it is difficult that the volcanism of Arsia Mons might have been prolonged until the Amazonian (Leone, 2016). The self-consistent hypothesis of formation for the Martian dichotomy and the consequent onset of volcanism (Leone et al., 2014), validated by the discovery of twelve volcanic alignments (Leone, 2016), suggests that the volcanic activity of Arsia Mons and Sirenum Mons, from which the units Asp2 and Asp3 within Mangala Valles derived, peaked in the Pre-Noachian (4.5–4.1), declined in the Noachian (4.1–3.9 Ga), and completely ended in the Hesperian (3.5 Ga ago at the latest). Keske et al. (2015) estimated a volcanism of Amazonian ages through crater counts but they did not make any correlation to the thermal history ofMars to see if there is any consistency. The decline ofMartian volcanism and the consequent shutdown of its magnetic field (~4.1–4.0 Ga ago; Acuña et al., 1999; Lillis et al., 2008;Williams et al., 2008) reveal the transient nature of the internal heat of theplanet. This view is supported by other thermal models that suggested Hesperian as maximum limit for volcanism on Mars (Hauck and Phillips, 2002; Grott et al., 2005) with an exception extending until Amazonian (Baratoux et al., 2011). However, Baratoux et al. (2011) suggested that a thick crust would prevent volcanic activity even in case of a still internally hot Mars. A thick crust is a plausible hypothesis for West Tharsis where Mangala Valles is located (Williams et al., 2008). Based on the southern polar giant impact (SPGI) model ages of Sirenum Mons, Sirenum Tholus, and Arsia Mons (Leone, 2016), volcanic centres which contributed to the formation of the Asp2 flows (Fig. 1), and on the crater count ages of Xiao et al. (2012), I would place the Asp3 unit that formed the Mangala Fossa – Mangala Valles system between 4.05 and 3.99 Ga (see Table 2). A later formation is excluded because lava tubes do not cross solid obstacles. Given that the Asp3 unit of Mangala Fossa and Mangala Valles crosses both Asp2 and Hrt units, and that Asp2 unit crosses the corridor made by Hrt unit, the conclusion is that Asp3 follows both Asp2 andHrt. So a lava tube formed during the Hrt eruptive event was later exploited by the Asp3 eruptive event to form and enlargeMangala Valles. Calculations in Section 6.4will showhow the timescale of the eruptive events is much shorter than absolute geologic age intervals. So the events that formed Hrt, Asp2, and then Asp3 units are essentially coeval on a geologic timescale, although the Asp3 event followed the other two events. Being all this volcanism older than Hesperian and Amazonian ages, respectively, the letters H andAwill be both changed into theN of Noachian in Table 2. Noachian is conservatively chosen as trade-off between Pre-Noachian and Hesperian because also supported by the crater counts ages of Xiao et al. (2012). A prolonged volcanic activity from Pre-Noachian to Amazonian appears unsustainable for the above-mentioned thermal models and obviously unlikely. Keske et al. (2015) even placed the putative fluvial activity (Ags unit older than Asp3) of Mangala Valles in Amazonian times when the climate of Mars already reached its cold and dry current state. A wet climate found only at Mangala Valles is unlikely and in stark contrast with the available climate models that lean towards globally dry and cold (Forget et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2015). The\nmineralogical evidence that will be discussed in the next section will further show how the climate of Mars was evidently not liquid water friendly since the Noachian. The low pressure of the Martian atmosphere does not even allow the stability of dry ice or water ice that sublimate at middle-low latitudes despite the low temperatures and the presence of salts observed at the Phoenix landing site (Smith et al., 2009). Only the very low temperatures at the polar caps allow stability of ice on the surface. HiRISE observations of craters exposing ice have shown total instability at equatorial latitudes where the Mangala Valles are located and time limited stability above 40–50° of latitude (Dundas et al., 2014)."

    "text": "The analysis of isotopic data from carbon, nitrogen, and argon suggested a big loss of volatiles during the first 500 Ma (Gillmann et al., 2011; Lammer et al., 2013; Kurokawa et al., 2014; Krasnopolsky, 2015; Villanueva et al., 2015). Such a loss is consistent with an acute phase of volcanic degassing coeval to the strongest phase of volcanism that Mars ever had as consequence of the SPGI (Leone, 2016). The water degassed is the sum of thewater originally contained inmagma coming from themantle plus thewater encountered bymagma along the rise in the crust. This loss is supported by authors who suggested that early Mars (4.5 Ga ago) had a global equivalent layer of 137 m available to fill the lowlands with an ocean (Villanueva et al., 2015). However, the argument that all this degassed water formed an ocean in the lowlands is not supported by thewidespreadpresence of unaltered olivinedeposited by that same coeval early volcanism, a global map shows that both the lowlands and the highlands have strong predominance of unaltered olivine (Ehlmann et al., 2010). The time necessary for the alteration of olivine into serpentine due to contact with water is restricted to a narrow window between 100 and 10 k years (Oze and Sharma, 2007; Stopar et al., 2006). Thewidespread presence of unaltered olivine in Noachian volcanic terrains (McSween et al., 2006; Rogers and Bandfield, 2009; Ehlmann et al., 2010), including Mangala Valles, rules out the option of recharge through atmospheric water (i.e. rain), even for limited warm periods of 10 ka obtained through favourable obliquity (Jakosky et al., 1995; Laskar et al., 2004). Also problematic for the hypothesis of periodic fluvial events alternate with volcanic events at Mangala Valles are: a) the visual lack of those volcanic features (i.e. maars, tuff rings, and rootless cones) typical of the interactions of lava with ice that a fluvial event should leave in the interstitial pores of the ground; b) the lack of a mechanism of water replenishment (Leverington, 2011) and tectonic faulting at the head ofMangala Valles to supportmultiple flooding episodes suggested by Tanaka and Chapman (1990); c) and the absence of evidence for a sudden removal of a volume of terrain more or less equivalent to the volume of Mangala Valles to support even a single episode of flooding suggested by Bargery and Wilson (2011).\nThe few serpentine observed at Nili Fossae and other few locations onMars, but not Mangala Valles, must have been formed in the shallow subsurface where water was still at pressures high enough to circulate in 400–600 °C hydrothermal fluids (i.e. Evans, 2004, 2010), and then erupted with lava onto the surface. Furthermore, the close association of unaltered olivine with jarosite found at the Opportunity landing site in Meridiani Planum (Madden et al., 2004) and at the Curiosity landing site in Gale crater (Vaniman et al., 2013) suggests a plausible scenario that jarosite may have formed directly from the small amount of water contained in fluid lava and then preserved by a dry environment immediately afterwards. Glauconite, often associated to carbonates and gypsum and believed to form at surface temperature on Earth (Hillier, 1995), was not found on Mars and only prehnite provided some evidence of hydrothermal alteration in the subsurface (Ehlmann et al., 2011). So it is reasonable to infer that most of the water was degassed and was lost to space (Kurokawa et al., 2014; Villanueva et al., 2015) with scarce or none available at liquid state to flow on the surface of Mars. The unaltered jarosite excludes that a putative ocean lasted for\nless than 100 years or 10 ka because it rapidly forms iron oxyhydroxides in humid climates (Madden et al., 2004). Even the study of the valley networks watersheds on the highlands suggested an arid to hyperarid Noachian paleoclimate (Irwin et al., 2011)."

    "text": "Keske et al. (2015) suggested a single fluvial event caused by dike intrusion between 800 and 700Ma ago,with a recurrence of alternate volcanic and fluvial episodes. The hypothesis of the single fluvial event is not new in the literature (i.e. Ghatan et al., 2005; Bargery and Wilson, 2011) but the sources of water are always hypothetical, still given for granted, and not supported by the above-mentioned mineralogical and environmental arguments. Leone (2014) showed why chaos terrains are not an unequivocal morphological evidence of collapse for melting of ground ice because they can be related to erosion of flowing lava. Except for polar areas and middle-high latitudes, it is very hard to find a clear and direct evidence of glaciers or underground water ice at equatorial latitudes (Cutts and Blasius, 1981; Dundas et al., 2014; Brough et al., 2016). Other authors (i.e. Souness et al., 2012; Levy et al., 2014) have proposed debris aprons as glacier-like forms (GLF). Debris aprons are not direct evidence of glaciers but may also be the result of landslides formed by dry or lava-induced mass wasting processes (McEwen, 1989; Soukhovitskaya and Manga, 2006; Bigot-Cormier and Montgomery, 2007; Leone, 2014; Leone, 2016). Another recent attempt to provide some evidence of underground water ice using the sounding radar instrument (SHARAD) of the MRO (Karlsson et al., 2015) produced ambiguous results because the dielectric constant for water used in the experiments is very similar to that of dacitic lava or porous basalt (Russell and Stasiuk, 1997); porous basalt could have been plausibly formed by the above-mentioned volcanic degassing. Although the interpretation of the lava flows is shared andwell supported in Keske et al. (2015) paper, the occurrence of fluvial events mentioned above in the Keske et al. (2015) and in other work (Tanaka and Chapman, 1990; Wilson and Head, 2004; Ghatan et al., 2005; Leask et al., 2007b; Basilevsky et al., 2009; Bargery and Wilson, 2011) still remains problematic in the environment of Mars which is unfriendly to liquid water both today and in the past.\nLeask et al. (2007a) based their volumetric estimates of the channels upon thosemade by Tanaka and Chapman (1990), who indicated a total eroded volume of 3 × 1012m3. This result was obtained assuming an average depth of 100 m by 30 km of width over a total length of 1000 km for the Mangala Valles-Fossa system. Available MOLA profiles, where crossing the channels, revealed a range of depths spanning an average of 200 m from the upper course of Mangala Valles to Labou Vallis and an average of 800 m from Labou Vallis to the mouth of Mangala Valles with a upper limit of 1000 m at the source and at the mouth. A survey based on available CTX images has returned some reliable results on the average width of the Mangala Valles channel system. Starting from the conservative estimate of the 5 km wide pit chain on the ridge along Mangala Fossa (Fig. 3b) and the 5.5–6 km wide Notch (Fig. 3a), the main channel of Mangala Valles enlarges progressively reaching a maximum of 165 km in the TESS sector described in Fig. 4. Then the main channel progressively narrows to 25 km measured at the source of Labou Vallis (Fig. 5d). At this point, slightly more than 500 km have been run with an average channel width of ~100 km. From here to the mouth of Mangala Valles the main channel splits in a network of subchannels of variable width from the 4 km of Sabis Vallis (Fig. 6g) to the 6 km of Minio Vallis (Fig. 6h). For practical reasons, from this count are even excluded many other sub-channels less than 3 km of width that, of course, also provide their volumetric contribution. A simple sum of all these estimates gives a total conservative volume of roughly 18,000 km3, 6 times the 3000 km3 estimate made by Tanaka and Chapman (1990) and nearly twice the 10,000 km3 trade-off estimate by Leask et al. (2007a), but consistent with the 13,000– 20,000 km3 range suggested by Ghatan et al. (2005) and the\n20,000 km3 of eruption volume suggested by Leverington (2007). This result does not also keep into account the volume that has been filled by the latest lava flows that draped the bed-floor of the channels, which would increase the total volume that must have been carved by the putative previous water. Now, considering the two-three orders of magnitude of water required for the erosion (Andrews-Hanna and Phillips, 2007; Leverington, 2011), it is clear that even the highest estimate of ~40,000 km3 of water volume made by Leask et al. (2007a) and ~50,000 km3 by Ghatan et al. (2005), regardless whether discharged in 46 or 90 days, or 17.9 h, is impossible to store in the limited volume ofMangala Fossa and keep liquid for such a long time in the low pressure environment ofMars. Thus, the only way to accommodate the permeability of the aquifer is amechanismof replacement forwater. However, it is very difficult to imagine a mechanism of replacement for the additional water required at the hydraulic head ofMangala Valles in the liquidwater unfriendlyMartian environment. The hydraulic head of Mangala Valles is topographically too high for the model of recharge of the global groundwater system by basal melting of ice-rich polar deposits (Carr, 2002; Leverington, 2011) and ice is totally unstable at equatorial latitudes (Dundas et al., 2014). Last but not least, the hypothesis of Mangala Fossa as potential graben that could accommodate the subsidence following the removal of underground ice is not viable. Due to the topographic gradient decreasing from east to west along the fossa, the effective length of the Mangala Fossa that could ideally contribute with water (ice) to form Mangala Valles is the ~50 km segment between the Notch and the ridge where the pit chain ends. Based on topographic measurements with available MOLA data, such a segment is 1 km deep and 6 km wide at maximum for a total volume of ~300 km3. This volume is very far away even from the minimum volumes estimated for Mangala Valles. Even assuming the total length of 220 km considered by Ghatan et al. (2005), which is not at all actively contributing of course, the total volume would be 1320 km3 and still very far away from the volumes estimated forMangala Valles. The analysis of the mechanical erosion by lava, based on similar calculations done for Athabasca Valles (Keszthelyi et al., 2014), provided numbers more consistent with the volumetric measurements of Mangala Valles instead. Given that no more of 10% of the erupted volume is entrained/eroded rock (Keszthelyi et al., 2014), a minimum volume of 180,000 km3 of basaltic lava must have been erupted to carve the 18,000 km3 of Mangala Valles. Lava wasmostly discharged to Amazonis Planitia with a minor amount draping the channels (i.e. Figs. 3c, e, 5d, 6g, h, 7g, and h). Assuming a laminar flow of an average thickness of 100 m inferred from the thickness of the lava deposits still draping the channel, a density of 3000 kg/m3 for basaltic lava (i.e. Leone and Wilson, 2001), a viscosity of 10,000 Pa s, an average half-filled 5 km of diameter lava tube/feeder (inferred from the width of the pit chain) crossing the ridge along Mangala Fossa can provide a rough flow rate of ~0.272 km3/s, based on a flow velocity of 13.875 m/s calculated with the combined use of the Jeffreys and Manning equations (Keszthelyi and Self, 1998; Harris et al., 2007). Assuming a single episode, this means that the 180,000 km3 of lava would have been erupted in about 661,764 s, roughly corresponding to 7 Earth days. Assuming a turbulent regime the flow velocity would be 8.6 m/s on the basis of a single slope value of 0.01, although slope is variable along Mangala Fossa and Mangala Valles, and on an average friction coefficient of 0.05 estimated from various eruptions (Baloga et al., 1995), the flow rate would have been 0.157 km3/s with an episode lasting 1,146,496 s, roughly corresponding to 13 Earth days. In any case, it would have been a longer episode compared to the 17.9 h of time estimated by Bargery and Wilson (2011) for their catastrophic release of water. Although these are still rough estimates based on parameters that have some degree of uncertainty, the order of magnitude of time required for the eruptive episode formingMangala Valles is not terribly different from the 30 Earth days obtained for a smaller eruptive episode forming a 150 m deep mechanically eroded channel within an Elysium Planitia impact crater (Hurwitz et al., 2010) or the 580 Earth days estimated\nfor Mangala Valles by Leverington (2007). This might thus explain why the ~900 km longMangala Valles are still small if compared to themain circum-Chryse outflow channels (Kasei Valles and Valles Marineris), otherwise it would have been much larger if the influx of lava was higher or lasted longer. Mars had an unusually strong volcanism with very high eruption rates because of the giant impact that formed the dichotomy (Leone et al., 2014) and twelve volcanic alignments (Leone, 2016), which also explains why the volcanic features are much larger than those seen on Earth (Wilson and Head, 1994). There is no other comparable example anywhere in the solar system of such high eruptions rates and of so large and aligned volcanic edifices like those seen on Tharsis or elsewhere on Mars (Leone, 2016)."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "A volcanic origin for all the geological unitswas interpreted from the geomorphological analysis of both Mangala Fossa and Mangala Valles through the use of MRO images, combinedwith volumetric calculations obtained from MOLA data, and from the careful observation of all the possible sources and types of the geological units. It is unlikely that water has ever been involved as main erosive agent for the formation of Mangala Valles. No rootless cones or maars are visible all along Mangala Valles and Labou Vallis thus confirming no previous presence of groundwater (ice) left by previous putative fluvial activity. Some rootless cones were seen at Athabasca Valles (Keszthelyi et al., 2014) and rarely at VallesMarineris (Leone, 2014) but none atMangala Valles. There is objectively no way to demonstrate previous presence of any water or underground ice at Mangala Valles because there is nothing that may remotely recall any lava-water interaction out there. Lava is the only visible and documented presence all along Mangala Valles from the source to the mouth. The calculations of the volumes and the erosion rates of lava gave realistic and better results than water. Lava is stable in the environment ofMarswhereaswater not. Thewidespread mineralogical evidence of unaltered olivine and jarosite inNoachian terrains of the equatorial regions, where the outflow channels (and Mangala Valles) are located, suggests thatwater did not flowon the surface since the past. Assuming that water was flowing or ponding in the past from the presence of phyllosilicates is unjustified, both underground and surface volcanic activity can explain their formation. This evidence strengthens the hypothesis for a volcanic-only origin of Mangala Valles and the conclusions listed here:\na) Mangala Valles originated from Mangala Fossa through the only source observed in the whole area: volcanic activity of Arsia Mons formed a lava tube and the ridge that divides Mangala Valles from Daedalia Planum; the presence of the lava tube is inferred from a pit chain still visible on the ridge; the ridge is plausibly a lava flow front thick enough to prevent total collapse of the roof along its section, similar ridges have been observed around the main volcanic centres on Mars (Fig. 8). b) The original lava tube then evolved inMangala Fossa upon erosion by lava; lavaflowingon the surface, aidedbybothdecreasing topography from south to north and from east to west carved Mangala Fossa, formed Mangala Valles as a breakout of Mangala Fossa and Labou Vallis as a breakout of Mangala Valles, opened its way through preexisting impact craters, and at last discharged into Amazonis Planitia; it is demonstrated that fluid lava can travel very far from its sources even on cold planetary surfaces characterized by low to very low atmospheric pressure, the same cannot be demonstrated for water. c) The geomorphological analysis of Mangala Fossa, supported by the analysis of MOLA profiles all along its length, has shown neither vertical or horizontal movements nor lateral lava flows that may suggest a tectonic origin or a dike rupturing to the surface; topography determined the straightness of Mangala Fossa as well as determined straight sections of Valles Marineris and Kasei Valles on the opposite flank of Tharsis.\nd) The volume of water required to carve Mangala Valles is now compared to the volumeof the source andnomatchwas found; replenishment for multiple episodes would require rain, which is at odds with predominant worldwide unaltered olivine and jarosite, or basal recharge of aquifers, which is impossible at the height ofMangala Valles head; there is neither presence of collapse features at the Notch nor maars or tuff rings in the whole section of Mangala Fossa between the ridge and the Notch able to justify the volume of Mangala Valles and volcano ice explosive activity; I conclude that no study has convincingly demonstrated the presence or the sudden removal of ground ice at the source of Mangala Valles. e) Both heat flux and thick crust of the planet were unable to support prolonged volcanism until the Amazonian; the many inconsistencies in the superposition relationships and the high degree of uncertainty related to the crater counts cast doubts on the ages of the geological units proposed by Keske et al. (2015).\nThe geological unit Asp3mantling the floor of Mangala Fossawas already interpreted as lava flowing into a graben following the gradient of topography (Keske et al., 2015) and such interpretation is partially shared in this paper, Mangala Fossa is a channel formed by lava erosion and not a graben. The unit Asp3 refers to the last of the youngest flows that essentially formed Mangala Valles, although not absolutely the youngest in time. The Asp3 unit eroded the pre-existing Asp2 unit, emplaced in the corridor formedby two lava flow fronts (unit Hrt) coming from Arsia Mons. SirenumMons and Sirenum Tholus likely contributed together with Arsia Mons to the origin of the lava flooding that formed the unit Asp2 (see black arrows in Fig. 1). So the ages of formation of these volcanic centres were taken as a point of reference for the ages of the units in the new reassessment. The Noachian ages of Sirenum Mons and Sirenum Tholus suggested in this work come from Xiao et al. (2012) whereas the age of Arsia Mons from the ages of the alignment to which all these volcanic centres belong as consequence of the SPGI (Leone, 2016). The ages in Table 2 are just indicative intervals of time in which the eruptive events related to the correspondent units may have occurred. From the superposition relationships of the volcanic units described so far, a possible sequence of events (from the oldest to the youngest) might be as follows:\n• Lava flows from Arsia Mons emplaced the Hrt unit, which formed the original lava tube (that after becameMangala Fossa) within the ridge that divides Daedalia Planum from Mangala Valles; lava flows from Arsia Mons emplaced the Asp2 unit also with the contribution of Sirenum Mons and Sirenum Tholus; these are the oldest units and mayhave occurredduring theNoachian (from4.05 to 3.99Ga ago) according to the ages estimated by Xiao et al. (2012) and Leone (2016). • Lava flows from Arsia Mons emplaced the AHv unit, which is superposed on the Asp2 unit near Amazonis Mensa, and embayed the Hrt unit (from 4.05 to 3.99 Ga). • Lava flows from Arsia Mons emplaced the Asp3 unit (superposed on AHv), enlarged the original tube, and formedMangala Fossa, including the breakout that flooded and carved Mangala Valles (from 4.05 to 3.99 Ga). • New flows, corresponding to the lHt unit in the map of Keske et al. (2015) and superposed on the AHvunit, flooded and partially covered the Asp3 unit at Amazonis Mensa (probably from 3.99 to 3.97 Ga).\nThe sequence of emplacement that comes from the new interpretation should be as follows (from the oldest to the youngest): Hrt, Asp2, AHv, Asp3, and then lHt. So, I preferred to rename these units according to a timely order, again from the oldest to the youngest with the correct age letter in Table 2: Hrt becomes Nrt; Asp2 becomes Nsp1; AHv becomes Nsp2; Asp3 becomes Nsp3; lHt becomes Nsp4, so that the original AHv unit of Keske et al. (2015) on Daedalia Planum is now split into Nsp2 and Nsp4. These renamed units were mapped in Fig. 9. The bedfloor of Mangala Fossa, Mangala Valles, Labou Vallis, Sabis Vallis,\nand Minio Vallis is now included in the Nsp3 unit. No one of all the fluvial units interpreted by Keske et al. (2015) is confirmed in the new interpretation because all the units have volcanic origin. The geologicmap in Fig. 9 does not carry any structural information because there are no tectonic features to report, the previously interpreted wrinkle ridges might essentially be lava flow fronts as it was also concluded by Leone (2016). The indicative geologic ages reported here are based on the crater counts and the SPGI modelling found in the literature. Noachian age for the geologic units is a conservative estimate, based on SPGI model, but even Pre-Noachian age cannot be excluded. Reliable ages can only be estimated with accurate geochronologic measurements in situ as done at Gale crater by the Curiosity lander (Farley et al., 2014). Henceforth, Mangala Valles and Mangala Fossa should be considered as lava channels formed by mechanical and thermal erosion by lava and thus of volcanic-only origin with no water involved. Lastly, SHARAD experiments done in several locations of Mars have shown how radar cannot distinguish porous lava fromwater because they have similar dielectric constant. In no case presence of glaciers and/or glacier-like landforms was observed at the locations of the radar experiments. After the original works following the Viking missions, the growing number of works\nshowing the volcanic origin of the outflow channels (Valles Marineris, Kasei Valles, Athabasca Valles, and Mangala Valles), the striking evidence of large volcanic provinces associated with outflow channels on Mars, all the claims of fluvial activity on Mars must be seriously reconsidered."

  "abstractText": "Article history: Received 9 October 2016 Received in revised form 1 March 2017 Accepted 10 March 2017 Available online 11 March 2017 Mangala Valles has always been viewed as the typical outflow channel formed by catastrophic floods of water. A new analysis has shown that the geomorphological traces offluvial or lacustrine processeswithinMangala Valles can be better explained by fluid lava flooding the channels and filling pre-existing impact craters. As for the circum-Chryse outflow channels, where no clear source of water or mechanism able to replenish water at its hydraulic head is observed, there is no geologic trace of a sudden removal of a volume of water (ice) necessary to carve Mangala Valles. Neither maars nor rootless cones, typical volcanic features indicative of interaction between lava and ground ice, were found. Past works suggested that the formation of Mangala Valles occurred in late Amazonian age when the climate of Mars was similar to that seen today, that is absolutely not liquid water friendly. The present work shows how the origin of Mangala Valles may go back to Noachian or even Pre-Noachian when other studies have concluded that the climate was not liquid water friendly. Even assuming limited periods of obliquity favourable to liquid water in the history of Mars, which is at odds with the widespread presence of unaltered olivine and jarosite, it is very difficult to find plausible mechanisms of aquifer recharge or signs of catastrophic water release at the Notch of Mangala Valles that could feed the multiple episodes, or even a single episode, of fluvial flooding suggested in the literature. This evidence and other analysis will show that the presence of water and, eventually, ground ice is not incontrovertible in the equatorial regions and should not be given for granted as commonly done so far in the literature. The geomorphological analysis of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) images provided in this paper, combined with THEMIS and MOLA data, showhowMangala Fossa, fromwhichMangala Valles originated as a breakout, is an erosional channel formed by the flow of lava in a original tube coming fromDaedalia Planum rather than a tectonic graben or the sign of a dike rupturing to the surface. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
