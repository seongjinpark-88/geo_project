These regional events of starvation and drowning were commonly associated with alkalic to tholeiitic magmatism and invariably coincided in time with multiple rifting events that punctuated the progressive disintegration of Gondwana. Deposition of major condensed horizons enriched in iron, silica, and phosphorus was fostered by global factors such as eustatic rise, warm \"greenhouse\" climates, sluggish circulation, increased fertility, and poor ventilation in the oceans. Such anomalous sedimentary conditions recurred synchronously during magnetic quiet zones, pointing to successive episodes of global fast spreading and accelerated terrestrial heat loss. Multiple \"pulsations\" of Earth are inferred to have triggered supercontinent breakup and widespread volcanism, thus altering the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and dramatically affecting sedimentary and biological systems. INTRODUCTION Stratigraphic research on the Precambrian to Eocene succession exposed in the Himalayan mountain range has emphasized the significance of iron-rich condensed intervals as a key to interpreting the sedimentary evolution of this Gondwanian continental margin (Garzanti et al., 1989; Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991). Oolitic ironstones or glauco-phosphorites up to tens of metres thick are found at several intervals including the Frasnian, Sakmarian, Djulfian, Norian, Callovian, Aptian to Cenomanian, and Paleocene (Fig. 1). Condensed horizons represent stratigraphic markers that can be traced physically for more than 100 km. When containing age-diagnostic fossils, they can be proved to be strictly isochronous, within a single biostratigraphic zone or subzone, for distances of > 1000 km along the length of the Himalayas (Premoli-Silva et al., 1992). Ironstones were deposited on the starved outer continental shelf during flooding stages, when terrigenous detritus was trapped in estuarine mouths. Mineralogical and fossil contents point to sedimentation in poorly oxygenated environments, at water depths of several tens of metres to more than 100 m, during times of changing climatic and oceanographic conditions. High-energy sedimentological features, including very coarse grain size and spectacular large-scale cross lamination, indicate that oceanic currents intruded onto the outer shelf during rapid sealevel rise, preventing deposition of mud and scouring the shelf floor. Iron ooids, glaucony, and cherty to phosphatic intraclasts derived from reworking of penecontemporaneous hardgrounds were thus mixed with palimpsest detritus, shell hash, arenite pebbles, or soil material provided by ravinement during stepwise retreat of the coast (Garzanti, 1991). Major ironstones mark drowning unconformities associated with time gaps several millions of years long, and all of them correspond in time to peak global transgressions (Haq et al., 1988). Moreover, the Aptian to Cenomanian glauco-phosphorites correlate well with oceanic \"anoxic\" events (OAE 1 and 2 of Arthur et al., 1990). Episodes of starvation and drowning occurred typically both at the onset and close of alkalic to tholeiitic volcanism during the multiple rifting events that punctuated the progressive fragmentation of Gondwana through the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic. MI LTIRIFTING HISTORY OF THE HIMALAYAS The assembly of Gondwana was completed ca. 500 Ma during a late \"Pan-African\" orogenic episode that also aifected northern India. Since then, the supercontinent has undergone a series of rifting events that led to its final disintegration in the Cretaceous, when India started its rapid northward flight to collide with Asia, close to the time of the Paleocene-Eocene boundary. Late Devonian In Nepal, a 2.5-m-thick oolitic ironstone separates lower Frasnian coral-bearing biocalcarenites from thick black Frasnian pelites (Garzanti et al., 1992). This nautiloidbearing condensed horizon can be correlated with worldwide episodes of transgression, increasing subsidence, and drowning (Kominz and Bond, 1991; Schlager, 1991). Permian At the close of the Paleozoic, the periGondwanian microplate fringe detached from Gondwana, and the Neo-Tethys began to open north of paleo-India. Extensional tectonics is documented by uplift and deep erosion of the northern India margin, where the entire Carboniferous to mid-Permian section may be missing. Climate turned from warm to cold in the Pennsylvanian to earliest Permian, when ice caps spread over Gondwana. In northern India, quartzose clastics and tilloids accumulated until the late Sakmarian, when a glauconitic horizon 20 to 35 m thick was deposited during major transgression at the end of continental glaciation. Progressive warming during the Permian is recorded by marine faunas in all Gondwanian margins (Dickins, 1985). A first phase of alkalic rift magmatism in the northwestern Himalayas is documented by syenites, carbonatites, and granites dated at 315 to 284 Ma (Le Bas et al., 1987; Spring et al., 1992). Between the Artinskian and the Midian, a vast area, more than 10 km wide, was covered by flood basalts of tholeiitic affinity (Panjal Traps). Quartzose arenites, glauco-phosphorites, and black pelites recorded another widespread transgression in Djulfian time. Late Triassic After deposition of ammonoid-rich pelagic limestones in the Scythian and thick shelfal marly limestones in the Anisian to Carnian, GEOLOGY, v. 21, p. 105-108, February 1993 105 Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/21/2/105/3514239/i0091-7613-21-2-105.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019 subsidence rates and quartzo-feldspathic terrigenous detritus abruptly increased in the Norian. Lower to middle Norian dark phosphatic pelites and bioclastic feldspathic arenites, interfingering in the upper part with coral-bearing patch reefs and several horizons of oolitic ironstones, pass upward to upper Norian-Rhaetian hybrid quartzarenites. Greater mineralogical stability in the latter interval coincides with transition to warm humid climates (Suttner and Dutta, 1986). Extensional tectonics and alkalic volcanism are recorded for the Late Triassic, from the Indian margin (Reuber et al., 1987) to as far as Western Australia (Von Rad and Exon, 1983); the Kutch basin began to open in western India at that time (Biswas, 1987). Middle Jurassic A thick uppermost Triassic to lower Middle Jurassic carbonate platform is overlain disconformably by Bajocian-Bathonian quartzose coquina layers; the layers are paraconformably overlain by a Callovian ferruginous oolite. Three distinct ironstone intervals are recognized in northern India {Macrocephalus, Patina, and Jason to Athleta zones; Jadoul et al., 1985), whereas only the earliest Callovian ironstone, 3 to 7 m thick, is found in Nepal (Macrocephalus Zone). Middle Jurassic extensional tectonics and sporadic alkalic volcanism are recorded in the southern margin of Neo-Tethys from northern India to Australia (Boote and Kirk, 1989); India-Madagascar was rifting away from Africa, and sea-floor spreading began in the Somali and Mozambique basins at that time (Bosellini, 1989).",
