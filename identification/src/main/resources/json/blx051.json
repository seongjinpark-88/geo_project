In New Zealand, glacial cycles during the late Pliocene and throughout the Pleistocene caused the loss of large areas of forest habitat and many species are proposed to have been restricted to refugia during this period. Here we use mitochondrial DNA (COI, COII) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes in association with several hypothetical biogeographical lines to determine the impact that past climatic conditions had on the giraffe weevil (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis), an endemic brentine weevil found in native forests across New Zealand. Our analyses revealed that populations in northern New Zealand have higher genetic diversity than those in the south. We compared evidence for genetic structure in relation to four biogeographical lines: Northland Line, Kauri Line, Taupo Line and Cockayne’s Line. Although, there was significant difference in genetic variation north and south of all the proposed biogeographic lines, we found most support for the Kauri Line. These results support our hypothesis that giraffe weevils had a restricted range during the Pleistocene, predominantly pushed north into refugia, which was followed by range expansion following glacial retreat.\nADDITIONAL KEYWORDS: biogeography – Cockayne’s Line – glacial refugia – Kauri Line – Last Glacial Maximum – mitochondrial DNA – Northland Line – Pleistocene – Taupo line."

    "text": "The archipelago of New Zealand has had a dynamic geological and climatic history. Shifting tectonic plates pushed up mountains, volcanoes wreaked havoc on surrounding landscapes, sea levels fluctuated, and vast glaciers carved out valleys (McGlone, 1985; Isaac, Herzer & Brook, 1994; Lewis, Carter & Davey, 1994; Suggate & Almond, 2005; Alloway et al., 2007; Naish & Wilson, 2009). The effects of these historic events in New Zealand’s calamitous past have stretched into the present, leaving a mark on the current geographic distribution and genetic structure of species (reviewed in Wallis & Trewick, 2009; Trewick, Wallis\n& Morgan-Richards, 2011; Buckley, Krosch & Leschen, 2015).\nDuring the late Pliocene and Pleistocene, glaciation, volcanic eruptions and sea-level fluctuations turned previously suitable habitat into a hostile landscape, breaking apart populations and driving the retreat of species into fragments of hospitable refugia (Hewitt, 1996; Hewitt, 1999; Wallis & Trewick, 2009; Trewick et al., 2011). Events during the Pleistocene had substantial impact on the distribution and genetic structure of a broad range of taxa in New Zealand including plants (Wardle, 1963; Gardner et al., 2004; Alloway et al., 2007), birds (Dussex, Wegmann & Robertson, 2014; Weston & Robertson, 2015), reptiles (Hare, Daugherty & Chapple, 2008; O’Neill et al., 2008; Chapple et al., 2012) and invertebrates (Neiman & Lively, 2004; Smith, Margaret Mcveagh & Collier, *Corresponding author.

This is a significant gap in the understanding of New Zealand biogeography, because several geographical boundaries are associated with distinct changes in the distribution of species in the North Island, reflecting the impact of historic geological and climatic events (Fig. 1) (Ellis et al., 2015). Probably the most cited biogeographical boundary in the North Island is the Taupo line, which corresponds to a strong division in the degree of genetic and taxonomic diversity of flora and fauna through the middle of the island (Fig. 1) (Wardle, 1963; McGlone, 1985; Rogers, 1989). The\nTaupo Line was originally discussed in the context of plant endemism, where Wardle (1963) noted a higher number of endemic vascular plant species north of the boundary. Subsequent researchers noted that animal species diversity followed a similar pattern, with higher numbers of species in the northern half of the North Island, and lower diversity in the south (Buckley et al., 2009, 2010; Marske et al., 2011; Bulgarella et al., 2014). Several factors are likely to be responsible for these patterns, including sea-level changes since the Pliocene, and volcanic eruptions, tectonic uplift and glaciation in the Pleistocene (McGlone, 1985; Alloway et al., 2007; Bunce et al., 2009; Trewick & Bland, 2012).\nRecently, Ellis et al. (2015) revisited biogeographic patterns in the North Island, and found that several other boundaries explained genetic structure among Kihikia cicada species better than the Taupo Line. They suggested that the Kauri Line (Fig. 1) (Wagstaff & Clarkson, 2012) may more accurately denote abrupt geographic changes in genetic structure for some species because continuous forests were largely restricted to areas such as Northland and Auckland (above 38°S) during the Pleistocene (Alloway et al., 2007). Ellis et al. (2015) also identified phylogeographic patterns associated with several other biogeographic boundaries, including additional Pleistocene glacial refugia in the Far North (Northland Line) and East Cape (East Cape zone), and a distinct east-west pattern through the central North Island which may be related to mountain uplift (Cockayne’s Line). Further phylogeographic studies on a wider range of taxa are therefore required to build on the findings of Ellis et al. (2015) and determine how widely applicable they are.\nIn this study we performed a phylogeographical analysis on the New Zealand giraffe weevil Lasiorhynchus barbicornis (Fabricius, 1775) (Coleoptera: Brentidae: Brentinae). This endemic species has an expansive range encompassing the North Island of New Zealand, making it an ideal species for testing predictions about biogeographic lines. Despite their enormous worldwide diversity of more than 1700 species (Sforzi, Bartolozzi & Leschen, 2014), our study is the first molecular phylogeny of any brentine weevil. Lasiorhynchus barbicornis belongs to a monotypic genus within the Trachelizini tribe and is New Zealand’s only representative brentine weevil, a largely tropical group with a few temperate species (Sforzi & Bartolozzi, 2004).\nIn summer, adult L. barbicornis aggregate on dead or dying native trees where the females oviposit their eggs. Large males aggressively fight for mating opportunities using their elongated rostrum, while smaller males use sneaking behaviour to gain access to females (Painting & Holwell, 2014a, b). Adult L. barbicornis can fly, although adults tend to be consistently found on the same host tree throughout the breeding season during their lifetime (C.J.P.,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /biolinnean/article-abstract/122/1/13/3893626 by U niversity of Arizona Library user on 20 February 2019\n© 2017 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2017, 122, 13–28\nunpubl. data). Their long-distance dispersal ability is currently unknown. Larval development lasts at least 2 years, during which the larvae tunnel through dead wood likely feeding on fungi (May, 1993; Painting & Holwell, 2014c). To date, 17 different host tree species from 16 plant families have been identified for L. barbicornis. This high degree of polyphagy coupled with the ability of adults to fly led us to predict that there is likely to be high levels of gene flow between populations and low levels of genetic divergence, compared to flightless species limited host plant requirements. Furthermore, given that larvae require tracts of broadleaf forest with decaying trees for their development, we predicted substantial northward retraction of forest in the North Island during glaciation would have had a significant impact on the amount of suitable habitat for this species. We predicted greater genetic diversity in areas that acted as refugia during phases of glaciation because these populations have been able to diverge for longer periods of time than populations that have formed more recently following range expansion and only carried with them a subset of the possible genetic diversity. Specifically, we predict a latitudinal pattern of decreasing genetic diversity from north to south, resembling the ‘northern richness/southern purity’ pattern (Marshall et al., 2009; Marske et al., 2009), which reflects range expansion southward following the LGM.\nWe tested predictions on the genetic structure of L. barbicornis in relation to a range of North Island biogeographical boundaries that have been found to explain species distribution patterns among New Zealand flora and fauna. Based on the recent findings of Ellis et al. (2015), we predicted that the phylogeography of L. barbicornis would be best explained by a division across the Kauri Line, because the forests required for larval development would have been greatly reduced south of this boundary during the Pleistocene."

    "text": "Specimen collection\nWe collected 129 specimens from 33 locations across New Zealand, predominantly focussing this study on the North Island where giraffe weevils are most abundant (Table 1, Fig. 2). Despite attempts to collect widely across the South Island, we include specimens from only two South Island locations, because we found giraffe weevils to be scarce. Specimens were hand collected from host trees such as karaka (Corynocarpus laeviguatus), māhoe (Melicytus ramiflorus) and kohekohe (Dysoxylum spectabile) in native forest (Painting & Holwell 2014c) and preserved in 95% ethanol We\nrecorded the location of each collection site using a Garmin GPS and all sequenced specimens from each population were lodged in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection, Landcare Research, Auckland (Supporting Information Table S1).\nmitochondrial dna amplification and Sequencing\nLeg muscle from each specimen was dissected using a sterile scalpel. Total genomic DNA extraction was achieved using an Aqua Pure Genomic DNA tissue kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the 3′ region of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) with the primers LCO1490 and HCO2198 (Folmer et al., 1994), and COII gene with the primers C2-J-3183 and TK-N-3785 (Simon et al., 1994). PCR reactions of 25 µL contained 5 ng genomic DNA, 2.5 µL PCR buffer with MgCl2 (Roche, USA), 200 µM each dNTP, 1 µL BSA (10 mg/ mL), 1 µL of 10 µM each primer, and 1.5 U of Fast start Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, USA). Amplifications were performed on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). PCR cycling conditions consisted of 95 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, annealing temperature ranged from 52 °C to 57 ° C (depending on binding specificity) for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s and one additional cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. Successful amplification was assessed using gel electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels by adding 5 µL PCR product with 3 µL Gelred (Biotium, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA), diluted in loading dye. PCR products were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready reaction Mix v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA). Cycle sequencing products were cleaned using Big Dye Xterminator Purification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and analysed in both directions on the ABI Prism 3100 Avant Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). To ensure authenticity resultant sequences were blasted against beetle sequences available on GenBank. All sequences were submitted to GenBank (Supporting Information Table S1).\nSequences were manually cleaned, trimmed and aligned using Geneious v7.1 (Kearse et al., 2012). We translated the sequences using the insect mitochondrial code in Geneious to check for stop codons which could indicate nuclear pseudogenes, but did not find any evidence of these, supporting their mitochondrial origin (Zhang & Hewitt, 1996). We used DnaSP v5.1 (Librado & Rozas, 2009) to calculate basic sequence statistics including number of polymorphic sites, haplotype diversity (h ± standard deviation), nucleotide diversity (π ± standard deviation) (Nei, 1987), and Tajima’s D and Fu & Li’s F tests for neutrality (Tajima, 1989; Fu & Li, 1993). Tajima’s D and Fu & Li’s F tests were used to assess genetic variation within a neutral model of equilibrium\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /biolinnean/article-abstract/122/1/13/3893626 by U niversity of Arizona Library user on 20 February 2019\n© 2017 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2017, 122, 13–28\nof populations. Significantly negative values suggest population expansion or departures from normality.\nphylogenetic analySiS\nWe used the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) method as implemented in JModelTest v2 (Darriba et al., 2012) to select the best-fit nucleotide substitution model for our dataset. To reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes we used maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference as implemented in Garli v2.0 (Zwickl, 2006) and BEAST v2.4.1 (Drummond et al., 2012). To reconstruct the ML tree, we used 300 replicates (‘searchreps = 300’) under the best-fit AIC model. Nodal support was estimated with 100 bootstrap replicates (‘bootstrapreps = 100’), each with 50 searches (‘searchreps = 50’). All other search settings were at default values. For the Bayesian analyses we analysed the data under a constant population size model and an exponential growth model. Comparison of these two models allows inference of whether the haplotypes are sampled from an expanding population or a constant sized population. We also used the best-fit AIC model with exponential priors on the relative nucleotide substitution rates (0.0, 1000), uniform prior on the proportion of invariable sites (0, 1.0), exponential prior of the gamma shape parameter for among-site rate variation (0, 100) and base frequencies fixed at empirical values. For the coalescent model parameters under the exponential population growth model we used exponential priors on the population size (0, 10 000) and growth rate (−1000, 1000). Under the constant population size\nmodel we used an exponential on the population size (0, 10 000). For both models we assumed a rate of 0.0112 substitutions/site/million years (Brower, 1994; Marske, Leschen & Buckley, 2012). For each model we ran five independent MCMC analyses with 10 million generations, with a 1/1000 thinning interval and a burn-in of 25% that was confirmed as adequate following post-run inspection of marginal parameter plots in TRACER v1.6 (Rambaut et al., 2014). We used the Bayes factor for comparison of marginal likelihoods between the two models under the harmonic mean (Newton & Raftery, 1994) and AICM methods (Baele et al., 2012).\nA median joining network was built for the concatenated COI and COII sequences using POPART version 1.7 (Leigh & Bryant, 2015), and compared to the ML tree.\npopulation Structure\nWe used analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) in Arlequin v3.5 (Excoffier & Lischer, 2010) to determine the degree of variance between populations found north and south of the hypothesized biogeographic lines. Using 10 000 permutations we divided the sequences into groups to test the molecular variation across four biogeographical lines: Northland line (Ellis et al., 2015), Kauri line (Wagstaff & Clarkson, 2012), Taupo Line (McGlone, 1985) and Cockayne’s Line (Ellis et al., 2015; Fig. 1).

We also tested for isolation by distance to determine whether geographical distance is a significant contributor to the genetic divergence of populations using a Mantel Test (Mantel, 1967) in IBDWS v2.23 (Jensen, Bohonak & Kelley, 2005).

From all 129 concatenated sequences there were 110 haplotypes with a haplotype diversity (Hd) of 0.983, containing 147 polymorphic sites, 76 of which were parsimony informative, and a low nucleotide diversity of 0.0121. The Tajima’s D value for all the individuals was −1.847 which was statistically significant (P < 0.05), and the Fu & Li’s F test was −3.909,also statistically significant (P < 0.02), suggesting recent population expansion with a historic population bottle neck. Of the 110 haplotypes\nFigure 2. Map of collecting localities for Lasiorhynchus barbicornis across New Zealand.

The most widely distributed haplotype was shared between 17 individuals from eight populations in the lower North Island (Hap. 28: Kaitoke Regional Park, Orongorongo Valley, Paengaroa, Lake Papaitonga, Ratapihipihi, Ruahine Ranges, Palmerston North, Totaranui).\nphylogeographic relationShipS\nThe exponential growth rate model was favoured by a Bayes factor of 6.067 using the harmonic mean estimator (Kass & Raftery, 1995) and a Bayes factor of 0.952 under the AICM (Baele et al., 2012). Kuschel (2003) hypothesized that Prodector from Sulawesi is the sister taxon to Lasiorhynchus, which we were unable to obtain samples of to root our phylogenies.\nWe identified five main clades on the L. barbicornis ML tree, which are labelled ‘A’ to ‘E’ (Figs 2, 3). The bootstrap support values and Bayesian posterior probabilities were low across many nodes, however, the major clades were generally well supported with posterior probabilities > 0.7, except for the large E clade. The lower support for this clade was due to two sequences (RAT19 and OPO1) being placed in a separate, wellsupported clade (posterior probability = 0.91) with COR1 and the Hick’s Bay specimens (HIC) in the Bayesian tree. Clade A is a monophyletic group of specimens exclusively from the far North of the North Island. Clade B spans the far north of the North Island to the southern area of Northland, with the exception of a single specimen from Morere Springs from the southeast of the North Island (MOR8). The majority of haplotypes that make up Clade B are concentrated towards the south of Northland and the Auckland region. A single specimen from the Coromandel made up Clade C, while Clade D consisted of a well-supported cluster of specimens from Hick’s Bay in the East Cape. Clade E represents the largest geographical area ranging from the Waikato (Mt Te Aroha) in the North Island through to the southern extremity of the South Island (Hollyford Valley), had the most specimens and the least genetic diversity.\nThe constant population size model placed the root between Clade A and all other haplotypes, whereas the exponential population size model placed the root between Clades D and E and all other haplotypes. In both cases these conflicting root positions were supported by posterior probabilities of less than 0.5, indicating poor support for the root position. Mid-point rooting of the ML phylogeny placed the root between Clade E and all other clades.\nThe median joining network showed many reticulations among haplotypes, consistent with the short\ninternal branches of the ML phylogeny (Fig. 4). Overall the major groupings from the ML phylogeny were also recovered in the median joining network.\nUnder the exponential coalescent model the age of the root was 1.3 Myr (0.97–1.65 Myr, 0.95 credible intervals). The ages of initiation of haplotype diversification within each of Clades A, B, D and E were 0.92 Myr (0.66–1.22), 0.86 Myr (0.59–1.15), 0.18 Myr (0.05– 0.33) and 0.83 Myr (0.58–1.11), respectively. The 0.95 credible intervals of all divergences lie well within the Pleistocene.\ngeographic population Structure\nCOI Φst data support high differentiation among most populations (Supporting Information Table S2). Populations north of the Kauri line showed higher levels of differentiation than those south of this line. This is true when comparing populations that are both north of the Kauri line, for example Te Paki (TEP) is significantly differentiated from MAN (Φst = 0.4959), as well comparing a population from north of the Kauri line to a southern population, where TEP is also significantly differentiated from STU (Φst = 0.5366). Populations with little differentiation (Φst < 0.05) tended to be geographically close together and/or occurred within geographic boundaries.\nWe found a strong curvilinear relationship between nucleotide diversity and latitude (F2,23 = 29.17, P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.72), showing that populations in the northern part of North Island had higher amounts of genetic diversity than populations in the south (Fig. 5). As expected of range expansion, there was little variation in nucleotide diversity for the most southern localities, as shown by the flattening of the line at higher latitudes.\nThe AMOVA analyses indicated that the within population variance was higher than between populations or biogeographical groups for all four tests, probably due to the high haplotype diversity among the localities sampled (Table 2). There was, however, significant geographical partitioning in the data for all of the proposed biogeographical boundaries. The Kauri Line hypothesis explained the highest proportion of variation among groups (24.17%), closely followed by the phylogeographic structure according to the Taupo Line (22.72%). Except for the Mt. Te Aroha specimens (ARO), which were collected slightly north of the Kauri Line, all the specimens clustered into the large Clade E were collected from localities south of the Kauri Line (Figs 2, 3). Also, apart from two specimens collected in TEP, all the specimens sampled north of the Kauri Line had unique haplotypes, whereas among specimens south of the Kauri line, we observed 21 specimens sharing haplotypes with at least one other specimen.

There was also significant partitioning of molecular variance across the Cockayne’s Line (Table 2), but only 15.31% of the variation was explained by this boundary. There was little evidence of an east-west division in accordance with Cockayne’s Line when inspecting the ML tree, where specimens collected on either side of the line are clustered in the same clade (Fig. 3).\nA comparison of sequence summary statistics and neutrality tests above and below each biogeographical line are presented in Table 3. When populations were split at the four hypothesized biogeographical lines, we found that that there was always higher levels of haplotype (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) on the northern side of the boundary, compared to the southern side of the boundary. Tajima’s D and Fu & Li’s F values were always negative north and south of each biogeographic line, although the values were not always significant.\nThe more conservative Tajima’s D statistic was only significantly negative south of the Kauri and Taupo Lines, which were the two best supported boundaries from the AMOVA analyses. Fu & Li’s F values were significantly negative north and south of the Kauri and Taupo Lines, suggesting population expansion occurred in both areas at some time. However, the test statistics were larger south of the lines, which is in line with our hypothesis of recent southward expansion. The only Fu & Li’s F statistic that was not significantly negative was north of the Northland Line, suggesting that this population has not experienced the population size expansions relative to those from further south.\nBoth the mismatch analyses show multimodality and diverged from the expected distribution under an exponential growth rate model (Fig. 6).

    "heading": "DISCUSSION",
    "text": "Our study revealed that New Zealand’s dynamic environmental past is reflected in the phylogeographic structure of L. barbicornis today. We found support for our prediction that L. barbicornis was significantly affected by northward retraction of forests in the North Island during the Pleistocene glacial cycles. The hypothesis that populations were restricted into putative glacial refugia followed by southward expansion was supported by a distinctive pattern of high northern genetic diversity compared to low southern genetic diversity (the ‘northern richness/southern purity’ hypothesis; Marshall et al., 2009; Marske et al., 2009), which presents as a strong latitudinal decline in genetic variation. Importantly, dating analyses support our hypothesis and show the timing of haplotype divergences all lie within the Pleistocene. This is consistent with glacial-induced environmental change being responsible for the phylogeographic patterns. An alternative explanation is that population expansion followed the emergence of land in the southern North Island during the late Pliocene (Bunce et al., 2009; Trewick et al., 2011; Trewick & Bland, 2012); however, the results of the AMOVA reveal the phylogeographic break that best explains the data is the Kauri Line, which lies far to the north of the emergent lands of the southern North Island.\nSeveral biogeographic boundaries have been proposed to denote abrupt changes in the genetic structure of species in New Zealand (Ellis et al., 2015). We compared multiple biogeographic boundaries and found strong support for northward retraction during the Pleistocene, with strongest support for the Kauri Line according to the AMOVA results. Although, there was very high haplotype diversity in general across all the L. barbicornis populations, we found fewer shared haplotypes north of the Kauri Line than south of it. All the specimens found south of the hypothesized Kauri Line, were associated with a single, large clade with little genetic structuring. Conversely, north of the Kauri Line four diverging clades were recovered showing a higher level of genetic diversity. Nine pairwise comparisons of Φst north of the Kauri Line are not significantly differentiated displaying values < 0.05, while south of the Kauri Line 33 populations are not significantly differentiated from one another. The mismatch analyses also showed evidence\nof more recent population expansion south of the Kauri Line. In comparison, there was likely a deeper and older population expansion north of the Kauri Line. We also acknowledge that the area north of the Northland Line may have supported larger populations with greater diversity in comparison to other areas north of the Kauri Line. This was supported by the Fu & Li’s F statistic, which did not differ significantly from zero north of the Northland Line, suggesting the existence of older remnant populations that persisted during the Pleistocene and expanded southward post-glaciation.\nLasiorhynchus barbicornis is a wood-boring weevil requiring patches of broadleaf forest, so is likely to have been greatly affected by the disappearance of forests throughout New Zealand during the Pleistocene. Our data mirror those described by Ellis et al. (2015) who found that only the forest-dwelling cicada Kikihia ochrina showed northern richness and southern purity, divided by the Kauri Line. In comparison, species that inhabit higher elevation scrub and forest edge, such as K. cutora and K. muta ‘aotea’, and the stick insect Clitarchus hookeri, show biogeographic patterns in accordance with Cockayne’s Line, caused by mountain uplift in the Pliocene and Pleistocene through the middle of the North Island (Buckley et al., 2010; Morgan-Richards, Trewick & Stringer, 2010; Ellis et al., 2015). Species that are less-reliant on dense forest habitat, such as those found in scrub and grasslands, may have been less affected by climatic cycles in the Pleistocene, compared to a forest-dwelling species like L. barbicornis.\nIn addition to support for the Kauri Line, the AMOVA also found a similarly high amount of variation explained by the Taupo Line. Genetic partitioning according to the Taupo Line was supported by significant negative Tajima’s D and Fu’s F tests north and south of the Taupo Line. However, many of the specimens collected from localities north of the Taupo Line (but south of the Kauri Line), such as those from the Waikato (MAU, PUR, STU) and Morere Springs (MOR) are nested within the large Clade E. The Waikato and Morere Springs may represent areas where giraffe weevils were able to persist during glaciation, especially in coastal areas, which could explain the more divergent subclades compared with other populations south of the Taupo Line. The mismatch analysis south of the Kauri Line supports this hypothesis, because we observed a bimodal distribution suggesting two population expansions. It is unlikely that the Pliocene sea straight, which stretched over much of the southern North Island south of Taupo (Trewick et al., 2011), is responsible for this phylogeographical pattern because our dating analysis suggests that diversification of these clades occurred well-within the Pleistocene period.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /biolinnean/article-abstract/122/1/13/3893626 by U niversity of Arizona Library user on 20 February 2019\n© 2017 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2017, 122, 13–28\nAlthough Northland is more commonly recognized as a region of refugia during the Pleistocene, it has also been shown that other areas of refugia were likely present in the North Island, such as coastal areas of the East Cape, Hawkes Bay and North Taranaki Bight (Gardner et al., 2004; Buckley et al., 2009, 2010; Ellis et al., 2015). Many of these predicted refugia from the Pleistocene epoch are now submerged following sealevel rise, suggesting that flora and fauna migrated inland and southward as temperatures warmed. In our study, we also found evidence of additional refugia, particularly considering the placement of the Hick’s Bay specimens in their own well-supported clade, suggestive of an East Cape refugium. Relatively low latitudes (i.e north of 38°) and warm coastal climate may have allowed isolated pockets of forest to persevere during glaciation, L. barbicornis to remain. Furthermore, L. barbicornis is highly polyphagous (Painting & Holwell, 2014c), perhaps allowing them to avoid localized extinction despite host tree species dying out.\nVolcanic eruptions during the late Pleistocene and Holocene around Taupo are also likely to have caused local extinction of some populations south of the Kauri and Taupo Lines, especially to the east of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (Morgan‐Richards, Trewick & Wallis, 2000; Holzapfel, Faville & Gemmill, 2002; Smith et al., 2006; Ellis et al., 2015). However, the low level of genetic diversity among the southern North Island and South Island populations, which are unlikely to have been affected by recent volcanic eruptions, suggests that the Pleistocene glacial cycles have had a stronger influence on the genetic structure of L. barbicornis (Bunce et al., 2009; Trewick et al., 2011). However, except for Morere Springs, we did not collect specimens from localities likely to have been affected by volcanic activity around Taupo, so it is difficult to accurately assess the impact of volcanism on the distribution of L. barbicornis.\nAlthough, we found evidence of deeply diverging haplotypes in the far North, we did not find evidence for reciprocally monophyletic haplotype clades or a speciation event involving the population from the former island of Te Paki, unlike studies of other invertebrate species (e.g. Morgan-Richards, Trewick & Wallis, 2001; Buckley & Leschen, 2013; Buckley et al., 2014; Myers, Holwell & Buckley, in press). Many of the invertebrate species that are endemic to this area are flightless, unlike L. barbicornis, and ongoing gene flow may have prevented population divergence here. Generally, across New Zealand, the ability of L. barbicornis to fly may partly explain the high haplotype diversity and lack of genetic structure. However, without a comparative analysis of other closely related species, this observation remains speculative and there has been little consensus among studies of flighted versus flightless\ninvertebrates in New Zealand (Trewick et al., 2011; Buckley & Leschen, 2013).\nBy addressing multiple possible biogeographic boundaries we were able to find a lasting effect of past climatic events on the genetic structure of L. barbicornis. We suggest that the strong pattern of northern diversity and southern purity is best explained by previous forest limitations during the last glacial maximum."

  "abstractText": "Historic geological and climatic events such as tectonic activity, volcanism and glaciation have significantly impacted the distribution and genetic signature of organisms. In New Zealand, glacial cycles during the late Pliocene and throughout the Pleistocene caused the loss of large areas of forest habitat and many species are proposed to have been restricted to refugia during this period. Here we use mitochondrial DNA (COI, COII) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes in association with several hypothetical biogeographical lines to determine the impact that past climatic conditions had on the giraffe weevil (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis), an endemic brentine weevil found in native forests across New Zealand. Our analyses revealed that populations in northern New Zealand have higher genetic diversity than those in the south. We compared evidence for genetic structure in relation to four biogeographical lines: Northland Line, Kauri Line, Taupo Line and Cockayne’s Line. Although, there was significant difference in genetic variation north and south of all the proposed biogeographic lines, we found most support for the Kauri Line. These results support our hypothesis that giraffe weevils had a restricted range during the Pleistocene, predominantly pushed north into refugia, which was followed by range expansion following glacial retreat.",
