The Toarcian OAE is thought to have been caused by flood basalt magmatism, and may have been a trigger for mass extinction. However, these proposed causes of the Toarcian OAE and associated biotic crisis are not adequately resolved by a precise chronology. The duration of the Toarcian OAE has been estimated to be anywhere from ~0.12 to ~0.9 Myr, most recently 0.74 to 3.26 Myr fromU–Pb dating. The CIE associatedwith the Toarcian OAE has a similar pattern at numerous localities, and there is evidence that the marine carbon isotope variations recorded astronomical forcing signals. Here we estimate a duration of ~620 kyr for the main negative CIE, ~860 kyr for the polymorphum zone and N1.58 Myr for the levisoni zone based on 405-kyr astronomical eccentricity tuning of the marine section at Peniche (Portugal). This 405-kyr tuned series provides a ~2.5 Myr continuous high-resolution chronology through the Early Toarcian. There are 6, or possibly 7 short eccentricity cycles in themain CIE interval at Peniche. To confirm this astronomically based estimate, we analyzed three other sections at Yorkshire (UK), Dotternhausen (Germany), and Valdorbia (Italy) from marine carbon isotopic series. These four stratigraphic sections from Early Jurassic western Tethys record the Toarcian OAE with ~6 prominent carbon isotope cycles in the CIE that span a 600 ± 100 kyr duration. The Peniche 405-kyr tuned series indicates that the pre- and post-CIE intervals experienced strong precession–eccentricity-forced climate change, whereas the CIE interval ismarked bydominant obliquity forcing. These dramatic and abrupt changes in astronomical response in the carbon isotopes point to fundamental shifting in the Early Toarcian paleoclimate system that was directly linked to the global carbon cycle.\n© 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.

    "text": "The Early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) is a globally recorded climate change event in the Early Toarcian of the Jurassic Period that is characterized by a major negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) (Jenkyns, 1988; Little and Benton, 1995; Hesselbo et al., 2000; Kemp et al., 2005; Hesselbo et al., 2007; Hermoso et al., 2009; Gill et al., 2011; Kafousia et al., 2011). In many marine sections, the Toarcian OAE is marked by a black shale, rich in organic carbon, that records profound paleoenvironmental change in bothmarine and terrestrial environments\neology and Environmental Gehina.

Pub\n(Jenkyns, 1988; Hesselbo et al., 2000; Jenkyns et al., 2001; McElwain et al., 2005; Gill et al., 2011; Hesselbo and Pienkowski, 2011). The Toarcian OAE has been linked to Karoo–Ferrar igneous activity, methane release, global warming, and mass extinction (Little and Benton, 1995; Pálfy and Smith, 2000; Svensen et al., 2007; Jourdan et al., 2008; Jenkyns, 2010). In order to pinpoint the triggering mechanism for this Early Toarcian global carbon cycle perturbation, a crucial step is to define a precise chronology.\nThe duration of the Toarcian OAE has been estimated to be anywhere from 120 kyr to 900 kyr from cyclostratigraphic assessments (Kemp et al., 2005; Clémence et al., 2006; Suan et al., 2008; Sabatino et al., 2009; Kempet al., 2011), and ~520 kyr from 87Sr/86Sr chemostratigraphy (McArthur et al., 2000). U–Pb radiometric dating has been taken to indicate a duration of 0.74–3.26 Myr for the Toarcian OAE at Serrucho in the Neuquén Basin, Argentina (Mazzini et al., 2010), although the stratigraphic position of the dated horizons is not constrained by precise biostratigraphy. Clearly, there is a specific date and duration for this global event that has yet to be accurately determined. In an effort to solve the\nlished by Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Biostratigraphic zones and high resolution carbon isotope records provide the primary means for global correlation of Toarcian marine and terrestrial sections (Hesselbo et al., 2007; Suan et al., 2008; Sabatino et al., 2009; Hesselbo and Pienkowski, 2011; Kemp et al., 2011; Hermoso et al., 2012; Izumi et al., 2012). The study sections at Peniche (Portugal), Yorkshire (England), Dotternhausen (Germany), and Valdorbia (Italy) all exhibit the negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) (Fig. 2). The base of the C2 interval in Suan et al. (2008; their fig. 6) records the most abrupt shift in the δ13Ccarb record, which was used as a correlation marker for the Peniche and Yorkshire sections. We use this correlation marker as the base of the CIE and the means by which to correlate all four sections. The stratigraphic definition of the CIE is based on Hesselbo et al. (2007) and is constrained from the polymorphum–levisoni boundary (near the Dactylioceras tenuicostatum–falciferum boundary, or mirabilis–serpentinum boundary in the Apennines) for the onset of the CIE (base of Interval 2, which is level 2 shown in figs. 3 and 4 of Hesselbo et al. (2007)), to the increase in carbon isotope values immediately above the peak negative excursion at the base of Interval 3 (same as level 3 in figs. 3 and 4 of Hesselbo et al. (2007), which is near the maximum of the total organic carbon content in many of the sections).\nThe Peniche section is the most complete section in this study with good ammonite control and located in the deepest part of the Lusitanian Basin. The section is the sole candidate for the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Toarcian Stage (Elmi, 2006; Hesselbo et al., 2007; Suan et al., 2008). High-resolution bulk carbonate carbon isotope (δ13Ccarb) data were collected at an average 2 cm spacing, and at a 1 cm spacing over the critical interval at ~11 mabove the base of the Toarcian (Hesselbo et al., 2007). After removal of turbidites anddebris flows (considered as instantaneous events whose primary carbon isotopic record are compromised by addition of diagenetic carbonate), the δ13Ccarb record has a thickness of 35.15 m for the early Toarcian; the CIE is between 11.13 m and 20.40 m, resampled here to 1 cm uniform sample spacing for time series analysis. The Peniche δ13Ccarb series (with all data from turbidites removed) shows evidence for strong astronomical forcing (Fig. 3). Here we use the Peniche δ13Ccarb series to develop a reference astrochronology for the Toarcian OAE; the other sections are examined to confirm the time scale of the OAE.\nThe Yorkshire section is composed of laminated, organic-rich shale that was deposited in a continental shelf setting (Hesselbo and Jenkyns,\n1000 km\nP anthalas O cean\nB\nA\nD\nC\nFig. 1.Paleogeographic and locationmaps of the early Toarcian,modified fromZiegler (1982) an (Cleveland Basin); C = Dotternhausen, Germany (South West German Basin); D = Valdorbia\n1995; Kemp et al., 2005). The organic carbon isotope (δ13Corg) data that we examined are from Hawsker Bottoms and other Yorkshire localities (Kemp et al., 2005; Littler et al., 2010). The Yorkshire δ13Corg series has a 1 to 11 cm sample rate with an average spacing of 6.4 cm; the CIE has an average sample spacing of 3.6 cm from 16.72 m to 21.06 m that we resampled to a 1 cm uniform sample rate for spectral analysis (use of integral linear interpolation to get evenly sampled rate for spectral analysis) (Fig. 2). The δ13Corg series shows strong astronomical forcing (Kemp et al., 2005).\nThe Dotternhausen section is from the northwestern Tethys Ocean and was deposited in deep water of the central part of the South West German Basin (Röhl et al., 2001). The sediments are composed of organic-rich shale with excellently preserved fossils and a few carbonate-rich beds (Röhl et al., 2001; Suan et al., 2008). The δ13Corg data of the CIE shows a pattern that is similar to that at Yorkshire, but it is unevenly sampled and has low resolution with average spacing of 12.8 cm from 2.25 m to 4.82 m (Fig. 2). Therefore, we chose to analyze the high-resolution grayscale data. The grayscale data were scanned over two 105 cmand75 cm intervalswith ultra high resolution (sample spacing of 12.7 μm), and show strong obliquity and precession forcing (Suan et al., 2008). In order to get a more highly resolved spectrum and to reduce the noise, we linked the two grayscale series together, smoothed the series with a 25-point moving average, and resampled to a 0.1 cm spacing for time series analysis.\nThe Valdorbia section is located in the Umbria–Marche Basin of the southern continental margin of the Tethys Ocean and contains black shale and gray marl with intercalated calcarenitic turbidites through the Early Toarcian OAE interval. The section is a reference section for the Apennine Toarcian (Sabatino et al., 2009; Bilotta and Sassaroli, 2010). The bulk carbonate carbon isotope (δ13Ccarb) and organic carbon isotope (δ13Corg) data have a pattern that is similar to that in the Yorkshire section (Fig. 2). The data were collected with an uneven and low-resolution sampling (average 25 cm) for the OAE CIE interval between 22.87 m and 40.12 m. We chose the δ13Ccarb data for time series analysis because it exhibits clearer cyclicity compared to the δ13Corg data. The δ13Ccarb data were resampled to 5 cm intervals for this study."

    "text": "From the raw δ13Ccarb data (Fig. 3A) it is impossible to see that there could be any consistent signal in the series. The power spectrum of the residual series (after detrending the entire series by subtracting a 15%\nweighted average to remove the long-term trends) (Fig. 3B) shows an extremely strong peak at ~5.8 m and weak peaks at 147 cm and 50 cm(Fig. 3H). In order to see the high-frequency astronomical periodicity peaks in the power spectra, the series were subtracted a 35% weighted average to remove the long-term trend for three intervals separately. Spikes were also removed, mainly at ~1860 cm. A rich sequence of cycles along the series is revealed (Fig. 3C). The power spectrumof the untuned (depth domain) δ13Ccarb residual series of Interval 1 shows prominent spectral peaks with wavelengths at ~140 cm, ~57 cm, ~22 cmand19 cm, andweaker peaks at ~42 cmand30 cm(Fig. 3E). Interval 2 spectrum shows significant wavelengths at ~139 cm, ~50 cm, and ~22 cm (Fig. 3F), and Interval 3 spectrum shows prominent wavelengths at ~160 cm, ~76 cm and ~21 cm (Fig. 3G). The power spectrum of the entire δ13Ccarb residual series of Fig. 3C has significant spectral peaks at ~150 cm, 115 cm, ~50 cm, 42 cm and 22 cm wavelengths, and a weak peak at ~5.8 m (Fig. 3J).\nWhen calibrating the ~5.8 m cycles to the 405 kyr eccentricity cycle, the ~150 cm, ~50 cm and ~22 cm cycles correspond to\n~105 kyr, ~35 kyr and ~15 kyr periods, respectively. The power spectra of the untuned series for the three intervals all show significant short eccentricity cycles; obliquity cycles dominate in the middle part of the OAE interval (Fig. 3F).\nThe power spectrum of the entire 405-kyr tuned residual series of Fig. 3B has an extremely strong peak at 405-kyr and weak peak at 96 kyr and 38 kyr (Fig. 3I). However, the power spectrum of the residual series of Fig. 3C shows significant spectral peaks at ~112 kyr, 38 kyr,\n33 kyr, and 20 kyr, lower-power peaks at 92 kyr and 29 kyr, and a weak peak at 405 kyr (Fig. 3K). These periods are comparable to theoretical Early Toarcian astronomical parameters (Fig. 3L). The obliquity period of 38 kyr and 33 kyr is shorter than the present-day period of 41 kyr due to faster predicted Earth rotation rate in the past (Laskar et al., 2004). The very weak power at the 405 kyr periodicity in Fig. 3K is due to the long term trend removal procedure. On the other hand, a ~400 kyr cycle appears as a major modulation in the amplitude envelope of the short eccentricity estimated from 405-kyr tuned series (Fig. 4A, B), similar to the La2004 theoretical amplitude modulation and its power spectrum for the Early Toarcian of 182.7–180.0 Ma (Fig. 4C, D), which supports the existence of the 405 kyr long eccentricity cycle in this δ13Ccarb series.\nThe 405-kyr tuned series provides a ~2.5 Myr continuous highresolution time scale through the early Toarcian Stage at Peniche. The pre- and post-CIE intervals show strong eccentricity-precession bundling; within the CIE interval there is prominent obliquity cycling. From the tuned series, the estimated duration for the CIE interval is 620 kyr; the duration of polymorphum/tenuicostatum zone (the preCIE interval: from the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary to the polymorphum–levisoni or tenuicostatum–falciferum zone boundary) is ~860 kyr, and the post-CIE interval, from the top of the CIE up to the top of the levisoni zone is ~956 kyr (although ammonites are rare in this part of the section and the top of the zone not identified with certainty). Finally, a duration of ~58 kyr was estimated for the negative δ13Ccarb excursion at the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary from the 405-kyr tuned series (Fig. 3D), although we note that the abundance of ammonites and finely divided ammonite biostratigraphy suggests a degree of stratigraphic condensation within about a meter on either side of the boundary (Elmi, 2006), meaning that the estimate should be considered a minimum."

The tuning results show a duration of 550–600 kyr for the CIE interval despite that the four sections developed in different depositional environments, from deep sea to continental margin, and have different thicknesses (2.57 m at Dotternhausen, 4.34 m at Yorkshire, 9.1 m at Peniche, 17.25 m at Valdorbia) (Fig. 5)."

    "text": "At Peniche, the 620 kyr duration for the Toarcian CIE estimated from the 405-kyr tuned δ13Ccarb series of Fig. 3D and 600 kyr from 100-kyr tuned series of Fig. 6A, is close to the 560 kyr duration estimated from 40-kyr tuned CaCO3 series for the same interval (cf. fig. 5 in Suan et al., 2008). A ~700 kyr duration (7 short eccentricity cycles) for the CIE is possible if we include the “e?” in the middle part of the CIE (Fig. 5A). The 6 short eccentricity cycle option is more reasonable because it has a slightly lower-variance spectrum (Fig. 6E black curve) than a 7 e-cycle spectrum (Fig. 6E gray curve); however, we cannot exclude a ~700 kyr duration for the CIE. Suan et al. (2008) estimated a duration of ~900 kyr for the entire CIE. The definition of CIE in the present study is different from the Suan et al. definition, but close to their C2 interval (cf. fig. 2A in Suan et al., 2008). There is some difference between figs. 2 and 6 in Suan et al. (2008); however, our CIE is the same as the C2 interval in fig. 6 of Suan et al. (2008). The duration of 0.86 Myr for the tenuicostatum zone estimated from 405-kyr tuned series is close to the 0.8 Myr duration estimated from fig. 2 in Suan et al. (2008). Suan et al.

The red dashed curve is the amplitude ents from182.7 Ma to 180 Ma (green curve) obtained by the sameTanerfilter applied inA, he amplitude modulation series in C.\nfrom the present study (the δ13Ccarb data in this study extends very close to the top of the levisoni zone, cf. fig. 2 in Suan et al., 2008). GTS2012 assigns durations of 1 Myr and 1.34 Myr, for the tenuicostatum and serpentinum zones, respectively (Gradstein et al., 2012), which is different from 0.86 Myr and 1.58 Myr estimated by this study. On the other hand, a total 2.34 Myr duration in GTS2012 for the Early Toarcian is close to our ~2.5 Myr estimate based our Peniche astrochronology. We also re-iterate here the possibility of stratigraphic condensation at the base of the Peniche section, whichwould lead to an underestimated duration.\nFor Yorkshire, we tuned the 6 prominent ~90 cm δ13Corg cycles to 100 kyr, to be consistent with the Peniche astrochronology. Kemp et al. (2011) argued that ~75 cm cycles in Interval 2 (cf. fig. 3 in Kemp et al., 2011) may not be short eccentricity cycles but instead precession or obliquity cycles. They suggested a CIE duration of 168–189 kyr if the ~75 cm 8–9 cycles correspond to 21 kyr precession cycles, or 288– 324 kyr if 36 kyr obliquity cycles. Previously a ~200 kyr CIE duration was estimated by assuming ~81 cm cycles as precession cycles (cf. fig. 1 in Kemp et al. (2005)). There is a ~40 cm peak in the power spectra of total organic carbon (TOC) content, δ13Corg and sulphur (S) abundance series in Interval 1 (figs. 5 and 6 in Kemp et al., 2011), which could comparewith the ~35 cm peak in Fig. 5F, corresponding to ~37 kyr obliquity (Fig. 6F). Kemp et al. (2011) rejected the ~75 cm cycles as short eccentricity cycles because they argued that the resultant ~1.77 Myr total duration of their analyzed section represented too much time for what is less than half the thickness of Early Toarcian in this section. However,\nthis problem is less acute if the accumulation rate is not constant through the Early Toarcian in Yorkshire. The evolutionary spectrogram of untuned Yorkshire δ13Corg series shows the wavelength of 0.6–2.1 m that should all represent short eccentricity band periodicities and there is evidence for lower accumulation rate in the CIE interval compared with pre- and post-CIE (Fig. 7; McArthur et al., 2000).\nAt Dotternhausen, there is at least a ~600 kyr CIE duration estimated from 100-kyr tuning of the grayscale series (Fig. 6C), which is in close agreement with the estimated duration 595 kyr (fifteen 35 kyr obliquity cycles) from the two parts of grayscale data plus about two obliquity cycles for the “Unterer Stein” bed (cf. fig. 3 in Suan et al., 2008). A long duration of ~970 kyr was previously obtained for the CIE by Suan et al. (2008), but their CIE occurs over a greater thickness of strata than the CIE defined in this study (Fig. 2C). Suan et al. estimated a 2.2 Myr duration for the Early Toarcian based on the assumption of a constant accumulation rate and 6.9 cm per ~20 kyr precession cycle; this estimated duration is consistent with the 2.34 Myr duration of GTS2012 and the 2.5 Myr duration from 405-kyr tuned Peniche section (above).\nAt Valdorbia,we estimated a ~550 kyr CIE (five andhalf short eccentricity cycles in Figs. 5D, 6D), which is close to ~500 kyr duration as indicated in figs. 4 and 6 in Sabatino et al. (2009). The prominent cycles of ~3.2 m analyzed from the δ13Corg and CaCO3 series in fig. 6 of Sabatino et al. (2009), are close to the ~3 m cycles recognized in the δ13Ccarb series of the present reanalysis (Fig. 5D). The duration of ~550 kyr and 5.5 cycles for the CIE may indicate that there is a hiatus within the CIE\nin this section. It has a 17.25 m thickness for the CIE which is greater than that in Dotternhausen, Yorkshire, or Peniche."

    "text": "There are 6–7 prominent short eccentricity cycles recognized in all four sections in the CIE interval. Although there has been debatewhether these 6–7 cycles are alternatively obliquity cycles or precession cycles (Kemp et al., 2005, 2011), this study suggests that they are ~100 kyr short eccentricity cycles, a conclusion supported by other authors (Suan et al., 2008; Sabatino et al., 2009; Hesselbo and Pienkowski, 2011; Hermoso et al., 2012). The ~100 kyr short eccentricity is the predominant cycle in the pre- and post-CIE strata (Fig. 3) but obliquity cycles are also strongly expressed within the CIE at Dotternhausen, Yorkshire and Peniche (Figs. 3 and 6). A weak obliquity band occurs at Valdorbia, probably because of the uneven and low-resolution sampling of this section (Figs. 2 and 6).\nOrbital eccentricity forcing of climate change during the early Toarcian OAE has been proposed by several authors (Suan et al., 2008; Sabatino et al., 2009; Hesselbo and Pienkowski, 2011). However, combined influence of obliquity and precession forcing for climate change during the global warming in the OAE interval may be the climate driver, which is similar with the late Pleistocene deglaciations (Huybers, 2011). The prominence of eccentricity scale variability in the δ13C proxies likely originates from eccentricity modulation of the precession signal. Because of the uneven and sparse sampling of the Yorkshire and Valdorbia sections, precession band power is very weak. Otherwise, Fig. 7 shows that there is a transition fromprecession–eccentricity dominated cycles in Interval 1 (pre-CIE interval) to obliquity dominated cycles in Interval 2 (CIE interval), and then back to precession–eccentricity dominated cycles in Interval 3 (post-CIE interval) (similar observation by Suan et al., 2008). This pattern also occurs in the Yorkshire section (cf. Kemp et al., 2011). Obliquity also appears to dominate cyclicity in\nthe negative δ13C excursion around the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary (Fig. 7) (Suan et al., 2008). These shifts in cyclicity indicate that the geological record's responses to astronomical forcing changed before, during and after the CIE."

    "text": "Fourteen new samples of the Karoo large igneous province yield coherent U–Pb ages ranging from 183.0 ± 0.5 to 182.3 ± 0.6 Ma, which indicate that intrusions could have taken place within 0.7 ± 0.4 Myr (less than 0.90 Myr with 95% confidence) (Svensen et al., 2012). A weighted mean age of 182.7 ± 0.2 Ma assumes that all the sills represent one event with zero duration (Svensen et al., 2012). These U–Pb ages for intrusion overlap with the initiation of the Toarcian OAE (182.16 ± 0.6 Ma) (Mazzini et al., 2010) which, even taking into account biostratigraphic uncertainty on the ages of the Mazzini et al. radiometric dates, back up a causal link between the Karoo igneous emplacement and the Toarcian OAE (Svensen et al., 2012). Svensen et al. (2007) proposed a magma emplacement time at 182.5 ± 0.4 Ma (this U–Pb age was obtained from the lowermost sill in borehole G39974 in the Karoo Basin) forming thousands of breccia pipes, and suggested that there is a causal relationship between the magmatism and the greenhouse gases venting, and Toarcian global warming. Pálfy and Smith (2000) and Hesselbo et al. (2000) also noted the synchrony between Early Jurassic extinction at the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary, the Toarcian OAE and Karoo–Ferrar flood basalt eruptions.\nThe Peniche 405-kyr tuned δ13Ccarb series indicates that the start of the CIE at the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary occurred ~860 kyr earlier than the ToarcianOAE and onset of the CIE. The Karoo basaltic intrusion, which initiated at 183.0 ± 0.5 Ma and continued for an estimated 0.7 ± 0.4 Myr (Svensen et al., 2012), could indicate that both the CIE at the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary and the subsequent early Toarcian CIE are linked to greenhouse emissions from the Karoo–Ferrar province\n(Svensen et al., 2007). Similarly Jourdan et al. (2008) suggested a ~3 Myr (181–184 Ma) duration formain sill events from15 sill samples by 40Ar/39Ar dating and highlighted the connection between the Karoo large igneous province emplacement, biotic extinction, global warming and the ToarcianOAE. In addition, astronomical forcing of the global carbon cycle during the CIE, particularly with respect to the gas hydrate reservoir, pre- and post-CIE also plays an important role in pacing the\nfate of carbon in the Early Jurassic oceans (Hesselbo et al., 2000; Kemp et al., 2005; Hesselbo and Pienkowski, 2011)."

    "text": "Four stratigraphic sections fromEarly Jurassicwestern Tethys record the Toarcian OAE with ~6 prominent carbon isotope cycles in the CIE.\nThese sections contain facies from a variety of epicontinentalmarine basins in thewestern Tethys region. The examined carbon-isotope records include marine carbonate carbon isotopes (Peniche, Valdorbia) and organic carbon isotopes (Yorkshire, Dotternhausen).\nA 405-kyr eccentricity cycle-tuned astrochronology was developed from the extended, high-resolution Peniche δ13Ccarb series, and indicates that the 6 widely recorded CIE cycles are at a 100-kyr scale. The Peniche astrochronology provides a ~2.5 Myr continuous high-resolution chronology for the Toarcian OAE. This chronology suggests a duration of 620 kyr for the main negative CIE, ~860 kyr for the polymorphum zone, N1.58 Myr for the levisoni zone, and a minimum 58 kyr duration for the negative δ13Ccarb excursion at the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary.\nThe Peniche 405-kyr tuned series indicates that the pre- and postCIE intervals experienced strong precession–eccentricity-forced climate change, whereas the CIE interval is alsomarked by strong obliquity forcing. These dramatic and abrupt changes in astronomical response in the carbon isotopes point to fundamental shifting in the Early Toarcian paleoclimate system that is linked to the global carbon cycle."
