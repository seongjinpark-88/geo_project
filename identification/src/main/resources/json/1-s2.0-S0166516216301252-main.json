The FCCM are differentiated from underlying, relatively high vitrinite Moranbah Coal Measures, and overlying higher inertinite Rangal Coal Measures in the BowenBasin by their intercalationwith abundant tuff and siliciclastic partings and interbeds. Besides this, there is little described about the variation in the organic composition of the FCCM and its causes. The FCCM can be subdivided into a lower aggradational Fair Hill Formation, transgressed by the shallow marinederived Black Alley Shale that interfinger with/is overlain by the progradational Middle Main Seams and Burngrove Formation coal measures. The coals are dominantly dull withminor bright bands that are more abundant in the Burngrove Formation representing a change in plant composition. The maceral analysis shows that the coals in the Fair Hill Formation andMiddleMain Seams are vitrinite-rich (80–90%mmf) albeitwith highmineral matter suggesting the formation of precursory peat under rising water levels and with high sediment (tuff) influx and preservation. The coals in the Burngrove Formation have an increased inertinite content (30% mmf) but are also high in mineral matter suggesting a shift to increased decomposition arising from a fluctuating water table, possibly increased aridity and/or microbial activity. Tuffs occur throughout, and although their frequency is higher in the lower Fair Hill Formation, the preservation of thicker tuffs in the upper Burngrove Formation indicates increased intensity of volcanism that could have modified the environment. Variation in carbon isotope compositions show a parabolic trend, from around−24.1‰ in the Fair Hill Formation to more variable values in the Middle Main Seams with an overall 13C-enrichment upwards in the Burngrove Formation, prior to the δ13C values becoming negative (depleted between −1 to −4% from the average −24.1‰) in the top seams and into the overlying Rangal Coal Measures. The 13C-depletion trend in the upper part of the section is unexpected in view of corresponding increase in inertinite content of the coals indicating that the δ13C values/ plant composition and inertinite content are decoupled, unless the inertinite origin is from intense microbial decay. Similar stable carbon isotope depletion trends have been observed elsewhere in an equivalent stratigraphic interval of the BowenBasin suggesting that the carbon isotope values are responding to global conditions that cause negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary. Overall, the basin was continuously subsiding and peats accumulated with constant interruptions from excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. The low proportion of visible thick bright bands coupled with high telovitrinite (mmf) content suggests a marsh to fen environment, with an open canopy and ponding able to preserve volcanic ash falls.\n© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The Late Permian Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM) and equivalent formations (Fig. 1) have an average of 400–450 m gross thickness throughout the Bowen Basin, comprising coal seams interbedded with tuffs and carbonaceous mudstone (Anderson, 1985). Although, the overall thickness of the formation is invariant, the coal seams split towards the south and the net coal thickness decreases. The FCCM were\naz).\nformed during the Late Permian foreland-loading phase of the Bowen Basin. The foreland loading phase was associated with significant volcanic activity, enhanced sedimentation and a change in basin configuration (Fielding et al., 1997; Fielding et al., 2000; Fielding et al., 2001; Holcombe et al., 1997), which resulted in the onset of contractional deformation in the east known as the Hunter-Bowen Orogeny (Holcombe et al., 1997). Near the end of the Late Permian, the global climate was changing towards increased warmth and aridity in concert with intense volcanism, eruptions of the Siberian flood basalts and possible release of methane clathrates from the sea and from permafrost melting (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Retallack and Krull,\n2006). Changes in climate and sedimentological record of the FCCM equivalent and younger formations were also observed by Metcalfe et al. (2014) around 254.1 Ma to 251.94 Ma. The FCCM is also expected to record these changes and offers an opportunity to understand the character and response of coal to tectonism and a rapidly changing climatic regime.\nThe FCCM are interpreted to have formed in association with southerly prograding river systems that were transgressed from the south by the marine Black Alley Shale (Draper, 2013). Where the Black Alley Shale occurs, the FCCM are subdivided into an upper Burngrove Formation and a lower Fair Hill Formation (Fig. 1). A series of Middle Main Seams were recognised by Ayaz et al. (2015) above and in places laterally correlative to the Black Alley Shale (Fig. 1).\nThe composition of the FCCMhas not been given attention in the literature in comparison to underlying vitrinite-rich coking coals of the Moranbah-German Creek coalmeasures (MCM) and overlying, variably inertinite-rich coking to PCI coals of the Rangal Coal Measures (RCM) (Diessel, 1992a; Mutton, 2003). The upper stratigraphic boundary of the FCCM is the Yarrabee Tuff. It is time correlative across the Bowen Basin and was deposited around 253 Ma according to CA-IDTIMS dating technique (Ayaz et al., under review). As the FCCM formed within a foreland basin setting, the seams might be expected to have a vitrinite-rich composition (Hunt and Smyth, 1989) resulting from preservation in an actively subsiding setting where an elevated water table is consistent (Clymo, 1987; Diessel and Pickel, 2012; Hunt and Smyth, 1989; McCabe, 1984; Moore, 1987; Moore and Shearer, 2003). Subsidence in conjunction with a humid climate provides optimal conditions for peat accumulation though they can also act independently (Hunt, 1989).\nThe physical conditions of the peat mire can be analysed through coal lithotypes (Lamberson et al., 1991; Teichmüller, 1989). Dull (durain) coal lithotypes are compositionally diverse, and can have different origins. If dull lithotypes are low in mineral matter, but high in inertinite group macerals, they are interpreted to have formed under oxidizing conditions either due to fungal decay (Stach et al., 1982; Hower et al., 2011a; Hower et al., 2011b; Hower et al., 2009) or fire activity (Glasspool, 2000; Glasspool, 2003). If they are high in themineral matter, regardless of maceral composition, they are interpreted to have formed under active clastic influx fromwater or wind-borne sediments (Stach et al., 1982). Conversely, bright (vitrain) band abundant\nlithotypes are formed under presumed wet anoxic conditions as they have commonly preserved xylem and bark tissues of woody vegetation (Stach et al., 1982). Additionally, Diessel (2007) suggested that these bright banded coal lithotypes are more likely to be preserved under rising and/or stable high water tables that are associated with increased subsidence during transgressive and early highstand systems tracts.\nLithotypes in conjunctionwith stable carbon isotope analysis can assist in identifying the controls on coal formation, especially climatic controls (Cristea et al., 2013; Lücke et al., 1999; Rimmer et al., 2006; Widodo et al., 2009). Carbon isotopes fractionate during photosynthesis, where plants preferentially utilise the lighter 12C fraction resulting in negative δ13C values that can vary between −23 to −35‰ (for ancient plants). Environmental factors like increased water availability, low nutrient sources, low irradiance and low temperature will result in depleted δ13C values (Grocke, 2002). On the other hand, increasing decomposition of plant material enriches the residual organic matter/ inertinite macerals in 13C (Whiticar, 1996). Changes in atmospheric CO2 can also induce variations in the carbon isotope composition of organic matter (Grocke, 2002; Kump and Arthur, 1999; Weissert and Erba, 2004). Late Permian volcanic events are considered a cause of high atmospheric CO2 (Retallack et al., 1996; Retallack and Krull, 2006; Retallack et al., 2011), with worldwide 13C-depletion in an organic matter close to the Permo-Triassic (P-T) boundary. Negative carbon isotope compositions of organic matter at the P-T boundary may reflect a combination of events including volcanism and oceanic anoxia with the possible release of methane and other gases as a result of permafrost melt (Erwin, 1993; Erwin, 1994; Gruszczynski et al., 2003; Korte and Kozur, 2010). In the southern Bowen Basin, Van de Wetering et al. (2013) observed a temporal trend in the FCCM equivalent Kaloola Member coals that showed 13C-enrichment up section followed by depletion in the overlying inertinite-rich Rangal equivalent coal measures, the Bandanna Coal Measures. This seemingly contradictory covariance was interpreted to record allogenic climatic changes associated with the approaching P-T boundary.\nAnalysing a single well, this study investigates how the sedimentary sequence and coal character of the FCCM are controlled by base level changes and sediment supply as a function of basin tectonics, localised volcanism and global events during the Late Permian time."

Tuffaceous partingswere recorded separately, as theywere abundant in the coal seams. Tuffs were recognised by their colour and smooth or soapy feel, as a beige to light brown claystone or siltstone, commonly exhibiting lapilli."

    "text": "Data for maceral composition were obtained from grain mounts of coal core (n = 84), collected in one meter increments as part of a regional gas exploration program (Well Completion Report 75985). Post desorption, the coal core was split, and a half was used for compositional analysis and half reserved formegascopic description and the collection of block samples. Grain mount sample preparation and maceral count were performed by Energy Resources Consulting Pty Ltd, as polished grain mounts under oil immersion with a magnification of 500× following the maceral classification of Australian Standard AS2856-1986. The results of maceral composition from different canisters were averaged by weight for each coal seam.\nCoal block samples of the different lithotypes from Foxleigh 4 well were also prepared at the University of Queensland to observe the textural and structural characteristics of the macerals. These were examined qualitatively using a range of air objectives resulting in magnifications from 50× to 200×. As sampling for these blocks was sporadic, the data are only used to illustrate banding character in this paper, whereas the contiguous grain mounts are more representative of the stratigraphic variation within the FCCM, coupledwith themacroscopic lithotype profiles."

    "text": "A high-resolution sampling for stable carbon isotope analysis of FCCM coal seams was performed on the Foxleigh 4 well at 20 cm intervals within individual seams, resulting in 271 samples. Samples of vitrain bands were collected with a metal clipper and avoided any mineralised zones or cleats. The metal clipper allowed a 2-5 g sample to be pinched from the vitrain band. Samples were ground manually to a fine powder, and processed at the University of Queensland Stable Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory. Powderswere examined for any possible carbonate contamination and found lacking. Carbon isotopes were analysed with an Isoprime Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer coupled with an Elemental Analyser (EA-CF-IRMS) using two calibration standards USGS24 (−16.1‰ δ13C VPDB) and NAT76H (−29.26‰ δ13C VPDB). The results were normalised via a two point regression (Paul et al., 2007) and are reported in per mil with a precision of ±0.1‰ at one standard deviation. Obtained results were also averaged for individual seams to compare with the petrographic and lithotype data sets."

    "heading": "3.1.1. Vertical succession of sedimentary facies in Foxleigh 4",
    "text": "The vertical succession of interpreted sedimentary facies is shown in Fig. 3. The Fair Hill Formation in this well is characterised by the occurrence of thick, ~25–35 m, amalgamated channel sandstones (Fig. 2, Facies A) separated by finer grained heterolithic sequences and coals (Fig. 2, Facies B). The coal seams decrease in thickness from the Fair Hill Seam at the base, to the Lepus, Canis and Hercules seams. Above the Hercules Seam, the heterolithic sediments are intensely bioturbated and the Phoenix/Pegasus seams are very thin, and overlain by marine facies of the Black Alley Shale (Fig. 2, Facies D). This alternating sequence of mire and channel sandstone facies represents channel abandonment and its reoccupation in a proximal fluvial environment as base level is rising, causing the channels to avulse, become distal distributaries, and eventually be overcome by a transgressing sea.\nWithin the Black Alley Shale, a series of small-scale coarsening and fining upwards sequences occur, but overall the system coarsens upward with a set of stacked coarsening upward sequences interpreted as shoreface sandstone facies (Fig. 2, Facies E). Sediment supply equals or overtakes the base level rise, and results in a sequence of thin coals interbedded with laminated mudstones and sandstones within the Middle Main Seams. Within this sequence, the frequency and thickness of sandstones increases upwards. Soft sediment deformation, mud rip up clasts and climbing ripples are common, suggesting rapid but alternating deposition in a distal deltaic or floodplain environment (Fig. 2, Facies C).\nUp section, the coal seams (Fig. 2, Facies B) become thicker in the Burngrove Formation and are associated with laminated carbonaceous mudstone, siltstones and sandstone bodies with a mix of coarsening, and fining upward sequences. The presence of quartz and lithic pebbles, rather than mud rip-up clasts, suggests that the fluvial system is receivingmore sediment froma hinterland as it progrades and aggrades. Ironstone (?siderite) staining and bedding become more prevalent in the heterolithic strata, as does root penetration, although at times alternating with carbonaceous mudstone (Fig. 2, Facies C). The sequence is interpreted as moving from a sluggish environment with minor splays and lakes to a more active fluvial system. These channel facies passes into mire (Pisces Seam) where the Yarrabee Tuff is preserved. The Yarrabee Tuff is a regionally persistent tuff that is used as the boundary of the FCCM and the overlying RCM (Anderson, 1985).\nOverall, the Foxleigh 4 core is interpreted to represent temporal variation in sedimentary environments from fluvial to near-shore marine and back to fluvial environments upwards in the sequence. The aggradational sequence in the Fair Hill Formation suggests stable to increasing base level with an alternating low to high energy environment depositing peat and clastics (i.e. formation within a transgressive systems tract). This responds to the invading Black Alley Shale transgression (or highstand systems tract), which is encroached by progradational shoreface sandstone facies that could also form within the highstand (Fig. 3). The overlying Middle Main Seams and the Burngrove Formation represent a progradational sequence with the development of alternating high energy and poorly drained low energy facies. The prograding upwards sequence becomes dominated by channel sandstones probably due to an increase in sediment supply as there is little incision or downcutting. In a declining base level system, if one considers the ongoing Hunter Bowen Orogeny at the time of the FCCM, the sediment supply should exceed the accommodation. This continued into the overlying RCM."

    "heading": "3.2. Compositional variation in coal lithotypes and macerals in Foxleigh 4",
    "text": "The lithotype composition of the FCCM in Foxleigh 4 is dominated by dull coal and carbonaceous mudstone, with minor amounts (3.75% to 18.17%) of bright coal, and of tuff (2–26%) (Table 1). There is no visible relationship between coal seam thickness and lithotype composition. Nevertheless, the seams as defined in the Fair Hill Formation show a minor decrease in carbonaceous mudstone and tuff up section as the\nS.A.A yaz etal./InternationalJournalofCoalG eology 166 (2016) 36–46\n40 S.A.A yaz etal./InternationalJournalofCoalG eology 166 (2016) 36–46\nseams thin towards the Black Alley Shale (Fig. 3). The Middle Main seams show an opposite trend, where the proportion of carbonaceous mudstone increases up section, (Fig. 3) while in the overlying Burngrove Formation, the coal seams show the least proportion of carbonaceous mudstone and tuff, as logged. The lithotype variation in the Middle Main Seams likely results from increased subsidence and/or water level that reverts in the Burngrove coal seams. The bright band proportion throughout the sequence is dominantly b10% (Table 1), although the vitrinite group macerals on a mineral matter free basis are high and discussed later (Table 2). Vitrain band thickness is dominantly less than 2 mm although there are few thick vitrain bands of b10– 12 mm in some seams (Fig. 3b). The plot of bright band proportion N10mmshows an increasing upward brightness trend in the Burngrove Formation and upper section of the Fair Hill Formation before transgression (Fig. 3c). Though the overall bright bands are thin and few, the brightness trend reflect a change in plant community, possibly\nincreasing woodiness in a mire. The nature of 15 mm bands under the microscope appears to be Glossopteris wood surrounded by clay-rich matrix. Hence, it is possible that the mire type had been alternating between marsh to fen type wetland throughout the sequence.\nThe tuff band thickness shows a distinctive distribution where tuffs are commonly b10–50 mm, and those nearly a meter thick are uncommon (Fig. 4A) and restricted to the Burngrove Formation (Fig. 4B). An increasing upward trend of the tuff thickness suggests a variation in tuff preservation, intensity of volcanic eruption or both (Fig. 4B). The coals in the Fair Hill Formation become less mudstone-rich upwards, possibly due to peat formation keeping pace with subsidence, alternating with drowning, in response to Black Alley Shale transgression. The coals in Middle Main Seams with increasing mudstone possibly reflect increased subsidence/or water level with the poor development of coals. The coals in the Burngrove Formation with the dulling upwards trends, decreasing mudstone and thicker tuffs reflect a more balanced\nFig. 4.Graphs showing lithotype data of tuff bands.

The dullness is a function of both, the ash yield and increased proportion of inertinite group macerals, which could reflect changes in climate related to water fluctuation, aridity or increased O2 levels, and is discussed later.\nUnder the microscope, the bright bands are telovitrinite with two different textures. The first texture includes thinly (~200–300 μm) banded telovitrinite interspersed with fine-grained, mineral matter, which is expected to bewind or water-borne detrital minerals and tuffaceous richmatrix due to continuous ash fall through time (Fig. 5A). The second texture includes thick (~1–2mm) telovitrinite bandswith cleats infilledwithminerals and fluids leached from the ash fall and secondary carbonate formation (Fig. 5B). Samples from the Burngrove Formation contain some angular shaped detrital minerals, which can possibly be volcanic glass from ash falls (Fig. 5C); however, these minerals were not observed in the Fair Hill Formation. This observation tracks the thickness distribution of tuffs, which indicates increased intensity of volcanic eruption during Burngrove Formation time.\nIf one looks at the grain mount petrographic analysis results (Table 2), the surprise is the abundance of vitrinite group macerals, 60 to 90%, on a mineral matter free basis across all the coal seams (Fig. 3).Much of this is telovitrinite, with a small percentage of detrovitrinite. There is a significant trend of increased inertinite groupmaceral content (dominantly fusinite and semifusinite) in the Burngrove Formation coals (Fig. 3), suggesting some sort of environmental change. As opposed to the fire origin of the inertinite (Glasspool, 2000; Glasspool, 2003; Scott and Glasspool, 2007), it is quite possible that increased volcanic ash thickness in the Burngrove Formation has changed the pH of the mire, promoting microbial activity that results in inertinite formation (Crowley et al., 1989; Crowley et al., 1994) termed as ‘degradosemifusinite’ by Beeston (1987). Overall, based on the lithotype and maceral composition, it is interpreted that all of these coals have formed in a consistently flooded, limno-telmatic marshy floodplain environment without any ability to stabilise and succeed into a forested bog to form thick, bright banded coal seams with thick telovitrinite bands. If the ash yield of the sequence is considered, this is high throughout\ning no trend and suggesting that these factors are not dependent on each other.\nthe sequence (Fig. 3), representing a consistent sedimentary influx that could come from increased volcanic eruptions, or an open mire system that enhances their preservation (Creech, 2002). A minor decrease in the ash content of the Burngrove Formation may represent decreased runoff during the base level decline. Hence, the FCCM represent consistent environmental conditions except for the increased inertinite group macerals upwards that suggest increasing degradation and oxidation stimulated by volcanic ash deposition, an increasingly arid environment, or a combination of both."

    "text": "The coal δ13C values for Foxleigh 4 show an average of −24.1‰ (STD= 0.5) but fluctuate stratigraphically (Fig. 3). The Fair Hill Formation has consistent δ13C values close to the average of −24.1‰ with a 13C-enrichment trend upward. Within the Middle Main Seams, the δ13C values vary but show overall 13C-enrichment upward that continues into the base of the Burngrove Formation. Upwards 13Cenrichment suggests a possible change in the type of plant community through the sequence or the gradual decline of water level as evidenced by the depositional sequence of the FCCM. Within the upper part of the Burngrove Formation, the δ13C values revert and become negative upwards through the Rangal Coal Measures (Fig. 3). This trend is similar to that observed by Van de Wetering et al. (2013) and they are compared in Fig. 7.\nAt the coal seam level, the smaller scale fluctuations in the δ13C values vary frequently within the range of−1.5‰ to−0.2‰ over a distance of 0.2 to N1 m, though resulting in a different trend in each seam (Fig. 3b). In the Fair Hill Formation, coal seams begin to show an overall enrichment upwards/lightening-up trend (Fig. 3b-E and F), which reflects a change from standing water levels (?marsh) to more variable or relatively drier (i.e. no standing water) conditions (?fen), and would reflect terrestrialisation and expansion of the mire. Contrary to this, the coal seams in the Burngrove Formation show an overall depleting upwards/or heavy-up/or drowning-up trend (Fig. 3b-B and C) reflecting increased water availability for the formation of peat. This is counter intuitive, as the seams in the Burngrove still show punctuated cycles of increasing bright band thickness. InMiddleMain Seams,\nFig. 7. Comparison between the δ13C trends (raw data) in this study on the left and δ13C trends with relative 13C-enrichment in the Fair Hill and equivalent formations, MiddleMain Seams and the Kaloola Member, the δ13C values become more negative into the Rangal and equivalent s\\f\nboth lightening-up and heavy-up 13C-trends are observed reflecting frequent water fluctuation/or instability during peat formation. Variable 13C-trends in the Middle Main Seams can possibly be the transition from 13C-enrichment in the Fair Hill seams to 13C-depletion in the Burngrove seams, where a shift in increasing inertinite content is observed. The inertinite content continues to increase in the overlying Rangal Coal Measures (Mutton, 2003), where the δ13C values deplete further by −1.0‰. Again, if the stable carbon isotopes were only responding to the inertinite maceral composition, then one would expect enrichment.\nThe presence of high inertinite content suggests enhanced aridity, or at least increasing fluctuations in the water table leading to intensified decomposition. Diessel (2010) showed a global increase in the inertinite content of the Late Permian stratigraphic sections, concluding that the climatic transition to arid environment is the possible reason for inertinite formation. In our study, however, the formation of inertinite with depleting 13C trends (under high water availability) is conflicting. A cross plot of the inertinite content and the negative δ13C values of the Burngrove Formation does not show any trend, suggesting these factors are decoupled (Fig. 6). There is a possibility that the upward 13C-depletion in the Burngrove and Rangal Coal Measures is related to the global climatic changes occurring at the end of the Late Permian time, rather than local environmental effects. The observed 13Cdepletion trend may result from: (1) sea level rise/recovery in the Late Permian (Haq and Schutter, 2008) possibly due to deglaciation and ocean expansion (Kidder and Worsley, 2004) leading to increased water availability andmore negative δ13C values; or (2) itmay be linked to the negative carbon isotope excursion just before the P-T boundary interpreted to reflect release of clathrates (Retallack et al., 2011). Our data suggests that increasing peat degradation, indicated by the inertinite group macerals, caused by melting permafrost, could also release clathrates and biogenic methane into the atmosphere, as recorded by the 13C-depletion trend.\nVarious palaeoclimatic studies (Faure et al., 1995; Montañez et al., 2007; Van de Wetering et al., 2013; White et al., 1994) use organic δ13C values as a proxy for atmospheric CO2 because increased volcanism and possible clathrate release in the Late Permian is thought to be responsible for high atmospheric CO2 (Retallack and Krull, 2006;\nobserved by Van deWetering et al. (2013) on right. The stratigraphic sequence is the same a part of KaloolaMember. In the upper part of the Burngrove Formation and upper part of ormations.\nRetallack et al., 2011) resulting in 13C-depleted isotope values in organic matter. Numerous tuffs in the FCCM reflect upon various local volcanic events of the time; however, a link with volcanism is not conclusive from our high-resolution lithotype and carbon isotope data set. In Rangal Coal Measures, no significant volcanic event is recorded in the sequence, however, δ13C values are still depleted reflecting that the data does not respond to the volcanic effect. Permafrost melting possibly led to the gas escape from the reservoirs, influencing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The climatic/or atmospheric changes can subsequently mask the local environmental effects as observed in the Burngrove and the overlying Rangal and equivalent Bandanna Formation. Regionally, the local environmental factors like water table and stress influence the plant growth more readily and are evident from the carbon isotope trends in individual seams."

    "heading": "4. Summary and conclusions",
    "text": "This study established the depositional and palaeoenvironmental architecture of the FCCM in Foxleigh 4 using sedimentary interpretations, coal lithotype profile, maceral composition and organic stable carbon isotope analysis. Overall, the FCCM record an upward progradational sequence in a downwarping basin with high sedimentation rates coincident with volcanism.\nThe sedimentary interpretations suggest that the FCCM sequence is interrupted by the regional Black Alley Shale transgression; however, the lithotype and maceral composition of coal does not really respond except in the Burngrove Formation. The basin was continuously subsiding and the coals could not develop as thick bright banded coals, although they do have abundant vitrinite group macerals on a mineral matter free basis. Due to high input of sediments and volcanic ash fall, the accumulated peat was preserved and buried rapidly. The high mineral matter in the coal is the reason for the macroscopically dull nature of the FCCM coals.\nIn the Fair Hill Formation, the aggradational sequence and increase in faunal bioturbation upwards in the sequence (Fig. 3) indicates rising base level leading to the Black Alley Shale transgression. The coals in the Fair Hill Formation are vitrinite-rich albeit with high mineral matter suggesting the formation of coal under high sediment influx.\nThe Middle Main Seams with high vitrinite composition do represent suitable conditions for peat accumulation; however, abundant carbonaceousmudstone in the coal seams indicates that the peatmire was possibly drowned or under fluctuating water table conditions. The inconsistent carbon isotopes also support the fluctuating water level in the Middle Main Seams. Such type of peat formation is common in a coastal or deltaic settingwhere unstable accommodation andpeat accumulation may result in frequent flooding (Diessel, 1992b; Taylor et al., 1998). Based on variable carbon isotopes trends, one can interpret frequent water level fluctuations during the Middle Main Seams after the BlackAlley Shale transgression. The ash yields and lithotypeproportions suggest that the peat was receiving excessive sediments. This scenario can be related to the regional tectonic setting of the Bowen Basin in the Late Permian where the ongoing Hunter Bowen Orogeny increased the sediment influx in the basin that invaded the peat mire systems. Hence, the Middle Main Seams may represent a transition to declining base level conditions.\nThe coals in the overlying Burngrove Formation are also high in ash yield indicative of excessive sediment supply, which can also force the base level to decline. Preservation of thick tuffs in the Burngrove Formation (Fig. 4B) indicates increased intensity of volcanism, and open peat canopies to preserve the ash falls. It is likely that the Hunter Bowen Orogeny had caused increased mire disturbance upwards in the FCCM sequence associated with excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. In this context, coals in the Burngrove Formation show a change in maceral composition with higher inertinite content (Fig. 3). The inertinite is interpreted to result from declining water level supplemented by microbial activity risen from volcanic ash deposition.\nConsidering the progradational sequence of the Burngrove Formation, the base level/water level is expected to decline; however, the carbon isotopes represent a depleting trend where they should have more enriching trend. The contrast betweenmaceral composition and carbon isotopes can be explained by the global climatic changes near the endPermian time. The Late Permian is characterised by increased aridity and warming (Chumakov and Zharkov, 2003; Faure et al., 1995; Fluteau et al., 2001; Kidder and Worsley, 2004) due to the eruption of Siberianflood basalts and possible release of clathrates leading to deglaciation and increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Melting permafrost would also result in intense degradation, the release of clathrates and also CH4 into the atmosphere. This effect is also interpreted through negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary (Retallack et al., 2011), also observed by Van de Wetering et al. (2013) in Burngrove equivalent Kaloola Member and Rangal equivalent Bandanna Coal Measures in the southern Bowen Basin.\nHence, throughout the FCCMsequence, subsidence and sediment influx related to Hunter Bowen Orogeny may have been the dominant control on the formation and resulting quality of the coals. Although the coals are high in ash yield, much from volcaniclastics, they are also vitrinite-rich. This could contribute to variable gas reservoir quality locally or to the potential for coking coal, albeit of low yields."

  "abstractText": "Article history: Received 26 November 2015 Received in revised form 8 April 2016 Accepted 14 April 2016 Available online 16 April 2016 An integrated analysis of megascopic lithotype, microscopicmaceral andmineral composition, stable carbon isotope and interburden sedimentology from a single well was used to interpret the response of the Late Permian Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM) to regional and global environmental influences. The FCCM are differentiated from underlying, relatively high vitrinite Moranbah Coal Measures, and overlying higher inertinite Rangal Coal Measures in the BowenBasin by their intercalationwith abundant tuff and siliciclastic partings and interbeds. Besides this, there is little described about the variation in the organic composition of the FCCM and its causes. The FCCM can be subdivided into a lower aggradational Fair Hill Formation, transgressed by the shallow marinederived Black Alley Shale that interfinger with/is overlain by the progradational Middle Main Seams and Burngrove Formation coal measures. The coals are dominantly dull withminor bright bands that are more abundant in the Burngrove Formation representing a change in plant composition. The maceral analysis shows that the coals in the Fair Hill Formation andMiddleMain Seams are vitrinite-rich (80–90%mmf) albeitwith highmineral matter suggesting the formation of precursory peat under rising water levels and with high sediment (tuff) influx and preservation. The coals in the Burngrove Formation have an increased inertinite content (30% mmf) but are also high in mineral matter suggesting a shift to increased decomposition arising from a fluctuating water table, possibly increased aridity and/or microbial activity. Tuffs occur throughout, and although their frequency is higher in the lower Fair Hill Formation, the preservation of thicker tuffs in the upper Burngrove Formation indicates increased intensity of volcanism that could have modified the environment. Variation in carbon isotope compositions show a parabolic trend, from around−24.1‰ in the Fair Hill Formation to more variable values in the Middle Main Seams with an overall C-enrichment upwards in the Burngrove Formation, prior to the δC values becoming negative (depleted between −1 to −4% from the average −24.1‰) in the top seams and into the overlying Rangal Coal Measures. The C-depletion trend in the upper part of the section is unexpected in view of corresponding increase in inertinite content of the coals indicating that the δC values/ plant composition and inertinite content are decoupled, unless the inertinite origin is from intense microbial decay. Similar stable carbon isotope depletion trends have been observed elsewhere in an equivalent stratigraphic interval of the BowenBasin suggesting that the carbon isotope values are responding to global conditions that cause negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary. Overall, the basin was continuously subsiding and peats accumulated with constant interruptions from excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. The low proportion of visible thick bright bands coupled with high telovitrinite (mmf) content suggests a marsh to fen environment, with an open canopy and ponding able to preserve volcanic ash falls. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.
