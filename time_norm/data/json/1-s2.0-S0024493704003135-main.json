Therefore, phreatomagmatic and phreatoplinian eruptions occurring during the final rifting stages of active flood basalt provinces provide a potent mechanism for triggering climate change.\nDuring the early Eocene, the northeast Atlantic margin was subjected to repeated ashfall for 0.5 m.y. This was the result of extensive phreatomagmatic activity along 3000 km of the opening northeast Atlantic rift. These widespread, predominantly basaltic ashes are now preserved in marine sediments of the Balder Formation and its equivalents, and occur over an area extending from the Faroe Islands to Denmark and southern England. These ash-bearing sediments also contain pollen and spore floras derived from low diversity forests that grew in cooler, drier climates than were experienced either before or after these highly explosive eruptions. In addition, coeval plant macrofossil evidence from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, also shows a comparable pattern of vegetation change. The coincidence of the ashes and cooler climate pollen and spore floras in northwest Europe identifies volcanism as the primary cause of climate cooling. Estimates show that whilst relatively few phreatomagmatic eruptive centres along the 3000 km opening rift system could readily generate 0.5–1 8C cooling, on an annual basis, only persistent or repeated volcanic phases would have been able to achieve the long-term cooling effect observed in the floral record. We propose that the cumulative effect of repeated Balder Formation eruptions initiated a biodiversity crisis in the northeast Atlantic margin forests. Only the decline of this persistent volcanic activity, and the subsequent climatic warming at the start of the Eocene Thermal Maximum allowed the growth of subtropical forests to develop across the region.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "During the early Paleogene, the arrival of the Iceland plume beneath the Greenland–northwest European lithosphere led to widespread eruption of\ncontinental flood basalts extending over an area from Ireland to east Greenland (Fig. 1). Initially, activity was sporadic and concentrated towards the south, but by 60.5 Ma, the effects of the plume had produced the early stages of North Atlantic rifting, and extensive basalt lava fields had developed along 3000 km of this proto-rift zone (Jolley and Bell, 2002). This volcanic activity began to wane during the earliest Eocene, and the rift-related volcanism contracted to the area between the Faroe Islands and east Greenland (Heister et al., 2001; Jolley et al., 2002), persisting there until the present day. As with many large igneous provinces (LIPs), the majority of the materials erupted throughout the volcanic episode were basaltic in composition, with only relatively minor contributions from more silicic, and hence more explosive eruptions. However, toward the close of North Atlantic Igneous Province volcanic activity, the nature of the volcanism changed\nfrom apparently quiescent terrestrial flood basalt eruptions to a repeated, highly explosive eruption style producing numerous widely distributed basaltic ashes. This phase of explosive volcanism initiated during the early Eocene, the early ashes yielding 40Ar–39Ar isotopic dates from c. 54.5 to 54.0 Ma (Berggren et al., 1995; Larsen et al., 2003), and was the result of widespread phreatomagmatic activity caused by the interaction of the ongoing basaltic volcanism with an influx of water along the opening North Atlantic rift. Importantly, coeval changes in the vegetation around the northeast Atlantic reveals that the eruption of these large volumes of ash N1 m.y. after the widely documented short-term climatic warming of the Late Paleocene Thermal maximum (LPTM), is synchronous with a pronounced climate cooling event.\nVolcanic ashes from this phreatomagmatic phase occur within the marine sediments of the Balder\non map.\nFormation from the Faroe-Shetland and Rockall Basins (Ebdon et al., 1995; Naylor et al., 1999) and typically show sorting and graded bedding which reflect marine redistribution of primary ashfall (Knox and Morton, 1988). In the east, they occur in the North Sea (Malm et al., 1984), in the claystones of the Fur and Ølst formations in Denmark (Boggild, 1918), and in the Wrabness Member of the Harwich Formation of southeastern England (Figs. 1 and 2; Knox and Ellison, 1979; Jolley, 1996). Their southern limit is controlled by a lack of preservation in arenaceous neritic facies deposited over the shallow shelf of the Anglo–Paris Basin (King, 1981; Jolley, 1996). Where they are preserved, the number of ash horizons recorded is dependent on the lithology, thickness of sections, and the completeness of cored boreholes. In Denmark, the tuffaceous claystones contain up to two hundred basaltic ash beds (Boggild, 1918; Nielsen and Heilmann-Clausen, 1988). Offshore, the Balder Formation has the greatest concentration of ashes in Unit B1 (Knox and Holloway, 1992). Relatively few ashes occur in the Balder Formation Unit B2 (Fig. 2). Ash beds also occur in the older Sele Formation (Fig. 2), but these are thin and discontinuous, and lack the repetitive frequency typical of the overlying Balder Formation. The preservation of these ashes indicates a southeast downwind distribution of aerosols (Knox and Morton, 1988), and repeated eruption of large\nvolumes of basaltic ash, together with such longdistance transportation testifies to the duration and volume of phreatomagmatic activity along the nascent North Atlantic rift system. This change in eruptive style from extensive subaerial flood basalt eruptions and the coeval emplacement of seaward-dipping reflector series offshore of east Greenland (Larsen and Saunders, 1998), to highly explosive volcanism therefore marks the flooding of the northeast Atlantic rift and potentially the most environmentally damaging final stage of the Paleocene–Eocene volcanic activity.\nThe synchronicity between the short-lived ash eruptive phase of the Balder Formation, and the observed climate cooling is unlikely to be accidental. This paper aims to investigate whether this type of late-stage rift-related explosive volcanism has the potential to generate the degree and duration of climate cooling indicated by the palynofloral record of the Balder Formation."

The Danish ashes are divided into positive and negative series,\ntions of the Ar–Ar dated +19 and 17 ashes are also shown.\n(1992), the depositional sequences labelled T40–T60 are those of\nLPTM to the base of the Balder Formation interval resulted in a decline in diversity of the pollen and spore assemblages (Fig. 3), reflecting a simplification of plant community structure. Against this background of overall decline, an abrupt fall in diversity occurs at the base of the Balder Formation, coinciding with the maximum ash output from the rift to the northwest. In the upper Balder Formation Unit B2, the decrease in ash eruption is matched by a recovery in pollen and\nspore diversity, which continues into the overlying Horda Formation (Sequence T60 of Ebdon et al., 1995: see Figs. 2 and 3). Such a linkage between assemblage composition, diversity, and ash abundance implies a causal relationship between these data.\nFrequencies of aquatic marginal pollen and spore taxa, ferns, and thermophyllic Normapolles fall in the Balder Formation (Fig. 3).

The depositional sequences T40–\nlenties veripites to Caryapollenties circulus. The warm period immediately after the LPTM (Winkler and Gawenda, 1999), and the later (circa 52 Ma) Eocene thermal maximum (Condon et al., 1992), both support C. veripites as the dominant juglandaceous species. The replacement of this species by C. circulus indicates a cooler environment. Further evidence from the major drop in diversity and abundance of fern spores and aquatic monocot pollen indicates that the period was also dryer. Subsequently, this cooler, dryer interval gave way to an increasingly warm and wet environment as ash eruptions along the rift declined. This is reflected in increased pollen and spore diversity in the Horda/London Clay formations, and the appearance of megathermal pollen taxa (Gruas-Cavagnetto, 1978), including Bombacacidites (Bombax-Balsa and Baobab), Spinizonocolpites echinatus (Nypa, a palm), Sapotaceoidaepollenites (Sapotaceae, tropical trees including Guta-percha), and Dicolpopollis species (Calamus, rattan palm), some occurring as far north as the Shetland Islands (Condon et al., 1992). These data mark the initiation of global warming in the period immediately prior to the Eocene thermal maximum.\nBeyond the immediate influence of the ash fall area, evidence from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA provides a comparison, and enables the quantification of the northern hemisphere temperature decline. The age calibration used by Wing et al. (1999) for the Bighorn Basin sequences is based on isotopic analysis of a local tephra, extrapolated using the paleomagnetic time scale. Physiognomic analysis of leaf macrofossil floras from the late Paleocene to early Eocene of these Bighorn Basin sediments demonstrates a circa 3 8C decline in mean annual temperature. This fall in mean annual temperature is matched by a decline in average floral diversity. This cooling and diversity decline is recorded by Wing et al. (1999) to occur between circa 54.25 and 53.75 Ma Using 40Ar–39Ar isotopic dating for the ashes (Berggren et al., 1995) of the uppermost Sele Formation Unit S3 ( 19 ash 54.5 Ma) and the basal Balder Formation ash +19 (54.0 Ma), as a direct means of correlation, a correlation with the palynofloral diversity decline of the northeastern Atlantic margin is established (Fig. 3).\nUnlike the Bighorn Basin, leaf macrofossils are largely absent from the Balder Formation interval of\nthe northeast Atlantic. However, the palynological evidence for a shift from a humid warm temperate angiosperm forest, to a dryer mixed mesophytic forest over the post-LPTM to Balder Formation interval infers a fall in mean annual temperature. By analogy to the temperature parameters of equivalent modern floras (Wolfe, 1985), this fall ranged from 3 to 5 8C. Alongside the macrofossil data from the Bighorn Basin, the close similarity of diversity trends between the two regions is evident. Moreover, this transcontinental comparability negates the possibility of reduction in diversity of the northeast Atlantic Margin vegetation as a consequence of downwind fallout from the rift volcanism, such as that resulting from volcanic SO2-derived acidic rain or by direct ashfall. Rather, this evidence of ash, floral diversity collapse, temperature fall, and drying of the environment implicates instead climatic forcing as a result of volcanic activity. Paleoclimatic indicators from deepsea sediments similarly indicate significant temperature decreases in the oceans at c. 54 Ma (e.g., Kennet, 1980; Bains et al., 2000). Such oceanic cooling indicates a widespread and persistent climatic deterioration linked to North Atlantic volcanism (Devine et al., 1984)."

    "heading": "3. Effects of eruption on climate",
    "text": "The effects of volcanic eruption on climate are determined by the style and magnitude of eruption, the composition of the magma, efficiency of gas delivery to the eruption column, and the duration and frequency of activity. Geographical position, prevailing meteorological conditions, seasonality, and atmospheric composition and structure (i.e., height of tropopause) will also fundamentally influence the degree and longevity of any volcanically induced climate change. However, both the injection of volcanic ash and SO2 are known to result in measurable cooling responses because gas and solid aerosol products backscatter incoming solar radiation which then affects the Earth’s radiative balance (Robock, 2000). Consequently, the most serious climatic effects are created by explosive eruptions which deliver sulphur compounds directly into the stratosphere where they are rapidly advected around the globe, achieving residence times and climatic\nresponses of several years (Rampino and Self, 1984). By contrast, ash and sulphur injected into the troposphere are removed over days or weeks and so, whilst they may have an immediate and damaging impact upon biota, their environmental effects tend to be regional rather than hemispheric or global (Robock, 2000). Stratospheric injection is largely dependent upon the power of the volcanic eruption (i.e., its volcanic explosivity index, VEI; Newhall and Self, 1982), and the height of the tropopause which varies with latitude. Stratospheric injection typically becomes possible at VEI 3, but VEI 3 corresponds to the uppermost limit of most historic basaltic eruptions (Newhall and Self, 1982).\nBy contrast with more silicic magmas, basaltic compositions have a high dissolved sulphur concentration and a potentially high emission of SO2 and H2S during eruption, but the low explosivity of most basaltic eruptions precludes efficient delivery of this gas into the stratosphere. This apparently dquiescentT nature of basaltic eruptions results from the fluidity of the magma which allows the constituent gases to escape during its ascent and associated lava eruption. Furthermore, the commonly cited paradox of reconciling flood basalt eruptions with possible climate change is largely derived from the fact that effusion, rather explosion, characterises modern basaltic eruptions. However, other historical analogues demonstrate that intensity and persistence of eruption (e.g., Laki, Iceland 1783, Thordasson and Self, 1993), rather than just lava volume or sulphur budget (Eldgja, Iceland 934 A.D., Thordasson et al., 2001), may represent primary controlling factors in climate forcing. In this context, it is important to note that the initial post-LPTM basaltic extrusions of the North Atlantic Igneous Province did not produce observable effects in forest community diversity or species abundance (Fig. 3), probably because this early stage of the activity was characterised by a relatively quiescent mafic lava effusion. Clearly, to achieve the floral turnover observed in the Balder Formation (Fig. 3) would have required much more climatically damaging volcanic events. These would have had to have been sufficiently explosive to affect the higher atmospheric levels. Stratospheric pollutant delivery of this nature becomes possible when water and basaltic magma interact creating phreatomagmatic or phreatoplinean eruptions (Houghton et al., 2000). In addition,\nit is probable that in order to achieve the observed degree and duration of Balder cooling, any climatic effects induced by these phreatomagmatic eruptions would have had to have persisted over time, and to have been cumulative."

    "heading": "4. Estimating volcanically induced Eocene climate cooling",
    "text": "Determining how volcanically induced climate change may have operated c. 54 Ma is problematical. Therefore, in the absence of complex global climatic models for the early Eocene, the only available methods by which the effects of the Balder ash eruptions may be estimated is by analogy with modern phreatomagmatic basaltic eruptions (e.g., Surtsey), and through the use of simple climate cooling relationships derived from historic volcanic eruption data. Obviously, it remains arguable whether these historic data actually do provide an appropriate analogue for the type of rift-related volcanism that produced the Balder Formation ashes (Larsen et al., 2003). However, judicious use of extant data should provide first-pass estimates of the effects of ancient volcanism may have had on past climate. Most importantly, these data can provide a basis for a critical evaluation of whether such volcanically induced climate change is feasible given the composition and style of the early Eocene Balder eruptions.\nThe climatic effects of historic volcanism is measurable, and has been widely recognised (Devine et al., 1984; Holasek et al., 1996; Stenchikov et al., 1993). The established correlation between sulphur yield of historic eruptions and Northern Hemisphere temperature decrease (Devine et al., 1984; Sigurdsson, 1990) can be expressed arithmetically by Eq. (1).\nDT 8C ¼ 5:9 105 x0:31\nð1Þ\n(where DT is degree of cooling, and x is mass (g) of erupted sulphur.\nIf Eq. (1) is adopted as a valid relationship between sulphur yield and climate cooling for moderately sized to large volcanic eruptions (i.e., zVEI 4), it becomes necessary to explore which type of eruption best offers an analogue comparable in eruption style, composition, and geological setting to those that generated the Balder ashes.\nThe Surtsey eruptions of the 1960s (Thorarinsson et al., 1964; White and Houghton, 2000), provide a useful modern analogue to North Atlantic rift-related volcanism, especially since they were a product of the same plume and spreading system as the earlier Cenozoic activity. Although Surtsey generated only a modest amount of volcanic materials (c. 1 km3 in 3.5 years’ eruption), its latter phreatomagmatic stages produced massive eruption columns. A similar style of volcanism is proposed for the opening North Atlantic rift system during the early Eocene (Peate et al., 2003), thus providing potential for prolonged atmospheric pollution through efficient delivery of sulphur to the stratosphere. Variations in petrogenesis result in magmas with variable amounts of dissolved sulphur, but a range of 1000–2000 ppm is considered typical of Icelandic basaltic magmas (Metrich et al., 1991; Thordasson et al., 2001). This variation, together with eruption conditions, controls upon the amount of dissolved sulphur delivered to the eruption column, and results in a range of possible fluxes to the atmosphere."

    "heading": "5. Climate cooling models and discussion",
    "text": "By employing Eq. (1) to analogous Surtseyeanstyle eruptions, it becomes possible to model the potential climate change (DT) induced by varying numbers of similarly sized volcanic centres along the opening North Atlantic rift (Fig. 4).\nHowever, since climate and eruption variables conditions cannot be accurately constrained for the early Eocene, it is useful to consider a wider range of cooling responses than are predicted by historic eruptions (i.e., Eq. (1)). In order to incorporate a wider range of possible responses, the predicted cooling effects have been increased and decreased by 50% to produce lines (a1) and (b1), thereby reasonably constraining the range of any likely volcanogenic cooling effects upon the ancient climate system. Whichever of the modelled curves is chosen as most appropriate, one consequence of Eq. (1) is that the cooling response (DT) becomes progressively less sensitive to increasingly larger amounts of sulphur delivery. Inspection of Fig. 4 indicates that\nate cooling and likely sulphur yield derived from different numbers resulting from basaltic eruptions with a sulphur content of 2000 ppm n) cooling response resulting from eruption sulphur content of 1000 ). Dotted lines (a1) and (b1) indicate 50% enhanced and diminished . According to the cooling relationship, a minimum of 40 Surtseyean the eruption column are required to create a 1 8C cooling response. uptions would be required to generate a similar response. In the lessn (curve b), 40 Surtseyan eruptions would generate a 0.7 8C cooling. 50% (curve b1), the cooling effect remains below 0.4 8C irrespective\nwithin the likely variable ranges (curves a and b), c. 12–40 Surtseyean-type eruptions, each producing c. 0.3 km3 per annum (Fig. 4), would be required to generate a 0.7 8C cooling (i.e., equivalent to that recorded for the 1815 Tambora eruption). Given that the length of the nascent North Atlantic rift system is estimated at 2000–3000 km, significant climate cooling could have been readily achieved by a series of small Surtseyan-sized eruptive centres spaced at 50– 250 km along the flooding rift axis (i.e., spaced Surtseyan centre model). However, the widespread distribution of the Balder Formation ashes suggests that individual eruptive centres may have been considerably larger than that of Surtsey, thus increasing the likelihood of more severe climatic cooling having taken place. Nevertheless, whilst these estimates make apparent that phreatomagmatic activity from a number of relatively modest-sized Surtseyean-type eruptions along an opening rift system can easily provide the potential for significant climatic cooling (i.e., DT of 0.5–0.7 8C). Fig. 4 also makes it apparent that the spaced Surtsey centre model is entirely insufficient to explain the DT of 3–5 8C indicated by the intercalated paleobotanical Balder Formation record. To achieve an instantaneous 3 8C cooling would require N2000 simultaneously erupting Surtseyan-type centres, even assuming the most highly efficient case for sulphur\ndelivery to the plume (curve a1). Such a density of centres is volcanologically implausible.\nIn explanation, it should be noted that Eq. (1) is largely derived from numerous, relatively small eruptions that generate only small variations of DT, and much fewer larger eruptions from which the DT is more reliably measurable. Consequently, Blake (2003) argued that little or no climate change can be positively attributed to individual eruptions yielding less than 5–10 Mt of SO2 aerosols (e.g., Surtsey), thus placing a theoretical lower threshold limit to volcanically-induced climate forcing. However, the widespread distribution of the Balder ashes indicates that individual eruptions were considerably larger than those employed in the spaced Surtsey centre model (Peate et al., 2003), and thus increased the likelihood of having caused more serious climate cooling effects. For instance, assuming an average precompaction ash thickness of 0.1–1.0 cm across the entire British Isles and North Sea areas (i.e., consistent with observed Balder Formation distribution Fig. 1) yields an eruptive volume of 10–100 km3, implying eruptions comparable in magnitude to those of Pinatubo (1991) or Krakatau (1887). Therefore, in order to address the deficiency in the spaced Surtsey centre model, it becomes necessary to model the effects of larger eruptions.\nTable 1 explores this relationship between eruption size and estimated decrease in Northern Hemisphere mean annual temperature. Inspection of these data reveal that eruptive volumes of 1–5 103 km3 of mafic tephra (i.e., four magnitudes larger than a 0.3 km3 Surtseyan eruption) are required to achieve DTN3 8C. Table 2 places these modelled values into a volcanological context because mass eruption estimates from historical eruptions of increasing explosivity (VEI) have been used to estimate a comparable range of cooling effects. In order to achieve the range required, data from the c. 75 Ka Toba super-eruption (Oppenheimer, 2002) have also been included. The degree of cooling effect of these historic data is known to vary according to magma composition and eruption style. Therefore, for the purposes of direct comparison with Table 2, the cooling effects (DT) of the individual eruption volumes are calculated assuming a mafic magma composition (i.e. dense mafic magma equivalent; Tables 1 and 2) containing 1500 ppm of sulphur (S) which has been delivered directly into the eruption column (see also spaced Surtsey centre model in Fig. 4). Using these mafic magma parameters clearly results in estimated cooling effects approaching the maximum that can be expected for eruptions of this size, and which are beyond those which have been independently measured from historical proxy data. Nevertheless, comparison of Tables 1 and 2 illustrates the following important points:\nFirst, in order to instantaneously generate a DT of 3–5 8C (i.e., comparable with that of the early Eocene), through the volcanogenic release of sulphur\naerosols into the stratosphere would have required a super-eruption approaching the size of Toba (i.e., VEI 7). Because the Balder Formation and Bighorn Basin data indicate that this cooling event persisted for c. 500 Ka, and given that the long-term climatic effects of such a super-eruption are likely to have diminished over a decadal rather than millennium time scale (Oppenheimer, 2002), the modelled data require a frequently repeated series of such super eruptions to maintain early Eocene cooling. Such a conclusion seems geologically improbable. This problem arises largely because the cooling model ignores the likelihood of other attendant positive feedback mechanisms having operated within the wider Eocene environment as a consequence of ongoing volcanism. Moreover, the case for, as yet unidentified, positive feedback mechanisms having contributed to the climate deterioration are further strengthened by the fact that most of the Balder ashes represent eruptive volumes at least a magnitude smaller those considered characteristic of super-eruptions.\nSecond, it is clear that mafic phreatoplinean eruptions, comparable in size to the those of El Chichon and Krakatau, are capable of forcing cooling of 0.5–1 8C northern hemisphere mean annual temperature, and that such explosivity and eruptive volumes are realistically representative of those which produced the Balder Tuffs. Therefore, if volcanically induced cooling is accepted as a viable causative mechanism for the early Eocene cooling event, then it becomes likely that the repetitive nature and frequency of these eruptions provided the underlying\n990) using mass eruption volumes from historical eruptions (Blake, -eruption\ndriving mechanism for the observed deterioration of northern hemisphere climate."

    "heading": "6. Summary and conclusions",
    "text": "Given that explosive volcanism is a particularly potent climate cooling mechanism, the synchronicity of the widespread eruption of Balder ashes, the opening of the North Atlantic, and the replacement of high-diversity warm temperate floras by lowdiversity temperate forest cannot be purely coincidental. Immense volumes of ash were produced during repeated phreatomagmatic eruptions, many of which emplaced eruption products directly into the stratosphere, and causing significant Northern Hemisphere cooling. This change of eruption style caused plant communities in the Northern Hemisphere to suffer a diversity reduction.\nA number of pollen taxa, particularly those from megathermal plants (Palms, Anacardiaceae, Bombax), and those related to the Cretaceous Normapolles group suffered marked reductions in frequency during this period, some species disappearing within the marked climate cooling of the dBalder eventT. Other previously common taxa were reduced to sporadic occurrences or else disappear altogether. The cooling climate eliminated temperature-sensitive species and any remaining evergreen plants more susceptible to the physical effects of ashfall. These species were then replaced by taxa that already formed part of the regional vegetation. Such a low-diversity forest would have acted as a barrier to rapid recolonization by temperature sensitive species during any inter eruption short-term warming periods. Consequently, the resulting low forest diversity was maintained by repeated eruptions, causing a break in floral community evolution across the region. Reinvasion of different groups of thermophyllic taxa during the ensuing Eocene thermal maximum ensured that this vegetation differed significantly from that of the LPTM some 2 m.y. earlier.\nThe spaced Surtsey centre model indicates that relatively few small Surtseyan-style centres erupting along the length of an opening and foundering rift axis would be sufficient to have affected climate, provided that sulphur was effectively delivered into the stratosphere. It is known that the brief atmospheric\nresidence of aerosols and ashes (i.e., months to years) mitigate volcanic effects in the short term, but larger, more frequent or persistent eruptions can significantly enhance these effects, and create more pronounced, and much longer-term cooling (Robock, 2000). The eruptions that produced the Balder Formation ashes represent both large and frequent volcanic events concentrated within a short span of geological time and, where these eruptions exceeded the critical lower threshold, a longer term climatic deterioration could have been achieved by medium-sized volcanic eruptions (VEI 4–5; 1–100 km3). The frequent repletion of eruptive events within the Balder Formation provides a feasible mechanism by which relatively small increments of volcanically induced climatic cooling (i.e., 0.5–1 8C, Fig. 4) could have accumulated over time. Such a cumulative effect would have exceeded that predicted by the size of individual volcanic events identified in the geological record, and have operated at least over an interdecadal rather than interannual time scale. In this manner, it could have potentially achieved the observed 3 8C in early Eocene mean annual temperature. A cumulative effect of this type has no modern analogue, and the response of the climate system under such circumstances is poorly understood. The feedback mechanisms that cause volcanically induced cooling to persist beyond the interdecadal time scale predicted from aerosol residence remain to be further identified and defined (Bains et al., 2000; Stevenson et al., 2003). Further exploration of this phenomenon is beyond the scope of the current work, although the most encouraging avenue of future investigation is likely to be through the use of appropriate GCMs. Modelling the effects of cumulative volcanic emission using atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) is currently at a preliminary stage, but attempts (e.g., Rampino and Self, 2000) indicate that persistent loading of modest amounts of sulphur over decadal time scales can achieve catastrophic cooling. Clearly, sophisticated GCM modelling of the effects of ancient eruption episodes upon past climates is now urgently required.\nTo conclude, geological and paleobotanical evidence from the northeast Atlantic Balder Formation and north American Bighorn Basin, provide compelling evidence linking a 500 Kyr Northern Hemisphere cooling event with widespread explosive basaltic volcanism during North Atlantic volcanism in the\nearly Eocene. The effect of opening the North Atlantic was a coeval volcanically induced climatic deterioration generating cooler and drier conditions. In the wider context, repeated phreatomagmatic and phreatoplinean volcanism occurring during the late-stage rifting phase of flood basalt episodes represents a potent mechanism for triggering climate change. Although volumetrically small compared with the flood basalts eruptions themselves, this type of latestage explosive volcanism offers a highly efficient method of delivering basaltic sulphur, ash, and other gases into the stratosphere. Numerous previous studies have focused upon the impact of large igneous provinces to global climate change, but have instead concentrated upon the voluminous flood basalt volcanism and its associated S and CO2 emission (e.g., Caldeira and Rampino, 1990; Courtillot et al., 1996). However, whilst flood basalts contain significant quantities of sulphur, and can cause major shortterm climatic perturbation (e.g., Laki), the effusive nature of these eruptions precludes an efficient delivery of sulphur into the stratosphere. The terminal rift phase common to many flood basalt provinces would have resulted in a paroxysm of highly explosive phreatomagmatic activity. This late-stage activity provides an alternative mechanism for affecting climate, not by greenhouse warming, but by injecting a stratospheric blanket of ash and gas."

  "abstractText": "The delivery of volcanogenic sulphur into the upper atmosphere by explosive eruptions is known to cause significant temporary climate cooling. Therefore, phreatomagmatic and phreatoplinian eruptions occurring during the final rifting stages of active flood basalt provinces provide a potent mechanism for triggering climate change. During the early Eocene, the northeast Atlantic margin was subjected to repeated ashfall for 0.5 m.y. This was the result of extensive phreatomagmatic activity along 3000 km of the opening northeast Atlantic rift. These widespread, predominantly basaltic ashes are now preserved in marine sediments of the Balder Formation and its equivalents, and occur over an area extending from the Faroe Islands to Denmark and southern England. These ash-bearing sediments also contain pollen and spore floras derived from low diversity forests that grew in cooler, drier climates than were experienced either before or after these highly explosive eruptions. In addition, coeval plant macrofossil evidence from the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, USA, also shows a comparable pattern of vegetation change. The coincidence of the ashes and cooler climate pollen and spore floras in northwest Europe identifies volcanism as the primary cause of climate cooling. Estimates show that whilst relatively few phreatomagmatic eruptive centres along the 3000 km opening rift system could readily generate 0.5–1 8C cooling, on an annual basis, only persistent or repeated volcanic phases would have been able to achieve the long-term cooling effect observed in the floral record. We propose that the cumulative effect of repeated Balder Formation eruptions initiated a biodiversity crisis in the northeast Atlantic margin forests. Only the decline of this persistent volcanic activity, and the subsequent climatic warming at the start of the Eocene Thermal Maximum allowed the growth of subtropical forests to develop across the region.
