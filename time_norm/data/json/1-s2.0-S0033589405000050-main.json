The most complete sequences comprise either stacked sediments within basins, where the lack of exposure and accessibility limits their use, or river terrace staircases where each level is preserved as a result of uplift. Often, however, these records are incomplete, a consequence of poor preservation due to subsequent erosion. The bestknown river terrace sequences are from the Middle–Late Pleistocene (the last ~0.8 myr) where climate-driven sediment supply changes have punctuated the long-term adjustment to uplift, resulting in sedimentation–incision cycles\n0033-5894/$ - see front matter D 2005 University of Washington.

Maddy).\ncorresponding to the low-frequency, high-amplitude 100,000 yr eccentricity-driven climate cycle (Bridgland, 2000; Bridgland and Maddy, 2002). Prior to the Middle Pleistocene, climate change was dominated by the higherfrequency, lower-amplitude ~41,000-year obliquity (changes in the tilt of the earth’s axis) cycle (Mudelsee and Statteger, 1997; Ruddiman et al., 1989). The recording of the high-frequency change is so far unproven in river terrace records, although it has sometimes been inferred from onlapping fluvial sequences (van den Berg and van Hoof, 2001). The registration of the higher-frequency signal requires uplift rates sufficiently high to clearly separate terrace levels, but low enough to allow the creation of a terrace record (Veldkamp, 1992; Veldkamp and van Dijke, 2000). There are few places globally where these conditions can be met. In this paper, we report the discovery of a wellpreserved buried river terrace sequence of the Early Pleistocene Gediz River in Western Turkey. The high\nrved.\nnumber of terrace levels, constrained by the available geochronology, strongly suggests a response to climatecontrolled sedimentation–incision cycles that correspond to the ~41,000-year obliquity cycle.\nWe first describe the terrace staircase, its composition, origin and preservation. The terrace sequence is then placed within a geochronological framework using the available age estimates. Finally, we compare this time-constrained sequence against global climate-proxy records for the same time period.\nTerraces of the palaeo-Gediz River\nThe geomorphology of Western Turkey is controlled by large-scale extensional tectonics. Crustal extension is accommodated along a series of east–west striking normal faults, which define low-lying grabens separated by footwall mountain ranges (Fig. 1) (Aksu et al., 1987; Paton, 1992). The Gediz River drains westward through a footwall block entering the AlaYehir graben, one of principal grabens in Western Turkey (Eyidoğan and Jackson, 1985), along which it subsequently flows to the Aegean Sea (Fig. 1). The northern bounding faults of the AlaYehir graben act as a local base level control, tying the evolution of the upstream reaches of the Gediz River closely to the slip on these faults. Uplift of the footwall block results from a combination of normal faulting and regional uplift (Westaway, 1993). The Gediz River responds to the uplift via adjustments in stream longitudinal profile: initial incision occurs at the fault zone where the Gediz enters the graben, and is subsequently\ntransmitted upstream via knickpoint recession until a new longitudinal profile is attained, graded to the new base-level. Repeated movement of the fault system, superimposed on a background of regional uplift has therefore resulted in progressive incision of the upstream valley.\nThe AlaYehir graben has developed over the past ~5 myr, the oldest sediments being attributed to the Pliocene (Bozkurt and Sözbilir, 2004). However, displacement of Late Pliocene deposits along the main faults suggests that the most significant horst uplift occurred during the past ~1.6 myr (Bozkurt and Sözbilir, 2004; Sarica, 2000). The fluvial sedimentary archive described in this paper is located ~40 km upstream of the AlaYehir graben in the Kula volcanic province (Fig. 1) and comprises a flight of river terraces (incised former floodplains and river channels) of the palaeo-Gediz, each abandoned during successive phases of incision. The volcanic activity around Kula, which began ~1.7 myr ago (Richardson-Bunbury, 1996), produces alkali basalts closely associated with the active rifting (Ercan, 1993; Ercan et al., 1983).\nThe palaeo-Gediz deposits described below are preserved beneath the high-level Burgaz and SarnVç plateaux (Fig. 2), both of which are capped by some of the oldest basaltic lavas in the Kula volcanic province. These flows emanate from three necks and flowed directly across the palaeoGediz valley floor and into the contemporary river, smothering the pre-basalt landscape and fossilising its terraced deposits (Fig. 2). Sediments of the palaeo-Gediz can be observed in continuous sections around the Burgaz plateau, while more restricted outcrops are present around the SarnVç plateau (Fig. 2). Characteristically they comprise\n1987). Black box indicates approximate position of study area. Open circles et shows position of Figure 1 in Turkey.\ngravels, up to 3 m in thickness, composed of lithologies derived from the underlying Miocene clastic sediments of the Ínay Group and underlying metamorphic basement (Seyitoğlu, 1997). The palaeo-Gediz sediments thus represent a phase of fluvial activity that post-dates the Ínay Group and may in part correlate with the previously identified Asartepe Formation (Seyitoğlu, 1997).\nThe palaeo-Gediz sediments can be readily distinguished from their Ínay source material. The Ínay fluvial sequence is predominantly grey/white, while the palaeo-Gediz sediments have a reddish colouration. The sedimentary structures of the palaeo-Gediz gravels are smaller, the beds thinner and less laterally persistent and the gravels considerably more rounded than those of the Ínay Group. Imbrication is well developed in the palaeo-Gediz gravels and shows flow in a down-valley direction (Fig. 2), the Ínay gravels, in contrast, typically exhibit a northward flow direction (Purvis and Robertson, 2004). Compositionally, the palaeo-Gediz sediments contain higher proportions of more resistant quartzose lithologies and, importantly, in the highest levels contain limestone clasts derived from the continental carbonate sequence that forms the upper part of the Ínay Group (Seyitoğlu, 1997).\nThe palaeo-Gediz gravels are, in many places, overlain by limestone-rich gravels and carbonate-rich fines that\nrepresent the deposits of fluvial fans emanating (based upon imbrication measurements) from the north. The presence of fan material is a key factor in the initial preservation of this remarkable terrace flight. Progressive southward migration of the palaeo-Gediz during the period of terrace formation allowed the earlier, higher, terrace levels to be preserved. This migration is the probable result of incision into the largely fine-grained and unconsolidated fluvial sediments of the Ínay Group to the south in preference to the terrace sediments protected by the fluvial fan to the north. Each time the river migrated southwards, the tributary-fed fluvial fans prograded over the abandoned floodplain to achieve confluence with the palaeo-Gediz. During the next downcutting interval, the palaeo-Gediz would have once again readily favoured the easier southern route. Progradation of the fans is supported by the substantial thickness (N14 m) of fan sediment on top of the highest level, with variable, but thinner, deposits to the south.\nUsing electronic surveying equipment the height of the palaeo-Gediz basal gravel contact with the Ínay Group was accurately measured (errors b10 cm) relative to a reference point on the present river (Fig. 2). The obtained data support field observations of distinct bodies of gravel (palaeo-Gediz sediment) lying at varying altitudes above the river, separated by bluffs. The various gravels form steps that\ndrop in altitude towards the present river (southwards). In total, eleven separate levels can be identified (Table 1), the lowest representing the valley floor contemporary with the lavas that cap the sequence. The upper surfaces of the palaeo-Gediz gravels, above this lowest level, are therefore interpreted as representing a sequence of buried river terrace surfaces (Fig. 3A). These are, in most cases, initially buried by fluvial fan sediment (Fig. 3B), with only the final burial and fossilisation of the sequence achieved by the blanketing of lava (Fig. 3A). Terrace bluffs at the back and front of each terrace are marked not only by the change in height of the Ínay Group/palaeo-Gediz contact but also by a consequent thickening of alluvial fan sediments at the back edge and a thickening of the basalts towards the front edge of each terrace (Fig. 3B).\nEleven terrace levels can be identified beneath the Burgaz plateau (Figs. 2 and 3A), but more limited outcrop has so far restricted the identification of all of these levels beneath the SarnVç plateau. The consistency of terrace base heights between the plateaux allows correlation of the identified levels suggesting that the sequence was deposited by a low-gradient river system. The accurate identification of terrace gradients is hampered by lateral variation in base heights within each terrace step, which is of the order of ~2– 3 m locally reflecting the nature of the channelised base, and also by the unknown channel distance between locations (i.e., the degree of channel sinuosity). However, a gradient of ~0.47 m km 1 on the base heights for the lowest (youngest) buried valley may give some indication of adjusted gradient. The consistency of terrace step values on each plateau may suggest little change in the gradients between each step. This inferred consistency of gradient"

    "text": "leads to the conclusion that these terraces can be considered to be subparallel and signify quasi-equilibrium longitudinal profiles adjusted to the regional uplift.\nGeochronology of the terrace sequence\nAge constraints on the sequence relate to the onset of uplift, the earliest volcanism in the Kula area and the direct dating of the capping basalt sequence. It has been argued that the AlaYehir graben is a young structure (Koçyiğit et al., 1999; Sarica, 2000). Offset Late Pliocene–Early Pleistocene deposits attributed to the period 2.0–1.4 myr ago suggest significant development of the graben during the latter half of this interval. Incision of the palaeo-Gediz in the Kula area would, however, have lagged uplift along the graben margin due to the delay in knickpoint recession. Initial incision in the Kula area would have been through the continental carbonate sequence capping the Ínay Group. The resistance of these strata, evidenced by the rivers that still drain these lithologies to the north of the studied area, would have restricted the valley width of the palaeo-Gediz thus not favouring the preservation of a terrace sequence. Once the river incised into the underlying fluvial sediments of the Ínay Group, substantial valley widening would have occurred, providing the potential for the preservation of a terrace sequence. The highest palaeo-Gediz terrace sediments identified during the present study (location 47, Fig. 2) overlie the fluvial sediments of the Ínay Group and contain a relatively large proportion (N15%) of limestone. As limestone is unlikely to survive long distant transport in a gravel-bed river, this may indicate that a limestone source\nlay close by. Therefore, the highest identified terrace may have been the first terrace preserved once the palaeo-Gediz had widened its valley floor in response to gaining access to the lower, more erodible, substrate.\nThe earliest recorded volcanism in the Kula volcanic province is from Akçakfy Tepe (Gfkyar Tepe) ~30 km\nwest of the current study area. A series of K/Ar ages estimate on individual amphibole crystals yielded a mean age of 1.67 F 0.22 myr (Richardson-Bunbury, 1996). This volcanism was perhaps triggered by (accelerated) rifting, in which case this age estimate gives a minimum date for the onset of uplift. An increasing uplift rate would have helped\npromote the incision of the palaeo-Gediz into the limestone cap. Although this age estimate is imprecise, the mean age is in agreement with that derived from the biostratigraphy (Sarica, 2000), we therefore accept this age estimate as the best available constraint for the oldest possible date for the highest terrace.\nThe age of the burial of the terrace system is constrained by a Ar/Ar age estimate of 1.245 F 0.13 myr from the Bağtepe neck on the Burgaz plateau (Figs. 2 and 3A) (Richardson-Bunbury, 1996). Unspiked K/Ar dating of lavas on the SarnVç plateau has yielded a mean age of 1.264 F 0.015 myr (Westaway et al., 2003). These age estimates confirm that all three necks in the studied area were active during the same phase of volcanism, a conclusion supported by the geological data, as the lavas from all three necks flow down onto the same river valley level at ~140 m above the reference point. Thus, we can accept that the youngest date for the severe disruption of the fluvial system and the burial of the preserved terrace system is ~1.245 myr. The available geochronology therefore suggests that this terrace flight spans the interval between ~1.67 F 0.22 myr and ~1.245 F 0.13 myr.\nControls on terrace development: Uplift and climate change\nThe outstanding question regarding this terrace archive is how to explain the terrace frequency and the regular step interval of the terrace bases. The observed pattern strongly suggests a cyclic control to the sedimentation– incision sequence. The chronology presented above would place these sediments in the Early Pleistocene, a period of known cyclic climate change. If we assume a linear age relationship between height and age, and an age model based upon the mean age estimates, that is, a 1.67-myr start and a 1.245-myr end to the sequence, we can assign age estimates to the intermediate terrace bases (Table 1). Plotting this relationship against the proxy climate record of y18O values from ODP677 (Shackleton et al., 1990) for the same time period reveals an intriguing correspondence (Fig. 3C). The high frequency of terrace formation appears to match the ~41,000-year obliquitydriven climate cycle reflected in the marine oxygen isotope stages (MIS), with incision to a lower level occurring at the end of MIS cold stages. This link is logical. Precipitation in the upland areas, such as the upper reaches of the Gediz, during cold stages would have been predominantly in the form of snow. Snow-pack accumulation and release would lead to enhanced flows during the melt season. The lack of bank- and slopestabilising vegetation at this time would however promote sediment availability, leading to relatively high levels of sediment transport and deposition. Increased sediment flux to the Gediz delta during Middle–Late Pleistocene cold stages underlines this dynamic link (Aksu et al., 1987).\nDuring warm stages discharge is more regulated and sediment supply is reduced due to bank and slope stabilisation by vegetation. Under these conditions, the river will concentrate its available energies on erosion of the bed. However, as with rivers elsewhere, it is likely that the major adjustments in river regime are associated with climatic transitions. Accommodation of regional uplift via incision would, under these conditions, best be promoted when sediment supplies are declining. Such conditions are most likely to occur on the warming limb at the end of a cold stage. This role of vegetation and discharge regime in controlling sediment supply and transport is reflected in river activity across the Mediterranean during the Late Pleistocene (Macklin et al., 1985, 2002).\nConfirmation of this relationship is however hampered by the uncertainties in the age estimates. These uncertainties sum to 0.425 F 0.35 myr (1j error), a value greater than the\ninferred cyclicity. The link to the obliquity cycle is however, perhaps, further indicated when this sequence is compared to the more local y18O signal from ODP967 (Fig. 4A). The ODP967 record is known to demonstrate a strong link between Eastern Mediterranean climates and the obliquity cycle during the period 1.0–1.9 myr (Kroon et al., 1998).\nAlthough the uncertainties associated with the age estimates would allow for a mismatch between these two signals, the most plausible interpretation is that these records do reflect the same driving force. If we assume that the link between terrace formation and the obliquity cycle is likely, we can refine the terrace chronology by matching terrace base levels to the y18O minima from ODP967 (Table 1). Based on the assumption that each terrace represents a quasi-equilibrium profile adjusted to the regional uplift, we can calculate a time-averaged incision rate and thus infer a timeaveraged uplift rate based upon the revised chronology (Maddy, 1997). Using this methodology, we estimate the time-averaged incision rate to be ~0.16 mm yr 1 (Fig. 4B) and thus we expect the time-averaged uplift rate to be close to this figure.\nConclusions\nThe fortuitous combination of relatively high uplift rates, progressive southward migration of the palaeo-valley floor and subsequent preservation by overlying fan sediments and resistant lava flows has produced an unparalleled record of Early Pleistocene river terraces. No sequence of comparable completeness has yet been reported either from the Mediterranean basin or elsewhere. The inferred close association of the timing of terracing events with the ~41,000-year obliquity-driven climate cycle suggests that rivers can respond to this higher-frequency cycle and that climate control of river systems in the Middle–Late Pleistocene in response to the 100,000-year cycle (Bridgland, 2000; Bridgland and Maddy, 2002) is a continuation of this coupling.\nThis archive now presents a unique opportunity to study this time period in the Eastern Mediterranean. The extensive outcrops can now be examined for biostratigraphical changes and other climate-proxy data. The potential for preservation of an archaeological record within this archive is high and therefore further investigation of this archive could prove to be highly significant to the study of hominid evolution and migration."
