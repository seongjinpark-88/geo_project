Noachian and Hesperian Periods\nKenneth L. Tanaka\nU.S. Geological Survey, 2255 North Gemini Drive, Flagstaff, Arizona 86001 E-mail: ktanaka@usgs.gov\nand\nEric J. Kolb\nDepartment of Geology, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287\nReceived December 12, 2000; revised April 26, 2001\nDuring the Noachian Period, the south polar region of Mars underwent intense cratering, construction of three groups of volcanoes, widespread contractional deformation, resurfacing of low areas, and local dissection of valley networks; no evidence for polar deposits, ice sheets, or glaciation is recognized. South polar Hesperian geology is broadly characterized by waning impacts, volcanism, and tectonism. Emplacement of the polar Dorsa Argentea Formation (DAF) occurred during the Hesperian Period. Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter topographic data and Mars Orbiter Camera images elucidate stratigraphic, morphologic, and topographic relations, permitting the dividing of the DAF into eight members, which surround and underlie about half of the Amazonian south polar layered deposits. The lobate fronts and lack of typical volcanic-flow morphology of the six plains units indicate that they may be made up of debris flows. We think that these flows, tens of meters to 200 m thick, may have originated by the discharge of huge volumes of slurry fluidized by ground water or liquid CO2, perhaps triggered by local impacts, igneous activity, or basal melting beneath polar deposits. The cavi and rugged members include irregular depressions that penetrate the subsurface; some of the pits have raised rims. The depressions may have formed by collapse due to expulsion of subsurface material in which local explosive activity built up the raised rims. Further, smaller eruptions of volatile-rich material may have resulted in narrow, sinuous channel deposits within aggrading fine-grained unconsolidated material perhaps produced by gaseous discharge of subsurface volatiles; preferential erosion of the latter material could have produced the Dorsa Argentea-type sinuous ridges associated mainly with the DAF. Alternatively, the ridges may be eskers, but the lack of associated glacial and fluvial morphologies casts doubt on this interpretation.\nThe knobby, degraded materials forming Scandia Colles may represent the only Noachian geologic record exposed in the north polar region. Most of the north polar region was buried by water- or debrisocean sediments during the Hesperian Period, originating from up-\nlands areas and perhaps knobby terrains in the northern plains. The sediments either mantle or were deformed by wrinkle ridges radial and concentric to Utopia basin and concentric to northern Tharsis. Sources of stress probably included sediment loading in the northern plains and regional magmatic and loading activity at Tharsis. Polar layered deposits began piling up during the Early Amazonian or later. c© 2001 Elsevier Science\nKey Words: Mars, surface; Mars, climate; Mars, ices.\n1. INTRODUCTION\n3\nA striking similarity between Mars and Earth is the presence of thick polar ice deposits. Terrestrial ice caps provide a wealth of data regarding recent climate and atmospheric history, and so investigation of the martian polar deposits is hoped to reveal similar insights for the Red Planet. Moreover, possible martian south polar deposits of sorts making up the Dorsa Argentea Formation (DAF) date back into the Hesperian Period, perhaps some three billion years ago (Sharp 1973, Condit and Soberblom 1978, Tanaka and Scott 1987, Plaut et al. 1988, Thomas et al. 1992). However, during the earliest period of martian geologic history—the Noachian Period—a clear record of polar-type deposition has not been recognized either in the present polar regions or elsewhere on the planet (Tanaka 2000) although basal melting of a Noachian south polar ice cap apparently has been invoked to explain the putative water filling of Argyre basin (Parker et al. 2000).\nExciting new insights into the polar geology of Mars are being provided by new data from the Mars Global Surveyor. In particular, altimetry data provided by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) are revealing more precisely the topography of the surface and thus the geometric characteristics of and relations\n0019-1035/01 $35.00 c© 2001 Elsevier Science\nAll rights reserved.\nN 4 TANAKA A\namong polar materials and landforms. In this paper, we show shaded-relief images of the south polar region derived from a MOLA digital elevation model (DEM) that accentuates the surface morphology. Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) narrow-angle images also have been examined to observe at meter-scale resolution the geomorphology and albedo character of the surface, whereas MOC wide-angle images are augmenting the Viking image collection at lower resolutions necessary for regional geologic mapping.\nWe incorporate these data into new geologic mapping and associated studies of the polar terrains on Mars (>lat ±60◦) with particular emphasis on the geologic record before Amazonian buildup of layered deposits currently dominating both poles. We also have compiled the first complete set of crater-density data for units previously mapped by Tanaka and Scott (1987) by merging the spatial distribution of the map units with that of craters larger than 5 km in diameter using the database of Barlow (1988) (Tables I and II). Our companion paper (Kolb and Tanaka 2001) follows from here and focuses more on the character and modification of the polar layered deposits and their similarities and differences between poles. Here we address the following questions: What geologic activity affected the polar regions during the Noachian and Hesperian Periods? What is the extent, character, and origin of the Hesperian south polar lobate plains, cavi terrain, and sinuous ridges of the Dorsa Argentea Formation?"

    "text": "Tanaka (2000) reviewed the distribution, morphology, and ages of layered sequences on Mars and the early development of Tharsis and concluded that “extensive polar wandering is unlikely following the Middle Noachian.” Assuming then that the present pole positions approximate their Noachian positions, we can comment on polar geology activity for this period. In the north polar region, the Noachian rock record has been erased, except perhaps for Noachian/Hesperian material forming degraded knobs and mesas of Scandia Colles (Figs. 1a, 2a). Moderate gravity and magnetic anomalies (Acuna et al. 1999, Zuber et al. 2000) indicate possible heterogeneities in buried rocks, but they are not correlative with topography or exposed rock units.\nIn contrast, the south polar highland terrain shows an extensive, diverse Noachian record (Fig. 1b). Most of the region is underlain by densely cratered materials likely including a diverse mixture of impact breccia and melt, volcanic rocks, and eolian and other sediment (units with “N” in their symbols in Fig. 1b; Tanaka and Scott (1987)). Impact, tectonic, and volcanic structures from much of the local to regional Noachian topography, including mountain ranges, ridge systems, and plains. The degraded, irregular southern rims of the Hellas and Argyre basins extend slightly into the south polar region (units Nh1 and Nplh), where they seem to have imposed local 1- to 2-km topographic highs marred by craters. Crustal uplift and piling of ejecta may account for the highs. Also, pronounced scarps and ridges form-\nD KOLB\ning a broad swath south of Hellas (Chalcoporous Rupes, Pityusa Rupes, Dorsa Brevia, Thyles Rupes, and Eridania Scopulus in Fig. 2b) may be contraction structures that reactivated Hellasrelated impact structures (Tanaka and Leonard 1995). The Hellas and Argyre impacts may be responsible for elevating crustal temperatures above the Curie point up to 2000 km from their rims, thereby erasing any previous magnetic remanence (Acuna et al. 1999).\nThe MOLA colored shaded-relief image (Fig. 2b) helps identify large, mainly Noachian and Early Hesperian volcanic structures. We divide these up into three sets by location and morphology. First, four paterae occur amidst ridged and grooved plains of Malea Planum on the south rim of the Hellas basin (units Hr, Hap, and Had). Amphitrites Patera forms a broad shield >300 km wide and about 2 km high with a shallow central depression less than 100 km across. Peneus Patera is a somewhat smaller shield with a slightly larger central depression. Malea and Pityusa Paterae, each >200 km across, occur within ridged plains and include patches of younger smooth and hilly material. The larger of these depressions previously had been interpreted to be a volcanic center (Tanaka and Scott 1987); we think that both may be cauldrons that served as vents for Malea Planum lava flows of Late Noachian to Early Hesperian age (Tanaka and Leonard 1995).\nApparent constructional volcanic edifices each 70 to 80 km across occur along the contractional ridges of Thyles Rupes (units HNv and HNm). From Viking images, these features were identified as a volcano and some sort of mountain structure (Tanaka and Scott 1987). Closer inspection of the MOLA DEM indicates that both are likely to be volcanoes (Molinero et al. 2000). Although they appear superposed on densely cratered terrain, they also are marked by some large impact craters, indicating that they may also be Noachian. The third set of possible volcanic structures (unit HNm) forms the 15 domes of Sisyphi Montes 20–90 km in width and rising prominently above surrounding plains material, which embays their bases. These features occur in a 1000-km-long, north-trending swath oriented roughly concentric to the Hellas basin, suggesting potential structural control related to the impact. These features have been interpreted to be subglacial volcanoes (J. W. Head, personal communication 2000); however, they are much larger than those in Iceland and would require a thick, extensive ice sheet when formed (during the Noachian to Early Hesperian). Alternatively, they may be composed of more viscous lavas as caused by silicic or volatile-poor compositions, lower eruption temperature, vesiculation, or high phenocryst content.\nEvidence for resurfacing of Noachian south polar landforms is similar to that of equatorial highland areas of Mars where crater rims in particular appear highly degraded. The leading cause(s) for Noachian resurfacing remain uncertain and may include fluvial erosion (Craddock and Maxwell 1993), eolian erosion, eolian and volcanic mantling (Plaut et al. 1988, Tanaka 2000), and impact comminution (e.g., Arvidson et al. 1989). Fluvial erosion may have been enhanced by higher heat flow and a\nPOLAR REGIONS OF MARS: NOACHIAN AND HESPERIAN PERIODS 5\nFIG. 1.

Our examination of Viking images and the MOLA DEM generally supports the more conservative mapping of channel systems surrounding the Argyre basin by Tanaka and Scott (1987). Only one modest channel system (Doanus Valles/Oceanidum Fossa; Fig. 2b) of those proposed extends to the margin of the Hesperian\n6 TANAKA AND KOLB\no FIG. 1—C\npolar deposits and thus potentially drained south polar melt water into the Argyre basin, perhaps during the Hesperian Period. The remaining potential drainage courses do not display channels cutting through Middle to Late Noachian rocks. Thus any surface drainage through the valley systems must have been Early to Middle Noachian. Alternatively, subsurface drainage may have occurred along the proposed courses, such as is apparent between Uzboi and Ares Valles north of the Argyre basin where collapse features indicate such activity (Parker et al. 2000).\nntinued\nIn addition to the lack of channels, we do not observe any other obvious Noachian landforms in the south polar terrain indicative of the presence of a polar ice cap; however, we cannot preclude such evidence if it is buried under the DAF or the south polar layered deposits (SPLD). We therefore conclude that a Noachian ice cap either did not occur, was relatively small compared to Planum Australe, or was removed with no readily apparent traces.\nA major erosional event planed the southwest rim of the Hellas basin to form Malea Planum, an area of ∼500,000 km2. MOLA\nPOLAR REGIONS OF MARS: NOAC\ntopography indicates that this part of the rim is generally 1 to 2 km lower on average than other parts of the rim, even though it has been partly built up by volcanic rocks of Amphitrites and Peneus Paterae. We suggest that an early stage of intrusive activity at these sites may have provided the thermal energy to initiate what may have been a catastrophic erosional event. Sill intrusion into friable basin-rim materials may have melted interstitial ices, resulting in large-scale fluidization and density flows into the Hellas basin, especially if CO2 was involved (Tanaka et al. 2001a). The northeastern rim of the Hellas basin is also topographically lower where covered by Hesperia Planum, which includes Tyrrhena and Hadriaca Paterae and the large outflow channels Dao, Harmakhis, Niger and Reull Valles. Thus large shallow intrusions in volcanic regions within the rims of large impact basins may have been effective at initiating extensive and pervasive erosion of the upper kilometer or two of rim material that may have been made up primarily of impact-comminuted fines (MacKinnon and Tanaka 1989).\nAustrale Montes make up the southernmost mountain ranges on Mars. They are moderately cratered and include broad, rounded ridges and large terraces that may have formed by structural deformation or differential erosion of layered strata. At least one mountain is capped by layered deposits similar in appearance to the SPLD (or unit Apl in Fig. 1b) but also tectonically deformed. Gullies filled with slope debris dissect Australe Montes and locally bury terraces and patches of SPLD. Australe Montes (unit Nplh) thus may include primarily Noachian rocks and some Hesperian and Amazonian strata and mass-wasting deposits. West of Australe Montes and south of Sisyphi Cavi, the rugged member of the DAF (unit Hdr) may include some outcrops of degraded Noachian highland materials that are difficult to recognize. reflect sedimentation resulting from discharges largely from the outflow channels that enter the Chryse basin; controversy exists\nTABLE I Cumulative Densities of Cratersa for Geologic Units in the North Polar Region of Marsb\nUnit symbol Unit name Area (103 km2) N(5) N(16) Relative age\nApi Polar ice deposits 856 — — LA Adc Crescentic dune material 458 — — LA Adl Linear dune material 230 — — LA Apl Polar layered deposits 403 — — LA Am Mantle material 1891 57 ± 5 8 ± 2 EA–LA Aa1 Member 1 of the Arcadia Fm 485 61 ± 11 8 ± 4 EA Hvm Mottled member of the Vastitas Borealis Fm 365 125 ± 40 38 ± 22 LH Hvg Grooved member of the Vastitas Borealis FM 76 26 ± 19 — LH Hvr Ridged member of the Vastitas Borealis Fm 677 78 ± 55 — LH Hvk Knobby member of the Vastitas Borealis Fm 4416 67 ± 4 8 ± 1 LH Hal Lower member of the Alba Patera Fm 67 104 ± 39 30 ± 21 EH–LH HNu Undivided material 136 107 ± 28 7 ± 7 N–LH cs Superposed crater material 382 — — LH–LA cb Partly buried crater material 2 — — N–LH d Dome material 8 — — H–A\na Number >5 or 16 km in diameter per 106 km2. b Based on the geologic map shown in Fig. 1b and the crater data of Barlow (1988 Noachian, H = Hesperian, A = Amazonian, E = Early, M = Middle, L = Late; base\nHIAN AND HESPERIAN PERIODS 7"

The earliest of these coincided with the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian erosion of higher regions within the northern lowlands and Noachian terrains along the highland/lowland boundary, including expanses of what are now knobby terrains such as Scandia Colles and other outcrops within Arcadia Planitia east of Elysium Mons as well as the fretted channels and terrains along northern Arabia Terra (Tanaka 1986, 1997; Tanaka et al. 1992; McGill 2000). This erosional period produced plains materials, commonly marked by knobs and wrinkle ridges detectable in Viking images, that remain exposed along parts of the outer margin of the northern plains. These materials occur south of the map area and possibly extend beneath younger plains deposits across much of the north polar region.\nThe Alba Patera volcanic shield (unit Hal) extends into Vastitas Borealis and up against the southern margin of Scandia Colles. Grabens of Alba and Tantalus Fossae radiate across the shield. The outer margins of the shield appear ringed by concentric wrinkle ridges evident in MOLA data but obscure in Viking images.

In addition to highland sources, Tanaka et al. (2001b) proposed that the Vastitas Borealis Formation includes material eroded from knobby terrains within the northern plains, such as in Arcadia Planitia north and east of Elysium Mons. We also find southeast of Olympia Planitia a region of irregular groups of mounds and depressions that may be degraded material and collapse features that provided some of the source material of the plains deposits. Of uncertain age and origin are buried deposits in Olympia Planitia adjacent to Planum Boreum (Fishbaugh and Head 2000) and remnants of a sloping plateau largely underlying the north polar layered deposits, which could be older polar deposits that were eroded during outflow channel activity (Tanaka 1997) or perhaps during cycles of high obliquity (see Kolb and Tanaka 2001).\nIn the map region (Fig. 1a), the Arcadia Formation forms a distal extremity of the Alba Patera shield.

The ridges form a radial pattern within the Utopia basin and a concentric pattern on the basin shoulder. Outside the Utopia basin, the ridges generally align with the northern margin of the Utopia basin and Alba Patera, roughly parallel with the 0◦–180◦ meridians. The pattern of ridges associated with Utopia basin may align with preexisting structures formed by the Utopia impact. The stresses that produced the ridges may be the result of Tharsis volcanotectonic activity and global contraction, generally thought to be active mainly in the Late Noachian and Early Hesperian Epochs (e.g., Tanaka et al. 1991). The northern plains ridges likely developed during this period and were then mantled by the Vastitas Borealis Formation (Head et al. 2001); some further deformation may have ensued."

In addition, we consider here the rugged and knobby material in the area between Argentea and Sisyphi Plana as a separate, rugged member of the DAF (unit Hdr; Fig. 5), gradational with adjacent outcrops of plains members of the DAF. Crater counts indicate a middle Hesperian age for these units (Tanaka 1986, Plaut et al. 1988, Table II). Because of their lobate fronts, these DAF units were previously interpreted as lava flows (Tanaka and Scott 1987) or sheets of mud (Jöns 1991). Elsewhere, the margins of the units were not clearly observed and massive eolian blankets were thus considered to be a possible alternative (Tanaka and Scott 1987). Sinuous ridges superposed on the upper parts of these flow deposits (e.g., Fig. 3) have been interpreted as eskers (Howard 1981, Kargel and Strom 1992, Head 2000b–d), inverted and raised fluvial channels (Rice and Mollard 1994), unusual volcanic features (Tanaka and Scott 1987), linear dunes (Ruff 1994), and a few other variations of such processes (see Metzger 1995, 2001).\nFinally, we map the dome-shaped terrain pocked by Cavi Angusti as the cavi member of the DAF (unit ANdc), previously mapped as Noachian and Hesperian undivided material by Tanaka and Scott (1987).

Thus\nfar, we have not found clear evidence for volcanic, fluvial, or glacial sources for this outcrop.\nViking and MOC images of Parva Planum are generally of low resolution, and clouds obscure surface features. MOLA data show that the Parva member of the DAF (unit Hdv) has a broadly undulating surface marked locally by sinuous ridges (Fig. 4), some of which appear to extend into the cavi member of the DAF (unit ANdc). Western Parva Planum includes a few superposed craters resting on pedestals up to 400 to 500 m thick, as well\nPOLAR REGIONS OF MARS: NOACHIAN AND HESPERIAN PERIODS 13\nParva Planum.

The ridges are densest in the southern part of the planum (Fig. 5). The longer, straighter ridges are generally oriented along the gradient. Many of the DAF ridge systems appear to originate in the vicinity of Australe Montes (Fig. 6) and from southeastern Cavi Angusti where the relative age between units ANdc and Hdd is unclear (Fig. 9). East of Schmidt crater, the dorsa member contacts the Argentea member (unit Hda) in a low area; however, a clear geomorphic contact has not been detected (Fig. 3).\nThe Sisyphi member of the DAF (unit Hds) forms broad Sisyphi Planum, gently sloping to the north and east (Fig. 6). Moderately high, rugged terrain separates Argentea and Sisyphi Plana. The distinct distal flow margins of unit Hds embay Sisyphi Montes and other high terrain, whereas southwestern Sisyphi Planum is deeply pitted by Sisyphi Cavi.

A couple small cavi-like depressions a few kilometers across in the unit reach more than 200 m in depth. The unit’s surface topography indicates that it may have originated in the Australe Montes area and perhaps beneath the layered deposits (unit Apl) of Planum Australe.

Likely, the tall scarp of Promethei Rupes that extends into Planum Australe (Fig. 8) prevented the unit from being emplaced beneath the Ultimi lobe.\nThe rugged member of DAF (unit Hdr) surrounds parts of Australe Montes at the east end of Dorsa Argentea (Figs. 5 and 6). This unit forms a mixed topography of irregular hills, ridges, depressions, and smooth plains at length scales of kilometers to tens of kilometers. Many of the depression floors extend tens of meters to a few hundred meters below adjacent plains. The depressions commonly have rims tens of meters high (Fig. 5). Some of these rimmed craters occur at the summits of low shields; the most prominent of these has radiating elongate depressions (Fig. 6) and was mapped previously as a possible volcano (Tanaka and Scott 1987).\nThe cavi member of DAF (unit ANdc) forms Angusti Planum and adjacent plateaus pitted by Cavi Angusti and locally rises more than 1500 m above the surrounding plains (Table V). The cavi form irregular depressions hundreds of meters to more than a kilometer deep, thus cutting through the plateau material into\npossibly underlying units of DAF and other older material. Locally, they form dense groups of individual pits a few kilometers across, but in the central part of Cavi Angusti they extend for many tens of kilometers. In some places, terraces and ridges along the cavi walls attest to slumping. Intervening broad ridges have sinuous forms, and a few are capped by narrow sinuous ridges both aligned with and locally perpendicular to the broad ridges; narrow ridges forming Inca City follow a curvilinear, reticulate pattern (Fig. 9). Some narrow ridges also occur on cavi floors and on Planum Angustum; the latter extend from cavi adjacent to Planum Australe northwestward onto Parva Planum. The cavi member locally buries the dorsa member of the DAF (unit Hdd) but elsewhere its age relative to units Hdv and Hdd is uncertain. In turn, the SPLD buries the southern part of this unit. The unit likely includes Noachian material exposed in the cavi. MOC images show thick layers and incised gullies (Malin and Edgett 2000) within the upper part of the unit, which may be Hesperian to Early Amazonian in age, depending upon how many craters may have been eroded away within the rugged cavi terrain (see Table II)."

Although Kargel and Strom (1992) indicated that glacial scour landforms including lineations and pits are present, we observe that the pits are not widespread but only occur in terrains surrounding the eastern parts of the ridges, and\nDebris flows\nN 18 TANAKA A\nFor a stagnant ice sheet (Head 2000a–d), the lack of glacial landforms is less of a problem, but other issues arise regarding how eskers in that setting have been preserved and how the associated rimmed pits were formed. Preservation of the sinuous ridges suggests their relative resistance to erosion may be attributed to either a protective cover of larger clasts or cementation. Deposition of coarser material by fluvial flow due to rapid discharge of subglacial meltwater would be expected to produce outlet river channels and substantial floodplain deposits. However, the landscape surrounding Dorsa Argentea-type ridges and the DAF appears to be made of rugged, largely undissected highland terrain. Although four channels have been proposed to drain water from the DAF into the Argyre basin (Head 2000a, Parker et al. 2000), our inspection of available Viking, MOC, and MOLA data verifies only one candidate channel—the eastern branch of Doanus Vallis, which begins northwest of Sisyphi Planum and links to Oceanidum Fossa (Fig. 2b). The other “channels” begin as valleys on the south edge of the Argyre basin but then disappear into undissected Noachian terrain. Also, if the sinuous ridge material is coarse grained, it must have originated from older highland rocks rather than polar dust deposits. However, exposed highland structures such as impact crater rims generally do not appear to be eroded more than normal. Preservation of the ridges by cementation also appears problematic, because water in subglacial lakes should be relatively devoid of salts, unless the water was able to circulate and interact with salts in the underlying aquifer system.\nIn the basal-melting ice-sheet scenario, extensive discharge might result in development of depressions due to withdrawal of water back into the subsurface (Head 2000c) or perhaps by a thermokarst process involving sublimation of ice-rich zones to form huge kettle holes. It is difficult to imagine how water drainage could lead to formation of the voluminous cavi, however. The kettle-hole explanation may work for rimless depressions such as Sisyphi Cavi, but the raised cavi rims in the rugged and cavi members cannot be explained this way.\nFinally, the broad DAF plains units have been interpreted as lake deposits formed in association with polar meltwater (Parker et al. 2000), but this idea fails because most of the units have sloping surfaces and lobate fronts. They also have been described as huge mud flows caused by basal melting and discharge of a polar cap (Jöns 1991). If so, then a thick polar cap of substantially greater volume than the plains units (∼104 to 105 km3) must have extended across regions where the DAF plains members originated. Potentially, the cavi member could be invoked as a polar cap from which the Promethei and chasma members formed. However, no remnants of a thick polar deposit occur in the source regions for the Argentea, dorsa, and Sysiphi members. It is hard to conceive how these units would have survived so well without substantial remnants of the source material.\nIn summary, we agree that the stagnant ice-sheet hypothesis may explain some features of the DAF. However, because of the lack of evidence for extensive fluvial outwash beyond the sinuous ridges, the lack of remnants of thick polar deposits in\nD KOLB\nsource regions of some of the DAF units, and the lack of explanation for the raised rims around many associated depressions, we feel that the ice-sheet explanation is seriously deficient (see Table VI).\nOur search for another explanation of the DAF must be able to account for all the major features involved, without necessitating additional features for which evidence is absent. First, we revisit the volcanic-flow origin of the DAF suggested by Tanaka and Scott (1987). Their interpretation was largely based on the lobate fronts on the margins of some of the DAF and an associated shield structure (Fig. 6). MOC images of the plains units now show that they have a fairly bumpy, homogeneous texture and lack channels and small pressure ridges typical of lava flows observed at meter scales elsewhere on Mars as well as on Earth. The shield structure has rimmed, elongate pits at its summit and radiating about it. They also suggested that the narrow sinuous ridges may have a volcanic origin, but did not venture to provide a detailed explanation.\nAlthough the DAF landforms deviate from typical volcanic morphologies in detail, their gross similarities indicate that volcanic-like eruption and flow mechanisms may provide a helpful starting point for possible scenarios of DAF geology, given the south polar geologic setting. Here, we examine origins involving the expulsion of fluidized, volatile-rich subsurface material, perhaps initiated and augmented by magma/volatile interactions at depth. We consider three essential aspects of this mechanism: (1) The availability of large south polar aquifers saturated with H2O and/or CO2 during the Hesperian, (2) instabilities and triggering mechanisms that would lead to rapid expulsion of subsurface volatiles and megaregolith material, and (3) formation of the observed units and features associated with the DAF.\nHow could liquid-filled aquifers have developed during the Hesperian Period? Perhaps the Noachian crust was too warm due to much higher heat flow back then (Schubert et al. 1992) to develop a cryosphere and effectively seal the subsurface and permit buildup of high pore-fluid pressures of H2O and/or CO2. During the Hesperian Period, discharges into the northern plains associated with erosion of the highland/lowland boundary may have released large amounts of H2O and CO2 into the atmosphere, much of which may have precipitated at the poles. Thus a concentration of volatiles could have developed within the polar regions, and the cryosphere may have thickened sufficiently to entrap liquid beneath. Following the methodology of Clifford (1993) and applying plausible estimates of heat flow during the Hesperian Period, a water-saturated cryosphere should have been <1 to ∼10 km thick at latitudes above >70◦, whereas a crysophere with interstitial clathrate and dry ice would have been 40 to 50% thinner (Hoffman 2000). Thus aquifers saturated with liquid H2O and/or CO2 may have developed beneath the apparent source regions of the DAF during the Hesperian Period at varying depths depending on conditions. Following the proposed discharges in the Hesperian Period, the depleted south polar aquifer system as well as waning heat flow and geologic\nPOLAR REGIONS OF MARS: NOAC\nactivity likely resulted in prohibitive conditions for later major discharge events. Only minor volatile discharges, producing small gullies and fan deposits in cavi walls seem to have occurred since then (Malin and Edgett 2000, Musselwhite et al. 2001).\nGiven the presence of subsurface water and/or liquid CO2, surface discharges may have arisen from instabilities in the aquifiers and triggering events caused by seismic shaking, fracturing, intrusions, and polar deposition. For example, the large, relatively young, 100-km-diameter South crater (Figs. 2b, 6) may have released the seismic energy equivalent to about a magnitude 9.3 marsquake, causing pore pressure changes on the order of several bars within a few hundred kilometers (Leyva and Clifford 1993). Thus the impact may account for the generation and expulsion of slurries from below the cryosphere (Clifford 1993), which may explain some of the DAF units, such as the dorsa, Promethei, and chasma members. However, secondary craters of South crater appear embedded in the Sisyphi member, indicating that the crater postdates that unit. The buildup of dust-rich deposits may have contributed to destabilizing of subsurface material by raising isotherms in the subsurface and melting interstitial ices as the cryosphere thinned (e.g., Clifford 1987, Kolb and Tanaka 2001), particularly if the deposits had very low thermal conductivity like that of frozen loess deposits on Earth (Johnson and Lorenz 2000). Possible evidence for such deposits include the cavi member of the DAF, friable material forming the lower walls of Sisyphi Cavi underlying the Sisyphi member, and hummocky parts of the Argentea member north of the Heaviside crater. In addition, igneous intrusions could have led to explosive magma/volatile interactions, resulting in some of the vent structures and deposits of the DAF.\nThe principal features of the DAF that require explanation include: (1) the voluminous flow units, (2) the broad cavi and rimmed depressions, and (3) the narrow sinuous ridges (see Table VI). We will address each of these aspects within the context of fluidized discharges.\nThe flow units may develop as fluidized slurries formed by the mixing of subsurface volatiles with fine-grained, unconsolidated crustal material and perhaps pyroclastic ash, if intrusions were involved. Given the large volumes of the flow members (104 to 105 km3), it seems more likely that magma was involved. However, the lack of large associated volcanic collapse structures is problematic, unless the magmas arose straight from great depths and did not reside in shallow chambers. The flows may have been sufficiently thick and coherent to suppress the release of volatiles, allowing flow to proceed by fluid lubrication. We speculate that the gradual release of volatiles through the flow surface and perhaps periglacial-style modification may have destroyed any viscous-flow features such as leveed channels and pressure ridges and produced the bumpy texture. This suggestion coincides with that for a deposit filling most of Aonia Planum (Fig. 2b) south of the 200-km diameter Lowell crater (54◦ to 62◦S, 71◦ to 83◦W). The Aonia deposit is similar in age to the Lowell impact and was thought to have resulted from liquefaction and expulsion of subsurface slurry generated by the intense\nHIAN AND HESPERIAN PERIODS 19\nshaking caused by the Lowell impact (Lias et al. 1997). MOC images show that this deposit has the same bumpy texture as the flow members of the DAF.\nIn the DAF, the cavi and rugged members include many large, rimmed depressions that may be vents for explosive discharges of subsurface volatiles and clastic material (e.g., Figs. 5, 9), perhaps leading to the formation of many of the Dorsa Argenteatype ridges. Liquid CO2 within a subsurface slurry will rapidly flash to the gas phase as the fluid approaches the surface, causing explosive, phreatic eruptions and density flows (Hoffman 2000), whereas volatile-rich magmas or magma/volatile interaction may result in explosive eruptions and pyroclastic flows (see Crown and Greeley 1993). Explosive discharge of fines could have built up sequences of deposits, within which numerous small, coarser-grained density flows eroded and filled channels. In Sisyphi Planum, a friable deposit apparently underlies the thick flow unit (Sisyphi member), whereas in most other places, the putative explosive deposits would have buried the flow units. Later preferential erosion of the fine-grained deposits may have produced and enlarged the rimless depressions of Cavi Angusti and Sisyphi Cavi (Figs. 6 and 9) and left behind pedestal craters in Parva and Promethei Plana (Figs. 4 and 7), and the Dorsa Argentea-type ridges (Figs. 4, 5, 7–9).\nOur interpretation of the Dorsa Argentea-type sinuous ridges is similar to that of Rice and Mollard (1994), who suggested that the ridges resulted from fluvial sedimentation followed by preferential eolian erosion of surrounding deposits, forming an inverted, raised-channel topography. The terrestrial analogue for this mechanism is a series of cemented fluvial gravels that form broad, sinuous ridges up to 30 m high, hundreds of meters wide, and tens of kilometers long across low-gradient alluvial fans in Oman (Maizels 1990). The channel deposits from throughout a 250-m-thick sequence of fine-grained sediments that extend for 250 km and gently slope at about 2 m km−1. The analogous elements include: (1) The dimensions and sinuous form of the south polar ridges, (2) their apparent exhumation out of friable material, and (3) their crossover relations, including some multistoried structures. The paleochannels are resistant due to coarser-grained clasts and a higher degree of cementation compared to the interchannel overbank and eolian sediments. Raised channels in Oman developed the best where later eolian deflation dominated, whereas terraces are the dominant landform where fluvial incision eroded the deposit (Maizels 1990).\nIn our scenario, most of the martian south polar sinuous ridges formed by analogous processes in which discharges dissected and infilled channel courses, followed by exhumation of channel deposits. Instead of fluvial sediments, the deposits may be density flows and/or poorly consolidated ash flows formed within unconsolidated fines created by the explosive activity associated with the flows and perhaps emplaced in similar fashion. A few of the ridges are singular, isolated, and only moderately sinuous and thus may be compressional tectonic wrinkle ridges. Also, the arcuate and rectilinear pattern of ridges that include Inca City in the cavi member (Fig. 9) may be relatively resistant"

Where ridges rise and surmount other ridges or crater rims, as noted by Head (2000d), their gradient change may be simply a result of draping and slumping as erosion undermines the raised channels. The original channel-floor profiles therefore become modified and thus modest reversals in the longitudinal ridge-crest profile should be expected.\nOverall, we feel that this discharge mechanism is generally consistent with the geology observed. This mechanism does not require activity by large amounts of water and hence the dissection of outwash channels and deposition of fans and floodplains. Modest Hesperian polar deposits, for which evidence exists, may contribute to the required discharges. Igneous activity is somewhat of a wildcard, because magma/volatile interactions may have played a significant role in the development of the DAF, but clear volcanic associations cannot be demonstrated. Discharges of subsurface volatiles also have been invoked to explain many other erosional landforms and features on Mars (e.g., Carr 1979, MacKinnon and Tanaka 1989, Tanaka 1997, Hoffman 2000, Carr and Malin 2000, Malin and Edgett 2000, Musselwhite et al. 2001, Tanaka et al. 2001b), and thus our model, while speculative, is consistent with this type of commonly proposed martian geologic activity.\nThe massive MOLA and MOC data sets, still being acquired as this paper was written, have only been cursorily examined herein. Further spacecraft exploration and data analysis should help to improve and refine understanding of the geologic histories of the polar regions of Mars, especially what the Dorsa Argentea Formation may indicate about Hesperian geologic and climatic conditions."

  "abstractText": "During the Noachian Period, the south polar region of Mars underwent intense cratering, construction of three groups of volcanoes, widespread contractional deformation, resurfacing of low areas, and local dissection of valley networks; no evidence for polar deposits, ice sheets, or glaciation is recognized. South polar Hesperian geology is broadly characterized by waning impacts, volcanism, and tectonism. Emplacement of the polar Dorsa Argentea Formation (DAF) occurred during the Hesperian Period. Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter topographic data and Mars Orbiter Camera images elucidate stratigraphic, morphologic, and topographic relations, permitting the dividing of the DAF into eight members, which surround and underlie about half of the Amazonian south polar layered deposits. The lobate fronts and lack of typical volcanic-flow morphology of the six plains units indicate that they may be made up of debris flows. We think that these flows, tens of meters to 200 m thick, may have originated by the discharge of huge volumes of slurry fluidized by ground water or liquid CO2, perhaps triggered by local impacts, igneous activity, or basal melting beneath polar deposits. The cavi and rugged members include irregular depressions that penetrate the subsurface; some of the pits have raised rims. The depressions may have formed by collapse due to expulsion of subsurface material in which local explosive activity built up the raised rims. Further, smaller eruptions of volatile-rich material may have resulted in narrow, sinuous channel deposits within aggrading fine-grained unconsolidated material perhaps produced by gaseous discharge of subsurface volatiles; preferential erosion of the latter material could have produced the Dorsa Argentea-type sinuous ridges associated mainly with the DAF. Alternatively, the ridges may be eskers, but the lack of associated glacial and fluvial morphologies casts doubt on this interpretation. The knobby, degraded materials forming Scandia Colles may represent the only Noachian geologic record exposed in the north polar region. Most of the north polar region was buried by wateror debrisocean sediments during the Hesperian Period, originating from uplands areas and perhaps knobby terrains in the northern plains. The sediments either mantle or were deformed by wrinkle ridges radial and concentric to Utopia basin and concentric to northern Tharsis. Sources of stress probably included sediment loading in the northern plains and regional magmatic and loading activity at Tharsis. Polar layered deposits began piling up during the Early Amazonian or later. c © 2001 Elsevier Science",
