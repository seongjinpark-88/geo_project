    "text": "Alba Patera, Mars: Topography, structure, and evolution of a\nunique late Hesperian–early Amazonian shield volcano\nMikhail A. Ivanov1,2 and James W. Head2\nReceived 22 April 2005; revised 17 April 2006; accepted 28 April 2006; published 2 September 2006.\n[1] New spacecraft data, especially MOLA topography, reveal important characteristics of Alba Patera that were either unknown or poorly resolved in previous data sets. The major and consistent breaks of slope and the specific pattern of lava flows within a broad region around Alba Patera permit division of this area into two major parts that appear to be related to different episodes of volcanism at Alba Patera: a low-lying apron of lava flows that broadly surrounds the edifice, a high-standing main construct, consisting of a central edifice, western and eastern flanking lobes, and a summit area characterized by a summit plateau and a summit dome topped by a caldera complex. Volcanic activity apparently began as massive effusive eruptions that formed the broad apron of lava flows, followed by more focused effusive eruptions that built the central construct. The construct spread gravitationally in a northerly direction to favor E-W dike propagation, leading to the formation of Tharsis-Montes-like flanking lobes. The final stages of volcanic activity at Alba Patera were concentrated in the summit area, forming a summit dome 400 km in diameter, a caldera complex, and two small shields near and inside the caldera, which underwent late-stage tilting and deformation; the load of the newly documented summit dome may have led to the development of Alba Fossae, reactivation of graben within Tantalus Fossae, and tilting of the summit dome to the east. A clear sequence in eruptive style is observed (early massive sheet flows, later tube-fed flows, and late, shorter-length and lower-volume sheet flows). Dendritic valley networks on the northern flanks of Alba Patera have been interpreted to be evidence of easily erodable material of pyroclastic origin, but new data suggest that these friable deposits and the valley networks may have formed instead during Amazonian climate excursion periods. The extensive apron of lava flows, combined with the flanking lava lobes and the Tharsis-Montes-scale summit dome, make Alba Patera much more similar to the Tharsis Montes than to the Hesperian-aged paterae. The Alba Patera lava apron was emplaced on early Hesperian ridged plains largely during the middle to late Hesperian; stratigraphic relationships suggest that effusive eruptions from Alba Patera interacted with ice-rich deposits in the northern lowlands. Alba Patera flanking lobes and the summit dome were emplaced in the earliest Amazonian, accompanied by late-stage loading, graben formation, and edifice tilting.\nCitation: Ivanov, M. A., and J. W.

    "text": "[2] One of the largest Martian volcanoes, Alba Patera [Mutch et al., 1976; Carr et al., 1977; Greeley and Spudis, 1981], is situated on the northern edge of the Tharsis rise (Figure 1) between about 20–60 N and 90–130 W (Figures 1 and 2) where it forms a prominent topographic and volcanic feature. Stratigraphically, the volcanic deposits of Alba Patera straddle the transition from the Hesperian to Amazonian systems [Scott and Tanaka, 1986] (Figures 3a and 3b) and thus appear to be among the oldest extensively exposed major volcanic deposits in Tharsis. Significant volcanic activity at Alba Patera ceased much earlier than it did on the Tharsis Montes. On the basis of Viking Orbiter images the variety of volcanic materials related to the formation and evolution of the volcano has been grouped into the Alba Patera Formation, which consists of lower, middle, and upper members [Scott and Tanaka, 1986]. The lower member (unit Hal) is Hesperian in age and corresponds to a broad area of lava flows surrounding the main construct of Alba Patera from the west, north, and east (Figure 1). The middle member (unit Aam), early Amazonian in age, coincides with the main construct of Alba Patera and the upper\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 111, E09003, doi:10.1029/2005JE002469, 2006\n1V.

[3] The large systems of graben that form the northern part of a giant zone of extension centered at the Tharsis Rise (Ceraunius, Alba, and Tantalus Fossae) [Carr, 1981; Banerdt et al., 1992] apparently played an important role in the evolution of the volcanic complex of Alba Patera. The main construct of Alba Patera is superposed on the large topographic ridge corresponding to the Noachian terrain of Ceraunius Fossae and the semicircular and curved graben of Alba and Tantalus Fossae outline the summit area of the volcano (Figure 2). The graben of these systems are both embayed by volcanic materials of Alba Patera and cut the lava flows on its flanks. A detailed study has shown that the evolution of the graben systems spans a long time interval, from Noachian to late Amazonian [Tanaka, 1990]; the formation and evolution of Alba Patera itself appears to correspond to a small portion of the whole tectonic history in the region of northern Tharsis [Tanaka, 1990] (Figures 3a and 3b). [4] Although many aspects of Alba Patera have been studied on the basis of the Viking Orbiter data [Hodges and Moore, 1994, and references therein], before the newer high-resolution data from Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey, little was known about the actual topographic shape of Alba Patera, and the total extent of the volcano was largely underestimated. For instance, the main construct of the volcano was sometimes considered to be between the major graben swarms, Alba and Tantalus Fossae [Cattermole, 1986, 1987, 1990; Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988; Turtle and Melosh, 1997]. The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data show, however, that this area, which is about 500 km across, is only the summit of a much larger volcanic construct, whose horizontal dimensions are about 1000 by 1500 km (Figure 2). The overall\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n2 of 31\nE09003\ntopographic shape of Alba Patera suggests a complex and multistaged evolution of the volcano during the formation of its specificparts. Incontrast tomanyof theother largevolcanoes in Tharsis, Alba Patera was cited as the possiblemajor location of pyroclastic-style volcanism onMars [Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988] and it was proposed that Alba Patera could represent an important link or transition in the apparent global evolution ofMartian volcanic style frommore explosive tomore effusive [e.g.,Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]. [5] Here we report on the results of the study of Alba Patera on the basis of the new high-resolution MOLA topography and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and Thermal Emission Imaging Spectrometer (THEMIS) image data. These data sets show new details of previously known structures, reveal new features, and greatly facilitate analysis and interpretation of the geology and history of Alba Patera. The main questions we address in our study are as follows. (1) What is the regional topographic setting and the overall topographic configuration of Alba Patera?; (2) What are the major components of Alba Patera, how did they form, and to which principal episodes of volcano evolution do they correspond?; (3) How do the topography and structure of Alba Patera compare to the Tharsis Montes and Olympus Mons?; (4) What is the major sequence of events during the evolution of the Alba Patera region?; (5) What are the relative roles of effusive and explosive volcanism at Alba Patera?; (6) Does Alba represent a transitional style of Martian volcanism and is it a link between the ancient highland paterae and younger major shield volcanoes [e.g., Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]?; (7) What is the interaction of volcanism and tectonics at Alba Patera?; and (8) How have the volcanic deposits of Alba Patera been modified subsequent to their emplacement?"

    "heading": "2. Topography: Overall Configuration of Alba Patera and its Regional Setting",
    "text": "[6] Alba Patera forms a regional-scale topographic high within the northeastern portion of the Tharsis Rise (Figure 4a) (for perspective flyovers see Animations 1 and Animation 2). The volcano has relatively steep sides and a flatter summit corresponding to the area between Alba Fossae and Tantalus Fossae (Figure 2). In the regional shaded topography maps, the region is characterized by a pattern of narrow sinuous ridges that appear to radiate away from the area centered at the main construct of Alba Patera (Figures 4a–4c). The distribution of the lava flows comprising the edifice surface is especially well seen in the detrended (high-pass filtered) topographic map (Figure 5). In this map, the long-wavelength (>400 km) topography was filtered out and only the high-frequency components of the topography are seen; thus the regional slope is removed and the appearance and distribution of lava flows are not distorted by the effect of illumination as in the case of the shaded topography map (compare Figures 4a and 4b with Figure 5). [7] The most topographically prominent lava flows in the region of Alba Patera are concentrated on the flanks of the main volcano construct, especially on its western side (Figure 5). More topographically subdued lava flows cover\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n3 of 31\nE09003\na much broader area extending for hundreds of kilometers away from the main construct (Figure 5). The regional-scale topography at Alba Patera apparently not only played a key role in the distribution of lava flows, but the preferential distribution of lava flows in certain areas obviously has influenced edifice topography. [8] The shaded relief maps (Figure 4) and the series of latitudinal and longitudinal topographic profiles (Figures 6 and 7) illustrate the specific regional topographic background and details of Alba Patera. The main trend of the regional topographic background is that it lies at the northern margin of the Tharsis Rise and the southern margin of the northern lowlands. Furthermore, the elevation and regional slopes on the western and northern sides of the volcano are very different from those on the eastern and southern sides. To the south and southeast of Alba Patera, the surface corresponding to the interior portions of the Tharsis Rise is almost horizontal and a few kilometers higher than it is north and west of Alba Patera. The vast area to the west, northwest, and north of the main construct corresponds to the broad flanks of the Tharsis Rise and slopes to the north and northwest consistently at about 0.2 (Figures 6a, 6b, and 7). Thus the main construct of Alba Patera occupies an area near the regional break of slope between the Tharsis interior and its flanks and the major portion of the Alba Patera construct is on the regional slope to the north (Figures 7b–7h). The southern portion of the regional break in slope coincides with a distinct topographic ridge (up to 1.5 km high) corresponding to outcrops of Noachian-aged terrain of Ceraunius Fossae (Figures 2, 4, 6g, and 6h). The main construct is superposed on this ridge and the summit area of the volcano is on the northward projection of the ridge (Figures 6e and 7e). [9] Topographic profiles taken at 40 N and 250 E reveal a strong asymmetry at Alba Patera (Figures 6d and 7e). In latitudinal profile (Figure 6d), the topographically prominent construct of the volcano consists of two lobe-like features and a summit area that is distinctly sloped to the east. The western lobe is higher (about 5.5 km above mean planetary radius (mpr)) than the eastern lobe (about 4 km above mpr) but the major breaks in slope at the base of the lobes are at about the same elevation, about 0 km. In the longitudinal profile (Figure 7e), the main construct is characterized by a relatively steep northern flank (about 1.3 ), a flat summit topped with a large dome-like feature, and a very gently sloping southern flank (about 0.17 ), which is superposed on a topographic ridge of Ceraunius\nFigure 3.

The topographic contour map and the topographic profiles show that a main feature of Alba Patera is its asymmetry. [10] The consistent breaks in slope seen in the 1/64 degree MOLA topography maps (Figures 4, 6, and 7) and in the specific pattern of distribution of lava flows in a broad region around the main construct (Figures 4a–4c and 5) define two major topographic subdivisions of Alba Patera (Figure 8): (1) the main construct that forms the topographic anomaly of the volcano and (2) the vast apron of lava flows surrounding the main construct. The major breaks of slope within the main construct of Alba further divide it into several smaller parts: (1) the central edifice, (2) the lobe-like features at the western and eastern sides of the central edifice, and (3) the summit area consisting of the summit plateau and summit dome. The summit dome contains a caldera complex. Below we describe each of the parts of the volcano separately. The volumes of distinct topographic subdivisions of Alba Patera are shown in Table 1, and Table 2 summarizes the dimensions of Alba Patera in comparison with the Tharsis Montes."

    "heading": "3. Apron of Lava Flows",
    "text": "[11] This portion of the volcanic complex of Alba Patera is characterized by sets of low, flat-topped ridges interpreted to be lava flows [Scott and Tanaka, 1986] that form a radial pattern to the west, north, and northeast of the main construct of Alba Patera (Figure 9). Topographically, the apron is a flat feature that occupies the shallow regional slope (about 0.2 ) of the northern flank of Tharsis Rise (Figure 7). The northern boundary of the apron is consistently outlined by a distinct break in slope between the steeper apron and flatter surface of Vastitas Borealis where the characteristic slope of the surface near the contact is about 0.1 (Figure 7c). The break in slope occurs to a large extent near a single elevation of about 3.0 km.\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n5 of 31\nE09003\n[12] The lava apron coincides with the unit Hal, the lower member of Alba Patera Formation [Scott and Tanaka, 1986] (Figure 3a) and its lava flows embay old cratered terrain of Tempe Terra and Noachian fractured material north of Olympus Mons (Figures 4a and 4b). An assemblage of narrow, elongated ridges is seen on the floor of the northern plains to the northwest of the apron (Figures 9 and 10). Although the ridges appear to be prominent features in the enhanced MOLA shaded relief map (black arrows in Figure 10), they have practically no morphologic signature: They are invisible in Viking images [Chicarro et al., 1985] and difficult or impossible to see in more recent (MOC, THEMIS) image data sets (Figure 11). At the regional scale, the ridges form a consistent pattern of structures circumferential to Tharsis Rise and have been interpreted to be buried Hesperian-aged mare-type wrinkle ridges largely covered within the northern plains by materials of Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF) [Head et al., 2002]. Exposed analogs of these structures are thought to be wrinkle ridges that deform the unit Hr (Hesperian ridged plains [Scott and Tanaka, 1986; Tanaka, 1986; Greeley and Guest, 1987; Head et al., 2002]), for example, in Lunae and Solis Planum. [13] Within the lava flow apron, there are practically no such ridges and those that are still visible occur at the very edge of the apron and appear as relict features embayed by lava flows from Alba Patera (white arrows in Figure 10). Such relationships suggest that both the units of VBF and the lava apron of Alba Patera (unit Hal) postdate emplacement of the Hesperian ridged plains (unit Hr). The stratigraphic relationships between the lava flow apron and the VBF cannot be established, however, because these units are not in contact with each other and there are no structures that may help to establish their relative age. In the correlation chart for the geologic maps of the western hemisphere and the polar regions of Mars [Scott and Tanaka, 1986; Tanaka and Scott, 1987] the materials of VBF and the lava apron (unit Hal) are shown at the same level (Figure 3a). [14] At its northern boundary, the apron is in contact with unit Aa1 (member 1 of Arcadia Formation, Scott and Tanaka [1986]). At the contact, the lava flows characterizing the apron abruptly terminate (Figures 9a and 9b). This may suggest that the flows mostly predate the Arcadia Formation (see also correlation chart of the map by Scott and Tanaka [1986]). The relationships of embayment are seen in more detail in the daytime IR THEMIS image I04897008 (Figure 12). Here, the apron is characterized by a rough surface with numerous narrow and low ridges and scarps corresponding to fronts of lava flows. The surface of the surrounding plains is smooth and displays a few features that have a subdued appearance. A graben that cuts the surface of the apron almost completely disappears within the plains. These relationships show unambiguously that material of the Arcadia Formation is younger than the lava flows of the apron.\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n6 of 31\nE09003\n[15] The important feature is that the contact between the lava apron and the northern plains materials follows a regionally smooth line, although the apron obviously represents multiple lava flows that were probably formed over an extended period of time (Figures 3a, 9a, and 9b). The contact could be explained by simple burial of the lava flow apron by materials of the Arcadia Formation. However, such a burial was not able to cover completely the wrinkle ridges that predate emplacement of the apron and are still visible in the high-resolution topography data northward of the contact (Figures 9a and 10). Thus there may be other factors affecting the morphology of the northern boundary of the apron. We address this issue in the Discussion section. [16] Swarms of graben composing Alba and Tantalus Fossae heavily deform the northeastern portion of the apron and postdate its formation. At the contact with unit Aa1, many\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n7 of 31\nE09003\nof the graben terminate and are embayed by material of the Arcadia Formation (Figure 12), but some of the tectonic structures of the same swarm of Tantalus Fossae cut the surface of the unit Aa1 providing evidence for prolonged and multistage development of the graben swarms [Tanaka, 1990]."

    "heading": "4. Main Construct of Alba Patera",
    "text": "[17] This portion of Alba Patera corresponds to the prominent topographic anomaly of the volcano (Figure 4).\nThis feature is outlined by a consistent break of slope and is elongated in the W-E direction (Figure 4). The main construct is about 1500 km from west to east and about 1000 km from south to north. Stratigraphically, the major portion of the main construct corresponds to the Amazonian-aged middle member (unit Aam) of the Alba Patera Formation [Scott and Tanaka, 1986] (Figure 3a). [18] Topographically, the main construct of Alba is a highly asymmetric feature (Figures 4a–4c, 6, and 7). Along the central north-south axis of Alba Patera (at about 250 E, Figure 7e), the northern base of the volcano is about 4.2 km\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n8 of 31\nE09003\nlower than its southern base where it overlaps the topographic ridge of Ceraunius Fossae. The apparent topographic gradient along the centerline of Alba is 0.24 to the north. Away from the construct center, however, the gradient is noticeably lower and is similar to the regional slope of the northern flank of Tharsis (about 0.20 , profiles at 245 and 255 E, Figures 7d and 7f). The summit area, where it is visible in the topographic profiles, appears to be roughly horizontal in the N-S direction (profile along 250 E, Figure 7e) and distinctly tilted to the east (profile along 40 N, Figure 6d). The western lobe, which is superposed on the regional steady slope to the west and north, is a much larger feature than the eastern lobe that is superposed on the more horizontal surface of the interior of Tharsis Rise. Thus the regional topographic background appears to be among the most important factors causing the prominent asymmetry of the main construct of Alba Patera. [19] Alba Patera occurs in the transition zone from the southern uplands to the northern lowlands. Within a broad region around the volcano, however, there is no prominent topographic step that is so characteristic of the edge of the southern uplands (dichotomy boundary) elsewhere on Mars; for instance, just to the east of Alba Patera at the northern edge of Tempe Terra. The absence of a topographic step within the area of Alba Patera means that it is either completely masked by the Tharsis and Alba volcanics or\nnever existed there as a prominent topographic feature. Indeed, the interpolated location of the dichotomy boundary has been drawn much to the south by some authors [e.g., Scott and Tanaka, 1986].\nTable 1.

The summit area corresponds stratigraphically to the upper member (unit Aau) of the Alba Patera Formation [Scott and Tanaka, 1986]. In the following sections we describe these topographic provinces in detail."

    "heading": "4.1. Central Edifice",
    "text": "[21] This feature of Alba constitutes the central portion of the main volcanic construct and is most prominent at its northern flank where the average slope is as much as 1.3 (Figures 4 and 7e). The southern side of the central construct is poorly defined because of proximity to the heavily deformed area of Ceraunius Fossae and is shallower than the northern flank on average ( 0.17 ). Two large lobe-like features completely mask the central edifice on its western and eastern sides (Figure 4).\n[22] In the MOLA shaded relief map (Figure 4), the northern flank of the central edifice is characterized by rough topography consisting of numerous narrow elongated ridges interpreted to be lava flows that are cut by structures of Alba Fossae (Figure 13). Three different components characterize the morphology of the northern flank of the central construct. Lava flows represent the volcanic component, and tectonic features are represented by the graben of Alba Fossae. A series of high-pass filtered topographic profiles across the northern flank of the central edifice shows that the typical variations of the high-frequency topographic features (predominant lava flows that are 20–25 km wide) are a few hundred meters (Figure 14). These features are the major contributors in the mesoscale (up to a few tens of kilometers wavelength) roughness of the northern flank. The small valley networks that are abundant on the flanks of Alba Patera and are thought to be of fluvial origin [Gulick and Baker, 1990] represent the third component (Figure 15) that apparently contributes little to the mesoscale roughness. [23] Among these features, the graben appear to be the youngest because the majority of them clearly cut both the lava flows and valley networks (Figure 15). The relationships between the lava flows and the valleys are less clear.\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n10 of 31\nE09003\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n11 of 31\nE09003\nIn the visible THEMIS images there is evidence, however, that at least some of the valleys appear to be controlled by the lava flows and thus are younger (Figure 15a). The highresolution MOLA topography provides additional evidence for the control of the distribution of the valley networks by lava flows. In the detrended topographic profiles across the northern flank of the central edifice, it is seen that the valleys are inserted into the V-shaped and U-shaped depressions that separate individual lava flows (Figure 16). Thus\nthe lava flows on the northern slope indeed govern the distribution of the valley networks suggesting that the majority of the flows predate the valleys. [24] The small dendritic valleys on the northern slope of the central edifice appear to be draped over the preexisting topography (Figures 15 and 16). In places, the smaller valleys merge to form wider and longer channels that are nested between the topographic ridges of lava flows. These larger channels follow the regional slope and run down toward the base of the central edifice. Comparison of the areal distribution of the valley networks with MOLA topography shows that the channels are almost exclusively\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n12 of 31\nE09003\nrestricted to within the steeper slopes (1.4–1.5 ) of the central dome, that they disappear near the slope break at the base of the edifice, and that they do not continue into the area of the apron of lava flows, which is the area largely free of valley networks (Figure 16)."

    "heading": "4.2. Flanking Lobes",
    "text": "[25] The distinct east-west elongation of the main construct of Alba Patera is due to the fact that two large lobelike features occur at the western and eastern sides of the central edifice (Figure 4). The characteristic feature of both lobes is the fan-shaped distribution of lava flows clearly seen in the MOLA topographic maps (Figures 17 and 18). The most prominent and apparently the most recent flows on the surface of both lobes appear close to the volcano summit. The western lobe is significantly larger then the eastern lobe, and is 900 km in the SW-NE direction and 700 km in E-W direction whereas the eastern lobe is 550 by 550 km. The western lobe is topographically higher (at 5.5 km mpr) than the eastern lobe (at 4.0 km mpr), and remains relatively undeformed (Figure 17). In contrast,\nthe eastern lobe is strongly deformed by Tantalus Fossae graben (Figure 18). [26] Similar to the central edifice, lava plains, graben, and small valley networks have shaped the surface of the western and eastern lobes. The most abundant features are sharp-crested ridges that have a specific triangle-shaped cross section in the shaded relief topography (Figures 17 and 18). These features are interpreted to be lava tubes [Greeley and Spudis, 1981; Cattermole, 1990; Lopes and Kilburn, 1990] Tectonic features (graben) are also common on both lobes but are much more abundant within the eastern lobe. There, the graben swarm of Tantalus Fossae forms a broad zone (about 250 km wide) of linear and curvilinear troughs that begins almost at the base of the eastern lobe and extends up the lobe flank to the summit area (Figure 18). In contrast, the main graben zone of Alba Fossae is much narrower (about 30 km, Figure 19), consists of distinctly curved structures, has a semicircular shape in plan view, and is concentrated along the break in slope between the western lobe and the summit area (Figures 4 and 5). The graben of both Alba and Tantalus Fossae are\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n13 of 31\nE09003\namong the youngest structures that cut the lava flows within both lobes (Figures 17–19). [27] Small valley networks are much more abundant features on the surface of the western flanking lobe than on the eastern lobe (Figure 20) [Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]. Within the western lobe, the valley networks appear to be more common on the northern sides of the lobe (Figure 21a); southern slopes are almost devoid of them (Figure 21b). On the western lobe, the valley networks often form a dendritic pattern of shorter and longer channels, whose distribution is controlled by the topographic ridges of the lava flows and tubes (Figures 20 and 21a). Such\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n14 of 31\nE09003\ntopographic control of the valley networks is evidence that the lava flows and tubes on the slopes of the western flanking zone are older features and the sequence of structures within the lobes is similar to that on the central edifice: Lava flows formed, followed by valley networks, and then graben. The local topography on the surface of the western lobe also controls the distribution of the sheet lava flows emanating from the summit area of Alba Patera (Figure 20). These flows clearly embay the small valley networks, indicating evidence that these flows are among the youngest volcanic features. [28] On the basis of the general topographic configuration and distribution of lava flows, the lobes of Alba Patera resemble structures on the flanks of the Tharsis Montes, especially Arsia Mons (Figure 22) [e.g., Crumpler and Aubele, 1978; Crumpler et al., 1996]. Although the specific shape of the Alba Patera flanking lobes was unknown before MOLA topography, Hodges and Moore [1994]\npointed out that the distribution of lava flows on the western lobe of Alba Patera resembled that of the southwestern rift zone of Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii. There are, however, several important differences between the flanking lobes of Alba Patera and the Tharsis Montes. The Montes lobes are significantly lower than the elevation of the central construct of their associated volcano (Figures 22 and 23) whereas at Alba Patera the lobes are almost as high as the central edifice of the volcano (Figure 6d). At the Tharsis Montes, flanking vents and vent-related structures crosscut the slopes of the volcanoes and extend downward from the summit caldera(s) areas to the uppermost portions of the lobes (Figure 22). Such flanking vents and structures are absent in Alba Patera (Figures 17 and 18). Clusters of small (tens of kilometers across) shield-like volcanoes occur on the lobes attached to Ascraeus and Pavonis Montes and a chain of the small shields crosses the center of the caldera of Arsia Mons [Carr et al., 1977; Scott and Zimbelman, 1995]. No small shields or their clusters have been observed on the flanking lobes of Alba Patera (Figures 17 and 18) and only two small shields occur near the caldera complex in the summit area of Alba Patera (see section 4.3.2). [29] An important similarity between Alba Patera and the Tharsis Montes is that these large volcanoes are either on or near consistent breaks in slope around the more plateau-like summit of the Tharsis Rise. The lobe-like features associated with these volcanoes spread along the strike of the\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n15 of 31\nE09003\nslope breaks (Figures 4a, 4b, and 22). In contrast to Alba Patera and the Tharsis Montes, the large volcano of Elysium Mons sits on top of the more domical Elysium Rise and does not display flanking lobes (Figures 23 and 24)."

    "heading": "4.3. Summit Area",
    "text": "[30] The summit area of Alba Patera (Figure 8) is outlined by the systems of graben of Alba Fossae to the west and Tantalus Fossae to the east (Figure 4). The summit area represents a broad plateau-like feature about 500 km across (Figure 4) that corresponds to the upper member of the Alba Patera Formation (unit Aau) [Scott and Tanaka, 1986] (Figures 1 and 3a). The summit area of Alba Patera hosts a large dome-like feature, the summit dome, which is topped by a caldera complex and two small shields. 4.3.1. Summit Dome [31] The summit dome of Alba Patera (Figure 25) is about 350 by 450 km across at its base, which is close to the horizontal dimensions of the central construct of the Tharsis Montes (Table 2). The dome of Alba, however, is only about 1.5 km high (significantly lower than the Montes), and was not identified in the Viking Orbiter images. Prior to the acquisition of MOLA data, the primary evidence for the presence of a summit dome on Alba Patera was the distribution of lava flows on the flanks of the dome [Cattermole, 1987; Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]. The flows there produce a radial pattern of features and are distributed broadly symmetrically relative to the center of the dome\n(Figure 26) [Cattermole, 1987; Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]. Sheet lava flows are the most abundant types of flows on the dome and their presence causes its slopes to be topographically rough (Figure 25). Some of the flows are long (hundreds of kilometers) and superposed on the other parts of the main construct of Alba Patera (Figure 20). [32] The graben and valley networks that are common features within the large portion of the main construct of Alba Patera are absent within the summit dome. There are two sinuous ridges on the western and eastern flanks of the summit dome. The ridges radiate from the summit caldera complex and appear to be among the youngest structures because they cut the flanks of the dome and appear to deform the floor of the calderas (Figure 25). These ridges are interpreted to be a response to the latest stage of reservoir solidification [Walker, 1984, 1988] and postemplacement loading and flexure of the edifice. We interpret the absence of major radial and/or concentric faults and graben within the dome (Figure 25) as evidence that this feature was formed primarily by volcanic construction; uplift by volcanic inflation, radial dike emplacement, and subsidence played secondary roles. The only major graben that occur within the summit area and locally on the flanks of the dome are those belonging to the Alba and Tantalus Fossae graben systems and the vast majority of those are\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n16 of 31\nE09003\ntangential to the dome. The graben of Ceraunius Fossae are radial to the dome but they do not extend very far up its flanks. In all instances where the graben cross the lava flows from the dome, the graben crosscut the flows, providing\nunambiguous evidence that graben were formed after formation of the dome (Figures 19, 21, 27a, and 27b). [33] Topographically, the summit dome is a symmetric feature in the N-S direction but it is strongly asymmetric in the W-E direction (Figures 6d and 7e). The western base of the dome is at about 5.5 km and its eastern base is at about 4.2 km. Thus the whole feature is on a regional slope of about 0.24 to the east, and the eastern flank of the dome appears to be significantly steeper (mean slope is about 1.1 ) than the western flank (mean slope is about 0.7 , Figure 28). The floor of the larger caldera at the top of the dome is also tilted to the east at about the same angle as the entire dome. If the regional slope, however, is taken into account and the actual topography is detrended, than the dome becomes a quite symmetric structure and the mean slopes at its western and eastern flanks become identical, about 0.9 (Figure 28). The symmetric shape of the summit dome appears to correspond better to the equidimensional (symmetric) pattern of distribution of lava flows around the center of the dome (Figure 26). If the summit dome was initially a symmetric feature, it would be characterized by a symmetric pattern of lava flows around it. If, in contrast, the dome tilted at earlier stages of its growth then the lava flows around such a dome would be both preferentially elongated to and turned toward the direction of the largest topographic\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n17 of 31\nE09003\ngradient and the pattern of lava flow distribution would be asymmetrical. We interpret the symmetric pattern of lava flows around the summit dome and its tilt to the east to mean that the dome was tilted after it was almost completely formed. 4.3.2. Caldera Complex [34] The summit dome of Alba Patera is topped with two volcanic shields and two nested calderas (Figures 25a–25f and 29). The calderas were visible in Viking Orbiter images, but the shields were not identified before the acquisition of MOLA data [Smith et al., 1999, 2001]. The larger caldera (approximately 170 by 100 km) is in the geometric center of the summit dome and is bounded by a steep, semicircular western wall (Figure 30a). The caldera wall is 500 m tall at the westernmost end of the caldera and disappears at the northern and southern sides of the caldera at 250 E. The smaller caldera (about 65 by 45 km) is in the southern half of the larger one (Figure 29) and is outlined everywhere by\na steep wall (Figure 30b) whose height varies over a range of a few hundred meters. The walls of both calderas are scalloped, suggesting multiple episodes of subsidence and/ or mass wasting. [35] The small volcanic shields are low mounds (several hundred meters) topped with caldera-like features several kilometers across (Figures 29 and 30). The topographic and morphologic characteristics of the shields are so subdued that they are almost indistinguishable in the visible wavelength image data sets (Figures 30a and 30b). Western shield A is outside the larger caldera and is partly cut by the caldera wall (Figure 30a), indicating that the shield formed prior to the caldera. Eastern shield B (Figure 30b) is within the larger caldera and is superposed on its floor, therefore postdating caldera formation. The summit of the eastern shield is topped with a concentric circular feature that was interpreted as a major center of explosive eruptions at Alba Patera [Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]. The northern wall of the smaller caldera cuts the southern flank of the eastern shield, and thus is younger. In summary, the crosscutting relationships among the volcanic features at the top of the summit dome of Alba Patera establish the following sequence of events: (1) formation of the western shield, (2) subsidence of the larger caldera and collapse of its western side, (3) formation of the eastern shield perhaps by some explosive eruptions, and (4) collapse of the smaller caldera. [36] The topographic and structural characteristics of the shields and calderas can help to correlate of events at the caldera complex with some larger-scale events in the history of Alba Patera. In the topographic profiles across the caldera complex, it is seen that the floor of the larger caldera is tilted to the east (Figure 31a) parallel to the inclination of the summit dome of Alba (Figure 28). This suggests that the larger caldera was formed before the tilting of the dome. In contrast, shield B (Figure 31a) and the floor of the smaller caldera appear to be horizontal (Figure 31b) suggesting that these features were formed after the tilt of the summit dome. [37] Crumpler et al. [1996] surveyed caldera structures and settings on Mars and classified them into two major end-member types: the Olympus type, characterized by nested and overlapping sets of collapse craters; and the Arsia type, characterized by broad, concave, relatively shallow depressions with sag-like margins. Crumpler et al. [1996] placed the Alba Patera caldera in the Arsia-type category, perhaps showing some transitional relationships with the Olympus type. MOLA data show that the outer caldera is indeed the Arsia type (Figures 25c–25f and 30) and that the inner caldera has some of the characteristics of the Olympus type (portions of scalloped, overlapping steep walls) (Figures 25e, 25f, and 30b)."

    "heading": "5.1. Emplacement of Early Lava Apron and Relation to the Vastitas Borealis Formation",
    "text": "[39] An apron surrounding the main construct of Alba Patera consists of sinuous ridges interpreted to be lava flows [Scott and Tanaka, 1986]. The majority of the flows follow the regional topographic gradient to the north and northwest and display a clear contact with an adjacent younger smooth deposit; the boundary is at about the same elevation for thousands of kilometers (Figure 9). A suite of low (tens of meters high), subparallel ridges occur within a broad zone in the northern plains near the contact with the apron (Figures 9 and 10). These ridges are covered by materials of the Hesperian Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF) [Head et al., 2002] and Amazonian Arcadia Formation [Scott and Tanaka, 1986] and have been interpreted as mare-type ridges [Head et al., 2002], similar to the typical features of the Hesperian ridged plains (unit Hr, [Greeley and Spudis, 1981; Tanaka et al., 1992; Head et al., 2002]). These ridges are rare within the lava flow apron and those that are visible appear to be embayed by apron lava flows (Figure 10). Thus the lava flows of the apron cover the ridges and the flows therefore formed after both emplacement and deformation of the Hesperian ridged plains (Figure 32). According to the regional geological map [Scott and Tanaka, 1986], the lava flows of the apron are not in contact with the materials of VBF; thus the exact time relationships between the apron and VBF cannot be directly determined. The stratigraphic relationships described here and by Head et al. [2002], however, place both the apron and the VBF after the regional plains and their deformation by wrinkle ridges. Materials of the Arcadia Formation clearly postdate and embay the apron (Figures 12 and 32).\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n19 of 31\nE09003\n[40] An important characteristic of the apron is that its lower contact follows a relatively smooth line (Figure 9). In contrast, if one outlines the lava flows from the steeper western lobe of Alba Patera superposed on the more horizontal surface of the apron (Figure 17) the resulting boundary is sinuous. There are several possible explanations for the smoothness of the distal boundary of the apron. First, the magma supply during its formation was such that the flows reached a common distal length and thus collectively formed the smooth edge of the apron. This is the simplest but perhaps the most unlikely explanation because it requires unusually consistent conditions of magma supply during the eruption of many individual lava flows. [41] A second possibility is that the outer boundary of the apron may correspond to a consistent break in slope in the underlying topography from a shallower slope (within the apron) to a steeper slope (outside of it). In this scenario, as the lavas flowed over the slope break, they preserved a topographic step. Younger materials (for instance, those of the Arcadia Formation) later covered the flows in the northern plains and thus created a regionally smooth contact between the apron and surrounding plains. The difficulties with this explanation are that (1) the topographic gradient beyond the end of the apron becomes shallower than within it; and (2) the thickness of the younger materials within the northern plains is not sufficient to mask the presence of the mare-type ridges. Thus the typical flow texture of the surface of the apron should be seen through the superposed materials at least near the contact where the superposed layer theoretically pinches out. [42] A third possibility is that the outer edge of the lava apron may correspond to a contact between volatile-poor and volatile-rich materials. The volatile-rich material may have corresponded to deposits of the Vastitas Borealis Formation. There is a growing body of evidence that the VBF may be the residue of a former large-standing body of\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n20 of 31\nE09003\nwater within the northern lowlands [Parker et al., 1989, 1993; Clifford and Parker, 2001; Head et al., 1999; Kreslavsky and Head, 2002; Carr and Head, 2003]. Lava flows that crossed such a boundary may have been disrupted by interaction of the hot lavas with volatile-rich materials, as has been observed in the contact area between the Vastitas Borealis Formation in the western part of the Isidis Basin and superposed lava flows from the eastern part of the Syrtis Major region [Ivanov and Head, 2003]. Such volatile-rich materials, obviously, have to be emplaced and remain on the floor of northern plains prior to the formation of the lava flows forming the apron of Alba Patera. There is some morphological evidence for disrupted lava flows within the northern plains at and near the edge of the apron (M. A. Ivanov and J. W. Head, Volcano-ice interactions in the northern Lowlands of Mars: The Alba Patera northern boundary with the Vastitas Borealis Formation, manuscript in preparation, 2006). [43] Clifford and Parker [2001] have mapped the northeastern edge of the apron as a possible shoreline of the hypothetical northern ocean (Ismenius shoreline) on the basis of the sharp and distinct change of morphology across the apron boundary."

    "heading": "5.2. Changes in Effusive Volcanic Style",
    "text": "[44] The distinctly different topographic signatures of the major parts of the volcanic complex of Alba Patera suggest that eruption conditions during formation of the apron and the main construct were also different. For instance, it may be that the apron was formed by rapid and dispersed eruptions, and the main construct was built by a more concentrated and persistent magma supply at lower rate. This change in volcanic style appears to be supported by volcanic morphology. Within the apron, the flat-topped ridges corresponding to broad lava flows clearly dominate (Figures 4 and 5). Such flows are characteristic features of lava flood provinces, for instance, Columbia River basalt [Hooper, 1988; Self et al., 1997], that were formed at high eruption rates.\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n21 of 31\nE09003\n[45] However, the flood-like lava deposits elsewhere on Mars characteristically lack the channeled flows and lava tubes [Greeley and Spudis, 1981; Plescia, 1990; Wilson and Head, 1994]. Thus the volcanic morphology of the apron is not consistent with the interpretation of a plains-forming lava emplacement. In contrast to the apron, narrow and sharp-crested ridges resembling terrestrial tube-fed flows [Carr et al., 1977; Cattermole, 1986, 1987, 1990] charac-\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n22 of 31\nE09003\nterize the central edifice and the flanking lobes of Alba Patera. The lava tubes and narrow flows are typical features on slopes of large terrestrial volcanoes [e.g., Carr et al., 1977] that are growing by eruptions at relatively low effusion rates [e.g., Lipman, 1995]. We interpret the change of volcanic morphology between the apron and main\nconstruct of Alba Patera as an indicator of changes of both magma supply and eruption rates: The apron formed during vigorous but short-lived eruptions while the main construct grew by steady magma supply at lower rates. Some of the changes in style broadly parallel those seen in Syrtis Major [Hiesinger and Head, 2004] and Syria Planum [Scott and Tanaka, 1986] (Figure 24). [46] The main volcanic construct of Alba Patera consists of three topographic provinces that are characterized by specific distributions of lava flows and are outlined by consistent breaks of slope (Figure 8). The relatively steep northern flank and the shallower southern flank define the central edifice of Alba Patera (Figure 32). The most abundant features there that are clearly seen in the MOLA data are the low, sinuous ridges interpreted to be lava flows and tubes [Greeley and Spudis, 1981; Cattermole, 1990; Hodges and Moore, 1994] (Figures 13 and 14). These features generate the rough topography of the central edifice at the scale of a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers (Figure 14). Flat (smooth) areas at this scale are absent throughout Alba Patera except for the cases where young lava flows fill the valleys between the older flows and tubes (Figure 20). Within the summit dome, flat-topped, sheet-like flows are more common [Cattermole, 1987, 1990]. Thus the final stages of the construction of Alba Patera were characterized by style(s) of eruptions in which the crust on the surface of the flows was continually disrupted [Kilburn, 2000] and lava tubes were not formed (nonsteady and/or short-lived eruptions probably at relatively high rates). These eruptions in the late stages of Alba Patera growth were apparently related to new episodes of volcanism [Wilson et al., 2001] and responsible for formation of the relatively small summit dome.\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n23 of 31\nE09003\n[47] In summary, there is a pronounced change of styles of eruptive volcanism at Alba Patera as a function of time. Large sheet-like flows that are several hundreds of kilometers long (up to about 500 km) and tens of kilometers wide form the lava apron. We interpret these flows to represent lava eruptions characterized by high effusion rates and large volumes of erupted lavas in the beginning of volcanic activity at Alba Patera. The flow texture of the apron is, however, dissimilar to the morphology of large lava plains on Mars such as Syrtis Major, Hesperia Planum, Lunae Planum, etc., on the surface of which individual flows are rare or absent [Greeley and Spudis, 1981; Schaber, 1982]. This suggests that volcanism during formation of the apron was not as voluminous as the plains-forming volcanism. Later in the history of Alba Patera, large lava tubes that may reachmany hundreds of kilometers in length [Carr et al., 1977; Cattermole, 1990; Wilson and Head, 1994] played a major role in the growth of the central edifice of Alba Patera and its flanking lobes. Lava tubes appear to be absent within the summit area of Alba Patera where sheet flows are the dominant features. These sheet flows comprise the summit dome and the amount of lava erupted was distinctly smaller than during formation of the apron (Table 1)."

    "heading": "5.3. Valley Networks: Origin and Implication for Eruption Conditions",
    "text": "[48] Small dendritic valley networks are locally draped over the surface of lava flows and tubes on the northern slope\nof the central edifice and within the flanking lobes as well [Gulick and Baker, 1990; Baker et al., 1992] (Figures 15, 20, and 21a). These networks have been cited as evidence for the presence a material that would be easily eroded by fluvial activity on slopes of Alba Patera [Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]. A good candidate for such material on Mars would be a fine-grained pyroclastic deposit [e.g., Wilson and Head, 1994], which in turn requires episodes of explosive activity at Alba Patera. Mouginis-Mark et al. [1988] suggested that volcanic activity at Alba Patera began with explosive eruptions and later changed to effusive volcanism. [49] Two features that characterize the distribution of the small valley networks may be important in assessing the\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n24 of 31\nE09003\npossible presence of pyroclastic deposits on the slopes of Alba Patera. First, locally, the distribution of valley networks is controlled by preexisting topography generated by older lava flows (Figures 16 and 20). This implies that the hypothesized easily eroded material cut by the valley networks was deposited subsequent to the construction of much of the central edifice and the flanking lobes. Second, the small valley networks preferentially occur on the northward slopes of Alba Patera and are distinctly less abundant on the southern slopes (Figure 21). This suggests that either the friable material was not deposited on the southern slopes, or the eroding agent was preferentially acting on the northern slopes, or both. [50] Another important characteristic of the valley networks is that they are concentrated on the steeper slopes of either the central edifice or the flanking lobes and are not observed within the more horizontal lava apron (Figure 16) suggesting that regional-scale variations in topography may have played an important role in the formation of the networks. Among the possible explanations are (1) the water supply eroding the valley networks was insufficient to produce sustained flow that could continue into the lowsloped region, or (2) the slopes caused a difference in the flow character, with water soaking into the ground and not cutting channels because of the change in topographic gradient (from about 1.3 to about 0.2 ). [51] Specific evidence for early explosive eruptions appears to be absent at Alba Patera in Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey data. If explosive volcanism had indeed occurred during the early formation of Alba Patera, the morphologically recognizable deposits of this volcanism have been completely covered by later lava flows. The absence of broad, smooth areas that could be interpreted as volcanic airfall deposits also does not favor a major role for explosive activity during the more recent eruptions at Alba Patera. In some places, the valley networks are partly covered by the youngest lava flows emanating from vents at the summit dome of Alba Patera (Figure 20). Thus if the small valley networks reflect the presence of pyroclastic material (and therefore explosive eruptions), this style of volcanism probably occurred near the end of volcanic activity at Alba Patera when most of the main construct of the volcano was in place but before the eruptive activity at the summit area (Figure 32).\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n25 of 31\nE09003\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n26 of 31\nE09003\n[52] An alternative view is that proposed friable material may not be of pyroclastic origin. Recent high-resolution topography data have shown evidence for a young finegrained, ice-rich, meter-thick mantle covering the surface of Mars from polar latitudes down to about 30 latitude [e.g., Kreslavsky and Head, 2000, 2002; Mustard et al., 2001; Carr, 2001; Head et al., 2003]. This layer is interpreted to be an ice-rich dust deposit emplaced during periods of enhanced obliquity in the recent history of Mars [e.g., Mustard et al., 2001;Head et al., 2003]. This deposit thinlymantles the Alba Patera region (30–60 N latitude) and currently is undergoing desiccation and partial removal. This scenario provides an alternative interpretation for the formation of valley networks on Alba Patera. We propose that instead of a pyroclastic deposit, a layer of ice-rich friable material was emplaced prior to valley network formation. [53] Atmospheric modeling suggests that during periods of high obliquity, water ice is transported from the polar regions to lower latitudes [Richardson and Wilson, 2002; Haberle et al., 2003]. Furthermore, the northern slopes of Tharsis and Alba Patera construct are the first topographic highs encountered by atmospheric water and dust transported southward from the north Polar region. Thus in our favored scenario, upwelling and adiabatic cooling and precipitation of dust-nucleated ice would preferentially form a volatile-rich deposit on the northern slopes of the volcano. The present distribution of water ice clouds in the atmosphere [e.g., Benson et al., 2003] and their predicted behavior in the past [Forget et al., 2006] supports this hypothesis. Following deposition of this ice-rich dust, warmer climatic conditions (perhaps combined with geothermal heat [Gulick and Baker, 1990; Fassett and Head, 2006]) would cause the ice to melt and produce the observed valley networks, in a manner similar to that described by Costard et al. [2002] for Martian gullies or valley networks [e.g., Gulick and Baker, 1990; Fassett and Head, 2006]. This scenario is further supported by the Mars Odyssey neutron spectrometer data that show waterequivalent hydrogen abundances of about 8 wt.% preferentially on the northern flank of Alba Patera [e.g., Feldman et al., 2002], suggesting that some ice-rich material may still remain at shallow depths. [54] This alternative hypothesis (1) links the ice-rich nature of the easily eroded material with the valley networks (melting of ice), rather than requiring separate events (pyroclastic deposits and precipitation-induced valley networks), (2) explains the preferential location of the deposit and valley networks on the northern flanks of Alba Patera, and (3) may account for the limited downslope extent of the valley networks because the total amount of melting is constrained by the small thickness of the deposit itself. When the ice-rich deposit began to melt by insolation [e.g., Costard et al., 2002] or geothermal heat [e.g., Gulick and Baker, 1990; Fassett and Head, 2006] the runoff was areally limited, as observed. [55] In summary, the new topography data show the distinctive morphological character of lava flows over the whole of the edifice surface (Figures 4, 17, 18, and 25) and suggest that if pyroclastic volcanism dominated the eruption style of Alba during some phase of its history, (1) it must have been very early and is now completely covered with lava flows, and/or (2) it occurred as a relatively minor phase at an intermediate-late period in the history of Alba Patera (Figure 32)."

    "heading": "5.4. Flanking Lava Lobes and Geometry of Lava Emplacement",
    "text": "[56] The main volcanic construct of Alba Patera as a whole is on the broad flank of the Tharsis Rise, which is tilted northward at a steady slope of about 0.2 (Figure 7). This may be an important factor that exerted control on the growth of Alba Patera. The main construct of the volcano is distinctly elongated in the W-E direction because of the presence of the flanking lobes at the western and eastern sides of the central edifice (Figures 6d and 7b–7g). The lobes are probably relatively young features because their shape appears to be controlled by the presence of the central edifice of Alba Patera. On the basis of their overall shape and the distribution of lava flows, the flanking lobes of Alba resemble similar structures at the Tharsis Montes (Figure 22) that are thought to be formed by unidirectional lateral propagation of magma from the source within the central constructs of the Montes [McGovern and Solomon, 1993; Wilson and Head, 1994]. The nature of the distribution of lava flows at the crest of the western flanking lobe also resembles that at the southwestern rift zone of Mauna Loa volcano, Hawaii [Hodges and Moore, 1994]. [57] If the flanking lobes are indeed analogs to the rift zones of the Tharsis Montes and Mauna Loa then their formation during the middle stages of evolution of Alba Patera could be dictated by the regional topographic setting of Alba Patera. The volcano is superposed on both the ancient topographic ridge of Ceraunius Fossae (Figures 6e– 6g) and on the broad flank of the Tharsis Rise sloping to the north and northwest (Figures 6e–6g and 7). We propose that as the central edifice of Alba Patera grew, it was subjected to more and more tensile stress generated by loading on the northward slope of the Tharsis Rise. The distribution of these stresses was anisotropic because of the regional topographic setting of Alba Patera. The high and broad meridional topographic ridge of Ceraunius Fossae may have served as an important obstacle that fixed the position of the central edifice and inhibited its spreading in the W-E direction. In contrast, the regional northern slope on which the central edifice is situated is predicted to be responsible for the preferential N-S orientation of extensional stresses facilitating the gravitational spreading of the central edifice in a northerly direction. This anisotropy in the stress distribution may have led to a major reorientation of dike propagation within the edifice [Wilson and Head, 1994]. New batches of magma were emplaced as dikes preferentially in the W-E direction creating the flanking lobes on the western and eastern sides of the central edifice. [58] This scenario is supported by the observation that all three Tharsis Montes have flanking lobes on the opposite sides of their central edifices (Figures 22 and 23). The lobes of the Montes are aligned along the same northeastern line corresponding to the major break of slope between the flat interior of the Tharsis Rise and its western flank (Figures 22 and 23). In contrast, the large volcano Elysium Mons, situated on a broader, flatter rise (Figure 23), does not display lobe-like features on its flanks (Figure 24). Thus characteristics of the topographic background (specifically, the distribution of regional slopes) has apparently played a\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n27 of 31\nE09003\nmajor role in the formation of the lobe-like features on the opposite flanks of the Tharsis Montes and Alba Patera. [59] In contrast to the Tharsis Montes where the lobes are significantly lower than the central construct (Figures 22 and 23), the lobes at Alba Patera are almost as tall as the central edifice (Figure 6d). This suggests that the magma reservoir feeding the lobes at Alba Patera was at a relatively high topographic level as the lobes were formed and that the neutral buoyancy zone was close to the surface [Ryan, 1987;Wilson et al., 1992; Head and Wilson, 1992; Wilson and Head, 2002]."

    "heading": "5.5. Emplacement and Tilting of the Summit Dome",
    "text": "[60] During the later stages of volcanism at Alba Patera (Figure 32), the summit dome, which is a few hundred kilometers across and about two kilometers high, was formed within the flat and broad summit plateau of Alba Patera (Figure 25). An important characteristic of the distribution of the flows is the general radial symmetry around the top of the dome [Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988; Cattermole, 1987] (Figure 26). In contrast, the topographic configuration of the dome and the whole summit plateau as well is characterized by a distinct tilt in the east direction (Figure 6d) at an angle of about 0.2 . This striking difference between the symmetric distribution of lava flows around the summit dome and the asymmetric topography of the summit area of Alba Patera strongly suggests that the summit dome was tilted after its formation and after the emplacement of the youngest lava flows on its flanks. In addition, removing the regional tilt also renders the dome’s flank slopes symmetric, with both the eastern and western flanks sloping away from the summit at 0.9 (Figure 28). This provides additional evidence for the tilting of the initially symmetric volcanic construct that was characterized by the symmetric distribution of lava flows around it. [61] The latest episodes of volcanic evolution of Alba Patera (Figure 32) are related to the formation of the complex of nested calderas and the small volcanic shields at the top of the summit dome (Figures 25 and 29). Superposition relationships imply that shield A was emplaced first on the western flank of the summit dome and then its eastern flank was cut by the western wall of the larger caldera. Caldera morphology suggests that it was formed by sagging and that its western portion collapsed in the manner of a trapdoor caldera. The actual floor of the caldera is tilted to the east in parallel with the tilt of the summit dome (Figure 31a). This means that the caldera was formed during earlier stages of the evolution of the summit dome, before it was tilted. The larger caldera contains shield B and the smaller caldera. Shield B (Figure 30b) is superposed on the floor of the larger caldera and is topped with an unusual circular feature 10 km across that was interpreted as the possible vent of explosive eruptions at Alba [Mouginis-Mark et al., 1988]. If this feature is indeed related to explosive eruptions, then they must have occurred during the very last phases of the volcanic evolution of Alba Patera. [62] The apparently youngest volcanic feature of Alba Patera is the smaller (southern) caldera (Figures 25e–25f, 29, and 30b) that is nested within the larger one and outlined by a prominent wall. An important characteristic of this caldera is that its floor appears to be essentially horizontal (Figure 31b) whereas the floor of the larger (older) caldera is tilted to the east in parallel to the tilt of the summit dome\n(Figure 31a), suggesting that the smaller (younger) caldera formedwhen the summit domewas already tilted (Figure 32)."

    "text": "[63] The summit area of Alba Patera volcano is outlined by graben of Alba Fossae and Tantalus Fossae (Figures 2 and 25a–25c). Although the history of development of the graben systems in the broad region of Alba is complex and multistaged [Figure 3b; Tanaka, 1990], the most abundant tectonic features readily observed were formed relatively late in the history of the volcano (fault stage III, early Amazonian [Tanaka, 1990]). The graben related to this stage cut the lava flows from the summit dome and thus postdate formation of the dome (Figures 19, 27a, and 27b). [64] Several models have been proposed to relate the formation of the graben zones to the evolution of the volcanic system of Alba Patera as a whole [Turtle and Melosh, 1997; McGovern et al., 2001; Cailleau et al., 2003]. Turtle and Melosh [1997] explain the circumferential graben of Alba and Tantalus Fossae by the load of the volcano on the lithosphere. The shape of Alba Patera is such, however, that the graben swarms are high on its slopes, and their formation in the lithosphere due to load of the main construct of Alba Patera therefore appears to be unlikely. Alternatively, the formation of the graben systems may be explained by intralithospheric magmatic intrusions (sills) [McGovern et al., 2001].Cailleau et al. [2003] propose that the graben systems of Alba Fossae and Tantalus Fossae can be explained by local crustal subsidence due to cooling and lowering of the central magma reservoir interacting with the regional-scale stresses at the northern flank of Tharsis. Neither model apparently takes into account the presence of a large constructional domewithin the summit area of Alba and the striking difference in number and spacing of graben on both sides of the summit plateau. [65] Models of graben formation need to account for characteristics of the Alba Fossae and Tantalus Fossae graben zones revealed or clarified by new data. First, the zone of Tantalus Fossae is much broader (a few hundreds of kilometers) than the zone of Alba Fossae (a few tens of kilometers). Second, the graben of Alba Fossae are more arcuate in plan view than the structures of Tantalus Fossae. Third, the graben of Alba Fossae are preferentially concentrated in a narrow zone along the slope break outlining the summit plateau of Alba from the west and within the plateau itself. Fourth, the graben in both zones appear to be among the youngest features at Alba Patera, postdating even the construction of the central dome. [66] These characteristics are consistent with the hypothesis that the majority of the Alba Fossae graben formed as a response to the loading of the summit dome on the summit plateau and to the solidification of the related magma reservoir [Walker, 1984, 1988]. The much wider and prominent zone of Tantalus Fossae may represent the long-lived main tectonic zone that existed before formation of Alba Patera and experienced several stages of evolution during the time span from Noachian to Amazonian [e.g., Tanaka, 1990]. It may have been reactivated in the relatively recent history of Alba Patera because of the loading of the summit dome. Because of the difference in elevation between the western and eastern edges of the summit area (about 1.5 km), the whole summit of Alba Patera is tilted to the\nE09003 IVANOV AND HEAD: ALBA PATERA, MARS\n28 of 31\nE09003\neast at an angle of about 0.2 . If the summit area were horizontal initially, formation of such a tilt would require an elongation of the slope of the eastern flanking lobe. The different displacements along multiple faults of the Tantalus Fossae zone may have accommodated this elongation. The tilting is then likely to be due to the formation of late graben due to the load of the summit dome together with subsidence due to cooling of the magma reservoir. [67] On the basis of our mapping and this previous work, we offer the following synthesis. Closely spaced and overlapping Noachian–early Hesperian aged graben extending northward from the central part of Tharsis (Syria Planum) form a topographic high that underpins the later construction of the Alba Patera edifice (stage I– II of Tanaka [1990]). Evidence for flows emanating from graben of this age lead to the conclusion that many of them represent the surface manifestation of lateral dike emplacement from magma reservoirs further to the south in central Tharsis [e.g., Mege and Masson, 1996]. The change in orientation of the graben from N-S to NE-SW, parallel to the adjacent structure of Tempe Fossae, suggests that they responded to the same regional stress field in northern Tharsis. In the late Hesperian–early Amazonian, graben formation continued along these orientations and the majority of the circum– Alba Patera features formed (stage III of Tanaka [1990]). These include both the radial graben of Ceraunius that penetrate into the edifice, indicating that they were forming concurrently with main edifice formation (probably representing dike-related graben feeding eruptions forming the edifice), and the concentric radial graben of Alba and Tantalus Fossae representing the later-stage subsidence and deformation of the edifice. The summit dome of Alba Patera contains E-W-trending wrinkle ridges, interpreted to be contractional features formed by the subsidence of the summit dome from a combination of loading and late-stage reservoir cooling. Finally, a late-stage set of graben (stage IV of Tanaka [1990]), many of which contain pit craters (Figure 21), are interpreted to represent the surface manifestation of dikes from a source to the south in central Tharsis [e.g., Scott et al., 2002]. Pits may be related to explosive venting of gas above dikes [Scott and Wilson, 2002], or to dilational fault slip along the graben [Ferill et al., 2004]."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "[68] Alba Patera, situated on the northern edge of the Tharsis rise, is the northernmost of the large Martian shield volcanoes, and has been interpreted to be a transitional construct between the low Noachian-Hesperian aged paterae (involving significant pyroclastic activity), and the steepersided Hesperian-Amazonian aged constructs such as the Tharsis Montes. Using new spacecraft data, we show that slope breaks and patterns of lava flow distribution permit the subdivision of Alba Patera into two major provinces: (1) a low-lying apron of lava flows that broadly surrounds the edifice and (2) a higher-standing main construct. The main construct can be further subdivided into (1) a central edifice, (2) western and eastern flanking lobes, and (3) a summit area consisting of a summit plateau and a summit dome topped by a caldera complex. These features and relationships reveal that volcanic activity in the Alba Patera region began as large effusive eruptions that formed the broad\napron of lava flows. Subsequently, more focused effusive eruptions began to build the central construct of the volcano on the broad northern flank of the Tharsis Rise. As the central construct grew, it began to spread gravitationally in a northerly direction toward the northern lowlands, andmagma from the central reservoir began to propagate as dikes preferentially in the W-E direction, leading to the formation of TharsisMontes-like flanking lobes. The final stages of volcanic activity at Alba were concentrated in the summit area and resulted in the formation of the 400 km diameter summit dome and a caldera complex, which underwent late-stage tilting and deformation. The load of the newly documented summit dome may have led to the development of the graben of Alba Fossae, the reactivation of graben within Tantalus Fossae, and the tilting of the summit dome. The total volume of effusive deposits forming Alba Patera is estimated to be 2.4–2.6 106 km3 (Table 1). A clear sequence in eruptive style is observed with early massive sheet flows up to 1000 km in length forming the edifice apron, later tube-fed flows characterizing the central edifice and the flanking lobes, and late, shorter-length and lower-volume sheet flows dominating the summit dome. [69] The presence of dendritic valley networks on the northern flanks of Alba Patera has been interpreted to be evidence of easily erodable material of pyroclastic origin. However, no specific evidence of pyroclastic deposits has been detected. The source of the friable material may be slope-related atmospheric emplacement of ice-rich dust deposits related to Amazonian climate excursions. The lack of evidence for extensive pyroclastic activity decreases the similarities of Alba Patera with the Hesperian-aged paterae. Instead, the extensive apron of lava flows, combined with the flanking lava lobes and the Tharsis-Montes-scale summit dome, make Alba Patera much more similar to the Tharsis Montes than to the Hesperian-aged paterae. Unlike the Tharsis Montes, however, Alba Patera was characterized by a final phase of extensive central effusive eruptions that built the major summit edifice. The absolute dominance of lava flows, buried and exposed, throughout the Alba Patera region suggests that volcanism there was primarily effusive. Stratigraphic relationships show that the Alba Patera lava apron was emplaced on early Hesperian ridged plains during the middle to late Hesperian, and strongly suggest that lava flows from Alba Patera may have interacted with ice-rich deposits in the northern lowlands (Vastitas Borealis Formation), thereby explaining the remarkably smooth northern contact between Alba Patera deposits and the northern plains. Alba Patera flanking lobes and the summit dome were emplaced in the earliest Amazonian, accompanied by late-stage loading, graben formation, and edifice tilting.\n[70] Acknowledgments.

The major and consistent breaks of slope and the specific pattern of lava flows within a broad region around Alba Patera permit division of this area into two major parts that appear to be related to different episodes of volcanism at Alba Patera: a low-lying apron of lava flows that broadly surrounds the edifice, a high-standing main construct, consisting of a central edifice, western and eastern flanking lobes, and a summit area characterized by a summit plateau and a summit dome topped by a caldera complex. Volcanic activity apparently began as massive effusive eruptions that formed the broad apron of lava flows, followed by more focused effusive eruptions that built the central construct.
