    "text": "The Miocene borate deposits of western Turkey are associated with extensive medium- to high-K calc-alkali ignimbritic volcanism and a differentiated comagmatic alkaline trachybasalt–trachydacite lava suite. Ignimbritic air-fall and reworked pumiceous clastic materials are intimately associated with lake sediments that host the borate deposits. Local ignimbritic volcanism is considered the primary source of the B for the Kirka borate deposit in this area. Comparison of the geochemical Ž .

Other apparent discriminants involving both compatible and incompatible elements relative to .major silicate phases are largely a function of different degrees of partial melting and fractionation. It is suggested that the Ž .initial source of the B and other associated elements was from LIL-rich fluids released by the progressive dehydration of altered oceanic crust and pelagic sediments in a subduction zone. The absence or presence of sediments in a segmented subduction zone may influence the variable lateral distribution of borates in active margins on a global scale. Once the crust has become enriched in B via previous or contemporary subduction-related calc-alkali magmatism, the effect of tectonic environment, climate and hydrothermal activity influence the local development of the deposits. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.\nKeywords: ignimbrites; geochemical discrimination; boron; borates; Turkey"

Borate Ž .minerals colemanite, ulexite, borax etc. are the Ž .major source of commercial boron B and are largely concentrated in continental Tertiary deposits of westŽ .ern Anatolia Turkey and the American continent Ž . Že.g. western USA, central Andes Helvacı, 1978; Kistler and Smith, 1983; Alonso et al., 1988, 1991; .Helvacı et al., 1993 .\n0375-6742r98r$19.00q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. Ž .PII S0375-6742 97 00047-2\nApart from the restricted range of environmental and tectonic conditions under which Tertiary borate deposits accumulated, one other consistent feature is their close geological association with volcanogenic rocks. It has long been believed that borate deposits may be genetically related to volcanic activity especially in the light of associated boron-rich thermal Žwaters and boric acid-bearing steam fumaroles e.g. Foshag, 1921; Clarke, 1924; Gale, 1964; Jensen and .Bateman, 1981 . In particular, the borate deposits of western Turkey are closely associated in space and Žtime with Miocene tuffs and lavas Helvacı et al., .1993; Helvacı, 1995 . While both lavas and tuffs\ncommonly surround the borate-bearing playa deposits, it is the tuffs that appear to be consistently interbedded with the borates or constitute a major component of bedded epiclastic materials. The source of the boron is thus often linked to this volcanic activity via the agency of hydrothermally generated B-rich springs that mix with the playa waters and Žprecipitate borates e.g. Inan et al., 1973; Helvacı, .1995 ."

    "text": "The object of this work is to test the presumed relationship by examining the chemical composition of silicic volcanic rocks which occur in the vicinity of a known borate deposit, such as the Kirka borax Ždeposit, near Afyon, central Anatolia, Turkey Fig. .1 . If it is possible to geochemically fingerprint or\ndifferentiate volcanic rocks associated with borates Ž .termed ‘fertile’ volcanics from those without Ž .termed ‘barren’ volcanics this feature might prove to be useful in the exploration of large silicic volcanic provinces as to their potential for borate deposits. Previous geochemical work has largely concentrated on the borate minerals themselves and the volcaniclastic rocks intimately associated and inŽterbedded with the borates e.g. Inan et al., 1973; .Castor, 1993; Helvacı et al., 1993; Helvacı, 1995 .\nHowever, these volcanic rocks have been invariably penetrated by migrating B-rich hydrothermal solutions such that high concentrations of B and other Ž .associated mobile elements As, Li, Sr; Castor, 1993 are to be expected, the host rock having been effectively metasomatized and mineralized. However, we\nare concerned with the volcanic suite as a whole and suggest that if the B in the deposits is genetically related to the volcanic rocks, then they may display a distinctive geochemical signature overall, as well as being specifically enriched in B. Preliminary data suggest that this may indeed be the case in Turkey Ž .Anderson et al., 1995; Floyd et al., 1995 . This proposal is based on the assumption that the volcanics have a special composition governed largely by their genesis and that subsequent borate deposition reflects a later mobilization and enrichment Žcaused by essentially secondary processes such as .hydrothermal activity and evaporation . The tectonic\nenvironment within which the volcanics initially developed may also play an important part in the generation of their specific geochemical characteristics.\nIn order to test the above proposition a number of volcanic rocks were analysed that are associated with borates from western Turkey, but to avoid contamination by mineralization all samples were collected )10 km away from the actual deposits themselves. The Turkish data set includes compositionally variŽ .able Miocene volcanics lavas and tuffs that stratigraphically span one of the main commercial borate Ž .deposits at Kirka see below, and Fig. 1 . In particuŽ .lar, the Kirka tuffs the ‘fertile’ group are compared\nwith lithologically similar tuffs from central Anatolia Ž .that do not host borates the ‘barren’ group . A third\nset of tuffs that are associated with borate mineralŽization from other parts of the world Samos, Greece;\nNevada, USA; Tincopalca region, Peru; Tujuy and .Salta provinces, Argentina have also been analysed\nto see if similar geochemical characteristics are displayed as the ‘fertile’ Kirka tuffs. However, as the data set for this last group is small and geographically restricted, attempts to provide a satisfactory global discrimination at this stage must be considered preliminary and premature. Representative analŽyses are shown in Table 1 ignimbrites associated . Žwith borates, Kirka deposits, Turkey , Table 2 Kirka . Žalkalic lavas , Table 3 ignimbrites associated with . Žselected borate deposits , and Table 4 central Anato.lian ignimbrites not associated with borate deposits . All samples were analysed for major oxides and Ž .most trace elements at the University of Keele UK using an ARL 8420 X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, calibrated against both international and within-house\nŽgeostandards analytical method and precision in .Floyd and Castillo, 1992 .

    "text": "The economic borate deposits of western Turkey are situated in five districts, Bigadic, Emet, Kestelek, Kirka and Sultancayiri, and are geologically bounded within a series of Tertiary NE–SW-trending rift Ž .basins or half-grabens Fig. 1 . The deposits were all formed during the Miocene in a lacustrine environment in which B is thought to have been enriched by the activity of geothermal springs. The borate deposits formed by evaporation in shallow playa lakes Ž .Helvacı, 1995; Helvacı and Yagmurlu, 1995 . Although each locality shows differences in detail, the Kirka succession is typical, with borates intimately interbedded with and penetrating marls, claystones Ž .and zeolitized volcanic tuff Helvacı et al., 1993 . In addition to tuffaceous epiclastic material in the lacustrine sedimentary rocks, the main volcanic components in the Kirka succession sandwich the borate Ž .horizons Fig. 1 . The volcanic rocks comprise three Ž .groups: a lower unit of a intermediate lavas Ž .penecontemporaneous with b voluminous tuffs, and Ž .an upper unit of c basaltic lavas. Tuffs and tra-\nchytic lavas from the lower unit have similar K–Ar Žbiotite ages tuffs 19.0\"0.2 Ma and lavas 18.5\"0.2 .Ma , whereas the upper basalts are clearly younger Ž . Ž .16.1\"0.2 Ma; K-feldspar Helvacı, 1995 . Field, sedimentological and petrographic evidence link the tuffaceous epiclastic material in the lake sediments with the voluminous tuffs surrounding the borate deposits, and suggest that volcanism was largely contemporaneous with borate formation. For example, a characteristic feature of the tuffs are ubiquitous dark quartz clasts that are also a common feature of Ž .ash-fall and reworked deposits interbedded with lake epiclastic sediments. Further details of the stratigraphy, lithologies and depositional models for the Kirka and associated deposits in western AnatoŽ .lia are given in Inan et al. 1973 , Helvacı et al. Ž . Ž .1993 , Helvacı and Yagmurlu 1995 , and Helvacı Ž .1995 .\nThe non-Turkish ‘fertile’ tuffs also show stratigraphic association with tuffaceous materials both within and surrounding the depositional lake environments. For example, the Late Miocene Samos Ž .deposits Greece are found in tuffs that form part of a saline–alkaline lacustrine sequence of claystones Žand limestones Stamatakis, 1989; Helvacı et al., .1993 .

    "text": "This comprises various thick lava flows dominated mainly by basaltic trachyandesites and trachy-\ndacites. The trachyandesite members are often highly Ž .porphyritic up to 20% phenocrysts and are charac-\nterised by numerous small granular-textured trachytic inclusions. The typical phenocryst assemblage is composed of large zoned plagioclases, diopsidic clinopyroxene and red-brown amphibole and biotite set in a fine-grained felsic matrix. Large plagioclases are generally zoned and may display internal thermal dissolution surfaces truncating the generally regular zonation. Some may also display rounded and corroded margins rather than euhedral outlines and, in rare cases, enclose inclusions of glass. Both amphibole and biotite are strongly pleochroic from yellow to deep red and invariably show magmatically corroded margins peppered with minute opaque granules. Pale green pyroxene forms long prismatic subhedral phenocrysts, but is more granular in the matrix. Apatite is a common accessory mineral. Large composite, stressed, irregular quartz grains probably represent xenocrysts derived from the local basement, rather than juvenile phenocrysts. The most mafic rocks in the suite are vesicular olivine–clinopyroxene–phyric trachybasalts, the more evolved members of which contain minor biotite in the granular matrix. The olivine phenocrysts are generally oxidized or altered to smectitic clays; some clinopyroxenes are zoned.\nIn the Afyon area just south of Kirka, more acidic Ž .rock types trachyandesite and trachydacite charac-\nterize the earliest representatives of the alkaline suite, Ž .whereas the more basic lavas trachybasalt are gen-\nerally later in the succession capping the Miocene Ž .lake sediments Fig. 1 . A similar magmatic se-\nquence is recorded in the nearby Bigadic borate Ž .province Helvacı, 1995 where the least evolved\nmembers of the alkalic suite erupted last following borate formation."

    "text": "Although often referred to simply as ‘tuffs’ in previous literature, these regionally important volcanic deposits are the products of a series of ignimbrite eruptions. Most exposures are composed of the upper pumice-rich layer 2b of a characteristic Ž .ignimbrite section Sparks et al., 1973 with relaŽtively small amounts of lithics basement-derived .argillites, quartzites, schists being present. Well-be-\ndded Plinian deposits exhibiting reverse graded pumice layers are present, although base surge deposits have not been identified. In the field, the ignimbrites are characterised by numerous small Ž .crystals feldspar and black quartz and elongate Žbrownish pumice clasts from a few mm to 100 mm .in length which often are aligned and partly flattened although the flows are not welded. The black quartz crystals observed in the ignimbrites are also a significant and readily identifiable component of the pumice-rich epiclastic lake deposits that host the Kirka borates. The distinctive colouration of the quartz is not due to any secondary coating of the grains, but is probably a consequence of irradiation Ž .Deer et al., 1963 ; under the microscope many grains have a cloudy appearance due to minute solid inclusions not dissimilar to U- and Th-enriched, Ž .inclusion-bearing calcite Williams and Floyd, 1981 . The ignimbrites are dominantly crystal–vitric tuffs Ž .with a very minor lithic component about 1% that is composed of basement lithologies and quenched vitric rhyolites. In thin section the ignimbrites exhibit a fine-grained, glassy, but variably recrystallized, granular matrix, and abundant flattened and conŽ .torted but not welded pumice clasts, some of which contain quartz and feldspar phenocrysts. The overall crystal component of the ignimbrites is similar to that found in the pumice, being largely embayed quartz and plagioclase, but with the addition of dark biotite and some K-feldspar."

Rep-\nresentative samples from other borate locations in western Turkey show a fuller range of compositions Žfor the alkaline suite unlike the apparently bimodal .distribution at Kirka , and the ignimbrites also inŽclude some dacitic compositions e.g. around the .Bigadic deposits; Helvacı, 1995 . Trace element\nŽ .compositions are also distinctive Figs. 3 and 4 ; again data from other locations extends the alkali suite range to lower Nb, Zr, and Ba values. Rare Ž . Ž .earth element REE patterns Fig. 4 show the typical enrichment of light REE for the alkalic suite, whereas the ignimbrite pattern, with a large negative Eu anomaly, is characteristic for the involvement of feldspar in their genesis. The trace element trends and parallel REE patterns indicate that the Kirka alkali lavas represent a single comagmatic differentiated suite influenced by the fractionation of mainly olivine, pyroxene and minor feldspar.\nThere is no genetic relationship between the two magmatic groups at Kirka, although in terms of the initial volcanic source of the B for the borate deposits, both can show high B values. Very high Ž .values range 700–1400 ppm B are recorded for\nsome members of the alkalic suite at Bigadic, which probably reflect local hydrothermal contamination, as additional data for Emet and Kirka only average Ž .58 ppm B Helvacı, 1995 .

Further classification of the ignimbrites, utilizing\nthe chemical discrimination of their tectonic environment, shows that the Kirka ‘fertile’ ignimbrites have characteristics comparable with typical A-type and Ž .within-plate granitoids Fig. 6 , and in this sense differ from the control group of ‘barren’ ignimbrites from elsewhere in Turkey.\nOne additional feature concerning ignimbrite alteration is the degree to which post-depositional effects can influence, and in particular enhance, the abundance of potentially mineralizing elements such as B in any ignimbrite. The total ‘loss-on-ignition’ Ž .LOI can be used as an approximate measure of the Ždegree of alteration, whose range generally 0–7 .wt.% indicates that secondary alteration is a comŽmon feature amongst the ignimbrites sampled Ta.bles 1 and 3 . However, as illustrated in Fig. 7, with\nthe exception of some non-Turkish ‘fertile’ ignimbrites, the distribution of B or As is not markedly influenced by the degree of alteration; the Kirka ‘fertile’ ignimbrites are systematically enhanced in B and As relative to the ‘barren’ ignimbrites at all levels of LOI."

    "text": "As noted above, the Kirka ignimbrites are considered to be the primary source of B as they are relatively B-rich throughout and closely associated in time and space with the lacustrine-developed borate deposits. In this section we compare their trace element characteristics with a control group of lithoŽ .logically similar ignimbrites ‘barren’ ignimbrites\nŽfrom central Anatolia, Turkey Yurtmen, 1993; .Kuscu, 1997 , together with a small selection of\nignimbrites that are closely associated with borate Ž . Ždeposits ‘fertile’ ignimbrites from elsewhere e.g. .Samos, Nevada, central Andes . Trace element diagrams have been constructed to\ncharacterize and compare the ‘fertile’ and ‘barren’ groups of ignimbrites.\n( )6.1. B and associated mobile elements Fig. 8\nB is a highly incompatible element and is reported to be mobile along with Be, Li, As, Pb, and Sb in the subduction environment where calc-alkaline melts Žcan be generated Ryan and Langmuir, 1987, 1993; .Noll et al., 1996 . There is a gross correlation be-\ntween B and As, Li, F and Pb in the sample sets, with varying degrees of enrichment in all these elements in the ‘fertile’ ignimbrites relative to the Ž .‘barren’ group Fig. 8 . In terms of the Turkish data only, high B, As, F and Pb provide a reasonable\ndiscrimination parameter for the ‘fertile’ ignimbrites. However, some of the high values for these elements exhibited by the non-Turkish ‘fertile’ group may be a consequence of hydrothermal enrichment by mineralizing fluids closely associated with the borate deposits themselves. While this is probably not the case for the Kirka group, as all samples were collected well removed and apparently unaffected by the development of the borate deposits, it is recognized that hydrothermal reservoirs can be very large and far-reaching. Thus, subsequent pervasive hydrothermal alteration could negate any suggested primary relationship between the ignimbrites and the borates. However, we consider that enrichment is Ž .primary in the melt source region as the degree of alteration suffered by both the ‘barren’ and ‘fertile’ Ž .groups completely overlap Fig. 7 and is similar, both chemically and mineralogically. It is suggested that the ‘potential’ for borate formation is primarily a consequence of the initial enrichment of the volcanics, followed by near-surface mobility generated by associated circulating hydrothermal solutions.\n( )6.2. Normalized element patterns Fig. 9\nREE patterns between the Turkish sample sets are clearly distinct, whereas multi-element plots only Ž .differ in minor detail Fig. 9 . The Kirka ignimbrites are characterised by relatively ‘flat’ light and heavy REE patterns and a large negative Eu anomaly, which are characteristic of silicic volcanics from Žboth continental interiors and margins Macdonald et .al., 1992 . This pattern differs from the strongly\nfractionated REE patterns of the ‘barren’ group, although again both patterns could be influenced by the differing nature of their sources and degree of melting involved. Both multi-element patterns are characterized by prominent negative anomalies at Sr–P and Eu–Ti. The main discriminatory features Ž . Ž .are a the size of the Eu anomaly, b relative Ž .enrichment of the heavy REE and Y, and c enŽ .hanced Th , in the ‘fertile’ group.N\n( )6.3. Possible discrimination diagrams Fig. 10\nOn the basis of some of the features described above, a degree of discrimination can be achieved\nŽwith the Turkish samples and possibly on the global .scale using the BrK ratio. In the binary diagrams Ž .Fig. 10 , both the KrRb ratio and TiO are used as2 indices reflecting the degree or range of chemical evolution exhibited by the suites; both functions decrease with progressive fractionation. A multi-element diagram normalized against a ‘barren’ ignŽ .imbrite Fig. 10 does not produce a definitive pattern except for the strong positive B–As–Li anomalies generated by ‘fertile’ ignimbrite samples. Better discrimination can be produced by employing simple Žbinary plots involving B with As and Li as in Fig. .8 .\nAt this preliminary stage discrimination can probably be achieved for Turkish ignimbrite samples, but wider global discrimination involving non-Turkish ‘fertile’ ignimbrites is more in doubt.\n7. Effects of magmatic processes on discrimination\nBecause common magmatic processes can cause variation in the absolute abundances of many trace\nŽ .Fig. 10. Binary diagrams top exhibiting possible discrimination of ‘fertile’ ignimbrites with high BrK ratios relative to ‘barren’ analogues. Ž .KrRb and TiO are fractionation indices, indicative of overall suite variation. The multi-element diagram bottom shows the pronounced2 and typical positive B–As–Li anomalies of ‘fertile’ ignimbrites when normalized relative to an average ‘barren’ ignimbrite from central Anatolia.\nelements, ratios are probably more reliable as potential discriminants, although they can also be susceptible to differential effects, such as degree of partial melting and extent or type of fractionational crystallization. Ideally these magmatic effects should be understood so that real chemical differences between ignimbrite groups at about the same degree of magŽ .matic evolution here, broadly silicic can be determined. As seen in Fig. 11, the Kirka ‘fertile’ samŽ .ples are apparently characterized by low CerY ,N ZrrY, KrRb, and Ba, uniform ZrrNb, and high RbrSr and KrLi, which broadly separate them from the Turkish ‘barren’ samples. However, because\nthese ratios can be influenced to varying degrees by magmatic processes they may only reflect the degree of magmatic evolution of the suite, rather than provide useful discrimination. For example, consider the Ž .range in CerY and ZrrY ratios which can beN modelled by variable partial melting and differential Ž .phase fractionation Fig. 11 . Some of the ratio variation within the ‘barren’ ignimbrites could be accounted for by the variable partial melting of a Žlower-crustal garnet-bearing granulite source Kfeldspar –plagioclase –orthopyroxene – clinopyro15 8 10 .xene –quartz –garnet , whereas the Kirka ign-37 20 10 imbrites could represent higher-degree crustal melts\nfrom a different source composition with lower ratios. Note that fractionation of clinopyroxene, hornŽblende and biotite mineral vectors for 60% fraction.ation, Fs0.4; D values from Rollinson, 1993\ncould also account for much of the internal variation of each Turkish group, although not their overall Ž .differences. In other words, the range in CerY N and ZrrY ratios within the Turkish ‘fertile’ and ‘barren’ ignimbrite groups could be accounted for by the variable extent of magmatic processes, although the difference between the groups is largely a function of different source compositions. Modelling sugŽ .gests that variation in the ZrrNb ratio Fig. 11 is not effected by closed-system fractional crystallizaŽtion of major or assessory phases such as zircon, .apatite and the YrNb–ZrrNb linear trend for the\n‘barren’ ignimbrites is more likely a function of variable partial melting coupled with sediment conŽ .tamination PAAS or greywacke . The other diagrams in Fig. 11 that involve variation in ratios of LIL elements are probably the result of differential magmatic differentiation involving mainly felsic and\nmica fractionation and as such are not good discriminants. For example, the trend of a concomitant deŽcrease of KrRb with Ba from ‘barren’ to ‘fertile’ .Turkish ignimbrites is largely a function of progresŽ .sive K-feldspar fractionation Shaw, 1968 . In summary, many ratios of either HFS or LIL\nelements apparently show variable discrimination between the Turkish ‘fertile’ and ‘barren’ ignimbrite groups, although in some cases these are largely a consequence of differences in the degree or type of Žmagmatic process especially partial melting and .fractional crystallization involved. The similarity be-\ntween the Turkish ‘barren’ group and the non-Turkish ‘fertile’ ignimbrites also indicates that global discrimination is not possible using these ratios."

    "heading": "8. Source and initial enrichment of boron",
    "text": "Although many borate deposits are situated in continental rift zones, the eruptive environment of Ž .the associated volcanics may be either a a contemŽ .poraneous subduction-related active margin, or b a\ncontinental collision compressional regime. For example, Miocene calc-alkali volcanism in western Turkey is considered the consequence of continental Žcollision and thickening after ocean closure Yılmaz, .1990 , derived from a subcontinental lithosphere enŽriched by subduction-related processes Seyitoglu et .al., 1997 . The central Andean ignimbrites are situ-\nated on a continental high plateau elevated by active subduction of the Nazca plate throughout the Miocene Ž .Jordan and Gardeweg, 1989 and are petrogenetiŽcally related to subduction processes Thorpe and .Francis, 1979 . In both cases, subduction processes\nmay have played a part in either the direct generation or subsequent development of the borate-associated silicic volcanism. It is therefore suggested that the subduction environment holds the key to the initial concentration of B that will eventually produce continental borate deposits.\nMuch of the recent work on volcanic arcs has been directed towards determining the ‘slab component’ of arc volcanics, and in particular the contribution of subducted sediments to the compositional Žvariation exhibited by arc basalts e.g. Tera et al., 1986; Morris and Tera, 1989; Morris et al., 1990; . ŽLeeman et al., 1994 . In this context B together with .B and Be isotopes has been used as a tracer for slab\ninput to arc melting processes because it is both Ž .highly incompatible Shaw and Sturchio, 1992 and\nreadily mobile under both low- and high-temperature Žhydrothermal alteration Seyfried et al., 1984; .Thompson, 1991 . Comparison of volcanics in different eruptive settings has demonstrated that B is enriched in arc basalts relative to both mid-ocean Ž . Ž . Žridge MORB and ocean island basalts OIB Ryan and Langmuir, 1993; Chaussidon and Jambon, 1994; .Dostal et al., 1996; Ryan et al., 1996 . Apart from B, other mobile trace elements such as Li, Be, As, Sb and Pb, are also considered to be enriched in the subduction environment via a fluid contribution into the overlying mantle wedge from the downgoing Ždehydrating slab Morris et al., 1990; Palmer, 1991; .You et al., 1993; Noll et al., 1996 . The B is derived Ž .from two main sources: a ocean crust which has undergone submarine alteration which causes an enŽ . Ž .richment in B and Li ; and b pelagic sediments Žwhich have adsorbed B from seawater Spivack and .Edmonds, 1987; You et al., 1993 . In both cases, B is largely hosted by secondary phyllosilicates\nŽ .Domanik et al., 1993 which on subduction of the oceanic segment undergo progressive metamorphism and dehydration, releasing a B-rich hydrothermal Ž .fluid with other mobile LIL elements into the arc mantle."

    "heading": "9. Discussion",
    "text": "From the above it is clear that subduction processes produce enrichment in the same range of Ž .elements B, As, Li, Pb that are concentrated in ignimbrites associated with borate deposits in western Turkey and elsewhere. We suggest that at some stage in the development of calc-alkali volcanics associated with borate deposits, subduction of a lithospheric slab composed of some pelagic sediment and altered basaltic crust was involved. Without the Žsediment with the highest proportion of B, but .smaller volume the degree of B-enrichment is un-\nlikely to be large and thus the likelihood of subsequent borates is reduced. In this context it is interesting that B and Be isotope data commonly exhibit a considerable range, both between arcs and within Ž .single arcs Tera et al., 1986 , and could reflect the variable contribution of a sedimentary component. A range of geochemical tracers indicate that subducted Žsediments leave their mark in arc volcanics e.g. .Hickey et al., 1986; Plank and Langmuir, 1993 , Ž .although on a gross scale Rea and Ruff 1996 suggest that there is no correlation between the amount of sediment being subducted and bulk arc composition. This later feature probably reflects the generally small proportion of sediment involved and does not take account of the high fluid flux generated by the progressive dehydration of the volcanic segment of the slab.\nAlthough initial B enrichment could be a consequence of a sediment component and subduction dehydration processes, the western Turkish ignimbrites are not directly related to an active subduction zone, but largely generated in a post-collisional setting by crustal melting. However, as demonstrated Ž .by Seyitoglu et al. 1997 the Early Miocene silicic melts were derived from a lithospheric source enriched via subduction-related processes. This is one fundamental difference between the Turkish ignŽ .imbrites largely continental rift-related and the\nŽnon-Turkish samples which are developed in con.current arc-related active margins . In this case it is\nsuggested that the Kirka ignimbrites were derived from a continental crust already enriched in B, via the agency of previous subduction-related magmatism. Tourmalinites are found in metasedimentary Ž .units in southwestern Anatolia Mittwede et al., 1995 indicating that B was available in the continental basement.\nIt is suggested that the Kirka borate deposits represent the end-product of four stages of transŽ .portation for B: a initial concentration in subducŽ .tion-derived fluids; b incorporation in continental Ž .crust via arc magmatism; c melting of B-enriched Ž .continental crust to produce ignimbrites; and d\nselective mobilization of B from ignimbrites by local hydrothermal activity and precipitation in alkaline lakes. Finally, although the initial enrichment of B in volcanic source rocks is considered a necessary feature for the development of borates, the local climatic, tectonic and volcanic conditions are important secondary features in their eventual genesis."

Because of limited geographical coverage the use of the chemical discrimination parameters as a global exploration tool should be treated with caution, although borate-associated ignimbrites from elsewhere in the world have some chemical features that are broadly similar to those of the Turkish ‘fertile’ ignimbrites.\nŽ .2 Relative to ‘barren’ ignimbrites, the ‘fertile’ analogues show the following chemical characters:\nŽ .a High, combined B, As, F, Li and Pb contents: any of these elements plotted with B in a binary Ždiagram will produce a degree of discrimination see .Fig. 8 .\nŽ .

Arc calc-alkali volcanism was the main carrier of B that became available for the subsequent deposition of borates via associated hydrothermal activity. Borateassociated volcanism not related to a contemporary subduction zone can release B by partially melting previously arc-generated silicic magmatic rocks within the continental crust.\nŽ .4 It is suggested that the variable lateral distribution of borate deposits along active margins related to subduction zones is primarily governed by the availability of pelagic sediments andror altered oceanic crust being subducted, coupled with the local volcanic and tectonic situation."

  "abstractText": "The Miocene borate deposits of western Turkey are associated with extensive mediumto high-K calc-alkali ignimbritic volcanism and a differentiated comagmatic alkaline trachybasalt–trachydacite lava suite. Ignimbritic air-fall and reworked pumiceous clastic materials are intimately associated with lake sediments that host the borate deposits. Local ignimbritic volcanism is considered the primary source of the B for the Kirka borate deposit in this area. Comparison of the geochemical Ž .

Other apparent discriminants involving both compatible and incompatible elements relative to . major silicate phases are largely a function of different degrees of partial melting and fractionation. It is suggested that the Ž . initial source of the B and other associated elements was from LIL-rich fluids released by the progressive dehydration of altered oceanic crust and pelagic sediments in a subduction zone. The absence or presence of sediments in a segmented subduction zone may influence the variable lateral distribution of borates in active margins on a global scale. Once the crust has become enriched in B via previous or contemporary subduction-related calc-alkali magmatism, the effect of tectonic environment, climate and hydrothermal activity influence the local development of the deposits. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",
