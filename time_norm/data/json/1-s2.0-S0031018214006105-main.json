The oncoids and microbialites consist mainly of a tubular microproblematicum, girvanellid cyanobacterial filaments, microbial micrite crusts, and pore-filling sparry calcite cements. They are surrounded by intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone, indicative of moderate- to slightly high-energy subtidal conditions. Themicrobial community was the primary boundstone-forming organismson the Akiyoshi atoll during this time. It represents a transitional stage in amid-Panthalassan reef succession between a cooler-water autotrophic Palaeoaplysina–microencruster community in the Gzhelian–Asselian and a warmer-water heterotrophic calcareous sponge–microencruster community in the Middle Permian. The flourishing mid-Panthalassanmicrobial community during the late Early Permian is related to enhanced alkalinity, increasing nutrient levels, elevated sea-surface temperatures, and the absence of major reef-building metazoans, which resulted from Gondwanan deglaciation, climatic changes, and a pulse of active volcanism.\n© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "Over the last 300 million years, the Early Permian is the only period known to have experienced a drastic climate change from icehouse to greenhouse conditions (Gastaldo et al., 1996; Montañez et al., 2007). Continental glaciation reached its peak in the latest Pennsylvanian (Gzhelian) and earliest Permian (Asselian–early Sakmarian), and began towane in themiddle Sakmarian (Rygel et al., 2008). Gondwanan deglaciation, elevated tropical sea-surface temperatures, and increasing pCO2 occurred almost simultaneously during that period (Montañez et al., 2007; Grossman et al., 2008; Korte et al., 2008). The marked climatic change may have influenced the compositions of tropical reef ecosystems and carbonate depositional systems. The Carboniferous– Permian Akiyoshi atolls, which formed upon volcanic edifices in the tropical mid-Panthalassa, preserve an excellent stratigraphic record of changes in reef systems (Nakazawa, 2001; Sano, 2006). Our studies of the Akiyoshi atoll carbonates have shown that a boreal phylloid alga, Palaeoaplysinawas the dominant reef-building organism during the latest Pennsylvanian to the earliest Permian (Nakazawa et al., 2011), and that sphinctozoan, inozoan, and chaetetid calcareous sponges built bioherms together with microencrusters during the Middle Permian (Nakazawa et al., 2012). However, late Early Permian reef-building\ncommunities have not been previously described from the Akiyoshi atolls.\nWe have examined core material from the Lower Permian section of the Akiyoshi Limestone for the purpose of understanding the midPanthalassan reefal succession during the period of deglaciation and climatic transition. The core examinations have revealed that large oncoids and microbialites are abundant exclusively in the Artinskian part of the Lower Permian. This paper describes the stratigraphic position and mode of occurrence of the oncoids and microbialites, and discusses their implications for late Paleozoic reef evolution in the mid-Panthalassa."

    "text": "The Japanese Islands comprise subduction-related accretionary complexes that formed along a trench since the late Paleozoic (Isozaki et al., 2010). The accretionary complexes consist mainly of oceanic rocks (basalt, carbonates, and chert) and trench-filling sediments (sandstone and mudstone). The carbonate rocks have been interpreted to be of mid-oceanic atoll origin, and overlie oceanic island basalt (OIB) (Kanmera et al., 1990; Sano et al., 2000) derived from the midPanthalassa (Ozawa and Kanmera, 1984). In this paper, we use the term “mid-Panthalassa” to describe a far-continent area/environment upon the Panthalassan oceanic plate.\nThe large limestone bodies of the Permian Akiyoshi accretionary complex, including the Akiyoshi, Taishaku, Atetsu, and Omi limestones,\nA B\nC\nSW Japan (Fig. 1A), are typical atoll carbonates (Kanmera and Nishi, 1983). These limestones range in age from the Visean (Mississippian) to the Midian/Capitanian (Guadalupian/Middle Permian), and are approximately 1000 m thick, without intercalation of terrigenous siliciclastics (Fig. 2; Sano andKanmera, 1988). The limestone successions are conformable with the underlying OIB produced by Mississippian superplume activity beneath the mid-Panthalassa Ocean (Sano et al., 2000; Tatsumi et al., 2000). The atoll carbonates and the OIB were formed in the low paleolatitudes (Nishiyama, 1997),migratedwestward by plate movement, and finally accreted to the eastern margin of the Asian continent during the latest Middle to Late Permian (Kanmera et al., 1990).\nThe Akiyoshi Limestone, distributed inMine City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, southwest Japan, is typical of accreted atoll carbonates in the Japanese Islands. It ranges in age from the Visean to the Capitanian, similar to other limestones in the Akiyoshi accretionary complex. The Lower Permian interval, the focus of the present study, makes up the upper middle part of the limestone succession (Fig. 2). The Akiyoshi Limestone comprises a carbonate-facies complex including true reef (reef core), back-reef beach sand, and lagoon facies (Ota, 1968)."

Managatake (Fig. 1), and consists of a back-reef (lagoonal) succession. The entire cored stratigraphic section is overturned (Ota et al., 1973). The upper cored interval has nearly horizontal bedding, but the lower core shows variably inclined dips up to 80° (Fig. 2). The upper 100-m of the overturned section was previously described by Nakazawa et al. (2011) and is Gzhelian–Sakmarian in age. In the present study, we described the 100–228-m core interval, which is Artinskian– Kungurian in age, and is composed mainly of grainstone/rudstone, microbialite, and lime-mudstone, which are described in the next chapter."

    "text": "Fusuline biostratigraphy provides a firm chronological framework for the Managatake Core succession. In the first, approximately 45-m-thick interval (0–45 m), dominant fusulines include Carbonoschwagerina minatoi, Darvasoschwagerina shimodakensis, Pseudofusulina stabilis, and Daixina sokensis, which suggest a late Gzhelian age for this part of the section (Watanabe, 1991). At 45–75 m, Sphaeroschwagerina spp., Pseudoschwagerina muongthensis, and Pseudoschwagerina robusta dominate, assigning this interval to the Asselian (Watanabe, 1991). In the underlying, approximately 10-m-thick interval, fusulines are less diverse, but contain a species which is somewhat similar to Sakmarella moelleri. Thus, this interval is likely correlated to the lower part of the Hermagorian in the Tethyan chronostratigraphic time-scale, and can be referred to the Sakmarian in the Permian global stage subdivision (Davydov et al., 2013). This is also supported by the Asselian and Artinskian age assessments of the overlying and underlying strata (in the overturned section). In the interval between approximately 89 m and 103 m, fusulines are dominated by Chalaroschwagerina species, particularly by Chalaroschwagerina vulgaris. In the remaining core succession, fusulines occur abundantly especially in bioclastic and oncoidal limestones, in which Pseudofusulina fusiformis, Pseudofusulina kraffti,\nFig. 1.

B: Geological map of the Akiyoshi Limestone and surrounding lithofacies. C: Map showing the drill site of the Managatake Core. Panel B is simplified from Kanmera and Nishi (1983).\nPseudofusulina kraffti magna, Pseudofusulina similar to Pseudofusulina gundaraensis and Pseudofusulina bactriana, C. vulgaris, and many other smaller forms such as Schubertella, Mesoschubertella, Biwaella, Staffella, and Nankinella are identified. Robustoschwagerina also rarely occurs in some levels of this interval. Age-diagnostic schwagerinid species from this part of the core succession contain similar forms to those previously reported from the middle part of the ‘Darvasian’ (the lower part of the Safetdaronskaya suite) of the Darvas Range, Tajikistan (Kalmykova, 1967). This interval approximately corresponds to the upper Yakhtashian in the Tethyan chronostratigraphic time-scale (Leven, 1980). Moreover in the Managatake Core succession, several poorly preserved specimens likely identified as Levenella and Pamirina were obtained from its uppermost part (approximately 180 m and 215 m levels, respectively). All of these lines of evidence clearly suggest that the core section below a depth of 89 m can be correlated to the Yakhtashian, which is now regarded to be almost equivalent to the late Arinskian to the early Kungurian (Davydov et al., 2013).\nSummarizing the fusuline biostratigraphy mentioned above, the Maganatake Core succession ranges from the late Gzhelian (latest Carboniferous) to the early Kungurian (latest Early Permian) (Fig. 2) although the late Hermagorian, which almost corresponds to the early Artinskian, is not very clearly recognized. Moreover, the Artinskian– Kungurian boundary is not currently clearly established but could be placed somewhere below the occurrence of Levenella, potentially at around the base of the first thick lime-mudstone beds in the middle part of the core studied herein (Fig. 3). Overall, the age of the 100–228 m part of the core examined here is probably late Artinskian to early Kungurian.\nVisean\nTournaisian\nSerpukhovian\nBashkirian\nMoscovian\nKasimovian\nGzhelian\nSakmarian Asselian\nArtinskian\nKungurian\nWordian Roadian\nCapitanian\nstage sy st\nem\nsu bs\nys te\nm\nse rie\ns\nP er\nm ia\nn (p t) C ar bo ni fe ro us\nM is\nsi ss\nip pi\nan P\nen ns\nyl va\nni an\nC is\nur al\nia n\nG ua\nda -\nlu pi\nan\nLimestoneBasaltic rocks\nTo ta\nl t hi\nck ne\nss :\nap pr\nox im\nat el\ny 1,\n00 0\nm\nentirely overturned\nco re\nin te\nrv al enotse miLihsoyik A\nS\nFig. 2.

Microbialite usually occurs as a patchymass or a column surrounded by the intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone. Under higher energy conditions, indicated by coarser bioclastic grains, oncoidal rudstone is associated with microbialite (Fig. 5). Some grainstones/rudstones display features indicating subaerial exposure, such as alveolar textures and meniscus cements (Fig. 4B).\nIn the Kungurian-aged interval from 173 to 228 m, massive to partially laminated lime-mudstone alternates with intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone (Fig. 3). In the lime-mudstone, bioclasts are generally rare, but ostracods and/or calcispheres are found in places. Very thin beds (b1 cm) composed exclusively of ostracod shells are also observed at some levels in the lime-mudstone. In parts, the lime-mudstone has a fenestral fabric characterized by aligned pores subsequently filled with crystal silt and/or blocky cement (Fig. 4C). Cracks, probably caused by desiccation, are commonly observed in these limestones, and are filled by material derived from the overlying layers. Intercalations of very fine peloidal grainstone often show ripple laminations (Fig. 4D).\nSome levels in the succession contain textures indicative of subaerial exposure (Fig. 3), including pendant, meniscus, and dogtooth cements (Flügel, 2004), vadose silts (Dunham, 1969; Reinhold, 1998), black pebbles (Strasser, 1984; Shinn and Lidz, 1988), and alveolar texture (Fig. 4B; Esteban and Klappa, 1983; Bain and Foos, 1993). The pendant, meniscus, and dogtooth cements commonly have a brownish-stained pedogenic color. The limestones containing these cements are generally dark gray in color, and they occur at levels that are truncated by erosion surfaces. An erosional unconformity separates the truncated darkcolored limestone (which shows strong evidence of meteoric diagenesis) from the overlying normal lighter gray limestone. In the late Artinskian–early Kungurian part of the Mangatake Core, we identified seven unconformable sequence boundaries (SBs in Fig. 3) based on the occurrence of meteoric–diagenetic textures and erosional surfaces (Fig. 3). These unconformities enable the recognition of depositional sequences in the core.\nThe depositional sequences bounded by the unconformities (sequence boundaries) in the Managatake Core are basically simple, composed mainly of intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone associated with microbialite/oncoidal rudstone (Fig. 3). In the upper part of the core section (173–228 m depth), lime-mudstone is recognized in the lower part of the sequences. The first appearance level of the lime-mudstone is largely correlated with the Kungurian (Fig. 3). The facies stacking pattern in a sequence probably changed around the Artinskian–Kungurian boundary from simple grainstone/rudstone into cyclic alternation of lime-mudstone and grainstone/rudstone. Furthermore, the thickness of the depositional sequences seems to have changed with the times. Each depositional sequence is relatively thin (mostly several meters) in the Gzhelian to Asselian in the Managatake Core (Nakazawa et al., 2011) but become thicker (probably N10 m) in the Sakmarian to Artinskian although the accurate estimation is difficult due to the various dips of the bedding in the core."

    "heading": "4.1.2. Interpretation",
    "text": "The intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone contains well-sorted skeletal grains of ordinary marine biota with submarine fibrous cements. These indicate moderate- to slightly high-energy conditions with regular wave action in a subtidal shallow-water environment. The oncoids and microbialites surrounded by the grainstone/rudstone were also formed in the same subtidal environments. Lime-mudstone, possibly recognized in the lower part of the Kungurian, is characterized by low biotic diversity and occurrences of fenestral fabric and lenticular bedded, rippled, very fine grainstone. Fenestral fabric in lime-mudstone indicates a tidal-flat environment (Shinn, 1983a) and lenticular rippled beds are also a common feature of such environments (Shinn, 1983b).\nLow biotic diversity may have been influenced by stressful conditions such as frequent ebb and flow and change in seawater salinity and temperature. Lime-mudstone in the lowermost part of the sequences is interpreted as tidal-flat deposits at a transgressive stage. Such limemudstone has been reported from the Middle Permian of the Akiyoshi and Omi limestones (Nakazawa and Ueno, 2004; Hayakawa et al., 2008; Nakazawa et al., 2009; Ueno et al., 2010). The facies assemblage of lime-mudstone and intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone in the core section is made up of a lagoonal succession, in contrast to atoll margin (reef core) facies composedmainly of cement-rich, coarser rudstone and boundstone formed under the higher-energy condition (Nakazawa, 2001).\nThe particular textures such as pendant, meniscus, and dogtooth cements, vadose silts, black pebbles, and alveolar texture in the grainstone/rudstone indicate subaerial exposure after the deposition of the host limestone. The subaerial exposure also formed slightly erosional unconformities. The facies stacking pattern in a sequence bounded by two successive subaerial unconformities probably changed around the Artinskian–Kungurian boundary from simple grainstone/ rudstone into cyclic alternation of lime-mudstone and grainstone/ rudstone. The lime-mudstone in the lower part of the sequences is interpreted as peritidal deposits of a transgressive systems tract (TST). The intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone and microbialites, which overlies the lime-mudstone, can be regarded as subtidal deposits of a highstand systems tract (HST). The depositional sequences in the core section become less frequent and thicker in the Sakmarian to the Artinskian, compared with those of the Gzhelian to Asselian\n(Nakazawa et al., 2011). Furthermore, as shown in this study, thick peritidal lime-mudstone began to accumulate in the Kungurian. The thick deposition of lime-mudstone at a transgressive stage is generally considered to have formed from a peritidal environment keeping up with a slow sea-level rise of low-amplitude sea-level fluctuation (Nakazawa and Ueno, 2004). Rygel et al. (2008) documented that the magnitude of the fluctuations largely decreased from 100–120 m to 30–70 m roughly in the mid-Sakmarian, which corresponds to the beginning of the waning stage of the major Gondwanan glaciation. The frequency also reduced from the Sakmarian onwards, synchronously with a sea-level rise of the longer-term, second-order cycles (Ross and Ross, 1987). The change in facies stacking pattern from a simple grainstone succession into cyclic alternation of lime-mudstone and grainstone in the core section indicate that the pattern of the sea-level fluctuations significantly changeddue to themajor Gondwanan deglaciation during Artinskian–Kungurian time."

    "heading": "4.2.1. Microbialites",
    "text": "Microbialites are abundant throughout the Artinskian interval (Fig. 3). They are generally of two types: Type A and Type B, as describe below.\nType A microbialites are dominant in the Artinskian (Fig. 3). This type of microbialite generally represents an irregular to columnar form with a massive to weakly laminated inner structure. It usually occurs as numerous, variably sized (less than several centimeters in both\nwidth and height) patches (Figs. 5A, 6A, and B), surrounded by intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone. The substrate ofmicrobialite is not always known, but a columnar form of microbialite growing on a gastropod has been observed (Fig. 6B). Constituents of this microbialite type are microproblematicum, cyanobacterial filaments of Girvanella, and clotted peloidal micrite probably of microbial origin (Fig. 6C and D).\nThemicroproblematicum (Fig. 6D) is themost conspicuous in Type A microbialite. It has a tubular form with a diameter of 50–125 μm, and possesses a microcrystalline wall with a thickness of 5–20 μm. The tube is not septated and does not branch but is gently twisted and interwoven in the microbialite. The tubes are quite similar to Girvanella distans described from the Dinantian in Belgium and France by Conil\nand Lys (1964), but the tube of G. distans and the microproblematicum described here appear to be too large (75–125 μm in diameter) for Girvanella and related cyanobacterial filaments (Danielli, 1981). The microproblematicum in this study could possibly be attributed to a kind of calcareous microalgae or a sessile foraminifer, but further examination is necessary tomake sucha conclusion. Themicroproblematicum in this study corresponds to the microproblematicum A reported from the Jigokudai area of Akiyoshi by Igawa (2003), which was most prolific in the Sakmarian to Artinskian interval. The present microproblematicum is usually surrounded by clotted micrite, which comprises aggregations of tiny peloidal grains (Fig. 6D). In this peloidal micrite, irregularly intertwisted cyanobacterial filaments of regularsizedGirvanellawith diameters of approximately 15–25 μmare observed (Fig. 6D). These filamentous microbes are sparsely arranged, resulting in poorly developed laminations compared with generally wellknown stromatolites. Fine-grained peloidal/bioclastic sediments are geopetal fillings of small constructional cavities in the microbialite, and any remaining open-spaces are occupied with sparry calcite cements (Fig. 6C). Thus, millimeter-scale alternations of the microbe-, sediment-, and cement-dominated layers in ascending order form a weakly laminated structure in the microbialite (Fig. 6C). The microproblematicum is broadly recognized as a mesh in each layer.\nType B, a subordinate type of microbialite in the Artinskian and also rarely seen in the Kungurian (Fig. 3), is characterized bymicrite bridges between grain particles (Fig. 6E and F). The bridges are composed of cyanobacterial filaments and peloidal micrite growing from the surface of the grains. The filaments are 15–25 μm in diameter, a common size for Girvanella. Where there is high microbial activity between coarser grains, micrite develops a mesh-like matrix with numerous connected, oval or irregular-shaped pores (Fig. 6E). This mesh-like micrite comprises clotted tiny peloids and also the remains of intertwisted cyanobacterial filaments of Girvanella (Fig. 6F)."

    "text": "Oncoids are particularly abundant in themiddle section of the examined core at a depth of 139–148 m, which corresponds to the late Artinskian (Fig. 3). Characteristically, the oncoids can be very large (Fig. 5B), and on the core slabs their apparent diameters are in the range of 1–14 cm (Fig. 7). Although 1–2-cm diameter oncoids are the most abundant, it is notable that oncoids with diameters of N10 cm are common. Small oncoid grains are generally near-subspherical, but larger grains have more irregular-shaped forms. A large oncoid often has a large nucleus of an alatoconchid bivalve shell (Fig. 5B) although the recognition of nuclei material by slab and/or thin-section observations is not always possible because of their very thick cortex.\nThe oncoid cortex is weakly laminated (Fig. 8A) and the laminations aremostly concentrical but partially irregularly overlapped, particularly in the case of having a large alatoconchid nucleus with low rotation potential. Additionally, columnar growth of a cortex is observed in some large oncoids. The constituent organisms and textures of the oncoids are almost the same as those of Type A microbialites. They are composed of the tubular microproblematicum, filamentous cyanobacteria, and clotted peloidal micrite probably of microbial origin (Fig. 8B). The tubular microproblematicum is most conspicuous in the cortex (Fig. 8B). It is gently twisted and interwoven within the oncoid cortex, and surrounded by clotted micrite comprising aggregations of very tiny peloidal grains and cyanobacterial filaments of Girvanellawith a diameter of 10–25 μm (Fig. 8C). The cortex of oncoids usually has aligned, irregular-shaped pores filled with sparry calcite cement, but has a\nFig. 6.

Furthermore, many of the oncoids are categorized into macroids in the classification of Peryt (1983), which is defined as having a diameter of N10 mm.\nAnother type of oncoid, which is characterized bymoremicrite-rich, massive to slightly laminated cortex with less common tubular microproblematicum and cyanobacterial filaments (Fig. 8D), is also recognized in the Artinskian to Kungurian. This type of oncoid is rather small, and the cortex is relatively thin (Fig. 8D). These micritic oncoids are probably the same as those in the Gzhelian to Asselian part (depth of 15–75 m) of this core (Nakazawa et al., 2011). This oncoid type is classified as a spongiostromate oncoid (Flügel, 2004), characterized by a micrite-rich appearance with rare microbial remains."

    "text": "Oncoids and microbialites are abundant in the Artinskian part of the Akiyoshi atoll carbonates. They are also common throughout the Pennsylvanian and the Middle Permian (Nakazawa, 2001 for the Bashkirian; Nakazawa et al., 2011 for the Gzhelian to Asselian; Nakazawa et al., 2009 for the Middle Permian) and are usually closely associated with each other. Nakazawa et al. (2011) reported that the Gzhelian to Asselian of the Akiyoshi Limestone commonly yields oncoids and microbialites in the lowermost and uppermost parts of high-frequency depositional sequences. These correspond to very shallow subtidal and/or peritidal environments formed during early transgressive and late highstand stages in a single sea-level cycle. The microbialites represent thin, laminated, platy structures like amicrobialmat probably influenced by restricted accommodation in a shallow-water environment. They are composed of densemicrite together with cyanobacterial filaments, sessile foraminfers, and Tubiphytes. The oncoids in this interval are predominantly 0.5–3 cm in diameter and are characterized by a poorly laminated micritic cortex with cyanobacterial filaments. On the other hand, the Murgabian to\ngatake Core, Akiyoshi Limestone. A: Microbialites including both Type A (a) and Type B ated inner structure. Note that the columnar microbialite grew on a gastropod (upper consists of alternations ofmicrobe-, sediment-, and cement-dominated parts in ascending ) and Girvanella (g) surrounded by peloidal micrite probably of microbial origin (depth, rous oval or irregular pores developed between the bioclastic grains (depth, 125.96 m). Girvanella remain in the micrite (depth, 125.96 m).\nMidian (Middle Permian) microbialites are usually associated with calcareous sponges in a subtidal lagoonal environment (Nakazawa et al., 2012). They consist of dense micrite together with cyanobacterial filaments, Archaeolithoporella, and Tubiphytes (=Shamovella).\nThe types of microbialites and oncoids in the Gzhelian–Asselian and the Middle Permian are quite different from the Artinskian ones in this study. The Artinskian large oncoids and microbialites described in this study occur in intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone in the middle part of a depositional sequence, which contains normal marine biota. These facies characteristics indicate that the oncoids and microbialites formed in subtidal, moderate- to slightly high-energy, normal marine conditions. They do not indicate a peritidal environment with high salinity and frequent emergences, which are stressful for biota. A columnar form of the microbialite Type A (Fig. 6B) probably rapidly grew in subtidal conditions to avoid burial by frequent sediment inflows. The co-occurrence of microbialite and gastropods (Fig. 6B) also possibly suggests that the microbialite was able to grow rapidly enough to prevent predation stress by marine biota such as grazing gastropods. The oncoids were formed in an environment where the energy level was high enough to rotate such large grains. The Artinskian oncoids and microbialites are composed of the tubular microproblematicum, cyanobacterial filaments, and micrite crusts that apparently formed a microbialite framework with constructional voids filled by geopetal sediments and calcite spar cements. The tubular microproblematicum is particularly conspicuous and probably acted as an important microframe builder because it is broadly recognized as a mesh-like colony\nin microbialite. In contrast, Tubiphytes and Archaeolithoporella are rare in the examinedmaterials. Largemetazoan reef-builders such as calcareous algae, sponges, and corals are also rare in the Artinskian. These differences highlight the peculiarity of the Artinskian microbialites and oncoids.\nIgawa (2003) reported microbialites from the Pennsylvanian to the Early Permian lagoonal successions in the Jigoku-dai area of Akiyoshi, which is located at about 1 km southwest of the present core site. She emphasized the significant microbial contribution to the development of the Akiyoshi atolls during this time interval and documented that microbialites are particularly abundant in the Sakmarian and Artinskian. The Sakmarian to Artinskian microbialite types in that study are quite similar to those described in this study in the abundant occurrence of the tubular microproblematicum (microproblematicum A of Igawa, 2003) and the sparsity of the surrounding peloidal micrite. These facts indicate that the large oncoidand microbialite-forming organisms were not restricted to the drilled Kaerimizu area but were rather widespread in the lagoon area on the Akiyoshi atoll during Sakmarian to Artinskian times. As the Lower Permian atoll margin (reef core) facies has not been reported from the Akiyoshi and other atoll carbonates in the midPanthalassa, it is not very clear whether or not such microbial community constructed a wave-resistant, rigid reef framework. Nevertheless, this study has revealed that the microbial community was obviously very important boundstone-forming members at least in the lagoon environment on the atoll during Artinskian time."

    "heading": "5.1.2. Comparison with Lower Permian reef communities from other areas of the world",
    "text": "Circum-tropical Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian reefs were generally dominated by abundant phylloid algae (including Palaeoaplysina), accompanied by common Tubiphytes, calcareous sponges, bryozoans, and laminar encrusting algae (Wahlman, 2002). However, phylloid algal reefs rapidly declined from the Sakmarian onward and globally there are fewer reported occurrences of Artinskian– Kungurian reefs.\nIn the Permian Basin of North America, theMiddle Pennsylvanian to Sakmarian (Desmoinesian–Wolfcampian) phylloid algae-dominated reefs were followed in the Artinskian–Kungurian (Leonardian) by those composed of frame-building calcareous sponges and bryozoans togetherwith bindingfistuliporid bryozoans, Tubiphytes, and calcareous algae (Bain, 1967; Myers, 1972; Wahlman, 2002). Buildups consisting mainly of Tubiphytes, Archaeolithoporella, and encrusting and upright bryozoans, together with abundant submarine cements were also reported from the Sakmarian to Artinskian platformmargin in the Southern Alps by Flügel (1981) and Krainer and Vachard (2007). On the contemporaneous northern Pangean shelves including Arctic Canada, Norway, and the Urals, the Palaeoaplysina and/or coral community were generally replaced by a cooler-water community including bryozoan, crinoids, brachiopods, and hyalosponges (Beauchamp and Desrochers, 1997; Bruce and Toomey, 1992; Kossovaya et al., 2013). This community shift is considered to have been caused by climatic cooling due to the northward drift of Pangea (Beauchamp, 1994; Beauchamp and Desrochers, 1997).\nThese studies clarified that Tubiphytes, Archaeolithoporella, and bryozoans were common in the circum-tropical reefs during Sakmarian to Kungurian time. Calcareous spongeswere also themajor reef constituents in the Permian Basin of North America during the corresponding time interval. These communities are quite different from themicrobial community on the Akiyoshi atoll described in this paper. Consequently the predominant microbial community composed of tubular microproblematicum, girvanellid cyanobacterial filaments, and micrite crusts from Akiyoshi is peculiar in the Early Permian reefs. This type of community is only known on the mid-Panthalassan atolls."

    "heading": "5.2. Implications of the Lower Permian microbial community for late Paleozoic reef evolution on mid-Panthalassan atolls",
    "text": "The late Early Permian (Artinskian) microbialite-dominated facies is unique in the late Paleozoic mid-Panthalassan reef succession. It is situated in a transitional paleoclimatic period between the Gzhelian– Asselian Palaeoaplysina–microencruster and the Middle Permian sponge–microencruster communities (Nakazawa et al., 2011, 2012).\nPalaeoaplysina is attributed to an archaeolithophyllid phylloid red alga and is regarded as a boreal biotic element (Vachard and Kabanov, 2007; Anderson and Beauchamp, 2014), whereas calcareous sponges are common in the tropical, warmer shallow-waters of the Permian (Wahlman, 2002). The turnover from phylloid algae to calcareous sponges is a known global trend, called the “late Early Permian turnover” (Weidlich, 2002). A reefal succession in the transitional postSakmarian interval, however, is so far not well known. This study shows that a microbialite-dominated boundstone facies flourished during the Artinskian paleoclimatic transitional stage on an open-oceanic isolated carbonate platform in the mid-Panthalassan domain.\nThe Pennsylvanian to the earliest Permian was an icehouse climatic interval in the Phanerozoic icehouse–greenhouse cycles (Veizer et al., 2000). Large continental ice-sheets around the South Pole on Gondwanaland broadly started forming in the Visean, reached their maximum in the Middle–Late Pennsylvanian to Asselian, and retreated from the mid-Sakmarian onwards (Fielding et al., 2008). The mid-Sakmarian to Artinskian deglaciation was closely coupled with increasing pCO2, elevated tropical marine surface temperatures (Montañez et al., 2007; Grossman et al., 2008; Korte et al., 2008), and a decreasing 87Sr/86Sr value in seawater (Korte et al., 2006; McArthur et al., 2012). It is also known that the deglaciation led to a change in sea-level fluctuations. Rygel et al. (2008) documented that the magnitude of the fluctuations largely decreased from 100–120 m to 30–70 m roughly in the midSakmarian, which corresponds to the waning stage of the major glaciation. The frequency also reduced around the Sakmarian, synchronously with a sea-level rise of the longer-term, second-order cycles (Ross and Ross, 1987). The change in facies stacking pattern in a depositional sequence on the Akiyoshi atoll shown in this study indicate that the pattern of the sea-level fluctuations significantly changed due to the major Gondwanan deglaciation during mid-Sakmarian to Kungurian times.\nIn addition, global tectonism and volcanism probably played an important role in the late Early Permian paleoclimatic transition. Recent studies showed that the Panjal Traps volcanism, which triggered the opening of the Neotethys Ocean, occurred at ca. 290 Ma (Shellnutt et al., 2011), in the late Sakmarian to the early Artinskian (Fig. 9). The Neotethys opening is believed to be one of the causes of theGondwanan deglaciation (Angiolini et al., 2003). Furthermore, additional large mantle-plume (superplume) volcanism beneath the mid-Panthalassa, which is considered to have produced oceanic plateaux, is suggested by the geochemistry of Lower Permian (probably Sakmarian–earliest Artinskian) greenstones in the Mino–Tamba accretionary complex, Japan (Fig. 9; Ichiyama et al., 2008). The age-coincidence between these volcanisms and the climatic change suggests that these volcanic activities caused increasing pCO2 in the Sakmarian to Artinskian.\niyoshi atolls and related environmental changes. Data sources of environmental changes: n (Fielding et al., 2008); 87Sr/86Sr curve (McArthur et al., 2012); sea-level change (Ross and 11); and Panthalassan superplume (Ichiyama et al., 2008).\nElevated pCO2 probably induced global warming and themelting of icesheets, and also enhanced weathering on land. Runoff from land increased alkalinity and the availability of nutrients in the seawater. In addition, volcanogenic/hydrothermal heating of the large mantleplume beneath the mid-Panthalassa may have resulted in upwelling of nutrient-rich deep-ocean water (Vogt, 1989). The rapid growth of the microbialite probably required high alkalinity in seawater. Furthermore, microbes generally tend to occur in a eutrophic environment rather than oligotrophic conditions (Wood, 1993; Immenhauser et al., 2005). It is likely that the large mantle-plume volcanisms beneath the mid-Panthalassa largely influenced the reef community particularly in a mid-Panthalassan atoll setting. The Early Permian microbial communities on the Akiyoshi atoll documented in this study can be regarded as transitional members in a reefal biotic succession from a coolerwater, autotrophic palaeoaplysinid algal community to a warmerwater, heterotrophic calcareous sponge community (Fig. 9; Nakazawa et al., 2011, 2012). After the decline of the algal community, the microbial community exclusively flourished under less ecological competition in a reef ecosystem during the major deglaciation interval before theprosperity of thewarmer-water, sponge community on theAkiyoshi atoll. Thus, this biotic succession probably reflects global warming, the enhanced alkalinity, and the increased availability of nutrients in seawater during the late Early Permian."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "Large oncoids and microbialites are abundant in the late Artinskian part of the mid-Panthalassan Akiyoshi atoll carbonates. Microbialites are represented as densely packed, centimeter-sized irregular masses or columns with a weakly laminated inner structure. Oncoids are up to 14 cm in diameter and are closely associated with the microbialites. They are both composed of the tubular microproblematicum (possibly of calcareous microalgae or sessile foraminifers), girvanellid cyanobacterial filaments, peloidal micrite crusts of microbial origin, and pore-filling sparry calcite cements. Microbialites and oncoids are surrounded by intraclastic–bioclastic grainstone/rudstone with associated normalmarine biota such as fusulines, indicating a shallow subtidal moderate- to slightly high-energy depositional setting that occasionally became subaerially exposed at high-frequency cycle tops. In this depositional setting and time interval, reef-building metazoans are rare, and instead microbial communities appear to have exclusively flourished as boundstone-forming organisms on the Akiyoshi atoll. This Artinskian microbial community is situated in a transitional stage in the reefal biotic succession on the Akiyoshi atolls, between the Gzhelian–Asselian cooler-water, autotrophic Palaeoaplysina–microencruster community and the Middle Permian (Guadalupian) warmer-water heterotrophic calcareous sponge–microencruster community. The Artinskianmicrobial community flourished in a nutrient-rich, warmer-water environment with high alkalinity. The reef ecosystem was possibly less competitive due to the absence of major reef-building metazoans. These paleoecological conditions are thought to be the result of the warming paleoclimatic transition during the Gondwanan continental deglaciation, which was probably triggered by plume-generated global volcanism and resultant pCO2 increase."
