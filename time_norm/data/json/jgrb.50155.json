M. Jellinek2\nReceived 1 February 2012; revised 5 March 2013; accepted 8 March 2013; published 30 April 2013.\n[1] Understanding the longevity of volcanic ash-clouds generated by powerful explosive eruptions is a long standing problem for assessing volcanic hazards and the nature and time scale of volcanic forcings on climate change. It is well known that the lateral spreading and longevity of these clouds is influenced by stratospheric winds, particle settling and turbulent diffusion. Observations of the recent 2010 Eyjafjallajökull and 2011 Grimsvötn umbrella clouds, as well as the structure of atmospheric aerosol clouds from the 1991 Mt Pinatubo event, suggest that an additional key process governing the cloud dynamics is the production of internal layering. Here, we use analog experiments on turbulent particle-laden umbrella clouds to show that this layering occurs where natural convection driven by particle sedimentation and the differential diffusion of primarily heat and fine particles give rise to a large scale instability. Where umbrella clouds are particularly enriched in fine ash, this “particle diffusive convection” strongly influences the cloud longevity. More generally, cloud residence time will depend on fluxes due to both individual settling and diffusive convection. We develop a new sedimentation model that includes both sedimentation processes, and which is found to capture real-time measurements of the rate of change of particle concentration in the 1982 El Chichon, 1991 Mt Pinatubo and 1992 Mt Spurr ash-clouds. A key result is that these combined sedimentation processes enhance the fallout of fine particles relative to expectations from individual settling suggesting that particle aggregation is not the only mechanism required to explain volcanic umbrella longevity.

    "text": "[2] The dynamics governing the rise of turbulent volcanic jets and their spread in the stratosphere as umbrella clouds have received significant attention over the last few decades [Sparks and Wilson, 1976; Woods, 1995; Sparks et al., 1997; Carazzo et al., 2008a, 2008b; Koyaguchi et al., 2009]. A central issue driving this work has been to identify the main factors controlling the sedimentation of solid particles and, thus, the structure and ultimate longevity of these clouds. Understanding the evolution of stratospheric volcanic umbrellas has obvious implications for assessing various volcanic hazards to humans [Bonadonna et al., 2002] as well as a significant bearing on topical problems including the quantitative effect of explosive volcanism on\nAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version of this article.\n1Institut de Physique du Globe, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Université Paris Diderot, Paris, France.\n2Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\nCorresponding author: G.

For example, predicting properly or parameterizing the “footprint” of volcanic eruptions on climate change is impossible without a detailed characterization of the time-dependent, three-dimensional structure, composition and radiative properties of these atmospheric clouds [McCormick et al., 1995]. Of increasing practical concern are the effects of umbrella clouds on the safety of air travel [Casadevall, 1994; Casadevall and Krohn, 1995; Simpson et al., 2002]. Indeed, the unexpectedly prolonged disruptions of global air travel as a result of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull (Iceland) and the 2011 Puyehue-Cordon Caulle (Chile) eruptions brought attention to potentially serious global economic consequences of an incomplete understanding of the dynamics of these volcanic clouds.\n[3] On 21 May 2011, the Grimsvötn volcano violently exploded producing a 20 km-high ash plume (Figure 1) that spread over Northern Europe, causing an air traffic disruption that was minor in comparison to the one following the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption. A remarkable observation made during this eruption is the emergence of quasiperiodic layering over the full height of the cloud (Figure 1). Although cloud layering has received little attention, this enigmatic phenomenon is observed commonly. Striking examples include the 1974 Fuego [Russell and Hake, 1977], the 1982 El Chichon [Hofmann and Rosen, 1984], and the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruptions [Barton et al., 1992;\n437\nOsborn et al., 1995]. The 2010 Eyjafjallajökull ash cloud was also particularly affected by this phenomenon since layering was observed in SO2, CO, O3 and mass concentration measurements [Ansmann et al. Flentje et al. Schlager et al., 2010; Slingo, 2010].\n[4] The origin of the layering, its relationship to cloud composition, and its effects on the dynamics of particle suspension and sedimentation are poorly understood and have been generally neglected, particularly in studies of cloud longevity. A major reason for this knowledge gap is that layering does not occur in all volcanic clouds and, thus, this process has never achieved scientific attention beyond simple curiosity. We will show that these enigmatic structures are an expected consequence of the source conditions and atmospheric density structure and, more importantly, that it can exert a fundamental control on the cloud residence time. Previous explanations for layering invoke ad hoc effects related to gas segregation and variations in tropospheric and stratospheric wind fields [Holasek et al., 1996a; Dacre et al. Folch et al., 2012]. In more detail, separation of gas and SO2 aerosol particles has been observed in a number of real-time measurements [Osborn et al., 1995; Schneider et al., 1999; Constantine et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2004a], as well as in laboratory experiments [Holasek et al., 1996a] and numerical simulations [Fero et al., 2009], but the underlying mechanisms leading to layering remain unclear. Alternatively, vertical and temporal variations in the speed and direction of atmospheric winds could promote the formation of layers in volcanic clouds [Dacre et al.,2011;Folch et al., 2012]. However, this picture is merely intuitive and\n, 2010; , 2010; ,2011;\nhow these effects might produce the short-wavelength periodic structure shown in Figure 1 is unclear. A third way layering can appear, which is also both intuitive and difficult to reconcile with the regularity of the layer thicknesses, is as a result of time-dependent variations in the discharge rate and/or gas content at the vent. Although such variations may influence the height of the level of neutral buoyancy (LNB) during the eruption and, in turn, the buoyancy flux\ndriving the lateral flow of the cloud [Sparks, 1986], the periodic time-dependence in the source conditions would have to be unrealistically monochromatic to explain the layering in Figure 1.\n[5] A fourth candidate mechanism, which can lead to periodic layering by definition, is “particle diffusive convection” [Green, 1987; Hoyal et al., 1999], a class of multicomponent convection [Turner, 1985] driven as a result of the differing rate diffusion of heat and very fine particles in volcanic clouds. Although a well-known phenomenon, the role of particle diffusive convection has not been explored in volcanic clouds. Here, we argue that sedimentation from volcanic umbrellas related to highly energetic eruptions can be largely governed by the dynamics of particle diffusive convection. We apply and analyze in greater detail the results of laboratory experiments presented in Carazzo and Jellinek [2012], which identify the conditions in which particle-laden umbrella clouds become layered in the absence of externally imposed effects related to vertical or temporal variations in wind stresses or source conditions (i.e., mass, momentum and buoyancy fluxes). We characterize and understand theoretically the main processes involved in the production of layering in our experiments, and we propose a new sedimentation model to explain the rate of change of particle content in the cloud. We show that particle diffusive convection can arise in natural ash-clouds and is favored for highly-explosive events in which the eruption cloud has a high concentration of very fine ash. More generally, however, a compilation of real-time observations from historic ash clouds shows that both “classical” individual particle settling and particle diffusive convection contribute to the ultimate longevity of these clouds. To understand the relative importance of fluxes carried by individual particle settling and particle diffusive convection, we develop a new sedimentation model that accounts for both processes and explains real-time measurements of the rate of change of particle concentration in several historical events.\n[6] Our paper is organized in the following way. In section 2, we present the experimental setup and the observations made where our laboratory ash-clouds form layers. We develop and test a model for sedimentation in our laboratory experiments driven by particle diffusive convection in section 3. In section 4, we apply our experimental results and theoretical model to understand layering and sedimentation in natural volcanic umbrella clouds. We discuss the results and conclusions from our work in sections 5 and 6, respectively."

    "text": "[7] We use the experimental setup presented in detail in Carazzo and Jellinek [2012]. The experiments are conducted in an apparatus that consists of a plexiglass tank with a floor 1 1 m and a height of 0.8 m (Figure 2a). This tank is filled with an aqueous NaCl solution with either a stepwise or linear density stratification. In most of the experiments, we use a 0.4 m-high layer of fresh water overlying a 0.2 m-high layer of salt water. A straight pipe nozzle of 6.35 mm diameter is positioned in the center of the floor and connected to a 1.5 m-long syringe beneath the tank. At the start of an experiment, we inject a well-stirred mixture of fresh water and solid particles at a fixed rate using the syringe. The particles used are well-sorted Custer feldspar powder with a mean diameter dp = 300 m and a density p = 2600 kg m–3. The particle concentration at the source and the input flow rate are varied from one experiment to another (Table 1). All the experiments are isothermal. A typical injection lasts between 1 and 10 min and is recorded using several video cameras. Following the injection, a long time exposure camera records the complete evolution of the particle-laden mixture.\n[8] Figure 2b shows a typical evolution of a particle-laden jet forming a buoyant column feeding a stable umbrella cloud. In this experiment, extensive turbulent entrainment and mixing of ambient salt water dilutes the rising jet, causing its density to decline to below that of the ambient salt water layer. The resulting positive buoyancy drives the injection upward as a convecting plume until it reaches and overshoots a level of neutral buoyancy (LNB). Residual momentum flux drives the jet up to a maximum height where the flow falls back under the action of gravity. The resulting gravity current spreads out laterally forming an umbrella cloud at the LNB. Once the current reaches the tank walls, the umbrella cloud continues to thicken as more material is injected from the nozzle. After the injection is stopped, a stable umbrella remains between the salt and fresh water layers (Figure 2b).\n[9] A detailed study of the stability of particle-laden plumes carried out in the same apparatus has been presented by Carazzo and Jellinek [2012]. In this paper, we focus on the behavior of the cloud after its emplacement. Previous laboratory experiments simulating particle sedimentation from turbulent suspensions show that, in this configuration, particles are expected to settle across the velocity\nboundary layer and density interface forming the cloud base at their terminal fall velocities [Martin and Nokes, 1988; Carey et al., 1988]. Here, we observe a radically different behavior: A few minutes after cloud emplacement, thin and relatively slow motion fingers form at the cloud base while the whole umbrella breaks up relatively rapidly into a series of particle-rich layers interbedded with thin layers of water depleted in particles (Figure 2c). The vertical transfer of particles from layer to layer and ultimately from the cloud to the tank base is governed by intermittent gravitational instabilities to a thin particle boundary layer (PBL) at the base of each layer, which takes the form of thin fingers. The complete transfer of particles from the top to the bottom of the cloud lasts for several hours, and the time scale for complete sedimentation is typically 6–8 h after the injection is stopped, which is a few orders of magnitude longer than expected when considering individual settling rates only."

    "text": "[10] A key issue in our experiments is how the dynamics of the jet influences the dynamics of the cloud before becoming layered. Building on previous studies [Chen, 1980; Didden and Maxworthy, 1982; Lemkert and Imberger, 1993], Kotsovinos [2000] uses laboratory experiments and scaling theory to show that the radial spread of an unbounded volcanic cloud as a result of a jet is characterized by four successive spreading regimes. Very close to the overshoot region (i.e., at very early times), the umbrella spreads as a jet with radius Ru / t1/2 [Chen, 1980]. After this initial stage, the rate of change of the inertia of the flow enters to balance the radial momentum flux (regime 2) and Ru / t. As the flow spreads further, it collapses into a turbulent gravity current governed by a balance between buoyancy and inertial forces (regime 3) and Ru / t3/4. Finally, at large times, the flow is driven by a balance between buoyancy and effectively viscous stresses, where the viscosity depends on an eddy diffusion (regime 4), and Ru / t1/2.\n[11] The radial spread of our experimental clouds is well explained by Kotsovinos’ theory, although regime 1 is not observed (Figure 3). The comparison between two umbrella clouds that eventually either break-up into a series of layers (cloud A) or not (cloud B) reveals that whereas cloud A remains in regime 2 until it hits the tank walls (end of the time series), cloud B passes through regimes 2–4 before reaching the walls. Cloud A was characterized by a relatively much higher overshoot region above the LNB than cloud B (i.e., the distance between the maximum height and the LNB). Cloud A was consequently driven by a larger initial momentum flux that governed spreading over the full distance to the tank walls.\n[12] An additional important consequence of the higher overshoot region is relatively more extensive turbulent vertical mixing across the LNB. In particular, this extensive mixing causes a continuous entrainment from the growing umbrella cloud and leads, in turn, to the production of a linear density stratification [e.g., Baines and Turner, 1969] that will influence the dynamics of particle settling within the cloud following cessation of the injection. The magnitude of the resulting density gradient depends on the intensity of the mixing, which is governed ultimately by the extent to which turbulent kinetic energy can be extracted from the velocity field to do the work of overturning the density interface that defines the LNB. The available turbulent kinetic energy for mixing depends on the overshoot height of the jet, which is determined by the ambient density stratification and to a lesser extent the buoyancy flux at the source [Turner, 1973]. In all the layered experiments in Table 1 (except #1), the turbulent jets are expelled with an excess of inertia compared to stabilizing buoyancy forces, which promotes the formation of jets with high overshoot regions and subsequent clouds, which spread with high radial momentum fluxes. These conditions favor intense mixing across the LNB that produces quasi-linear density gradients within all clouds prior to layers formation (Figure 4)."

    "text": "[13] Figure 4 summarizes the main processes involved in the production of layering in our analog eruption clouds. During injection, mixing across the LNB produces a linear density gradient in the particle-rich cloud (stage A) (Figure 4). Following cessation of the jet, particles that were initially suspended as a result of turbulent motions driven by the spread of the cloud begin to settle through the density gradient at fall velocities that depend primarily on their size, forming gradients in particle concentration within the cloud (stage B). Descending particles of a given size slow down as they move through progressively denser fluid. Concurrently, entrained relatively low density salt water initially carried down with the particles ascends in turbulent plumes that rise to their levels of neutral buoyancy, where they spread out driving lateral motions (stage C).\n[14] The stirring related to this type of sedimentationdriven convection [e.g., Kerr, 1991] mixes the vertical regions over which the plumes ascend and leads, in turn, to the emergence of a series of homogeneous layers bounded by sharply-defined density interfaces marked by welldefined PBLs. From Figure 4, the large scale flow within the layers is in alternating directions. The resulting shear concentrated at the bounding density interfaces is observed\nto re-suspend particles from the PBLs where the particle concentration is low, where the particles are very small [Da Cunha and Hinch, 1996] and where particle concentration gradients are steep [Davis and Leighton, 1987]. Qualitatively, this effect is observed commonly within velocity boundary layers related to solid boundaries and viscosity or density interfaces under both low-Reynolds number [Leighton and Acrivos, 1987a, 1987b; Schaflinger et al., 1990; Acrivos et al., 1993] and high-Reynolds number conditions [Solomatov et al., 1993; Solomatov and Stevenson, 1993; Rampall and Leighton, 1994; Huppert et al., 1995; Ziskind and Gutfinger, 2002], where high shear strain rates give rise to complex particle-particle interactions. These interactions include random walk particle trajectories that are well explained in terms of “hydrodynamic particle diffusion” theories [e.g., Leighton and Acrivos, 1987a; Davis, 1996]. Although the particle-scale mechanisms governing the vertical flux of particles across the layers and out of the cloud are complex, the resulting average flux is ultimately carried by thin particle-laden fingers extending downward from a dense PBL at the cloud/salt water interface forming the umbrella cloud base (stage D).\n[15] An important additional remark is that although the tank limits the lateral extent of the cloud, the strength of the return flow is observed to be too weak to significantly alter either layer formation or the convective PBL dynamics governing sedimentation from the cloud base. Indeed, the scaling theory for the spread of the intrusion (i.e., Figure 3) and that developed for layer thickness and cloud longevities in the next section require that effects related to interactions with the sidewalls are negligible. Indeed, if the buoyancy or momentum fluxes related to the return flows is important, neither the spread of the cloud nor its longevity would be explained theoretically. Qualitatively, a key reason why these return flows are unimportant is that, in all experiments, the observed advective timescale for the return flow, which increases during an experiment from 40 to 200 s (cf., Figure 3) is always much larger than the measured time scale for convective instability of the PBL at the cloud base (see Figure 6A of Carazzo and Jellinek [2012])."

    "text": "[16] The main features observed in our isothermal clouds are analogous to particle diffusive convection occurring where a layer of warm particle-laden water lies over a layer of cold, clear denser water [Green, 1987; Hoyal et al., 1999]. Although our experimental system is initially gravitationally stable, an unstable density gradient develops because salt diffuses much faster than the particles, which are retained in the upper layer until thin fingers of particle-laden fluid form. To test this hypothesis, we compare our experimental results with theory built on a well-established understanding of multicomponent convection in heat/salt systems [Turner, 1967; Stern and Turner, 1969; Turner, 1973; Schmitt, 1979; Huppert and Turner, 1981]. First, we show that our isothermal particle-laden clouds are in a particle diffusive convection regime. We predict, in turn, the structure of the expected layering and compare the results with our experiments. Finally, we develop a theoretical model for the rate of change of particle content in the cloud in terms of the particle-salt double diffusive flux from the cloud base."

    "text": "[17] The onset of particle diffusive convection (or any class of multicomponent convection) depends on the magnitude of the stabilizing to destabilizing buoyancy. In our isothermal experiments, a critical criterion for convection is the ratio of the stabilizing salinity gradient to destabilizing compositional (i.e., particle) buoyancy [Huppert and Manins, 1973; Green, 1987],\nRs ˇ S ˇm C\ns\np\n3/2 . (1)\n[18] This relationship shows that an infinitesimal instability will develop into fingers only if the capacity of the cloud to diffuse salt more rapidly than particles is efficient enough to overcome the stability of the originally sharp interface. In equation (1), S = Su – Sl and C = Cu – Cl are the salinity S and particle concentration C (in kg kg–1) differences between the upper (u) and lower (l) layers, respectively, s is the diffusion coefficient of salt (10–9 m2 s–1), p is a particle diffusivity (i.e., the larger of either the Brownian or hydrodynamic diffusivity [Davis, 1996]), ˇ is the saline volumetric contraction coefficient, and ˇm is the volumetric expansion coefficient for a particle suspension, which is defined as\nˇm =\n1 @\n@C C 0 p – f p , (2)\nwhere , p and f are the bulk suspension, particle and fluid densities, respectively.\n[19] From the results of experiments involving hot particle-laden fluid layers overlying cold, fine particle-laden fluid layers [Green, 1987; Hoyal et al., 1999] and wellestablished theoretical and experimental studies of particle diffusion [e.g., Leighton and Acrivos, 1987a; Davis, 1996; Da Cunha and Hinch, 1996] an appropriate hydrodynamic diffusivity for our 300 m particles can be estimated from the particle concentration and the local shear strain rate. For spherical particles, this diffusivity is given by p = k P d2p np , where p is the volume fraction of particles, dp is the particle diameter, P is the local shear rate, and k and n are constant coefficients, which vary from one study to another (k = 0.0075 and n = 1 in Da Cunha and Hinch [1996], k = 0.33 and n = 2 in Davis and Leighton [1987]; Acrivos et al. [1993], k = 0.5 and n = 2 in Leighton and Acrivos [1987a]). In our experiments, based on the rate of flow within the water-rich layers (stage C in Figure 4), we infer P 0.01 s–1, which leads to p = 10–14 – 10–13 m2 s–1 for a range of k and n found in the literature. Replacing variables in equation (1) with typical values gives Rs = 6 – 27, which is much smaller than ( s/ p)3/2 105 – 106. Therefore, our experimental clouds are unstable to particle diffusive effects and are likely to break in a series of layers.\n[20] In classical double diffusive convection, from dimensional analysis, the thickness of each layer hu in an unbounded system scales as G( s/N)1/2 [Huppert and Turner, 1981; Kelley, 1984], where N = (–gd / dz)1/2 is the local buoyancy frequency and G is a constant. Kelley [1984] shows that G is a function of the ratio Rs and varies over the range 100–800 in both laboratory and natural flows.\nThe maximum number of particle-rich layers nmax observed during an experiment is therefore given by\nnmax = Hu hu = Hu G( s/N)1/2 , (3)\nwhere Hu is the cloud thickness. Replacing variables in equation (3) with values inferred in our experiments gives nmax 10–14, which is consistent with our observations (Table 1). This result confirms that the layered structure observed in our experiments results from particle diffusive convection effects."

    "text": "[21] The development of particle concentration gradients within the cloud strongly influences particle sedimentation since some particles are held in suspension in the layers (stage C in Figure 4). The full characterization of the dynamics of vertical transport of particles from layer to layer from the top of the cloud to the tank floor is complex and would require a new experimental approach and a correspondingly complex multi-layer and fully dynamical model [e.g., Huppert, 1971; Huppert and Linden, 1979], which is beyond the scope of this paper. However, at steady-state, the particle flux through the cloud is ultimately carried by the fingers at the cloud base. Thus, to predict cloud longevity, we need only to characterize the particle flux across the PBL above the density interface forming the cloud base. Provided equation (1) is satisfied, the diffusive convective flux of particles passing from the lower PBL of the cloud to the salt water layer is independent of the lower layer depth and of the form [Turner, 1985; Green, 1987; Hoyal et al., 1999],\nFD = 1 20 (g fˇm)1/3(Cu – Cl)4/3, (4)\nwhere f is the diffusion coefficient of the fastest diffusing substance (i.e., salt). Huppert and Linden [1979] show that this experimentally determined flux law obtained from measurements across a single interface between two layers is also valid where a number of coupled layers evolve with time.\n[22] Assuming (for now) that the diffusive particle convective flux FD is much larger than that related to the sedimentation of individual particles, that the cloud and the underlying salt water layer are well mixed by convective motion, as observed in our experiments, and that the process is occurring under quasi-steady state conditions, conservation of mass in the upper cloud layer and the underlying layer gives\nHu dCu dt = – 1 20 (g sˇm)1/3(Cu – Cl)4/3, (5)\nHl dCl dt = –Hu dCu dt – VsCl, (6)\nwhere Hl is the salt water layer thickness, and Vs is the average settling velocity for our particle size distribution, which is found to be 7 cm s–1. In this simple box model, the cloud and the lower salt water layer boxes are control volumes of fixed height. The longevity of the cloud is governed by the flux of particles across the cloud/salt water layer interface, which is mainly controlled by (Cu –Cl) and to a lesser extent, s. Although equation (6) can be used to calculate the total\ntime required for all the particles to settle, we only use this equation to estimate Cl in equation (5).\n[23] To compare the predictions made using equations (5) and (6) with our experiments, we measure the rate of change of particle content relative to the initial concentration using carefully calibrated variations in transmitted light. Figure 5 shows that our simple model captures the evolution of particle concentration in the umbrella cloud and predicts residence times of the order of 6–8 h, consistent with our experimental observations. This result suggests that following an initial and relatively short-lived period of sedimentation-driven convection, particle diffusive convection governs the vertical flux of particles across the cloud/salt water interface."

    "text": "[24] Carazzo and Jellinek [2012] show that our experiments capture the source conditions governing the dynamics of volcanic jets operating in the layered regime as well as the main dynamics governing sedimentation from the resulting cloud (Figure 6). The following set of dimensionless numbers is used to ensure that our experiments reproduce the main forces acting on natural jets, clouds and intra-cloud layers.\n[25] The Reynolds number (Re) indicates the importance of inertial forces for the flow of the particle-fluid mixture:\nRe = VL , (7)\nwhere V and L are the characteristic velocity and length scales for the flow, and is the kinematic viscosity of the mixture. For the spreading umbrella cloud, the characteristic length and velocity scales are the overshoot height\nhos = zm – zb and the lateral spreading rate Wu = p\nhosg0m, where zm and zb are the maximum and neutral buoyancy heights, respectively [Carazzo and Jellinek, 2012]. Here g0m = g[( – a)/ a]z=zm is the reduced gravity of the jet at the maximum height zm, with a the density of the ambient fluid. For the fully developed intra-cloud layers, L = hu and V = Vf, where Vf = pblgı2pbl/18 is the settling velocity of a blob of PBL with ıpbl the PBL thickness, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and pbl the density difference between the PBL and its underlying water-rich layer.\n[26] The Richardson number (Ri) expresses the strength of the jet at the source relative to the stabilizing environmental density stratification:\nRi = – g0L V2 , (8)\nwhere L = R0, V = U0 and g0 = g[( – a)/ a]0 for the jet, with R0 and U0 the vent radius and exit velocity.\n[27] The Stokes number (St) characterizes the tendency of particles to remain coupled (St << 1) or uncoupled (St >> 1) to turbulent overturning motions:\nSt = pV L , (9)\nwhere p = p d2p/18 f is the particle inertial response time, and f a drag coefficient [Carazzo and Jellinek, 2012]. The sedimentation number (†) indicates the tendency of\nparticles to remain in suspension († << 1) or settle out of the flow († >> 1):\n† = pg V . (10)\nFor the vertical jet, L = R0 and V = U0. For the umbrella cloud, L = hos and V = Wu.\n[28] The particle Reynolds number (Rep) indicates the extent to which inertial forces influence flow at the particle scale:\nRep = Vsdp , (11)\nwhere Vs = pg is the particle terminal fall velocity. [29] Comparing the values of these dimensionless numbers calculated at the base of the turbulent jet in our experiments and for natural flows (see Table S1) shows that the Reynolds number for volcanic jets is too high to be reproduced in our experiments [Carazzo and Jellinek, 2012]. However, our laboratory jets are at high-Re, fully turbulent and conducted under Re conditions comparable to many published studies. Furthermore, the degree of dilution ( p), the Richardson (Ri), Stokes (St) and sedimentation (†) numbers all fall within the range covered by explosive volcanic jets (Figures 6a and 6c) suggesting that our laboratory jets capture the source conditions governing the dynamics of volcanic jets.\n[30] Conditions in our experimental clouds can be compared with those in natural ash clouds by calculating the Reynolds, Stokes, and sedimentation numbers (Figures 6b and 6c). Figure 6b shows that it is impossible to reproduce the high-Re conditions and very low particle concentration\n( p) of volcanic clouds. Our analog clouds are, however, fully turbulent such that their spread is well described by Kotsovinos’ theory for the spread of turbulent intrusions (Figure 3). In addition, our experimental values of the Stokes and sedimentation numbers fall within the wide range covered by the natural ash clouds (Figure 6c) suggesting that laboratory conditions prior to layering are dynamically similar to those driving the transport and sedimentation of fine ash in volcanic clouds. Consequently, we argue that the mechanisms controlling the formation of layers in our experiments must also exist in volcanic clouds enriched in fine ash.\n[31] The long term dynamics of our laboratory clouds is governed by conditions in the layers after break-up. Comparing the values of the Reynolds number in natural and experimental layers shows that volcanic layers are much more turbulent than the laboratory layers (Figure 6d). Volcanic particles may therefore be more efficiently resuspended in each layer but, as discussed in section 2.3, these highly turbulent conditions may increase particleparticle interactions [Solomatov et al., 1993; Solomatov and Stevenson, 1993; Rampall and Leighton, 1994; Huppert et al., 1995; Ziskind and Gutfinger, 2002]. As a result, the hydrodynamic diffusivity will increase and the instabilities observed in our experiments are still expected to occur. Moreover, the particle Reynolds number in volcanic layers is well reproduced in our experiments (Figure 6d) suggesting that the time scales ratios governing particle sedimentation are consistent with the natural phenomenon. Thus, the long term dynamics and sedimentation observed in our experiments is likely to be relevant for volcanic umbrella clouds carrying relatively fine ash.\n[32] Finally, as detailed in section 2.3, sidewall effects such as return flows are negligible in our experiments. The gravitational instabilities giving rise to the fingers in the experiments neither move laterally nor are they sheared by flow driven as a result of sidewall effects. We note that if such effects entered in a significant way in our experiments, neither the scaling for the total number of layers (section 3.1) nor the theoretical models for PBL stability, sedimentation or cloud longevity (section 3.2) would explain our experimental data because they are all independent of the boundaries. Therefore, the layering and sedimentation processes observed in our experiments are expected to occur in volcanic clouds spreading in the atmosphere."

    "text": "[33] Layering is a commonly observed feature in volcanic umbrella clouds composed predominantly of very fine ash such as those related to highly explosive events involving magma-water or magma-ice interactions (Figure 1). Indeed, the 2011 Grimsvötn umbrella cloud was just one example of this class of phenomena. It is well established that turbulent motions acting at all scales enhance the spreading and dispersion of particles in ash clouds (Rose et al. [2000]; Crowe et al. [1998]; Devenish et al. [2012] and Figure 3). However, our experiments as well as previous work [Burns and Meiburg, 2012] show that particle diffusion can play a crucial role in the dynamics of particle sedimentation even in very turbulent flows.\n[34] Applied to natural eruptions, our experiments show that strong vertical mixing in the overshoot region and\nentrainment from a progressively thickening umbrella cloud, leads to the production of an approximately linear density gradient across the depth of the cloud (Figure 7). Assuming that the umbrella cloud is a dilute suspension and that the atmosphere behaves as an ideal gas with a density controlled primarily by temperature, this new density gradient is governed by the structure of the initial vertical temperature profile with additional contributions from the specific heat carried by the ash into the overshoot region [Woods, 1988], from the absorption of solar insolation [Mather et al., 2003] and from the latent heat release associated with moist convection driven as a result of the condensation of entrained water vapor [Glaze et al., 1997]. When a given eruption wanes in intensity or ceases entirely, ash and pyroclasts held initially in suspension by turbulent motions will settle through this density gradient depending on their settling velocities. From our experiments, this sedimentation-driven convection can give rise to periodic layering (Figure 7) and to a particle flux governed by variations in the concentration of particles and in the local strain rates in the wind field. In the atmospheric example in Figure 1, these interfaces are demarcated visually by thin water vapor clouds containing ash. In this picture, the cloud layers themselves are presumably related to the vertical advection, cooling and condensation of water vapor and thus they also trace the large scale flow."

    "text": "[35] For umbrella clouds already in the layered regime, vertical atmospheric variations primarily in temperature define a stable stratification that is perturbed as a result of the intermittent formation and detachment of dense particle boundary layers as fingers. This picture requires that whereas the diffusion of heat is relatively fast and stabilizes the flow against convection by spreading out vertical thermal gradients, the settling and diffusion of fine particles give rise to destabilizing buoyancy effects most clearly expressed as fingers. To quantify the reality and significance of this process, we discuss and constrain the effective diffusivities of heat and ash particles. We neglect effects related to the diffusion of volcanic gases because they contribute little to the density structure of the cloud and have diffusivities that are close to that for heat. Depending on their concentration and size, aerosols may behave in a way similar to ash particles but we do not discuss this issue further.\n[36] From our earlier discussion (cf. equation (1)), a basic criterion for the onset of particle diffusive convection occurring where a warm particle-laden fluid is emplaced above a relatively cold particle-free denser fluid is given by [Green, 1987; Hoyal et al., 1999],\nRT ˛ T ˇm C\nT\np\n3/2 , (12)\nwhere T = Tu –Tl is the temperature difference between the cloud and the atmosphere, and ˛ is the volumetric expansion coefficient for heat. Typical temperature variations between the cloud and the surrounding atmosphere is of the order of 10 K [Woods and Self, 1992; Holasek and Self, 1995; Woods et al., 1995; Holasek et al., 1996b], whereas typical initial particle concentrations in volcanic clouds are of the order of 10–4 – 10–3 kg kg–1 [Bursik et al., 1994; Sparks et al., 1994; Woods, 1995], which give RT 10 – 100.\n[37] The diffusivity of heat T = K/ a(z) cp, with K the thermal conductivity and cp the specific capacity, is relatively straightforward to constrain and varies with altitude according to the density structure of the atmosphere and the cloud. Over the range of altitudes z = 5 – 40 km, T = 2.2 10–5 – 6 10–3 m2 s–1. Particle diffusion is, by contrast, more difficult to understand. Theoretically, this process describes the bulk random-walk motion of groups of particles in response to gradients in flow velocity and concentration [Davis, 1996; Hoyal et al., 1999]. This theory may be applied to sedimentation from umbrella clouds only if the dynamics of individual particles do not enter significantly into the process. In particular, neither particle inertia nor particle buoyancy can influence significantly the flow regime or the distribution of particles. This dynamical condition is met for small particles with Stokes (St) and sedimentation (†) numbers that are much less than 1. For typical values of cloud thickness (Hu 0.5 – 10 km), cloud spreading rate (Wu 0.5 – 60 m s–1) and particle density ( p 2000 kg m–3 for fine volcanic ash), the conditions St < 0.1 and† < 0.1 are always reached for particles smaller than 10 m.\n[38] The diffusivity of particles smaller than 10 m can be estimated from theoretical calculations (see section 3.1). Using a typical shear strain rate P = 0.001 – 0.007 s–1 [Dürbeck and Gerz, 1996] and a typical particle volume fraction p = 10–6 – 10–5 [Bursik et al., 1994; Sparks et al., 1994; Woods, 1995], we infer p = 10–18 – 10–8 m2 s–1 for 0.1 – 10 m-sized particles. In spite of the uncertainties on p, the criterion given by equation (12) is verified since ( T/ p)3/2 105 – 1023 is much larger than the range estimated for RT (i.e., 10–100). As a consequence, volcanic ash-clouds are unstable to particle diffusive effects driven by the sedimentation of particles smaller than 10 m."

    "text": "[39] Whereas the criterion given by equation (12) determines whether multicomponent convection can occur in volcanic clouds, this condition provides no indication of\nthe influence of this mechanism on the vertical flux of ash compared to that carried by individual particle settling. Accordingly, following the approach of Green [1987], we introduce a second criterion quantifying the tendency of fingers to transport volcanic ash, the flux ratio\nF* = FD FI , (13)\nwhere FI = VsCu is the flux of particles when individual particle settling dominates and FD is given by equation (4) together with f = T. Replacing FD and FI by their expressions gives\nF* = (g Tˇm)1/3 C4/3 20VsCu 9 ( TˇmCu) 1/3 10g2/3 pd2p , (14)\nwhich assumes that the effect of particle content on the density of the atmosphere is negligible (i.e., C Cu) and that particles are small. Replacing constants parameters in equation (14) with appropriate values (i.e., g = 9.81 m s–2, = 1.4 10–5 Pa s, ˇm 1, and p = 2, 000 kg m–3 [Rose et al., 2001; Mather et al., 2003]) gives\nF* 1375 \" TCu\nd6p\n#1/3 , (15)\nwhere dp is in microns, Cu has units of mass/mass and T is in m2 s–1. The flux ratio F* depends primarily on the mean particle size (dp), with only a very weak dependence on the thermal diffusivity ( T) and particle concentration (Cu). Thus, where the solid fraction in the cloud is mainly made of large particles, the F* number is very small (< 0.01) and individual particle settling dominates. On the other hand, for very fine particles the F* number is large (> 100) and particle diffusive convection should govern sedimentation from the cloud. Where 0.01 < F* < 100 both sedimentation processes contribute to the longevity of ash clouds.\n[40] To apply our proposed model to observed eruptions, we require constraints on the concentration and size\nof the solid particles in the cloud. Figure 8 shows realtime measurements performed during six recent eruptions (see also Table S2): the 1980 Mount St Helens, the 1982 El Chichon, the 1991 Mt Pinatubo, the 1991 Mt Hudson, the 1992 Mt Spurr, and the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull events. Particle sizes and concentrations reported in Figure 8 and Table S2 have been measured using a variety of remotesensing techniques including ground-based LIDAR observations, balloon-borne measurements, direct aircraft sampling and satellite data (TOMS, AVHRR), which have certain limitations. For instance, satellite visible and thermal infrared split-window techniques are unable to measure particles larger than a few tens of microns [Rose et al., 2000], whereas LIDAR signals cannot penetrate through thick clouds. A detailed discussion of the limitations imposed by these techniques is beyond the scope of this paper [for more detail, see Schumann et al. [2012]]. Here, we assume that most of the largest particles have already settled and thus do not affect the sedimentation of the finest fraction of ash (dp < 100 m).\n[41] For all the eruptions reported here, the total particle concentration and mean particle size decline monotonically in time. Consistency between the behaviors of the total concentration and particle size suggests that in spite of the limitations imposed by the different observational methodologies applied [Schumann et al., 2012], existing real-time measurements give reliable values for particle size and concentration. Comparing the theoretical transition given by equation (15) with these measurements reveals that condi-\ntions for which F* = 0.01 (i.e., the flux of particles from diffusive convection represents 1% of the total flux) is reached quickly after the jet phase of the eruption ends, depending on the altitude of the cloud (Figure 8). Thus, particle sedimentation from the 1982 El Chichon ( 18 km altitude) and 1991 Mt Pinatubo ( 22 km altitude) ash-clouds may have been influenced by diffusive convection processes soon after the initial spread of their respective umbrella clouds. Diffusive convective effects may also emerge very shortly after the eruption where explosive magma-ice interaction produces large amounts of very fine ash (equation (15)), consistent with the pronounced layering observed near the source during the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull [Slingo, 2010] and the 2011 Grimsvötn (Figure 1) eruptions. An additional important remark from Figure 8 is that conditions for which the process of individual particle settling can be neglected (i.e., F* > 100) are unlikely to exist in nature."

    "text": "[42] Because most observed natural conditions are characterized by F* 0.01 – 100 (Figure 8), effects related to both individual particle settling and diffusive convection must be included in a model for sedimentation. The flux of particles crossing the cloud/atmosphere interface Fp is\nFp = FD + FI, (16)\nwhich has been verified in our experiments to a 95% confidence and also in published laboratory experiments involving both small and large particles [Hoyal et al., 1999]. We then modify equation (5) to give an evolution equation for particle concentration:\ndCu dt = – 1 20Hu (g Tˇm)1/3(Cu – Cl)4/3 – Vs Hu Cu. (17)\nNoting that (Cu – Cl) Cu because the effect of particle content on the density of the atmosphere is negligible, we integrate equation (17) with the initial condition Cu = C0(t = 0) to obtain:\nCu = C–1/30 + exp Vs 3Hu t – –3 , (18)\nwhere = (g Tˇm)1/3/ 20Vs. For large particles with high settling velocities ! 0 and equation (18) can be rewritten\nCu = C0 exp – Vs Hu t , (19)\nwhich is the classical exponential decay law resulting from a flux by individual particle settling [Hazen, 1904]. In the limit of small particles (i.e., Vs << (Hu/t)), we Taylor expand\nthe exponential part of the expression and equation (18) is to first order:\nCu\nC–1/30 +\n1 + Vst 3Hu – –3 , (20)\nor Cu\nC–1/30 + (g Tˇm) 1/3 t 3Hu –3 , (21)\nwhich recovers the classical t–3 decay law where the diffusive flux dominates [Hoyal et al., 1999]. Therefore, equation (18) can be used for any particle size and concentration satisfying the criterion given in equation (12).\n[43] Figure 9 compares the theoretical predictions for the change in particle concentration with time with the realtime measurements conducted during the 1982 El Chichon, the 1991 Mt Pinatubo and the August and September 1992 Mt Spurr eruptions. We selected these four eruptions because time series of total particle concentration and effective mean radius are available particularly near the start of each event. In addition, the stability criterion given by equation (12) is verified for all four events and, thus, diffusive particle convection is expected to be important. Figure 9 shows that the classical exponential decay law for individual particle settling (equation (19)) is inconsistent with the time series data and also generally overestimates the cloud longevity. As will be discussed in greater\ndetail in the next section, this divergence is commonly interpreted as a result of the premature fallout of aggregated fine ash [e.g., Rose et al., 2000]: Small ash particles become larger and thus fall out more quickly. In contrast, theoretical predictions obtained with equation (18) capture the trends in the time series in Figure 9 remarkably well and show that both individual particle settling and diffusive convection processes are required to explain the particle concentration data. Quantitatively, the theoretical fit to the data in a least-squares sense give agreements at a 98%, 89%, 91% and 95% confidence level for the 1982 El Chichon, the 1991 Mt Pinatubo, and the August and September 1992 Mt Spurr eruptions, respectively. Moreover, this result shows that the data demand no ad hoc adjustment to the particle size as a result of particle aggregation. We note that the obvious disagreement between our model and observations made 1.5 days after the 1991 Mt Pinatubo eruption corresponds to a sudden change in cloud surface area, which started to decrease after the first 38 h [Guo et al., 2004a]. As a result, particle concentration estimates based on measurements of total mass of ash and cloud surface area are found to be higher than expected."

    "heading": "5.1. Residence Time",
    "text": "[45] Whereas a contribution of the flux related to individual particle settling is required to explain the data in Figure 8, our experiments are understood assuming a diffusive convective flux alone. Qualitatively, this difference in behavior is a consequence of the time scale for diffusive convection TD being much smaller than the time scale for individual particle settling TI in our experiments and of TI TD in natural eruption clouds.\n[46] Quantitatively, the residence time of suspended particles is given by T = HuC0/Fp, which can be rewritten as\nT = HuC0 FD + FI = TITD TI + TD , (22)\nwhere TI = Hu/Vs is the residence time for individual settling [Hazen, 1904], and TD = 20Hu[g TˇmC0]–1/3 is the residence time for particle diffusive convection [Green, 1987]. Comparing these two end-member time scales leads to TI/TD = . As discussed in section 4.5, for large particles is small (i.e., TI << TD) and equation (22) gives T TI. In this case, the residence time of suspended particles is given by the settling flux and the contribution of the diffusive flux\nis negligible. For small particles, however, is large (i.e., TI >> TD) and equation (22) gives T TD. In this second extreme case, the residence time is mainly controlled by the diffusive flux.\n[47] In our experiments, is large and the rate of change of particle content in the cloud is imposed by the diffusive flux only. In volcanic ash-clouds, however, the relative importance of both processes on the residence time depends on the particle size range. Replacing variables in TI and TD by typical values (i.e., Hu = 0.5 – 10 km; Vs = 10–3 – 102 m s–1; T = 10–5 – 10–3 m2 s–1; C0 = 10–4 – 10–3 kg kg–1) gives residence times of a few seconds to a few days for TI ( 5 – 105 s) and a few days to a few years for TD ( 105 – 108 s). Thus, except for very fine particles the diffusive flux is generally smaller than that carried by individual particle settling. However, for fine particles, where TI TD, the residence time (equation (22)) becomes T TI/2 and the time scale for complete sedimentation where both individual settling and diffusive convection occur concurrently is reduced relative to expectations from individual settling alone (Figure 9). Interestingly, the different time scales for sedimentation suggest that particle diffusive convection may also influence the sorting of the bed deposit. However, the particle sizes involved in diffusive convection processes are so small (Figure 8) that evidence of this behavior may be difficult to find in the field because fine particles can easily be dispersed by winds in the underlying atmospheric layer."

    "heading": "5.2. Particle Aggregation",
    "text": "[48] A popular way to reconcile the data in Figure 9 with the classical exponential decay law (equation (19)) is to assume efficient particle aggregation or ice-ash meteor formation. Because Vs / d 2p and, thus TI / d –2p , the resulting increase in mean particle size related to this phenomenon is thought to drive the premature fallout of volcanic ash observed in Figure 9. Although aggregation is an important process in volcanic clouds [Mather et al., 2003], an observational challenge with this interpretation is that there is no published evidence of this process in particle size data either from the ash clouds [Rose et al., 2000] or from ash deposits for the four eruptions reported in Figure 9. For example, whereas satellite measurements [Guo et al., 2004a] suggest that ice-ash meteors may be present in the 1991 Mt Pinatubo cloud, Guo et al. [2004a] are careful to conclude that more work is required to refine their interpretation. Rose and Durant [2008] hypothesize that ice hydrometeors formation is the most plausible explanation for the rapid removal of fine particles from the 1982 El Chichon cloud, but underscore that no sign of this process can be found in the field. Durant and Rose [2009] suggest that the same ash removal process is highly likely to have occurred during the 1992 Mt Spurr eruptions, but acknowledge that there were not widespread observations of aggregate fall during these eruptions. On the other hand, satellite measurements of the 1982 El Chichon [Schneider et al., 1999], 1991 Mt Pinatubo [Guo et al., 2004a], and 1992 Mt Spurr [Rose et al., 2001] eruption clouds show that the mean effective particle radius decreases as a function of time during these four eruptions. These actual observations are at odds with expectations from aggregation processes, which result in the production of larger particles as a function of time\n[Rose et al., 2000] as observed during the 1991 Mt Hudson eruption [Constantine et al., 2000]. Any ad hoc adjustment to the particle size resulting from possible particle aggregation/ice-ash meteor formation in order to explain the data in Figure 9 with the classical sedimentation law (equation (19)) is inconsistent with real-time field observations.\n[49] A mechanical challenge for aggregation mechanisms is an inherent difficulty in producing aggregates rapidly after the cloud emplacement at the LNB. Aggregation efficiency is highly sensitive to collision kinetic energy (CKE) and drops rapidly as the CKE increases [Telling and Dufek, 2012]. The mean free path between particles in a mixture with concentration of 10–4 – 10–3 kg kg–1 [Bursik et al., 1994; Sparks et al., 1994; Woods, 1995] is large and so the efficiency of collision is very low. In these conditions, aggregation processes are not predicted to be important. Interestingly, the instabilities investigated in this paper provide a potentially crucial way to enable aggregation processes to occur as they produce a mechanism to generate regions with locally large ash concentrations (i.e., PBLs). Ash aggregation might be enhanced because the mean free path between particles becomes smaller and the collisional energy is low. Understanding the coupled effects of particle diffusive convection and ash aggregation is not straightforward on the basis of our experiments alone where no aggregation is observed. However, using the experiments of Telling and Dufek [2012] we estimate that where particle concentration reaches values up to 10 times larger than the initial particle content in the cloud, the CKE drops by perhaps an order of magnitude leading to a proportional increase in the efficiency of aggregation from 0 – 5% to several tens of percent. Consequently, although we argue that aggregation processes may not have played a significant role in fallout early after the beginning of the 1982 El Chichon, the 1991 Mt Pinatubo, and the 1992 Mt Spurr eruptions, this phenomenon may have occurred later promoted by PBLs formation."

    "heading": "6. Conclusion",
    "text": "[50] We have used an extensive series of laboratory experiments simulating an explosive volcanic eruption and a thorough review of published data to show that particle sedimentation from volcanic ash-clouds can be strongly affected by particle diffusive convection. From the experiments, a remarkable production of periodic layering and its effect on particle sedimentation involve three main processes that arise, in turn. First, extensive mixing across the density interface that defines the LNB for the erupting column, as well as between the column and the thickening cloud, causes a progressive growth of an umbrella with an internal approximately linear density gradient. Whereas in the experiments, the density gradient is defined by variations in the concentration of salt, in natural umbrella clouds, this stratification is defined primarily by vertical variations in temperature. Second, following cessation of the volcanic jet convection within the cloud driven by the settling of ash particles of different size through this density gradient causes the umbrella to break up into layers demarcated by thin, particle-rich layers or PBLs. Third, once in the layered regime, the vertical transfer of particles from the top of the cloud to its base, as\nwell as the average flux of particles from the cloud base to the ground, is governed by intermittent gravitational instabilities to these PBLs, which take the form of particle-rich fingers, and is an example of “particle diffusive convection” [Green, 1987].\n[51] A crucial difference to the conventional view is that in this layered regime, rather than being set by the Lagrangian dynamics of individual particle settling, the sedimentation flux is governed by the gravitational stability of PBLs, which is controlled by the average structure and physical properties of these particle-fluid mixtures. Our theoretical model for the rate of change of particle content in volcanic ash-clouds, which has been independently validated by laboratory experiments, captures for the first time the character of real-time measurements of the rate of change of umbrella cloud particle concentration during the 1982 El Chichon, 1991 Mt Pinatubo and 1992 Mt Spurr eruptions. We demonstrate that cloud layering is favored for highly-explosive events in which the eruption cloud has a high concentration of very fine ash. More generally, however, we show that ash sedimentation in a number of historic ash clouds involved both individual particle settling and diffusive particle convection. Finally, whereas particle diffusive convection alone tends to slow down sedimentation as observed in our experiments, where both diffusive convection and individual particle settling are of similar importance, the fallout of particles is enhanced relative to expectations from individual particle settling. Thus, processes such as particle aggregation may not be as generically important as is assumed commonly and is certainly not required to explain volcanic umbrella longevity.\nNotation cp: specific heat capacity (J kg–1 K–1) dp: particle diameter (m)\nf: drag factor g: acceleration of gravity (m s–2)\ng0: reduced gravity (m s–2) g0m: reduced gravity at z = zm (m s–2) hos: jet overshoot height (m) hu: thickness of an individual layer (m) k: constant coefficient n: constant coefficient\nnmax: maximum number of layers predicted nobs: maximum number of layers observed\nt: time (s) z: altitude (m)\nzb: neutral buoyancy height (m) zm: maximum column height (m) B: buoyancy flux (m4 s–3) C: particle concentration (kg kg–1) Fp: flux of particles (kg m–2 s–1) G: proportionality constant H: layer thickness (m) K: thermal conductivity (W m–1 K–1) L: characteristic length scale (m) M: momentum flux (m4 s–2) N: stratification frequency (s–1) Q: volume flux (m3 s–1) Ru: umbrella cloud radius (m) R0: vent radius (m)\nS: salinity (p.s.u.)

  "abstractText": "[1] Understanding the longevity of volcanic ash-clouds generated by powerful explosive eruptions is a long standing problem for assessing volcanic hazards and the nature and time scale of volcanic forcings on climate change. It is well known that the lateral spreading and longevity of these clouds is influenced by stratospheric winds, particle settling and turbulent diffusion. Observations of the recent 2010 Eyjafjallajökull and 2011 Grimsvötn umbrella clouds, as well as the structure of atmospheric aerosol clouds from the 1991 Mt Pinatubo event, suggest that an additional key process governing the cloud dynamics is the production of internal layering. Here, we use analog experiments on turbulent particle-laden umbrella clouds to show that this layering occurs where natural convection driven by particle sedimentation and the differential diffusion of primarily heat and fine particles give rise to a large scale instability. Where umbrella clouds are particularly enriched in fine ash, this “particle diffusive convection” strongly influences the cloud longevity. More generally, cloud residence time will depend on fluxes due to both individual settling and diffusive convection. We develop a new sedimentation model that includes both sedimentation processes, and which is found to capture real-time measurements of the rate of change of particle concentration in the 1982 El Chichon, 1991 Mt Pinatubo and 1992 Mt Spurr ash-clouds. A key result is that these combined sedimentation processes enhance the fallout of fine particles relative to expectations from individual settling suggesting that particle aggregation is not the only mechanism required to explain volcanic umbrella longevity.",
