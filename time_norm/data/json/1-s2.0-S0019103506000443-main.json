    "text": "Pitted debris cones occur across the northern plains volcanic province of Elysium Planitia (Fig. 1), singly, or in clusters of many hundreds (Fig. 2). They are assumed to be explosive in origin, so-called ‘rootless’ cones that result from the interaction of molten lava with near surface ground ice in former fluvial and lacustrine environments (Lanagan et al., 2001). They form within platy, patterned ground, generally considered to be volcanic in origin and a product of lava flows that issued from the eruptive fissures of the Cerberus Fossae (e.g., Keszthelyi et al., 2000; Hartmann and Berman, 2000; Plescia, 2003).

These similarities would make martian rootless cones and pingos difficult to distinguish remotely, and the polygonal fracture of the patterned substrate is common\nto permafrozen ground and cooling lava alike (Lachenbruch, 1962). Hence, the view of the Cerberus cones as volcanic stems primarily from interpretation of the underlying platy deposits as lava (e.g., Fagents et al., 2002; Lanagan et al., 2001; Greeley and Fagents, 2001), while the case for pingos is made by the consistent association of cones and polygonal ground, typical of terrestrial periglacial environments (Lucchitta, 1981; French, 1996; Mackay, 1998; Burr et al., 2005). As such, both landforms are evidence for the presence of near surface volatiles, or ground ice, but their genetic differences (i.e., explosive vs intrusive) should be reflected in their stratigraphical relations with other deposits. For a ‘rootless’ volcanic origin, lava and cones are co-formational, so structures postdating deposition of the platy substrate, such as impact craters, must also postdate the cones. If the cones can be shown to intrude or crosscut landforms that formed later than the platy deposits, this will rule out a phreatomagmatic origin. While eruptive, or ‘rooted’ cinder cones situated over a vent are not subject to this stratigraphical restriction (i.e., such cones might reflect later volcanic activity at depth, unrelated to the platy deposits), no lava flows are associated with any of the cones in Fig. 2, or have been described for any of the cones reported from the Cerberus\nplains; indeed, it is the very absence of such lava that forms the basis for their ‘rootless’ identification (e.g., Lanagan et al., 2001; Fagents et al., 2002). As explosive, hydrovolcanic structures generated by the interaction of magma with surface water or groundwater, neither maars, nor more effusive tuff rings can explain the formation of these cones; the absence of summit craters in many of the smaller cones (e.g., Fig. 4d) is inconsistent with an origin as explosive, constructional landforms."

    "heading": "2. Stratigraphical observations: Distal Athabasca Valles",
    "text": "MOC E10-00998, in SW Athabasca Valles (Fig. 2 [context: Fig. 1]), shows a sinuous cluster of ∼400 cones extending across 8 km. The cluster traces a meandering path through channelised patterned ground dominated by kilometre-scale platy rafts (Fig. 2a). The relative age-relationships where this cluster intersects a small (<70 m) impact crater, cutting the rim in two places (Figs. 2b–2d), indicate that an origin by lava–ice interaction is not possible. The sequence of events (summarised in Fig. 2e) is: (1) deposition of platy ground, (2) impact cratering, and (3) cone formation. The cones superpose the crater rim (so postdate cratering), yet the ‘lavas’ supposedly responsible\nfor ice volatilisation and cone formation lie beneath the craters (therefore, precede impact). This MOC strip shows more than 30 craters on this flow surface [all of similar size, and likely a secondary impact cluster (e.g., McEwen et al., 2005)]. This surface must have been solid to record this event, and while it is possible that impact occurred while the interior of this presumed lava flow was still molten, the likelihood that this impact happened in the time interval between flow emplacement and ice vaporisation (that is, during phreatomagmatic reaction) is improbable in the extreme."

    "heading": "3. Impact cratering and circularity",
    "text": "The boundaries of this crater (as defined by the rim interaction with the cones) provide information about the impacting projectile and inferred sequence of events. A primary impactor would strike the surface at near-original cosmic velocity (>11 km/s), leaving a crater 20–30 times larger than the projectile diameter (French, 1998). A secondary impactor (i.e., material ejected from a primary impact elsewhere on the surface) may also travel at hypervelocity, but is typically of lower velocity, and excavates a crater only slightly larger than the projectile itself (French, 1998). For both impact outcomes, the survival of pre-existing landforms within the crater rim (as for the cones of Fig. 2) is not possible. Material forming the rim of a primary (or high velocity secondary) impact crater represents compressed, structurally uplifted surface material in which strata are inverted at the rim crest (where uplift is greatest), out to 1.6 crater radii (Melosh, 1989). Experimental and numerical studies of crater growth and collapse (e.g., Shoemaker, 1963; Maxwell, 1977; Melosh, 1989; Turtle et al., 2005) show deformation and emplacement of this ‘overturned flap’ of rocks, illustrating how the surface between the transient crater diameter (i.e., the point at which radial growth ceases) and the final crater rim is ejected during crater excavation. This is the surface occupied by the cones, and prohibits the survival of pre-impact landforms in this region. For small craters, where no significant collapse occurs, ejecta are emplaced ballistically and form the greater part of the rim height (Melosh, 1989). This early stage of crater formation is fundamentally the same for all craters, regardless of size (Turtle et al., 2005). Either a small projectile travelling at high velocity excavated this crater, in which\ncase the cones at the crater rim would not survive impact, or a lower velocity impactor, little smaller than the resulting crater was responsible, and would have obliterated these landforms on contact. Post-impact, the rim would be expected to superpose pre-existing landforms, whereas the opposite is observed. The only possible interpretation (of Fig. 2) is that this crater is older than the two neighbouring cones, one of which visibly overprints the crater rim; whatever its origin, it clearly formed after this secondary crater (Melosh, H.J., personal communication, 2005).\nDeformation of the crater rim by formation of the cones is confirmed by measurements of circularity. Due to limited image resolution (∼10 pixels to the crater diameter), four different tracings of the rim were made, each at different enlargements and contrasts. Circularity was measured by four different methods for each of these, giving a perfect circle a value of 1, and other shapes greater than unity (the value being larger the more non-circular the shape).\n1. The Radial line method:\n1 + 1/R N∑\ni=1 [R − ri],\nwhere R = (1/N)∑Ni=1 ri and ri are the individual measured distances from the centre of figure to the crater rim. In this case, N (the number of measurements) was always set at 16;\n2. Miller’s circularity ratio:\nP2/4πA,\nwhere P = crater perimeter and A = crater area; 3. Schumm’s elongation ratio:\nDmax/2 √ (π/A),\nwhere Dmax is the length of the largest axis passing through the crater centre of figure;\n4. Maximum and minimum diameters:\nDmax/Dmin,\nwhere Dmax is the minimum axis passing through the centre of figure.\nTaking the mean of these four different methods of measuring circularity, Murray and Guest (1970) showed that, irrespective of topographic or geological setting, terrestrial impact craters have mean circularity 1.20 ± 0.07, Lunar impact craters 1.16 ± 0.05, and artificial explosion craters 1.16 ± 0.06\n(standard deviation in each case). The four different measures of the impact rim in Fig. 2, however, give a mean circularity of 1.75 ± 0.25, supporting the stratigraphical interpretation that the cones on the rim postdate crater formation."

    "text": "Athabasca Valles\nSimilar age relations are in evidence ∼200 km upstream (Fig. 4a [context: Fig. 1]), where MOC R12-03203 (a superresolution ‘cPROTO’ [compensated Pitch and Roll Targeted Observation (Malin and Edgett, 2005)]) view of the channel shows cones in the same patterned ground within a floodformed (Burr et al., 2004) dune field. Here, the cones again form the latest event, erupting through patterned ground and overlying dunes. There is no evidence of streamlining of sediment behind the cones in Fig. 4, as would be expected if the cones predate the dunes (Burr et al., 2005), and of the 60 cones that crosscut these dunes, none show any sign of flood modification, or embayment by sediment (Fig. 4m). Fig. 4c shows the rays of a small impact crater affected by a number of collapsed, complex cones. This crater is one of a linear cluster whose ejecta cover individual dunes (‘CR,’ Fig. 4a; cf. Fig. 2), so impact must postdate these bedforms. Identical patterned ground and cones have been exhumed (from below the Medusae Fossae Formation) in southern Elysium, but this cannot be the case here, as the Athabascan cones clearly postdate the platy, patterned ground of Fig. 2. These stratigraphical relationships indicate an intrusive, rather than erosional contact between cones and dunes, and the following sequence of events (summarised in Fig. 4b): (1) deposition of patterned ground, (2) dune deposition, (3) impact cratering, and (4) cone formation. Magma–ice interaction might produce this apparent superposition of phreatic and fluvial features if water were to flow over recently emplaced lava [the relative timing involved for the ∼10 m thick flows of the Cerberus Plains (Plescia, 1990) would require that these two events be separated by less than five years (Patrick et al., 2004)], but as it is ice vaporisation and explosive expansion that excavate such lavas [forming the ‘rootless’ construct around the explosion site (Greeley and Fagents, 2001)], confining pressure would not arise, and such water would simply boil on contact. Fagents et al. (2002) suggest that it is the stratigraphical characteristics of candidate martian rootless cones that rule out a non-volcanic origin, but these same criteria, applied in the same study area, actually require a non-volcanic origin."

    "heading": "5. Intrusive ice mounds",
    "text": "If lava–ice interaction is not a viable mechanism for the formation of these martian landforms, the <1 m/pixel resolution (1.5 m cross-track, 50 cm downtrack) of MOC cPROTO offers convincing evidence of an alternative, permafrost origin for the cones. Pingos form through doming of frozen ground due to freezing of water under hydraulic or hydrostatic pressure. A continuous, two-fold classification recognises a hydraulic, or ‘open system’ pingo type, indicating groundwater circulation (the result of artesian pressure, or permafrost aggradation beneath abandoned river channels), and a hydrostatic, or ‘closed system’ pingo type that generally forms following rapid lake drainage (these pingos also driven by basinward permafrost growth, but without the through-going water passage of hydraulic pingos). Both rely on a pressure system (which may\nor may not relate to freezing elsewhere, or to hydraulic head for open system pingo genesis) to deliver groundwater to the frozen mound core (Gurney, 1998).\nUntil pingos grow, and rupture, they have no summit depressions (e.g., Fig. 4i: small pingo, Canadian Arctic). It is difficult to see how this could be the case for explosive, volcanic structures since many of the smaller Athabascan examples shown in Figs. 2 and 4 have no summit craters (some terrestrial rootless cones also lack such craters [i.e., the Álftaver group in Iceland (Greeley and Fagents, 2001)], but these have been substantially reworked, and un-eroded cones in the same area retain their summit craters intact (Fagents et al., 2002)). If this characteristic alone does not exclude a magmatic origin, a postdepositional explanation is more consistent with the superposition relationships, and the common observation that the martian cones are not rafted or deformed by flow of the ‘lavas’ that (appear to) underlie them (Thordarson, 2000; Lanagan et al., 2001; Greeley and Fagents, 2001).\nIndications of growth are evident in the summit fractures exhibited by many of the larger cones in Fig. 4 (i.e., 4j– 4k; 4m): orthogonal, tensional (or dilation) cracks propagate downslope from their summits, as in terrestrial pingos (e.g., Fig. 4l), and predicted for progressive, mechanically induced failure (Lachenbruch, 1962). The shallow, rimmed depressions of Fig. 4c resemble pingo ‘scars,’ typical of collapsed, melted frost mounds (Gurney and Worsley, 1996; Gurney, 1998), and Fig. 4h shows individual cone margins which appear to have merged to form overlapping, composite structures, comparable to the preferential formation of new pingos in the footprint of older, collapsing pingos (Gurney, 1998) [and distinct from the nested summit craters of rootless cones (Lanagan et al., 2001)] on Earth. MOC cPROTO shows the field relationships of this patterned ground in new detail: the polygonal sculpture is clear in Figs. 4c and 4h, with many of the cones displaying circumferential moats that truncate polygon margins (e.g., Fig. 4h, arrowed; 4c) or assume the polygonal form of the substrate (as in the striking six-sided example of Fig. 4g). There is little prospect that these are pyroclastic mantles (Greeley and Fagents, 2001; Fagents et al., 2002), or that this patterned ground signifies thermal contraction in lava (e.g., Lanagan and McEwen, 2003), rather, similar depressions are seen around terrestrial pingos, reflecting episodic growth and melting from beneath the mound (Mackay, 1998).\nOne common characteristic of pingos, usually concealed by 1–10 m of overburden, is the core of massive ice (French, 1996). Exposure and melting of this ice is the first stage in pingo decay, growth and extension proceeding until the overburden falls away, and the exposed ice is lost by ablation. Total loss of this core and collapse is the final stage in the cycle. Central features are visible in many of the mounds of Fig. 4 (e.g., Fig. 4e), and it is suggested that this cycle of growth and decay (represented in Fig. 4n), is what is seen in the Athabasca Valles: small, youthful, uncratered mounds (4d), grow and become fractured (4j–4k), ice-cored-cratered (4e), open-cratered (4f), and collapsed (4c), before starting anew (4h). Exposed icecored pingos are rare, and usually short-lived on Earth, so their presence on Mars would indicate that current surface conditions\nare able to support active, perennial, ice-rich landforms comparable to those of terrestrial cold-climate environments.\nThese cones are fluvial in context, their clustering characteristic of hydraulic (or ‘open-system’) pingo genesis and groundwater circulation. Large fluvial systems in the discontinuous permafrost zone can sustain unfrozen zones (or taliks) at depth that are pressurised by encroaching permafrost following river channel abandonment [prime examples are the Canadian Arctic pingos of Banks Island (see Pissart and French, 1977)]. As groundwater source for pingo growth in the Athabasca Valles, such taliks are consistent with geomorphic evidence for recent aqueous floods that originated from the Cerberus Fossae (Burr et al., 2002), the shared hydraulic source [of open-system pingos] accounting for their most characteristic feature in the terrestrial environment: new pingo growth within collapsed pingos, giving rise to a collection of landforms in various states of growth and decay (Gurney, 1998), similar to what is observed in the Athabasca Valles. Recent Mars climate models suggest the long-term survival of ground ice (deposited at high obliquity) long after it ceases to be stable at the surface (Mischna et al., 2003), so these cones may reflect near-surface volatile transport driven by permafrost aggradation, but otherwise unstable with respect to sublimation. The metres-thick overburden that lies above the pingo, shielding the ice core, would form an effective barrier to sublimation, at least prior to summit rupture, and similarly, to the detection of such ice. The Neutron and Gamma Ray Spectrometers onboard Mars Odyssey have found little evidence of subsurface ice equatorward of 45◦ N and 60◦ S, but these instruments only sense ice in the top metre of the regolith, and if this is itself desiccated (as would be expected at these low latitudes, where water is least stable) ice can no longer be detected from orbit (Feldman et al., 2004).\nThis interpretation does not exclude alternative explanations for comparable structures elsewhere on Mars that do not involve lava or ground ice [e.g., mud volcanism (Tanaka, 1997), evaporite deposition around springs and geysers (Farrand et al., 2005), or piping structures (Mahaney et al., 2004)], but these typify volatile release in wet, sedimentary environments, and are similarly incompatible with the current view of these deposits as lithified lava flows, if not the permafrost origin advanced here."

    "text": "These structures have implications for substantial numbers (∼107) of small, secondary craters (<200 m) associated with the rays of Zunil crater, ∼400 km east of the Athabasca Valles (McEwen et al., 2005). Some 80% of the craters superimposed over the floor of this channel system are described as originating from this single impact event. Surface ages for this region (as derived by crater counts) are <10 Myr (Hartmann and Berman, 2000; Burr et al., 2002; Murray et al., 2005), and McEwen et al. (2005) rightly suggest that the extension in ages implied by such secondary craters may not justify correlation of apparently youthful geological activity with recent obliquity cycles (Head et al., 2003), or sustain evidence for recent climate change on Mars (Mustard et al., 2001). These craters have light, high-albedo ejecta that form a very distinc-\ntive facies (Grier and Hartmann, 2000), identical to that of Figs. 2 and 4 (which fall within the Zunil rays, as mapped), show wind erosion elsewhere in the Cerberus plains (e.g., MOC E16-01783), and will only be present around the very youngest craters (McEwen et al., 2005). These light ejecta can be seen within the collapsed cones, partially covering mound interiors, yet are quite consistent with a post-impact origin. Pingos form through slow doming of the ground surface over many decades; following collapse, it is entirely to be expected that they are infilled by the deposits they intrude. If this single impact event formed all of these craters, then putative pingos—one of the very few known proofs of the existence of permafrost on Earth (Mackay, 1998)—visibly postdate them, providing evidence for recent, possibly even ongoing, climate change on Mars. Given the widespread documentation of other periglacial, permafrost features elsewhere in the northern plains [e.g., ice-wedge polygons and thermokarst (Lucchitta, 1981; Squyres et al., 1992; Scott et al., 1995; Siebert and Kargel, 2001; Costard and Baker, 2001)] there is good reason to suppose that this proof is also applicable to Mars."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "Pitted cones occur in platy, polygonally patterned ground throughout the Cerberus plains of Mars, and have until now been thought to represent the products of explosive lava–ice interaction (Lanagan et al., 2001; Fagents et al., 2002). This geomorphic association of cones and platy, patterned ground is central to accounts of repeated volcanic and aqueous floods (Burr et al., 2002) and widespread inflated lava flows (Greeley and Fagents, 2001; Thordarson, 2000; Keszthelyi et al., 2000) in the Cerberus plains region during the late Amazonian. This region is the type area for late-stage flood volcanism on Mars (Plescia, 1990), and source for the platy, ridged flows of the Marte Vallis outflow channel that debouch into Amazonis Planitia (Keszthelyi et al., 2000; Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Plescia, 2003). Stratigraphical relations between cones and platy, patterned ground in the Athabasca Valles indicate that such cones are post-depositional, and likely intrusive frost mounds, or ‘pingos,’ more consistent with platy, patterned ground as icy (Brakenridge, 1993; Rice et al., 2002; Murray et al., 2005), than volcanic."

  "abstractText": "‘Rootless’ debris cones (or pseudocraters) occur in platy, patterned ground throughout the Cerberus plains of Mars and are thought to represent the products of explosive magma–ice interaction [Lanagan et al., 2001. Geophys. Res. Lett. 28, 2365–2368; Fagents et al., 2002. In: Smellie, J.L., Chapman, M.G. (Eds.), Volcano–Ice Interaction on Earth and Mars. In: Geol. Soc. Spec. Publ., vol. 202, pp. 295–317]. Requiring lava and water interspersed, they are central to theories of multiple magmatic and aqueous flood events [Burr et al., 2002. Icarus 159, 53–73; Berman, D.C., Hartmann, W.K., 2002. Icarus 159, 1–17] and widespread sheet volcanism [Keszthelyi et al., 2000. J. Geophys. Res. 105, 15027–15049] in the region during the late Amazonian (a region reported to have been occupied by water bodies ranging from lakes to oceans [Scott et al., 1995. Map of Mars showing channels and possible paleolake basins. USGS Miscellaneous Investigations Series, Map I-2461 (1:30,000,000)]). The nature of the platy substrate is the subject of debate, with evidence given for lava [Keszthelyi et al., 2000. J. Geophys. Res. 105, 15027–15049; Plescia, J.B., 2003. Icarus 164, 79–95] and ice [Brakenridge, G.R., 1993. Lunar Planet. Sci. XXIV (Part 1), 175–176; Rice et al., 2002. Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXIII. Abstract #2026; Murray et al., 2005. Nature 434, 352–355]. The superposition relationships of cones and platy deposits in the channels of the Athabasca Valles precludes a magmatic origin, indicating later formation as permafrost mounds (or ‘pingos’), with implications for geologically recent flood volcanism, age constraints on young surfaces and recent climate change on Mars. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.
