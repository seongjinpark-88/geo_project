A historic ice extent in the Ross Sea in early austral winter was rebuilt through sea salt ions in the DT401 ice core in interior East Antarctica. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) had a significant influence on the sea salt deposition in DT401 through its influence on the Ross Sea SIE and the transport of sea salt inland. Spectral analysis also supported the influence of ENSO with a significant 2–6 a periodicity band. In addition, statistically significant decadal (10 a) and pentadecadal (50–70 a) periodicities suggested the existence of a teleconnection from the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), which originated from sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The first eigenvector of the empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOF1) showed lower values during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), while higher values were found in the Little Ice Age (LIA). A higher frequency of ENSO events were found in the cold climatic stage. The post 1800 AD period was occupied by significant fluctuations of the EOF1, and PDO may be one of the influencing factors. The EOF1 values showed moderate fluctuations from 680 BC to 1000 AD, showing that the climate was relatively stable in this period.\nsea salt ions, sea ice extent, ENSO, DT401, Eastern Antarctica\nCitation: Li C J, Ren J W, Xiao C D, Hou S G, Ding M H, Qin D H. 2015. A 2680-year record of sea ice extent in the Ross Sea and the associated atmospheric circulation derived from the DT401 East Antarctic ice core. Science China: Earth Sciences, 58: 2090–2102, doi: 10.1007/s11430-015-5125-3\nSea ice is a crucial component of the polar climate system. Its presence or absence modifies the albedo of the ocean, as well as the exchange of heat, moisture, momentum, and trace gases such as CO2, between the atmosphere and ocean (Abram et al., 2013). Sea ice plays a major role in the production of deep waters in the ocean, and therefore in the entire global ocean circulation system (Dieckmann and Hellmer, 2010). Sea ice extent (SIE) variation was originally associated with global or regional temperature (Xiao et\nal., 2013; Yuan and Martinson, 2000; Liu et al., 2014) and was also well teleconnected with the atmospheric circulation in low-mid latitude areas (Yuan, 2004). Yuan and Martinson (2000) found that Antarctic sea ice is linked to an out-of-phase temperature pattern between the Drake Passage and central tropical Pacific. In addition, the sea ice had some statistically significant relationships with other extra-polar climate indices, such as the tropical Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST), tropical land precipitation and the Pacific North America (PNA) index. Among these indices, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) telecon-\nnection stands out as the most significant link of Antarctic sea ice with extra-polar climate variability. These ENSO-related sea ice variabilities occur mainly in key regions, such as the Ross, Bellingshausen and Weddell Sea, as well as the Southern Indian Ocean. Studies of Antarctic SIE are of great importance not only because of their potential link to ENSO, but also because Antarctic sea ice variations have been shown to have a major influence on Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation patterns (Carleton, 1989; Li et al., 2013), such as the Antarctic circumpolar wave (White and Peterson, 1996). Due to limited sea ice time series, some of the earlier studies were not able to evaluate the significance of this relationship or found that the relationship was insignificant (Yuan, 2004).\nConsiderable efforts have been made to reconstruct the historical SIE variations and atmospheric circulation during past decades to centuries through the Antarctic ice core records (Abram et al., 2013; Goodwin et al., 2004; Kreutz and Mayewski, 1999; Mayewski et al., 2004; Meyerson et al., 2002; Peel and Mulvaney, 1992; Reusch et al., 1999; Russell and McGregor, 2009; Souney, 2002; Vance et al., 2013; Xiao et al., 2013, 2004; Yan et al., 2005). The findings revealed that sea salt ions (mainly Na+ and Cl), methanesulphonic acid (MSA) and non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO4\n2) were good indicators of the SIE (Abram et al., 2013; Meyerson et al., 2002; Xiao et al., 2013) and associated atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (Xiao et al., 2004), Southern Annular Mode (SAM) (Xiao et al., 2013), ENSO (Abram et al., 2013; Vance et al., 2013), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Vance et al., 2013). However, most of the ice cores were located at the peripheral regions of Antarctica and reflected the variations in the SIE and the atmospheric circulation in the adjacent oceans. Moreover, most researchers focused on the recent decades to centuries and few referred to longer time-scales, i.e., more than one thousand years (Abram et al., 2013). However, the climatic change during the last millennium has received much attention because of the existence of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and Medieval Warm Period (MWP) episodes (Vance et al., 2013).\nIn this study, the deposition of sea salt ions during the past 2680 a were detected using the DT401 ice core, which was located in the interior region of eastern Antarctica (Ren et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013). Variations in the SIE surrounding Antarctica were investigated to ascertain the possible source region for the sea salt ions, and the associated atmospheric circulation patterns that influence the transport of the ions were then compared with the sea salt deposition."

    "text": "During the 15th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE) in 1999/2000, an ice core with a length 102.65 m was retrieved from DT401 (79°01′S, 77°00′E,\n3760 m a.s.l.). DT401 is located 120 km from Dome A and 1100 km from Zhongshan station (Figure 1). A stake matrix with dimensions of 100 m×100 m, which was used to monitor the accumulation rates, was built beside the ice core drilling site during the 15th expedition. During the 21st CHINARE in 2005, the stake matrix was re-measured, and the mean accumulation rate during the past 5 a (2000 AD–2005 AD) was 0.025±0.016 m w.e./a; this value is among the lowest accumulation rates in Antarctica (Ren et al., 2010). With respect to the precipitation style, clear sky precipitation “diamond dust” predominated the total amount deposited (Hou et al., 2007). Since no temperature data of the 10 m snow layer (used to represent the mean annual temperature) was measured in the field, a mean annual temperature of 54.3°C was calculated using an interpolation method based on the temperatures in Dome A, Zhongshan station and DT263, and the elevation data (Ren et al., 2010). This temperature is also among the low values in eastern Antarctica, similar to those in Dome F, Dome C and Vostok, but somewhat higher than Dome A and Dome B (Xiao et al., 2008).\nNo auto-meteorological station (AMS) was established at DT401; therefore, the meteorological conditions were speculated from the AMS records at Dome A from 2005 AD (Ma et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2008). DT401 is located relatively close to Dome A and the two sites share similar climatic conditions. In addition, a gentle slope around the ice dome (1.8 m/km) provided assurance that the ice flow had a small effect on the disturbance of the ice layers (Ma et al., 2010). Further, with respect to the upstream correction effect (Fischer et al., 2007a), the relatively shorter duration in comparison with the flowing down time from the ice divide can be regarded as negligible. Low accumulation was found at both sites, and the accumulation detected at Dome A\nfrom 2005 AD–2007 AD (0.031 m w.e./a) was somewhat higher than our results at DT401 using the stake matrix, which may be associated with different measuring methods and different time periods. The wind velocity at Dome A was very low (less than 4 m/s) and the monthly mean value was stable throughout the year (Ma et al., 2010). Moreover, the special precipitation style (diamond dust) in the interior of Antarctica and the unique topographic feature (needle ice crystal layer) both require weak wind conditions (Hou et al., 2007). Therefore, we speculate that drifting snow has little effect on the snow deposition in the inland area of Dome A. Precipitation usually occurs during the cold season from April to September and this period occupies most of the snow that is deposited throughout the year (Ma et al., 2010).\nDuring the DT401 ice core drilling process, a snow pit with a depth of 2.04 m was dug and snow pit samples were collected along the snow layer profile with a depth resolution of 3 cm per sample. This resulted in a total of 68 snow and firn samples; all samples were sealed in pre-cleaned polyethylene sampling bottles and maintained under cold conditions. To avoid contamination, the sampler was dressed in clean isolation clothes, gloves and a mask. After the snow pit sampling, a 100.61 m firn core with a diameter 9 cm was collected at the bottom of the snow pit using an electrical mechanical driller in a dry hole. A total of 161 pieces of ice cores with a mean length of 80 cm were captured. After extraction, the length and weight of each piece of ice core was measured for density calculations, and the physical characteristics were examined and recorded. Then, all ice cores were sealed in polypropylene bags and transported to the State Key Laboratory of the Cryospheric Sciences in Lanzhou, China, in a frozen state (15°C) and stored in a refrigerator (18°C) until further analysis (Ren et al., 2010).\nSample processing was carried out in a class-100 clean room. Ice cores were sub-sampled to 3.5 cm in length for the top 5 m porous firn portion, and 3 cm per sample for rest of the cores, which resulted in 2945 ice core samples. To avoid contamination, the outer 1 cm layer was removed using clean tools. Blank concentrations were also assessed. Milli-Q water was frozen in clean plastic bags (LDPE) to be used as artificial ice cores and these were processed following the same procedures as the Antarctic firn cores.\nDuring the entire analysis procedure, Milli-Q water was used for cleaning containers and sample processing equipment. Samples were melted in closed polyethylene containers and analyzed for major cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4 +) and anions (NO2 −, Cl−, Br−, NO3 −, and SO4 2−) using a Dionex-600 ion chromatograph. The analyzing columns used for the cations and anions were CS-12 and AS-11, and protecting columns were CG-12 and AG-11, respectively. The injected volume was 800 μL, and isocratic analysis was used for all samples. The eluents used for cations and anions were Methanesulfonic acid and potassium hydroxide with concentrations of 20 and 12 mmol/L, re-\nspectively. Blanks were regularly monitored during sample analysis, and all blanks were found to be lower than the detection limits. Analytical uncertainty was calculated (on the basis of replicated measurements of standards) to be within 10% of the average concentration levels found in the core samples."

    "heading": "2 Ice core dating and error estimates",
    "text": "The snow accumulation rate at DT401 is among the lowest values in Antarctica (Cole-Dai et al., 2000). As a result, the sampling resolution (approximately 2–3 samples per year for the upper part of the ice core and even lower for the lower part of the ice core with a higher density) for ionic and other measurements was insufficient to allow dating by counting annual layers. To develop a timescale for the profiles of the ions, volcanic signals, radioactive elements (β-activity) from nuclear activities during the 1950s and early 1960s, accumulation rates, and the Herron and Langway firn densification experiential model were used for dating the ice core. The entire duration of the ice core was 2680±40 a (680 BC–1999 AD) (Ren et al., 2010). The dating accuracy of the upper part of the ice core (1259 AD–1999 AD) can be assumed by comparing the β-activity data and the volcanic records with other ice core records nearby DT401 (e.g., DT263 and Plateau Remote) (Cole-Dai et al., 2000; Li et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2006). Based on these data, the dating accuracy was ±1 a for the last half century and ±11 a at the time when the unknown 1259 volcanic matter was deposited. The dating error for the bottom of the ice core increased to ± 40 a (Figure 2) (Ren et al., 2010).\nIn order to compare the possible influencing factors (i.e., SIE, ENSO, PDO, etc.), we aimed to construct an annual resolution time series of the sea salt ions for the upper part of the ice core. Because of the lower density (0.39 g/cm3), sub-annual temporal resolution can roughly be achieved (2–3 samples per year) for the last half century. Fortunately, the accumulation during the last 3 decades (1965 AD–1999 AD) was fairly stable and this provided assurance for our dating results. The data were integrated into an annual resolution and no missing annual layers were detected for the last 50 a. Even with these efforts, we cannot be completely confident in the annual dating results from the past decades. Therefore, in the following discussion, records were smoothed with a 5-point running mean for the upper part (1948 AD–1999 AD) and a decadal or centennial scale was used for the lower section to remove high frequency variations and thus reduce noise in the annual data, thereby providing a better indication of possible climate behavior (Bretherton et al., 1999; Trenberth and Hoar, 1996).\nThe annual resolution time series of the ions during the former 2630 a (680 BC–1949 AD) were also integrated for spectral analysis and missing data were filled using a\nlinear interpolation method. Seventy-three missing annual layers were found; which account for 2.7% of the total data."

    "heading": "3.1 Empirical orthogonal function analysis",
    "text": "Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is based on principal component analysis of multivariate statistics, and the analysis of the annually resolved glaciochemical time series was used to identify relationships with climatic variables (Kreutz and Mayewski, 1999; Souney, 2002; Xiao et al., 2004). It has become common to use the EOFs to refer to the time series of the variables. The eigenvectors that de-\ntermine the components and the variances of the series they are derived from are the eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. The eigenvectors determine the new orthogonal components which, when used to represent the multivariate data, provide the decomposition of the time series into uncorrelated components which, sequentially, represent the maximum amount of residual variance (Xiao et al., 2004). The major ion (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, NO3 −, and SO4 2−) and δ18O records during the past 2680 a with annual resolution were used for the EOF analysis; the main purpose of this analysis is to divide the ions into groups with different sources or changes under different post-depositional effects. The results are shown in Table 1.\nThe first EOF (EOF1) explained a considerable (31.5%)\nportion of the overall variance in the multivariate ice record and was loaded primarily by the major components of the sea-salt aerosols (e.g., Na+, Mg2+, Cl). Components of an EOF that explain a significant portion of the overall variance in a multivariate data set are likely to represent some underlying physical linkages among the variants (Peixdto and Oort, 1992; Xiao et al., 2004). Given the location of DT401 and the major influencing factors for the ions in the surrounding regions (Li et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2004), the sea salt deposition was ascribed as the main influencing factor of the EOF1. In comparison with the coastal sites (e.g., LGB65, Law Dome) (Souney, 2002), a lower portion of the variance existed for DT401; this may be caused by the more interior location and the post-depositional effects cannot be neglected (Ren et al., 2010). Ca2+ deposited on the snow surface of the inland region of Antarctica is mainly from the bare rock area in the coastal region or transported from arid regions in South America and Australia via the meridional atmospheric circulation (Delmonte et al., 2005; Fischer et al., 2007b). Ca2+ accounted for 25.0% of the explained variance in EOF1, which implies that part of the Ca2+ originated from sea salt aerosol (Ca2+ and Mg2+ exhibited a high correlation coefficient, R=0.51, 95% confidence level, not shown here), or that the transport pathway for Ca2+ to the interior of Antarctica is similar to the sea salt aerosols.\nEOF2 explained 21.0% of the total variance and was mainly loaded by Cl and NO3\n (30.3% and 53.3%, respectively). Cl was mainly contributed by the sea salt aerosol and showed good correlation with Na+ in the coastal area of eastern Antarctica with a high accumulation rate (e.g., Law Dome, Dronning Maud Land) (Souney, 2002; Suzuki et al., 2002). However, the post-depositional loss also played a dominant role in the decrease of its concentration in the\ninterior region of Eastern Antarctica, especially for periods with low accumulation (Li et al., 2009). Nitrate (NO3\n) is the chemical species at the end of the oxidation chain of atmospheric reactive nitrogen in the stratosphere and is one of the dominant anions in Antarctic snow (Legrand and Mayewski, 1997). The volatile characteristics in the snow and firn layers make it a challenge to trace the original deposition signal, including climatic information (Wolff et al., 2008, 2002). The high portion of the explained variance in EOF2 may be from the post-depositional loss effect because of the Cl loss in the snowpack in such a low accumulation area. EOF3 explained 14.5% of the total variance and was loaded primarily by Ca2+ (46.2% of the explained variance) and SO4\n2 (39.7% of the explained variance). This implies that part of the contribution from the two ions were from gypsum (CaSO4). A dust advection from the Dry Valleys would carry considerable amounts of salts into the polar plateau, especially carbonates and gypsum (Campbell and Claridge, 1987). EOF4 explained 12.6% of the total variance and was loaded primarily by SO4\n2 (46.2% of the explained variance). For the interior area of Eastern Antarctica, besides the sea-salt and dust origin, non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO4\n2) originated from the oxidation of volcanic gases (SO2) (Cole-Dai et al., 2000; Li et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2010) and dimethylsulphide (DMS), which originated mainly from phytoplankton metabolic activity in the ocean (Becagli et al., 2004)."

For further details on the software used, see the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Singular Spectrum Analysis-Multitaper Method (SSA-MTM) Toolkit (http://www.atmos.ucla.

    "text": "Initially, people believed the burst of bubbles and waves on the surface of the open sea water was the main input source\nof the sea salt deposited in the Antarctic snow and ice, and that the amount of deposition was dominated by the intensity of the atmospheric circulation (Petit et al., 1999). However, additional research has shown that the sea ice area around Antarctica may be the main source region (Wolff, 2003; Xiao et al., 2013) and more evidence supports this conclusion. We used SIE data from 1973 AD–1996 AD, derived by Jacka and Budd (1998) from the US Navy/NOAA Joint Ice Center (JIC) weekly maps of sea ice extent and concentration, to provide the northern edge of the sea ice cover for every 10° longitude around Antarctica on a monthly basis (http://staff.acecrc.org.au/~jacka/seaice.html). We extended the SIE data to 1999 AD using SMMR/ SSM/I passive microwave remote sensing data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).\nThe sea ice area contributes a significant amount of ions in the sea salt deposition near the coastal area, and the ion concentration showed a decreasing trend with an increased inland distance (Suzuki et al., 2002). Scientists reconstructed the SIE time series during the past decades to centuries\nusing the sea salt records in the ice cores (Souney, 2002; Xiao et al., 2004; Yan et al., 2005). However, most of the results originated from coastal regions with high accumulation rates, and few of them are from the interior plateau area. DT401 is located in the interior high plateau region of eastern Antarctica and the distance to the nearest coastline is more than 1000 km (Figure 1). A previous study indicated that the moisture source region and the atmospheric transport mechanism in the inland region was different from the coastal area (Xiao et al., 2012). The deposition of MSA in the South Pole ice core originated partially from the Amundsen-Ross Sea sector (Meyerson et al., 2002), and the atmospheric circulation in this region also facilitated their transport (Cullather et al., 1996). Therefore, the deposition of the sea salt ions (EOF1) and its relationship with the SIE surrounding Antarctica was investigated in this section.\nSpecifically, we used linear regression analysis to investigate the correlation between the EOF1 record and monthly changes in meridional SIE over every 10° longitude for the entire area around Antarctica from 1973 AD–1996 AD (Table 2). Correlations coefficients with significance levels higher than 95% are shown in bold. Following Souney’s method, if a robust, physically significant relationship exists between meridional SIE and sea salt aerosol production and transport to DT401, we expected to find significant correlations between the EOF1 record and SIE for consecutive months at a particular longitude and/or for a single month across multiple longitudes (Kreutz and Mayewski, 1999; Souney, 2002).\nFollowing this line of reasoning, the significant correlations found between the EOF1 sea salt record and SIE were as follows: (1) positive correlation within the region\n170°–200° in April; (2) 190°–210° in May; (3) 130°–150° in July, (4) 270°–280° in November and December. In general, during the austral autumn and winter seasons (April to July), positive correlations existed mainly in the Ross Ocean sector (170°–210°) and later for the sea ice area adjacent to the Law Dome (130°–150°). The variation in the SIE from September to December in the 350°–20° region in the past 24 a (1973 AD–1999 AD) was significantly auto-correlated with the Ross Sea region during April and May (R=0.43, P=0.037).\nThe temporal correlation between the EOF1 and the SIE data from the Met Office Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset from 1973 AD–1999 AD ((Rayner et al., 2003), http://hadobs. metoffice.com/) also showed significant positive values in the Ross Sea area (not shown here). Clearly, the sea salt load in DT401 most strongly reflected the sea ice changes over the 170°–210° sector of the Ross Sea sector.\nThe mean monthly position of the SIE around Antarctica for the period 1973 AD–2000 AD showed that the northernmost extent reached 55°S over the sector 20°–30° at the seasonal maximum in September, and retreated as far south as 75°S over the sector 180°–190° (Ross Sea sector) at the seasonal minimum in February (Xiao et al., 2013). These extremes are due to ice drift resulting from complex ocean and atmospheric circulation in the deep embayments of the Ross and Weddell Sea, which also produce the well-known sea ice dipole between the two sectors (Yuan and Martinson, 2001). The Ross Sea (mostly the Western Ross Sea) has received much attention because of the variation pattern of the SIE in this area, which showed a significant increasing trend during the past 3 decades (1980 AD–2008 AD), and the opposite relationship with the western Antarctic Peninsula/southern Bellingshausen Sea region (Simpkins et al., 2012; Stammerjohn et al., 2008). Moreover, this sector has been identified as an air-mass source region for the West Antarctic ice sheet. Additionally, there are multiple studies documenting the instrumental relationships between sea ice and ENSO in the Ross Sea region/southeastern Pacific (Carleton, 1989; Ledley and Huang, 1997; Simmonds and Jacka, 1995).\nSpecifically, the time series of April and May of 1973 AD–1996 AD near the Ross Sea was separated (SIERAM) to investigate its relationship with EOF1 at DT401. Midautumn to early winter (April to June) was the period when the SIE showed the most rapid increase. Brine crystals growing on sea ice (frost flowers) are another source of sea salt aerosols, and large areas of newly formed frost flowers on the sea ice can contribute largely to sea salt deposition (Kaleschke et al., 2004; Roscoe et al., 2011; Wolff, 2003).\nThe variation in the sea ice extent in the Ross Sea during April and May (SIERAM) and EOF1 showed a significant positive correlation (R=0.60, P=0.002) during the past 24 a and the 5 a running smoothed data also showed a significant positive correlation (Figure 4). Generally, the SIE showed a\ndecreasing trend during the 24 a and a similar trend was found for EOF1. A significant decreasing trend was detected during 1975 AD–1982 AD for the two series, after which they both showed a small increase during the following 3 a. Another significant decreasing trend was found for the 5 a smoothed EOF1 during 1984 AD–1991 AD, while the SIERAM maintained a stable variation pattern. However, comparison using a detailed resolution (annual scale) indicated that the two series showed a consistent variation pattern. The variation pattern of the SIE in the Ross Sea sector in the early austral winter months from 1973 AD–1999 AD were different from Simpkin’s results, which showed that the sea ice concentration in March to May during 1980 AD–2008 AD increased significantly (Simpkins et al., 2012) . However, this result does not seem contrary to our findings, because the two datasets were not in the same period and the high SIE values in the end of the 1970s AD had a significant influence on the variation trend."

    "text": "Sea salt ions are usually used as indicators of atmospheric circulation and have been used to reconstruct the atmospheric circulation over the past hundreds of years (Souney, 2002; Xiao et al., 2004). El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most important coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon to cause global climate variability on inter-annual time scales (Wolter and Timlin, 2011). Here, monthly multivariate ENSO indices (MEI) of the six main observed variables (sea-level pressure (P), zonal (U), and meridional (V) components of the surface wind, sea surface temperature (S), surface air temperature (A), and total cloudiness fraction of the sky (C)) over the tropical Pacific from 1950 AD–1999 AD (Downloaded from NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, also see http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/) were selected for comparison with the EOF1 time series (Wolter and Timlin, 2011).\nMEI data at a monthly resolution were used to detect the influence on the sea salt deposition. Results show that the MEI index in April-June during the period from 1948 AD–1999 AD had a significant anti-correlation (R=0.36, P=0.011) with the EOF1. Variations in the EOF1 and MEI\nduring the period from 1948 AD–1999 AD are shown in Figure 5, and the two series showed significant anti-correlation during the half century, for both the low and high frequency variation pattern. High MEI values during April to June (MEIAMJ) in 1957 AD–1958 AD, 1982 AD–1983 AD, 1987 AD–1988 AD, 1992 AD–1993 AD, and 1997 AD–1998 AD were mostly accompanied by simultaneous low EOF1 values in the instrumental period. In contrast, high EOF1 values in 1961 AD–1963 AD and 1973 AD–1977 AD were accompanied by low MEIAMJ. Yuan (2004) provided a thorough conceptualization of the potential mechanisms proposed for the high-latitude ENSO teleconnection and sea ice response. One of the primary features of this teleconnection is the weakening of the subtropical jet stream and a strengthening of the polar front jet stream in the South Pacific during La Niña events (Rind et al., 2001; Stammerjohn et al., 2008). The strengthening of the polar front jet stream leads to more storms, warmer conditions and less sea ice in the southern Bellingshausen and western Weddell Seas but colder conditions and more sea ice in the Amundsen and Ross Seas. The opposite situation occurs during the El Niño events (Yuan, 2004). The less sea ice in the Ross Sea that is associated with strong El Niño events would decrease the sea salt load in DT401 and vice versa.\nDeposition of marine-originated aerosols at high latitudes are controlled by productivity as well as efficient transport to the study area (Legrand et al., 1991; Meyerson et al., 2002). There is a slight strengthening of the zonal westerly flow at high latitudes in the Southern Ocean in La Niña years, and this strengthening can increase the summer sea salt deposition in the Pacific sector of Antarctica (e.g. Law Dome). However, in El Niño years, mean zonal wind speeds are reduced by up to 2 m s1 in a circumpolar pattern, reducing sea salt aerosol production and resulting in reduced sea salt concentrations in snow (Vance et al., 2013). This finding is analogous to previous studies on sea salt variability at Law Dome, which showed sea salt concentrations not\nonly reflect the sea ice extent surrounding Antarctica but also the broad scale source strength signals of zonal winds in southern mid to high latitudes (Goodwin et al., 2004; Souney, 2002; Vance et al., 2013). Moreover, the strengthened poleward ENSO-related sea level pressure anomalies during austral warm seasons may also cause the increase in the sea salt concentrations in the interior continental land (Stammerjohn et al., 2008).\nThe spectral analysis results of all the 2680 a EOF1 data showed significant 2–6 a periodicities where 3.0, 3.1, 4.1 and 4.6 a were significant at the 99% level, while 2.1, 2.3, 2.7 and 6.0 a were significant at the 95% level (Figure 3(a)). This periodicity band was consistent with that of the ENSO events (2–6 a) (Vance et al., 2013) and the significant periodicity band can also be detected during the last 50 a (Figure 3(c))."

    "text": "A growing body of literature suggests that the tropicalextratropical connection between ENSO and the South Pacific and Antarctica is highly variable, depending on the exact pattern and zonal distribution of tropical SST anomalies and the zonal wind in the South Pacific (Harangozo, 2004; Lachlan-Cope and Connolley, 2006; Turner, 2004). L’Heureux and Thompson (2006) found ENSO variability affects the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) during December to February, yet Fogt and Bromwich (2006) found this connection varied on decadal scales due to interaction with the SAM during the prior spring, which either reinforced or opposed the high-latitude teleconnection. Moreover, based the spectral analysis of the full reconstructed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) time series, Shen et al. (2006) found significant decadal to centennial variations. Five lowfrequency bands, i.e., 11–12 a (decadal), 23–28 a (bidecadal), 35–45 a (quadridecadal), 50–70 a (pentadecadal), and 75–115 a (quasi-centennial) were significant at the 95% or 90% level. Coincidentally, all the five significant periodicities, except the quasi-centennial scale, were also found in the DT401 EOF1 data with a significance higher than the 99% or 95% confidence level (Figure 3(a)).\nThe coincidence of the close match of the periodicities led us to believe that the load of sea salt ions in DT401 is associated with the PDO signal, and therefore some consideration of the PDO is required. The PDO index represents mean SST anomalies of the North Pacific (north of 20°N) and the PDO has a signature that bears some spatial resemblance to ENSO but behaves quite differently over time. The monthly PDO data between 1948 AD–1999 AD (Zhang et al., 1997) and extended to 1999 AD using updated data (http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest) were selected for comparison with the EOF1. A significant negative correlation between the two time series (R=0.41, P=0.002) during this period was detected based on an annual time resolution (in addition to the 5 a smoothed data; Figure 6(a)). Spatial correlation of the HadISST1 sea surface temperature\ndata (Rayner et al., 2003) and the EOF1 during the past 52 a also showed a significant (P<0.1) anti-relationship in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean regions (0°–20°N) (Figure 6(b)). This may further support our speculation that the PDO influenced the deposition of the sea salt ions at DT401. The teleconnection between the two variables may also be achieved through SIE variations in the Ross Sea. However, because of little knowledge of their possible inner mechanism, no further discussion on this issue will be attempted in this study."

    "text": "In this study, variability in the EOF1 record over the last 1000 a is discussed in terms of three distinct epochs. Epoch 1 (1000 AD–1400 AD) is the period of mainly below-average EOF1 values, while epoch 2 (1400 AD–1800 AD) is the period of mainly above-average values, and epoch 3 (1800 AD–1900 AD) exhibited significant fluctuation of EOF1 values around the average. The ENSO events\nwith significant spectral feature of 2–6 a were shown with arrows in Figure 7 (Vance et al., 2013). During epoch 1, three periods under a significant ENSO influence were detected during 1014 AD–1019 AD, 1077 AD–1085 AD, and 1137 AD–1139 AD, after which no significant ENSO signal was found until 1400 AD Epoch 1 was temporally associated with the Medium Warm Period (MWP), which had higher temperatures (Crowley, 2000; Crowley and Lowery, 2000). The lower EOF1 values during this period may be connected to the lower SIE in the Ross Sea area under a warmer climate. Low frequency of ENSO occurrence may have contributed to the decrease in the SIE. During epoch 2, a high frequency of ENSO events was found, especially for the initial and latter part of this duration (Figure 7). This period was climatically colder (little ice age, LIA) (Crowley, 2000) and the higher EOF1 values imply higher SIE in the Ross Sea area. The temporal distribution pattern of EOF1 showed a consistent correlation with the summer sea salt load in the Law Dome region (LDSSS), even for the period 1600 AD–1700 AD, which had lower EOF1 and LDSSS\n(Vance et al., 2013). The South Pole ice core showed a similar variation pattern (Meyerson et al., 2002). During epoch 3, no significant ENSO periodicity band was detected. However, significant and high EOF1 values can be found around 1800 AD and 1890 AD Such a distribution style suggests that climatic factors other than ENSO were responsible. Based on the wavelet analysis (Figure 3(b)) we identified an evolutive spectrum with a periodicity of 50–70 a during 1800 AD–2000 AD, and this value corresponded well with the periodicity of the PDO (Shen et al., 2006). The end of the LIA at the end of the 1800s AD (the LIA occurred mainly from 1400 AD to 1900 AD (Kreutz et al., 1997)) was expected to be followed by a temperature increase and simultaneous SIE decrease. In contrast, however, the EOF1 showed an intense increasing trend during the 1930s AD–1950s AD, followed by an intense decreasing trend. In addition, the notable ENSO influence during the mid-1950s AD and the superimposed influence of the PDO may be an important reason for the rapid SIE change in the Ross Sea. The occurrence of the pentadecadal periodicity during post-1800 AD may be associated with global warming (Shen et al., 2006)."

    "heading": "3.5 EOF1 variation during 680 BC–1000 AD",
    "text": "In comparison with the period from 1000 AD–2000 AD, the EOF1 values from 680 BC to 1000 AD showed a medium variation amplitude (Figure 8), implying that the climatic\ncondition was relatively stable. Spectral analysis during this period showed that two periods (400 BC to 20 AD and 550 AD to 950 AD) were under significant influence of ENSO and the peak values of EOF1 temporally correspond well to the periods with significant ENSO periodicity.\nWavelet analysis results showed that EOF1 variations were significant at both decadal and pentadecadal periodicities during 460 BC–320 BC and 10 BC–60 AD, which may be associated with the PDO signal. Significant and high EOF1 values and intensive fluctuation patterns can also be found in the two periods. However, because few data on the sea salt deposition in other regions were available, inter-site comparisons and determination of the influence of the PDO need to be conducted in future studies."

    "text": "EOF analysis of the ions in the DT401 ice core during the past 2680 a showing that the EOF1 is contributed by the sea salt ions and can be used to study the variations in the sources and transportation. Correlations of the SIE variations surrounding Antarctica and the EOF1 during the instrumental period show that the Ross Sea SIE in austral autumn (April and May) contributed significantly to sea salt deposition in the interior of Antarctica. The newly formed frost flowers in early winter can contribute greatly to the load of the sea salt ions. ENSO had a significant influence\non the sea salt deposition in DT401 through its influence on the SIE and the transport of sea salt inland. Spectral analysis also supported the influence of ENSO on the deposition of sea salt ions with a significant 2–6 a periodicity band. In addition, significant decadal and pentadecadal periodicities suggested the existence of an influence from the PDO, which originated from the sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean.\nThe EOF1 values fluctuated greatly in the latest millennium. Values lower than the mean were detected during 1000 AD–1400 AD, when a warmer climate dominated and were associated with a lower SIE in the Ross Sea. Values higher than the mean EOF1 values were found in the cold climatic stage (LIA) and this period was also dominated by the frequent occurrence of ENSO events. The 1800 AD–1999 AD period was occupied by the significant fluctuations of EOF1 and this period also showed significant pentadecadal periodicity, which may indicate the significant influence of the PDO. The EOF1 values showed moderate fluctuations from 680 BC to 1000 AD, indicating that the climate in this period was relatively stable. More efforts are needed in future research to verify the existence of the influence of the PDO and to identify the inner influencing mechanisms between the atmospheric circulation and sea salt deposition in the interior of Antarctica.\nThe authors would like to thank all the members who participated in the 1999/2000 CHINARE field campaigns for sample collection.

  "abstractText": "Long time series of Antarctic sea ice extent (SIE) are important for climate research and model forecasting. A historic ice extent in the Ross Sea in early austral winter was rebuilt through sea salt ions in the DT401 ice core in interior East Antarctica. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) had a significant influence on the sea salt deposition in DT401 through its influence on the Ross Sea SIE and the transport of sea salt inland. Spectral analysis also supported the influence of ENSO with a significant 2–6 a periodicity band. In addition, statistically significant decadal (10 a) and pentadecadal (50–70 a) periodicities suggested the existence of a teleconnection from the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), which originated from sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The first eigenvector of the empirical orthogonal function analysis (EOF1) showed lower values during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), while higher values were found in the Little Ice Age (LIA). A higher frequency of ENSO events were found in the cold climatic stage. The post 1800 AD period was occupied by significant fluctuations of the EOF1, and PDO may be one of the influencing factors. The EOF1 values showed moderate fluctuations from 680 BC to 1000 AD, showing that the climate was relatively stable in this period.",
