Knight\nThe Val d'Aveto Formation is a turbidite sequence deposited in the Northern Apennines during the Oligocene (32–29 Ma). The occurrence of calcareous, siliciclastic, volcaniclastic and carbonatoclastic deposits makes the Val d'Aveto Formation a natural laboratory to study the interplay among climate, tectonics and volcanism in a subduction-related context. Eight logs have been studied in order to reconstruct the stratigraphic architecture of the succession. Ten different facies (one limestone senso lato facies, four siliciclastic facies, four volcaniclastic facies and one carbonatoclastic facies) have been recognized on the basis of their different sedimentary features, microtextures andmatrix compositions (through thin section analysis andX-ray powder diffraction). For thefirst time, syn-volcanic facies (pyroclastic density current and epiclastic deposits) have been distinguished from postvolcanic facies in the volcaniclastic facies. Compositional trends of sandy tomuddy detritus, together with image analyses on gravel dimensions, highlight spatial and temporal persistence of the syn-depositional volcanic activity across the source-to-sink system. Lithological and petrographic analyses on the gravel size fraction of the siliciclastic and volcaniclastic detritus point out a SE France provenance and reveal the strong influence that tectonics has on sediment production. The comparison between the geodynamic evolution of the source area and the stratigraphic evolution of the Val d'Aveto Formation can help unravel the importance of climate on the redistribution of tectonically produced sediments and shaping of the resulting submarine fan.\n© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

    "text": "The time needed to produce and transport detritus from source rocks along a sedimentary system controls the amounts of sediment discharged into a basin (e.g., Allen, 2008). This timedepends on external factors such as climate, tectonics and volcanism, which all have an impact on sediment supply and transport. Climate variations produce sediments by rockweathering andmechanical erosion, and transport them by water and wind along the source-to-sink system (e.g., Howard et al., 1994; Fielding et al., 2009). The climate signature is particularly relevant at short temporal scales (e.g., Peizhen et al., 2001), when violent episodic events are recognizable (e.g., Mulder et al., 2003; Brandano and Ronco, 2014), but tends to be diluted during long periods due to the overprint of tectonic activity (e.g., Mutti et al., 2003). Tectonics has a strong and temporally long control on sediment production, as it is able to mechanically deform rocks, rapidly raise slopes and modify fluvial systems (e.g., Stewart et al., 2008), resulting in the production and supply of large amounts of detritus to the environment (e.g., Burbank et al., 1988).\nMilano-Bicocca, 4 Piazza della\na).\nHowever, tectonically produced detritus is remobilized by water, so this supply partially depends on environmental and climate conditions (e.g., Milliman and Syvitski, 1992). Volcanism can: (1) produce large amounts of sediments independently from rock weathering (particularly of pyroclasts generatedduring violent explosive eruptions that form thick, unconsolidated deposits whelming topography; Smith, 1991), and (2) transport detritus far away from the source, as pyroclasts can either be transported in the atmosphere (e.g., Zanchetta et al., 2011) or may flow downslope from the volcanic flank during pyroclastic density current (PDC) events (e.g., Sulpizio et al., 2014).\nThe Val d'Aveto Formation (32–29 Ma, Northern Apennines, SW of Piacenza, Italy) (Fig. 1A) constitutes a singular example where interactions among tectonics, volcanism and climate with sediment supply have been recorded (Elter et al., 1999a, 1999b; Catanzariti et al., 2009). In a preliminary study, Di Capua et al. (2014) inferred that such singular sedimentary record of the Val d'Aveto Formation is the result of two main events: a forced regressive stage owing to the Eocene-Oligocene global cooling, and the activation of important volcanism in the source area. The occurrence of PDC deposits intercalated in the formation (Di Capua, 2015) confirmed the syn-sedimentary activation of volcanic centers along the source-to-sink system. In this study, a fieldwork-based part aimed to reconstruct the submarine fan of the Val d'Aveto Formation\nthrough the correlation of their deposits in the highly deformed Bobbio tectonic windows (Elter et al., 1999a, 1999b; Catanzariti et al., 2009). Then, minero-chemical analyses of the gravel-sized detritus allowed the identification of the detritus source area. Grain size analyses on 4 conglomerate bodies, together with optical, petrographic and mineralogical analyses on 22 sand-to-mudstone samples have been used to trace the control of volcanic activity on sediment supply. All the results obtained have been used to rediscuss the role of tectonics, climate and volcanism that control sediment production and delivery to foredeep basins in an incipient extensional tectonic regime, like the Oligocene Northern Apennines Foredeep."

    "text": "The Val d'Aveto Formation crops out mainly in the Bobbio Tectonic Window (Northern Apennines, Italy; Fig. 1A), and represents the first massive clastic input of the Oligo-Miocene Northern Apennines Foredeep (32–29 Ma; Vescovi, 1998; Elter et al., 1999a, b; Cibin et al., 2001; Catanzariti et al., 2009; Mattioli et al., 2012). It was deposited in the sub-Liguride Basin, which was originally located between the Ligurian oceanic domain and the Tuscany continental margin (Mutti et al., 1995; Elter et al., 1999a). Post-depositional deformation developed high-angle thrust faults that deformed the original sequence of the Val d'Aveto Formation (Elter et al., 1999a). The reconstructed stratigraphy was first proposed by Elter et al. (1999a) and comprises three members (Fig. 1B): (1) a lower siliciclastic pelitic-arenaceous\nmember, ending by metric-scale conglomerate bodies; (2) a middle volcaniclastic arenaceous-conglomeratic member; and (3) an upper volcaniclastic to siliciclastic arenaceous member. Two sandstone petrofacies have been identified, one composed of metamorphic, plutonic and sedimentary lithic fragments and single minerals, and the other one characterized by an andesite debris-rich assemblages (Elter et al., 1999a). From siliciclastic to volcaniclastic deposits, polylithic conglomerates do not show any change in clast lithological associations, but an increase in clast sizes has been noted (Elter et al., 1999a; Di Capua et al., 2014). 40Ar/39Ar radiometric data on amphiboles separated from three volcanic clasts constrain the main volcanic event at 29± 0.2Ma (Mattioli et al., 2002), whichwas supplied by a local Apennines volcanic source, as inferred through the volcanic geochemical signature by Mattioli et al. (2012). Di Capua et al. (2012) recognized two other minor members: one at the base of the formation, composed of calcareous turbidites intercalated by thinner pelitic layers, and one on top, composed of carbonatoclastic sandstones andmicroconglomerates. Heavymineral composition of an uppermicroconglomerate layer pointed to a sediment supply from amedium to lowmetamorphic basement. Through the correlation between the depositional ages of the Val d'Aveto Formation and the global eustatic curve (Haq et al., 1987; Zachos et al., 2001; Kuhlemann et al., 2002; Wade and Pälike, 2004; Jovane et al., 2009;Miller et al., 2011), Di Capua et al. (2014) preliminarily suggest a climate control on the siliciclastic sedimentation trends, but no geodynamic or palaeogeographic reconstructionswere provided to support this conclusion."

For the first time, clast counts on 11 conglomerate deposits have been used in the Val d'Aveto Formation to provide quantitative lithological associations of the gravel-size detritus. Furthermore,\ns, abbreviations (e.g., A57) refer to samples collected for compositional and point-count grain size; S, sand grain size;m,medium sand grain size; c, coarse sand grain size; G, gravel ic facies—syn-volcanic facies Vp and Ve, post-volcanic facies Vs and Vc; carbonatoclastic\ngrain size analyses on 4 conglomerate bodies have been performed by redrawing clast boundaries of scaled pictures on transparent papers, then analyzing them through the shaper analysis tool of an open-source software (JmicroVision; Roduit, 2007). Equivalent circular diameter (ECD) values have been extracted and inserted in a spreadsheet for calculations (Sarocchi et al., 2005). A total of 42 samples has been collected and cut into standard thin sections to be observed under a polarized microscope. Petrographic compositions of 6 sandstone layers and a conglomeratematrix have been obtained through the classic Folk methods (Folk, 1965). This method is preferred over the Gazzi–Dickinson method because of its grain size dependence (Ingersoll et al., 1984), like the grain size dependence of syn-eruptive volcanic signature in sediments (Smith, 1991; Critelli and Ingersoll, 1995; Critelli et al., 2002; Di Capua, 2015; Di Capua and Groppelli, 2015). A total of 15 fine-grained (mudstone) samples and a PDC deposit sample have been optically observed under a polarized microscope and compositionally analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (using a XRPD, PANalytical X'Pert PROPW3040/60 diffractometer in θ–θ Bragg–Brentano parafocusing geometry with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40mA, in the 4°–80° 2θ range). Compositional results have been analyzed running the PANalytical X'Pert High-Score software, with the ICSD PDF2 database. From XRD analyses, a ternary plot with plagioclase, quartz and calcite as poles has been used (Fig. 4A). Such poles have been chosen considering (1) the mineralogical composition of a primary pyroclastic deposit (sample A57 in Fig. 3), where plagioclase represents ~60% of the bulk volume, and no quartz has been detected; (2) the main occurrence of quartz-rich detritus in sandstone and conglomerate layers (Fig. 4B, C); (3) the presence of calcareous layers both at the base and intercalated in the Val d'Aveto Formation. In order to distinguish syn-volcanic from post-volcanic detritus, optical analyses on the microtexture of 20 volcaniclastic layers have been also carried out, according to the method developed by Critelli and Ingersoll (1995), Critelli et al. (2002) and Di Capua (2015). Finally, optical and mineralo-chemical (SEM-EDS) analyses have been also performed on single clasts and/or lithic fragments of metamorphic detritus, both in the siliciclastic and volcaniclastic deposits, to trace sediment provenance."

It consists of an association of fine-grained, weakly laminated (Td of Bouma, 1962) calcareous turbidites and dark gray pelitic layers, usually packaged in pluricentimetric to plurimetric sequences (Fig. 5A). Calcareous turbidites often show Chondrites targionii, phycosiphon and granularia ichnofossils (Fig. 5B).

    "text": "Siliciclastic facies are widely exposed in the Aveto Valley, and constitute the thickest part of the Val d'Aveto Formation. Four are the siliciclastic facies recognized: Sm (varicolored shales), Sf (dark gray siliciclastic pelites), Ss (brownish siliciclastic sandstones) and Sc (siliciclastic conglomerates).\nFacies Sm is composed of varicolored (green and red) shales (Fig. 6A), weakly laminated, with clay aggregates and single minerals\nof quartz as the main detritus fraction (Fig. 4A), with Chondrite ichnofossils. In thin section, clay mineral aggregates and quartz single minerals have been recognized. Minor calcite has been identified through XRD analyses (Fig. 4A).\nFacies Sf is constituted of dark gray pelite layers (Fig. 6B), up to 50 cm-thick, grouped or in single packages up to 20 m thick, and characterized by fine silty detritus, which rarely transforms to clay through normal grading. It is well sorted, with convolute laminations and asymmetric ripples (Tc of Bouma, 1962) vertically passing to parallel laminations (Td of Bouma, 1962). Small leaves and dark clay rip-up clasts are quite common. Microscopical and XRD analyses (Fig. 4A) reveal that the mineral assemblage is made of muscovite, minor quartz and subordinate biotite. Intrabasinal fragments (calcilutite mudstones—after Dunham, 1962—and fossil fragments—foraminifera) may occur.\nFacies Ss comprises coarse to fine brownish sandstones, up to 1.5 m thick, and is characterized by massive layers and/or normal graded layers (Fig. 6C), with convolute structures (Ta to Tc of Bouma, 1962), rip-up clasts and flute casts. Occasionally, bioturbation structures (Chondrites targionii ichnofossils (?)) have been recognized. Sandstones are composed of single minerals of quartz and micas (muscovite and subordinate biotite), with subordinate lithic fragments of orthoderivates and paraderivates, limestones, minor plutonics and rare volcanics (Fig. 6C). Some layers present a carbonate cement.\nFacies Sc is composed of metric to plurimetric matrix- and clastsupported conglomerates, up to 21 m thick, massive, normal or reverse to normal graded. This facies is characterized by rounded to subordinate sub-angular gravel-size detritus in a brownishmatrix. Matrix-supported conglomerates are generally massive, whereas clast-supported bodies show a weak imbrication, and overlay the lower facies Ss through erosional contact. In the upper part of Log 2, lenticular, clast-supported deposits are recognized amalgamated (Fig. 6D). Gravel-size detritus is composed of abundant crystalline rocks, with subordinate limestones, rare sandstones and volcanics (andesites) (clast count 178 in Fig. 4C). The matrix has the same composition as facies Ss, with abundant lithic fragments of metapsammites, carbonates, metaigneous, plutonics, terrigenous and metacarbonates, and single minerals of K-feldspar, plagioclase, monocrystalline quartz, biotite, muscovite, and rare chlorite (Fig. 6D)."

    "text": "Volcaniclastic facies association includes four different facies: Vp (pyroclastic facies), Ve (epiclastic facies), Vs (volcaniclastic sandstones) and Vc (volcaniclastic conglomerates).\nFacies Vp comprises a metric, massive lapilli-size deposit (Fig. 7A) and up to 30 m thick blocky-rich, lithified deposits, characterized by weak imbrication, dark greenmatrix, chilled margins around accidental blocks (Fig. 7B). Blocky-size detritus (with a major axis up to 70 cm long) is composed of abundant crystalline rocks, with subordinate limestones, volcanics and metagabbroes (counts 175 and 176 of Fig. 4C). Microscopically, these deposits are characterized by euhedral plagioclase with external growth rims, amphibole, cubic (most common), octahedral and pyritohedral hydro-oxidated pyrite, subordinate relicts of pyroxene, and accidental phengite-bearing schist fragments, in a devitrified, felty porphyritic to eutaxitic groundmass (Fig. 7A, B). XRD analyses on sample A57 (Figs. 3, 4A) have identified plagioclase (59.6%), illite from devetrified volcanic glass (22.2%), clinochlore (7.1%), biotite (6.1%) and horneblende (5.1%) as major mineralogical fractions.\nFacies Ve is constituted of massive coarse sandstones and breccia conglomerates (Fig. 7C), up to 20 m thick, alternatively packaged in sequences up to 60 m thick. The deposits are characterized by a green matrix (similar to that facies Vp), basal groove casts, flute casts, aligned rip-up clasts of marl, mud and Vp facies, including ichnofossils (Chondrites). Breccia conglomerate deposits can be alternatively massive or reverse to normally graded, and their gravel-size detritus is\nrepresented by abundant crystalline rocks, with subordinate limestones and volcanics (counts 250, 251 and 252 of Fig. 4C). Jigsaw structures on an angular, m-scale boulder have been also recognized in one conglomerate body (Fig. 7C). Microscopically, the deposits are characterized by remobilized pyroclastic fragments that form a dark green pseudomatrix, i.e., a background paste generated by the deformation of weak detrital grains (Dickinson, 1970). Accidental lithic, crystalline fragments and fossils (Nummulites), either angular or rounded, are present (Figs. 4A, 7C).\nFacies Vs consists of greenish, very coarse to fine sandstone layers, up to 2m thick, usually in packages up to 10m thick (Fig. 8A). The sandstones are massive or normally graded, up to mud-sized, with laminar structures (Ta to Te of Bouma, 1962). The sandstones contain variable amounts of angular to sub-angular volcaniclastic (andesite) lithic fragments, together with more rounded metamorphic (ortho- and paragneiss lithic fragments) and sedimentary lithic fragments, as well as single minerals of quartz, plagioclase, k-feldpars and white mica (point-counts A58 and A61 of Figs. 4B, 8A).\nFacies Vc includes massive greenish conglomerate deposits, up to ~11 m thick, reverse to normal graded, with rounded clasts showing the same lithological association of abundant crystalline rocks, with subordinate limestones and rare volcanics (count 177 of Fig. 4C). Some deposits show a coarse-sandy base (up to 2 m thick; Fig. 8B), which is sharply overlain by the dominantly matrix-, locally clastsupported conglomeratic part. In thin section, andesite lithic fragments are still present in variable amounts, with fragments generally angular to sub-angular. Sub-rounded crystalline and sedimentary lithic and fossil (Nummulites) fragments, together with loose crystals (quartz, plagioclase andmicas) represent a variable fraction of the detritus (Fig. 8B)."

Metamorphic lithotypes are the most abundant, and are generally represented by orthoderivates (quarzites and ortogneiss) and paraderivates (generally micaschists and minor paragneiss), with metagabbros in minor amounts. Orthoderivates are characterized by abundant quartz, biotite, or biotite and muscovite associations, and minor to rare feldspars. Textures generally show low grade deformation, but proto-mylonitic samples have been also observed. Mineralogical associations observed in paraderivate clasts document different grades ofmetamorphic deformation (Fig. 10A). They are usually composed of muscovite, biotite, chlorite, and quartz, with secondary kyanite and garnet (Fig. 10B). Metagabbroic clasts are characterized by plagioclase, epidote, chlorite, pyroxene, blue amphibole (glaucophane?), actinolite and hornblende (often chloritized) as main mineralogical assemblages, with textures that range between undeformed to mylonitic (Fig. 10C, D). Plagioclase, when preserved, is usually albitized, chlorite is chamosite (a Fe-Mg member with rare Ti), pyroxene is augite and preserved hornblende is a Mg-rich member. Chamosite also shows different concentrations of Fe and Mg, probably due to the original compositional variations of\nFig. 3. Stratigraphic logs (upper Val d'Aveto Formation).

Microscopical plagioclase growth rims and different pyrite habits (Fig. 7A) seem to indicate water/flow mixing and development of hydrothermal and syntherization processes at high temperatures (Graham and Ohmoto, 1994; Wadsworth et al., 2014).

Facies Ve corresponds to facies F3 (clast-supported conglomerates) and F5 facies (massive sandy flows) of Mutti et al. (2003), and sandy debrite facies of Talling et al. (2012). The pyroclastic pseudomatrix observed in thin section indicates the rapid rework and discharge of unconsolidated pyroclasts mantling the topographic surface during or soon after catastrophic events into the basin by lahar events (e.g., Calder et al., 2000; Mulder et al., 2003; Lube et al., 2012).

Thus, facies L s.l. and facies Sm are the lower facies of the Val d'Aveto Formation (Fig. 11), once in heteropic contact, representing, respectively, the outer foredeep sequence and the deepening-upward ramp succession of Mutti et al. (2003), or the basin plain association of Shanmugam et al. (1988). Facies L s.l. and\nfacies Sm formed an underfilled depositional system comparable to that documented in the Eocene Perialpine basins, where facies L s.l. is the turbidite unit, and facies Sm the middle hemipelagic unit (Sinclair, 1997; Allen et al., 2001). Facies L s.l. may be distal deposits of the calcareous turbidite system of the Canetolo Unit. However, further biostratigraphic constraints are needed to confirm this hypothesis.\nAs the siliciclastic inputs increase with time, the carbonate signal is rapidly diluted in the terrigenous detritus, and a basinal turbiditic system begins to prograde seaward above the basinal plain, according to the general model of Mutti et al. (2003). On the western side of the Aveto River, the depositional onset of facies Sf to the deposition of facies\nSs in a thickening-upward sequence document thedevelopment of a fan fridge zone deep into a lobe area (Shanmugamet al., 1985; Shanmugam andMoiola, 1988; Catuneanu et al., 2011), as shown in Fig. 11. The input of gravel-size detritus (facies Sc) and subsequent fining-upward sequences identify two channel-fill sequences (or slope sequences) and the seaward fan progradation (Shanmugam and Moiola, 1988). On the eastern side of the Aveto River, thicker channel-fill deposits (facies Sc) better document the progradation of the channelize system onto the lobe area (facies Sf and Ss).\nAs large amounts of volcaniclastic detritus start to fill the basin relatively quickly, the submarine fan becomes wider, channels migrate and overbank deposition is promoted. This has been observed at the bottom of the Aveto River, where facies Ve directly overlays facies L s.l. The coarser facies (Vp, Ve clast-rich and Vc) remain channelized in the fan system, as suggested by the lenticular geometry recognized in the field by Elter et al. (1999a, b), pinching out to the NW. These deposits can be also interpreted as slope deposits, according to Shanmugam and Moiola (1988). Large volumes of pyroclastic detritus rapidly enter\nthe water and deposit thick primary and secondary sequences, often rich in non-volcanic fragments with clasts scraped off along the fluvial system and/or the submarine slope (Calder et al., 2000; Trofimovs et al., 2006). Minor or rare siliciclastic (facies Ss and Sf) and calcareous (facies L s.l.) layers are interbedded during this phase.\nIn the upper part of the Formation, volcaniclastic sedimentation (facies Vp and Ve) tends to disappear, or be confined in few, fine and thin events (facies Vs). Here, siliciclastic sedimentation is dominated by facies Ss and Sf, forming amiddle to lower submarine fan association (Shanmugam et al., 1985) or a lobe-fringe facies association (Shanmugam and Moiola, 1988), together with facies Cs. Facies associations exposed here reflect architectures of immature passive margin models (Shanmugam et al., 1988) or the sandy-rich system of Stow and Mayall (2000)."

    "heading": "5.3. Reconstruction of the source-to-sink system",
    "text": "The reconstruction of the Val d'Aveto Formation source-to-sink system is still debated. Sandstone petrography has been inferred to reflect an Alpine provenance (Cibin et al., 2001), whilst volcanic clast geochemistry has been used to suggest an in situ volcanic source (Mattioli et al., 2012). In both cases, sedimentary and volcanic information has been considered separately, or one much more suitable than the other. The recognition of PDC deposits preserved in the basin (this work) and metamorphic textures characterizing some volcanic\nlithologies in the entire Val d'Aveto Formation record (metagabbroes—this work; and rhyolites—Elter et al., 1999a) testify that volcanic detrituswas supplied at the same time by an intermediate, syn-sedimentary volcanic suite and older volcanic sequences. This situation is quite common in the peripheral basins of the Alps, where Oligocene volcanic products have been found mixed with Permian volcanic clasts in the same turbidite deposits (e.g., Stanley, 1980; Di Capua et al., 2015). This suggests that the Oligocene ages inferred on a single andesite lava clast (29.5 Ma), and two dacite ignimbrite clasts (32.1 Ma and 29.7–29.0Ma) by Mattioli et al. (2002) cannot be extended to the entire spectra of volcanic detritus. Furthermore, the geochemical association of volcanic detritus alone is not enough to identify an unique volcanic source, due to the contemporary activation of different volcanic suites between Sardinia (Réhault et al., 2012), SE France (Montenat et al., 1999), and W Alps (Kapferer et al., 2012). A different approach is needed, which considers both volcanic and non-volcanic detritus characteristic features.\nAs documented by different authors (e.g., Pirkenseer et al., 2011; Coletti and Basso, 2014), fossil associations in calcareous clasts can provide a strong provenance constraint, as they represent features identifying specific depositional basins through times. In the Val d'Aveto Formation, the large amount of Cretaceous to Tertiary carbonate flyschoid clasts (Elter et al., 1999b) are ascribable to (1) the Cretaceous helmintoid flysch of the Antola Unit, already discharged in the close Tertiary Piedmont Basin during the Oligocene times (cf., Savignona\nConglomerate andMolare Conglomerate; Elter et al., 2006; Capponi and Crispini, 2008; Capponi et al., 2009; Marroni et al., 2010), as well as (2) the Tertiary flyschoid External Ligurian Units (e.g., Canetolo Unit; Elter et al., 2005), exposed from the Ligurian Alps far toWestern Corsica during the Rupelian times (Carmignani et al., 2004). Thisfirst interpretation allows us to exclude the Biella Volcanic Suite from the possible volcanic source, as no Tertiary carbonate flyschoid detritus has been foundwithin the Biella Volcanic sequences (Kapferer et al., 2012). Moreover, no syn-sedimentary volcanic detritus has been recognized in the Tertiary Piedmont Basin (Elter et al., 2006; Capponi and Crispini, 2008; Capponi et al., 2009). The already exhumed and structured Ligurian Units likely represent an orogenic boundary dividing the Tertiary Piedmontes Basin and the “embryo” of the Apennines Foredeep Basin, not supplied by the Alpine detritus at those times (Fig. 12).\nThe siliciclastic fraction of the detritus can be compared with that produced within the Sardinia/Corsica, SE France and Ligurian Alps area which is discharged into the western peripheral foreland basins around the Western Alps (cf., Annot Sandstones, Saint Antonin Conglomerate,\nVille Sandstones in the Bârreme Basin; Stanley, 1980; Evan and Mange-Rajetzky, 1991; Sinclair, 2000; Joseph and Lomas, 2004; Amy et al., 2007; Etienne et al., 2012, 2013; Grosjean et al., 2012; Simicek and Bàbek, 2015). Rhyolite ignimbrite clasts, described by Mattioli et al. (2012) and partially metamorphosed discovered by Elter et al. (1999a), are ascribable to the Permian rhyolitic province that extends from the Estérel Massif (SE France), offshore to the Tyrrhenian sea and the northern part of Corsica (Cortesogno et al., 1998; Poitrasson and Pin, 1998; Sinclair, 2000; Rollet et al., 2002). This provenance is also consistent with (1) the dominance of orthoderivate and paraderivate clasts, and (2) the minor amount of plutonic clasts, all these lithologies are akin to the Variscan Belt of SE France and Corsica (Cortesogno et al., 1998; Sinclair, 2000; Corsini and Rolland, 2009).\nMetamorphic conditions and mineralogical associations documented in the Val d'Aveto Formation clasts (Fig. 10) are similar to those endured by the Variscan terrains (from initial HP-HT conditions, to MP-MT and late LP-HT conditions, as defined by Corsini and Rolland, 2009), and plutonic clast associations to the calc-alkaline Carboniferous\nsence of microconglomeratic and fine pelitic layers.\ngranitoids (granodiorites, tonalites and granites; Cortesogno et al., 1998; Onézime et al., 1999; Rollet et al., 2002). Phengite-schist lithics recognized in the first PDC deposit are related to the erosion of “Schistes lustrés” sequences cropping out between the Ligurian Alps and the socalled Alpine Corsica (the NW part of Corsica; Rollet et al., 2002). These can be correlated with phengite-schist fragments of the “Schistes lustrés” terrains documented in a lava block with fluidal texture, plagioclase phenocrysts up to 2 mm, ghosts of ferromagnesian minerals, and crypto-crystalline matrix in the Tristanite Ridge, NW Corsica (43 ± 2.3 Ma; Réhault et al., 2012). The limited amounts of underfomed tomylonitic basic/ultrabasic clasts can be alternatively represent the basic/ultrabasic lenses (amphibolite, gneiss and serpentine) now exposed in the Variscan Belt of SE France (Western Maures; Bellot et al., 2000), or to the ophiolites exposed in Northern Corsica (Rollet et al., 2002).\nThis provenance makes SE France volcanism the most suitable synsedimentary magmatic suite, and suggests a connection between the early Oligocene Northern Apennines Foredeep basin (Val d'Aveto Formation) and the early Oligocene western sector of the South Alpine Foreland Basin (Grosjean et al., 2012, 2015) (Fig. 12). Such a connection is particularly evident when comparing the Val d'Aveto Formation and the Saint Antonin Conglomerate (Stanley, 1980), whose detritus was supplied by the French Mesozoic to Tertiary carbonate sequences, the SE France-Corsica Variscan Belt material and andesite volcaniclastic material (dated at 33 Ma; Rollet et al., 2002 and reference therein) from the SE France volcanism (Stanley, 1980; Montenat et al., 1999; Joseph and Lomas, 2004)."

    "heading": "5.4. Volcanism, tectonics and climate in clastic sediment supply",
    "text": "In the Val d'Aveto Formation, as well as in all the peripheral Alpine basins, the first, calcareous, flyschoid inputs reflect a period of low sediment supply (Mancin et al., 2001; Ford and Lickorish, 2004; Garzanti andMalusà, 2008; Di Capua et al., 2015). Supply of fine calcareous detritus (facies L s.l.) is a consequence of the subaerial exposure and karsification of the Nummulitic Limestones carbonate ramp (Sinclair, 2000; Grosjean and Pittet, 2013), at the beginning of sealevel fall (Merino-Tomé et al., 2007; Reijmer and Andresen, 2007), rather than driven by slope instability (Drzewiecki and Simò, 2002). Minor siliciclastic turbidites were discharged by climatically controlled,\nflood-dominated river and fan deltas draining the continent (Merino-Tomé et al., 2007; Brandano and Ronca, 2014).\nThe onset of the siliciclastic sedimentation (32 Ma; Elter et al., 1999a) and consequent progradation of the fan delta of the Val d'Aveto Formation mark an abrupt change in the sediment supply. Such sedimentary evolution has usually been interpreted as due to the beginning and temporal persistence of thrust progradation toward the outer margin of foredeep basins (Mutti et al., 2003). However, provenance traced in this work reveals that no synsedimentary thrust propagation toward the Northern Apennines basin was occurring, but sediments were produced in a local extensional to transtentional tectonic regime (Evans and Mange-Rajetzky, 1991; Ford et al., 1999; Jolivet et al., 1999; Rollet et al., 2002; Joseph and Lomas, 2004; Dumont et al., 2011; Grosjean et al., 2015; Fig. 12). Thus, the onset of the siliciclastic sedimentation and seaward progradation of the submarine fan during the first stage of the Apennines foredeep basin history was mainly favored by the strong Oligocene climate instability (Pälike et al., 2006; Jovane et al., 2009). Onland high-frequency climatic variations (Grosjean and Pittet, 2013) have induced an increase of sedimentation rates and grain sizes of sediments transported by the fluvial systems (Peizhen et al., 2001), with the consequent increase of hyper-concentrated flow events discharged into the basin (Mulder et al., 2003).\nWhen volcanism begins, explosive events rapidly overload the source-to-sink systemwith large amounts of unconsolidated pyroclasts (Fig. 13A,B). These destabilize fluvial drainage system at regional scale over thousands of years (Smith, 1991; Manville et al., 2009; Cuitiño and Scasso, 2013; Jutzeler et al., 2014). Eruptions and resulting acid rains can also damage vegetation, exposing terrains to rapid erosion and promoting lahar events (Alexander et al., 2010). Moreover, PDCs moving across the source-to-sink system result in the instantaneous and most efficient way to transfer and eventually discharge river sediments into the basin (Calder et al., 2000; Branney and Kokelaar, 2002; Sulpizio et al., 2007; Caracciolo et al., 2011; Perri et al., 2012; Brand et al., 2014). All of these features have been preserved in the distal turbidite sequences of the Val d'Aveto Formation. Indeed, it has been observed that (1) the almost monolithogical detritus compositions of facies Ve approach the composition of our pyroclastic flow deposit (Fig. 13B); and (2) the increased grain size of the gravel-size detritus in the PDC deposits reflects the higher energy of these volcanic events\nin comparison to the turbidity currents (Fig. 4D). In addition, textural characteristics like the extreme fragmentation of volcanic material and the frequent presence of pyroclastic pseudomatrix that makes the particle boundaries often indistinguishable between each other, suggesting a rapid remobilization of unconsolidated material, washed up from the environment by, for example, hard rains (Fig. 13B).\nDuring post-eruption periods, production and transport of sediments return to pre-eruptive, tectono-climatically controlled conditions, and volcaniclastic detritus becomes diluted by the siliciclastic detritus (Smith, 1991). This results in a progressive increase of minerals and fragments from the basement and sedimentary terrains (Fig. 13C,D), and a net decrease of volcano-derivedminerals in thefinest\nJoseph and Lomas (2004), Grosjean et al. (2012) and Fauquette et al. (2015). TLPB, tertiary\nevents (Figs. 4A, 13D), as found in facies Vc and Vs. In such facies, the textural characteristics, the increase of fragment roundness and absence of pyroclastic pseudomatrix suggest that only weathering of lithified to welded volcanic deposits was responsible to liberate detritus to the fluvial system, subsequently transported through the source-to-sink by classical fluvial process. This process controls particle dimensions and shapes as a function of their distances from the source (Miall, 1996; Allen, 2008).\nWhen volcanic input switches off, siliciclastic and carbonatoclastic sedimentation starts to appear in the basin. During this phase, facies associationsdocumented in theupper part of the Formation correspond to the immature passive fan facies associations of Shanmugam et al. (1988), rather than those of an active fan (Shanmugam and Moiola, 1988;Mutti et al., 2003).Moreover, the enrichment in ophiolite detritus (Marroni et al., 2010)marks a net change in the lithological associations coming into the basin. These variations are related to the activation of\nthe Sestri-Voltaggio Zone (Capponi et al., 2009) at the beginning of the Ligurian rifting (~30 Ma; Jolivet et al., 1999; Rollet et al., 2002), and highlight the beginning of a tectonically driven phase in the sedimentation of the Northern Apennines Foredeep."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "The Val d'Aveto Formation is the first clastic succession deposited in the Oligocene Northern Apennines Foredeep basin (Catanzariti et al., 2009). The occurrence of siliciclastic, volcaniclastic andminor carbonate events that reach the basin implies a complex interaction between climate, tectonics and volcanism in sediment production and transport. Through a multidisciplinary approach, including facies analyses and clast counts in the field, and textural and mineralo-chemical characterizations in the laboratory, SE France has been identified as the main source area supplying the submarine fan, and the different sedimentary signatures preserved in the Val d'Aveto Formation have been identified. In particular, we inferred that:\n(1) Climate controls the progradation of the submarine fan in response to cyclical sea level variations. It also influences the frequency and styles of submarine flows deposited into the basin. (2) Tectonics act on detritus production, promoting variation in siliciclastic detritus composition in response to the progressive activation of different deformational fronts. (3) Volcanism has a high impact on the environment, but its effects decrease soon after the brief life of the volcanic sources. During syn-eruptive periods, sediment production and transport controlled by explosive volcanic activity increase both the sediments supplied to the basin and the energy of depositional events, as documented by the grain size trends of gravel detritus. During the post-eruptive period, sediment production and transport approaches to tectono-climatically controlled conditions, and volcaniclastic detritus is progressively diluted by the siliciclastic one."

  "abstractText": "Editor: Dr. J. Knight The Val d'Aveto Formation is a turbidite sequence deposited in the Northern Apennines during the Oligocene (32–29 Ma). The occurrence of calcareous, siliciclastic, volcaniclastic and carbonatoclastic deposits makes the Val d'Aveto Formation a natural laboratory to study the interplay among climate, tectonics and volcanism in a subduction-related context. Eight logs have been studied in order to reconstruct the stratigraphic architecture of the succession. Ten different facies (one limestone senso lato facies, four siliciclastic facies, four volcaniclastic facies and one carbonatoclastic facies) have been recognized on the basis of their different sedimentary features, microtextures andmatrix compositions (through thin section analysis andX-ray powder diffraction). For thefirst time, syn-volcanic facies (pyroclastic density current and epiclastic deposits) have been distinguished from postvolcanic facies in the volcaniclastic facies. Compositional trends of sandy tomuddy detritus, together with image analyses on gravel dimensions, highlight spatial and temporal persistence of the syn-depositional volcanic activity across the source-to-sink system. Lithological and petrographic analyses on the gravel size fraction of the siliciclastic and volcaniclastic detritus point out a SE France provenance and reveal the strong influence that tectonics has on sediment production. The comparison between the geodynamic evolution of the source area and the stratigraphic evolution of the Val d'Aveto Formation can help unravel the importance of climate on the redistribution of tectonically produced sediments and shaping of the resulting submarine fan. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
