  "abstractText": "Ansraxcr: Petrographic study of modem sand samples collected near Hopi Buttes volcanic field (northeastern Arizona) underscores the low preservation potential of mafic minerals and altrabasic volcanic detritus even in an arid, intraplate tectonic setting. The Miocene-Pliocene Hopi Buttes volcanic field has been interpreted as a mar-diatreme and scotia cone field in which phreatomgmatic ernpfions took place in a playa lake basin. The tephra, necks, dikes, flows, and mar crater fill are now sources of sediment found in local ephemeral streams. Once the volcanic field is eroded away, the main record of its existence will be as a provenance component in the sand it is now shedding. The locally derived volcanic components include monocrystalline pyroxene, glass shards, scoria,, and a narrow range of ultrabasic volcanic rock fragments. Thin-sectlon point counts (450 grains) on four sieved sand fractions from each of 7 sites downstream (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 21, and 31 kin) from one margin oftbe volcanic field provided the following results. (1) The proportion of volcanogenic to total sand grains decreases from an initial value of about 40% at a rate of about 0.8% per kilometer downstream from the source rocks over the first 30 km of stream length. (2) Dilution by sand eroded from other local source rocks, rather than physical grain-size reduction or chemical dissolution, drives the diminution of voicanogenic grain proportions. Detritus sourced from the Hopi Buttes volcanic field has a very low preservation/recognitian potential, despite the arid climate and stable t~tonic setting far removed from a plate margin. It follows that mar-diatreme volcanism is generally underrepresented in the sedimentary record.",
