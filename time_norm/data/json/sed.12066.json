    "text": "Interpretation of bulk-sediment geochemistry is one of several approaches\nfor determining sediment provenance. This study investigates the value\nadded by bulk-sediment geochemical analysis in interpreting provenance in a passive margin clastic basin, the Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous deltaic sediments of the Scotian Basin. Provenance studies in this basin are chal-\nlenging because source tectonic terranes are parallel to the basin margin and polycyclic sediment sources are abundant. More than 400 samples of mud-\nstone and sandstone representing the geographical and stratigraphic range\nof interest were analysed for 57 elements. Diagenetic processes added calcium to many samples and removed potassium in rocks buried below 3 km,\nthus impacting principal component analysis and published weathering indices. However, multiple geochemical approaches to assessing the degree\nof weathering showed climatically controlled changes in weathering in the\nTithonian and Barremian, and changes in supply from major tectonic events, such as the top-Aptian uplift in the Labrador rift. Covariance of ele-\nments in heavy minerals demonstrates the varying magnitude of polycyclic\nsupply and stratigraphic changes in sources. Geochemical analyses revealed a previously unsuspected Tithonian alkali volcanic sediment source, charac-\nterized by high niobium and tantalum. The lack of highly contrasting\nsources means that geochemistry alone is inadequate to determine sediment provenance. Published discrimination diagrams are of limited value. Statisti-\ncal analysis of geochemical data is strongly influenced by diagenetic pro-\ncesses, episodic volcanic inputs and polycyclic concentration of resistant heavy minerals in sandstones. Single indicator elements for particular\nsources are generally lacking. Nevertheless, careful consideration of geo-\nchemical variability on a case by case basis, integrated with detrital mineral studies, provides new insights into palaeoclimate, sediment provenance\nand, hence, regional tectonics. Although there is no simple template for\nsuch analysis, this study demonstrates an approach that can be used for other basins.\nKeywords Diagenesis, geochemistry, provenance, Scotian Basin, tectonism, volcanism.\n© 2013 The Authors.

    "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "Detrital minerals are a powerful indicator of sediment provenance in sedimentary basins; detrital zircon chronology in particular has become a widely used technique. Nevertheless, mineralogical techniques may not detect major sources of detritus that lack diagnostic detrital minerals such as feldspars, muscovite, monazite, garnet, tourmaline and zircon, or such minerals may be greatly diluted by minerals concentrated during polycyclic reworking. This is particularly the case for sources in mafic igneous rocks. The study of bulk-rock geochemistry can complement studies of detrital minerals (von Eynatten et al., 2003). The use of bulk sediment geochemistry as a provenance indicator is challenging in areas lacking strongly contrasting source terranes and in rocks that have gained and lost elements through diagenetic processes (Pe-Piper et al., 2008). However, geochemical studies may provide evidence for inputs from mafic sources that are poorly represented mineralogically (Ohta & Arai, 2007) and also may indicate weathering conditions in the hinterland (Ruffell et al., 2002; Kahmann et al., 2008). This study illustrates how bulk-rock geochemical data can be used effectively to solve problems concerning sediment provenance and the climatic and tectonic evolution of the hinterland of a large sedimentary basin, in this case the Mesozoic Scotian Basin. In this passive margin basin, tectonic terranes are sub-parallel to the basin margin, strongly contrasting source terranes are lacking, and polycyclic sediments are an important source of detritus to the basin. The general characteristics of sediment sources for this basin are already known from published studies of detrital minerals, including zircon, monazite, and muscovite geochronology, as summarized by Pe-Piper & Piper (2012). The present study demonstrates how such mineralogical data can be ambiguous and the manner in which geochemical data can provide an enhanced understanding of basin evolution, taking into account the effects of diagenesis, hydraulic sorting and climatically controlled changes in weathering. This study builds on the earlier work of Pe-Piper et al. (2008), which explored techniques for provenance analysis based on a database of 95 geochemical analyses. That study showed that many published geochemical discrimination diagrams were unable to discriminate between potential sources and\nthat in the Scotian Basin, only a small number of elements, those common in granites, are valuable as provenance indicators. The Scotian Basin (Fig. 1) is a Mesozoic– Cenozoic passive-margin basin on the Atlantic margin of south-eastern Canada. Following rifting in the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic, it received abundant sand supply in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (Kimmeridgian– Albian) (Pe-Piper & Piper, 2012). Studies of detrital minerals indicate that the sand was sourced from the evolving rift in Labrador, and from reactivation and unroofing of horsts and late Palaeozoic successor basins in the northern Appalachians (Tsikouras et al., 2011; Piper et al., 2012). Volcanic input to the basin has been identified in the Early Cretaceous (Bowman et al., 2012). The relative importance of sources from Precambrian basement in Labrador and eastern Quebec, Appalachian basement, late Palaeozoic basins and contemporaneous volcanic rocks is difficult to determine from mineralogical studies alone because of the complicating effect of polycyclic mineral sources and the lack of knowledge of abundance of each particular mineral in potential source rocks. Nevertheless, identification of sources is necessary to assess the tectonic conditions on land as opening of the Atlantic Ocean progressed from the Grand Banks–Iberia rift northwards into the Labrador Sea. This new study is based on a database of 445 bulk-rock geochemical analyses from sandstones and mudstones of Kimmeridgian to Albian age. The specific objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate limitations on geochemical data imposed by sea floor and burial diagenesis; (ii) identify and, as far as possible, quantify major sediment sources that were poorly revealed by mineralogical studies; (iii) identify geochemical criteria for distinguishing first cycle and polycyclic mineral indicators; and (iv) evaluate the significance of deeply weathered compared to rapidly eroded sedimentary products. This case study in a well-understood basin demonstrates how simplistic interpretations of geochemical data must be avoided. It goes beyond demonstrating the strengths and limitations of using bulk geochemistry as a provenance indicator, and attempts a new synthesis of the tectonic and climatic evolution of eastern Canada in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous and the associated impact on the accumulation of deltaic sediments in the Scotian Basin.\n© 2013 The Authors.

    "text": "In the Late Jurassic and continuing throughout the Early Cretaceous, a three to four-fold increase in terrigenous sediment supply to the central shelf of the Scotian Basin resulted in deltaic deposits 3 to 6 km thick occupying accommodation created by salt withdrawal (Wade & MacLean, 1990; Weston et al., 2012). Deltaic sand-rich sedimentation in the central part of the basin around Sable Island began in the Kimmeridgian. The Upper Jurassic lower member of the Missisauga Formation overlies shelf carbonates and lesser terrigenous clastic sedimentary rocks of the Mic Mac Formation, and is laterally equivalent to the upper part of\nthe Mic Mac Formation to the north-east and to the Abenaki Formation carbonates to the southwest (Fig. 2; Table 1). During deposition of the middle (Berriasian–mid Hauterivian) and upper (mid-Hauterivian–Barremian) members of the Missisauga Formation, deltaic sedimentation extended over most of the Scotian Basin. Deltaic sedimentation continued through the Aptian–lower Cenomanian Logan Canyon Formation, with the shale-rich Naskapi Member and overlying sand-rich Cree Member. Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic rocks are principally shales and lesser chalks. The Valanginian– Albian Chaswood Formation exposed on land is composed of fluvial sediment deposited in faultbound basins with synsedimentary tectonic deformation, and is the proximal equivalent of parts of the Missisauga and Logan Canyon formations. Studies of detrital mineralogy (Table 1) show that two distinct rivers supplied sediment to the eastern and central parts of the Scotian Basin, respectively (Fig. 1A). In both rivers, some sediment was derived at times from as far away as the Palaeoproterozoic rocks of central Labrador. The Mesoproterozoic Grenville Province of southern Labrador, eastern Quebec and the Long Range inlier of western Newfoundland was an important sediment source, together with mostly Palaeozoic crystalline basement of the Appalachian orogen (Pe-Piper & Piper, 2012; Piper et al., 2012). Particularly in the central basin, polycyclic minerals from Palaeozoic sedimentary basins make up a high proportion of the mineral assemblage (Tsikouras et al., 2011). Large amounts of muscovite were supplied from erosion of the outboard Meguma terrane and variations in that supply demonstrate episodic tilting and uplift of the Meguma block south of the major Cobequid–Chedabucto fault zone (Reynolds et al., 2012; Fig. 1B). The Meguma terrane was the principal source of sediment to the western part of the basin. North America moved north-westwards during Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous and began to separate from western Europe (Beck & Housen, 2003). The influx of clastic sediments to the Scotian Basin since the Late Jurassic could result either from a change in river pathways or from enhanced erosion due either to climate change or tectonic uplift. In the Middle Jurassic, the climate near the Scotian Basin was arid, allowing the development of extensive shelf carbonate deposits and some coastal anhydrite (Wade & MacLean, 1990).

Less is known about the climate of the interior of the North American–Greenland continent at that time, although climate modelling inferred from predicted precipitation and evaporation suggests that, by the Barremian, the entire drainage basin was humid (Hayward et al., 2004). Enhanced sediment supply related to the rifting of Iberia from the Grand Banks (the ‘Avalon Uplift’) began in the Tithonian (Tucholke et al., 2007) and rifting of the Labrador basin began in the Valanginian (Dickie et al., 2011). The mineralogy of sedimentary rocks of the Scotian Basin is strongly influenced by diagenetic processes (Table 2). Sea-floor diagenesis resulted in precipitation of iron-rich silicates, carbonates, and phosphates utilizing colloidal Fe and dissolved P, Ca and Mg in sea water (Gould et al., 2010; Okwese et al., 2012). Burial\ndiagenesis involved the dissolution of K-feldspar and other less stable framework minerals and the precipitation of pore-filling kaolinite, quartz overgrowths, illite, chlorite and various carbonates (Gould et al., 2010; Karim et al., 2010). In general, diagenetic carbonate is more abundant in the central basin. Burial of clay minerals to depths >3 km resulted in conversion of smectite and various mixed layer vermiculites to illite (Strathdee, 2012)."

    "text": "A total of 445 samples of sandstone and mudstone, mostly from conventional cores, but including a few samples of cuttings, were analysed from Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. These samples cover the geographical range of the Scotian Basin, from nine wells in the eastern basin, 28 wells in the central basin and two wells in the western basin\n(Fig. 1B). All the samples were lightly brushed and washed in an ultrasonic bath to remove any contamination from drilling mud. A slice of the sample was used for a thin section and the residue was crushed for geochemical analysis. Major elements and trace elements were determined by Activation Laboratories Limited according to their Code 4 Lithoresearch and Code 4B1 packages (Activation Laboratories Ltd, 2012). The full geochemical data are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Abundance of major elements was recalculated on a volatile-free basis. Mean size of framework grains in sandstone samples was determined from thin sections. For most samples, petrographic study of the thin section provided estimates of abundance of diagenetic minerals. Samples in which the chemical composition was severely affected by diagenesis were screened out, based on abnormally high CaO, P2O5, Fe2O3 or MgO contents compared to SiO2 and Al2O3 contents (Fig. S1). This procedure does not recognize all samples with significant diagenesis, for example, those with K metasomatism. It does provide a data set of 182 sandstones (SiO2 > 78%) and 184 mudstones (mostly with SiO2 < 68%) in which the chemical signature of diagenesis is not overwhelming. Classical multivariate statistical analysis – principal component analysis (PCA) – was implemented to identify the principal factors that control variations in element abundance. Principal component analysis is a technique that transforms numerous variables into several independent principal components that explain the greatest amount of variation within the data set. In this study, centred log–ratio transformation (clr) (Aitchison, 1982) was applied to remove the non-negativity and constant-sum constraints on compositional variables. Following the clr transformation, PCA calculation was performed using singular value decomposition (svd) and conducted on the ‘R’ program using the package ‘compositions’ (van der Boogaart & Tolosana– Delgado, 2006). To explore the data set in more detail, a biplot is used as a joint graphical representation of both variables and samples projected onto the plane of the first two principal components, including loadings (the weights for each original variable when calculating the principal component) for variables and scores for samples (Figs 3 and 4). The statistical package SYSTAT was used to identify additional principal components using varimax rotation, which changes coordinates so as to maximize the sum of the\nvariances of the squared loadings (Table 3). Principal component analysis was implemented on mudstones and sandstones separately."

    "text": "Variation with grain size\nFine-grained sandstone samples commonly include minor mudstone, either interlaminated or bioturbated, which results in higher Al2O3 (Fig. S2A) and lower SiO2 (Fig. S2B) concentrations. Variations in most other elements, for example, TiO2, Zr, Cr, V, Ni and Th, show little correlation with grain size, particularly when normalized to Al2O3 (a proxy for abundance of mudstone) (Fig. S2C to H)."

    "text": "In this study, samples with severe diagenetic addition of carbonate and phosphate minerals were screened out to avoid ‘swamping’ the PCA. Nevertheless, PCA analysis of both sandstones and mudstones in the Scotian Basin displays high loadings of Ca, indicating that calcium-bearing carbonates dominate the variability, which is ascribed to smaller unscreened amounts of diagenetic precipitation of carbonates. Carbonate cements in some sandstones are observed from petrographic studies at all burial depths >2 km and carbonate was precipitated in mudstones by sea-floor diagenetic processes (Okwese et al., 2012). K-feldspar in sandstones decreases in abundance with depth due to dissolution and/or replacement by carbonate cements (Milliken, 1988; Gonz alez-Acebr on et al., 2010). The decrease in abundance of K2O in sandstones below about 3 5 km (Fig. 10C) reflects this process. The corresponding increase in K2O in mudstones (Fig. 10D) results from smectite and kaolinite altering to illite with burial (Maynard,\n© 2013 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 61, 383–410\n1992), which is confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of shales from the Scotian Basin (Strathdee, 2012). These processes probably account for the strong loading of K2O in PCA (Fig. 3B) and the lack of sandstones below 3000 m with a high ‘F’ component in the MFW plot (Fig. 6B), because K2O is a major constituent of the ‘F’ component. In contrast, Rb does not show clear variation with depth (Fig. S5C). In summary, diagenetic processes lead to the addition of Ca to many rocks and loss of K in\nrocks buried to depths greater than 3 to 4 km. These processes have a significant impact on weathering indices based on major-element variation and may dominate variation analysed by PCA. Some other elements concentrated by diagenetic processes, such as phosphorus and iron, do not show significant correlations in PCA. Principal component analysis analysis also established that Mississippi-Valley-type hydrothermal processes affected a few mudstones, resulting in high loadings for Ba, Pb and Zn\n© 2013 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 61, 383–410\n(Fig. 3C; Table 3). The high Ba, Pb and Zn loadings are not due to drilling mud, because no cutting samples are included and conventional cores of shales lack effective porosity to allow invasion of drilling mud. The presence of such mineralization is confirmed by rare macroscopic diagenetic barite and sphalerite (Pe-Piper et al., 2010) and highly saline (>20% NaCleq), high-temperature (>200 °C) fluid inclusions in some sandstones (Karim et al., 2012)."

Sorting may occur through differential concentration of detrital heavy minerals (Sawyer, 1986; Garcia et al., 1994), represented by variations in elements like Ti and Zr (Fig. 9), and appears independent of sandstone grain size (Fig. S2). For mudstones, the lack of correlation of Zr with TiO2, Cr and Ce (Fig. 9D to E) suggests no significant hydraulic sorting. For this reason, mudstones have been used preferentially as indicators of provenance by previous workers (e.g. Mondal et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012).\n© 2013 The Authors.

    "text": "Principal component analysis in mudstones (Fig. 3C, Table 3) shows that Nb and Ta behave quite differently from most trace elements that are concentrated in heavy minerals (Zr, REE and Cr) or adsorbed on clays (Co, Ni and Sc). Some PCA analyses (Fig. S6) show that Nb and Ta covary with Na2O and MgO, as well as with other predominantly detrital elements in mudstones. Absolute values of Nb (>70 ppm) and Ta (>5 ppm) in some rocks are at least four times greater than those found in average shale or sandstone. Potential alkaline source rocks with Nb and Ta minerals occupy only a very small proportion of the potential source area; no evidence of such minerals has been found in mineralogical studies (Tsikouras et al., 2011), and PCA shows no evidence for concentration of heavy minerals in mudstones. However, Nb and Ta covary with eNd in mudstones (Piper et al., 2011b) (Fig. 13), which implies a more juvenile source for high Nb and Ta samples, whereas Zr and Cr show no such correlation (Fig. S7). Taken together, this suggests that the source of high Nb and Ta is from contemporary peralkaline volcanic ash. The strong loading in PCA for Nb and Ta in the Lower Missisauga Formation (Figs 3 and 4) of the central basin is quite different from contemporaneous samples in the eastern basin and from other stratigraphic levels. Tithonian or\nBerriasian alkalic volcanic or sub-volcanic rocks near the Scotian Basin are known from Baltimore Canyon and Georges Bank (Pe-Piper & Jansa, 1987), the New England–Quebec igneous province (Eby, 1985), and the Labrador margin and West Greenland, where volcanism is represented by nephelinite and phonolite sub-volcanic rocks (Tappe et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2009) (Figs 14 and 15). Alkalic volcanism continued into the Early Cretaceous in all these areas except in Labrador–Greenland, where voluminous tholeiitic volcanism started in the Valanginian (McWhae & Michel, 1975). The absence of high Nb and Ta samples in contemporaneous rocks in the eastern basin (Fig. 11) implies that the volcanic material was not transported to the central basin through the atmosphere, but rather by the Sable River system (Fig. 1A). Mineralogical studies defined the Sable River as having drained the central Labrador rift shoulder (Piper et al., 2012), where it eroded fresh volcanic products. The switch to tholeiitic volcanism in the developing rift by the Valanginian provides an explanation for the abrupt disappearance of abundant high Nb and Ta concentrations in sediments above the Lower Missisauga Formation. Three or four samples with high Nb and Ta concentrations in the Missisauga Formation (Fig. 11) are exceptional, and might indicate continuing erosion of Tithonian ash deposits in the Early Cretaceous. Subalkaline volcanic rocks of Hauterivian age on the SW Grand Banks and Aptian age in Orpheus Graben have contributed volcanic ash or volcaniclastic detritus at particular horizons in the Cree Member and Upper Missisauga Formation. Lower sedimentation rates in the eastern basin mean less dilution of such volcanic material. Higher Na2O/K2O ratios in the eastern basin than equivalent rocks in the central basin (Fig. S5) might be a reflection of this source, but no trace element geochemical markers for subalkaline to tholeiitic volcanic inputs were identified."

Polycyclic reworking tends to give uniformity of stable heavy minerals (Tsikouras et al., 2011) and hence linear correlation in selected trace element ratios for sandstones (Fig. 9). In contrast, scatter of more abundant Ti in a Ti versus Zr plot (Fig. 9A) is interpreted to indicate predominant first cycle sources, as is known independently from mineral studies in the Chaswood Formation (Piper et al., 2007).

These interpretations, summarized in\nTable 1, are limited by the number of samples that have been analysed and the challenges of distinguishing polycyclic grains.\nThe Albian Cree Member in the eastern basin (specifically at Peskowesk A-99, Fig. 1B) is interpreted from mineralogical data to have a high proportion of sediment supply from Labrador and eastern Quebec, with correspondingly low input from Palaeozoic rocks of the Appalachians (Table 1). The high Ti in mudstones is interpreted as a feature of first-cycle supply from Labrador and eastern Quebec, where anorthosite massifs make up 20% of the Grenville terrane and include Fe-Ti ore bodies (Morisset et al., 2009). The relative scatter in Cr, Ce, Ti and Zr distributions in sandstone (Fig. 9) is interpreted as a consequence of only small amounts of supply from polycyclic reworking. The relatively\n© 2013 The Authors.

The Cree Member in the central basin also had a Labrador source, but the Meguma terrane and its Carboniferous cover were increasingly important sources to the west (Fig. 15D). This Meguma terrane input is reflected in lower Ti and the greater importance of polycyclic sources indicated by the covariation of Ti, Ce, Cr and Zr (Fig. 9). The source of the Naskapi Member throughout the basin is more difficult to determine. The member is a shale-rich, low-sedimentation rate unit that resulted from the diversion of the Labrador River westwards into the Bay of Fundy\n(Piper et al., 2011a; Fig. 15C). Ti and Cr contents in mudstone are low (Fig. 9), in that regard, resembling the Upper Missisauga Formation mudstones in the western basin derived predominantly from the local Meguma terrane. Sample scores on trace-element PCA (Fig. 3B) show correlation with Rb and Ga, enriched in clay minerals (rather than in silt-size grains in mudstone) and Cr, Ni, Sc and Co (Fig. 12), principally derived from mafic rocks and adsorbed on clay minerals. Abundances of the latter four elements, Zr and Ce are similar to those in the Middle and Upper Missisauga Formation in the central basin (Fig. 9).\n© 2013 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 61, 383–410\nThe Upper Missisauga Formation in the western basin (at the Naskapi N-30 well), based on detrital mineral geochronology, was sourced predominantly from the Meguma Terrane and Lower Carboniferous sediments derived therefrom (Reynolds et al., 2009; Piper et al., 2012). These Upper Missisauga rocks have high Ti/Zr ratios in sandstone (Fig. 9A) indicative of a first cycle source, but low absolute Ti, Cr and Zr concentrations in mudstones (Fig. 9D). The abundance of Ti and Cr in Meguma Terrane slates (Graves & Zentilli, 1988) is similar to, but Zr is lower than, the observed values in the Upper Missisauga mudstones (Fig. 9). Small Cretaceous zircons are known from as far west as the Alma wells (Piper et al., 2012), so that high Zr might result from contemporaneous volcanism (Bowman et al., 2012). The Upper and Middle Missisauga Formation accumulated during the same time as uplift of\nhorsts and accumulation of the terrestrial Chaswood Formation in small basins throughout the outboard parts of the Appalachians (Pe-Piper & Piper, 2012; Fig. 15B). Horst uplift would be expected to result in denudation of Carboniferous cover rocks and exhumation of Appalachian crystalline basement. In the central Scotian Basin, sediments have more reworked zircon than in either the Cree or Naskapi members. Detrital monazite and zircon demonstrate important sources from the Appalachians and the Mesoproterozoic of Labrador. Absolute values of Ti and Cr in mudstones are as high as in the Cree Member of the eastern basin, which is interpreted to mean significant supply from Labrador. On the other hand, Ti, Zr, Cr and Ce in sandstones tend to covary linearly (Fig. 9A to C), consistent with the zircon evidence for important polycyclic sources. A high proportion of detrital muscovite is Devonian–Permian in\n© 2013 The Authors.

The Lower Missisauga Formation in the central basin is geochemically quite distinct (Fig. 3). Monazite and fresh zircon are predominantly from Palaeozoic and Neoproterozoic rocks of the Appalachians, with lesser input from Mesoproterozoic and Palaeoproterozoic rocks (Table 1, Fig. 15A). Muscovite is almost entirely from the Meguma Terrane. Principal component analysis shows high sample scores for Nb, Ta, Na2O and MgO in both mudstone and sandstone, which is interpreted to be derived from contemporaneous alkaline mafic to intermediate volcanism in the evolving Labrador rift. Zr and Ce also tend to be high in mudstones (Figs 3 and 9) and probably also have a volcanic origin, whereas Cr is low. In sandstones, the scatter in Zr and Ce (Fig. 9C) suggests that at least one of these elements is predominantly in first cycle minerals. Conversely, the linear co-variation of Zr and Cr suggests variable concentration of polycyclic sandsized zircon and chromite (Fig. 9B). Proportions of different varieties of spinel and tourmaline show no significant difference from the Upper Missisauga Formation (Tsikouras et al., 2011), indicating similar polycyclic sources. The scatter of Ti in sandstones, when plotted versus Zr, is as great as in the Cree Member of the eastern basin. It is unclear whether Ti was supplied from Labrador–eastern Quebec or the Appalachians, but Ti in sandstones from the Chaswood Formation, for which there is no evidence of a Labrador source (Pe-Piper & MacKay, 2006),\nshows a very similar distribution (Fig. 9A). Weathering indicators are not as high as in all shallower stratigraphic units. Although the CIA might be influenced by deep burial diagenesis and loss of K, the W index (Fig. 6) involves <1% of the amount of K2O (Table 4). Neither is there a simple effect of elements thought to be associated with volcanic input on weathering indices. In summary, geochemical data clearly separate units derived principally from the erosion of the Labrador rift (Lower Missisauga Formation, Cree Member) from those with an important or dominant Appalachian source (Middle and Upper Missisauga Formation, Naskapi Member). Biplots of elements concentrated in heavy minerals in sandstones show variations in the input of polycyclic sediment. An example of this variation occurs in the eastern and central basins of the Cree Member. Geochemical data have also shown a previously unrecognized, important alkaline volcanic source from the Labrador rift."

Tectonic uplift and rapid denudation result in less weathering of detritus and thus it is difficult to discriminate them from the effects of climate change. The lack of sandstone and the low sedimentation rate in the Naskapi Member led to the suggestion that uplift of the Meguma Terrane and extrusion of basalts in the Aptian blocked the rivers that supplied sediment to the basin through Cabot Strait and diverted them south-westwards to the Bay of Fundy (Piper et al., 2011a; Bowman et al., 2012). If this were the case, then the Naskapi Member shale could have been derived from the major river discharging hundreds of kilometres away, or from small local rivers draining the Meguma Terrane (Fig. 15C). The similarity of trace element content of mudstones to the Middle and Upper Missisauga Formation indicates that the source of the Naskapi Member shale was not just from the Meguma Terrane. The abrupt change to sand-rich sedimentation at the base of the Cree Member marks restoration of abundant sand supply to the Scotian Basin. The increase in sand-rich sediment was due in part to erosion of volcanoes on the north-eastern margin of the basin (Bowman et al., 2012). Mineral provenance suggests less sediment supply from the Appalachians (Table 1), but continued sediment supply from the active Labrador rift (Fig. 15D), consistent with the lack of fault uplift in the Appalachians at this time (Pe-Piper & Piper, 2012). The supply of higher grade metamorphic aluminosilicate minerals from Labrador rather than unmetamorphosed polycyclic shales from the Appalachians would result in lower weathering indices."

Degree of weathering may provide information on relative erosion rate and amount of long-distance transport, times of climate change, and periods of tectonic uplift and enhanced erosion. In the Early Cretaceous, western Europe had not yet separated from Atlantic Canada and the drainage basin to the Scotian Basin was at the same palaeogeographical latitude as the British\nIsles, Germany and southern Sweden, not under the influence of arctic air-masses. In western Europe, there is clear evidence of arid conditions in the Tithonian–Berriasian (Allen, 1998; Nunn & Price, 2010) and in the Barremian–Early Aptian (Ruffell et al., 2002; F€ollmi, 2012). The consistently low weathering indices in Tithonian Lower Missisauga Formation samples of this study, despite provenance similar to younger strata, except for the alkaline volcanic ash, suggest arid weathering conditions in the hinterland, with reduced transformation of illite to kaolinite and mixed-layer clays, as in western Europe. The W index suggests greater weathering in the Middle and Upper Missisauga Formation and Naskapi Member (Fig. 6). Elemental ratios also indicate more weathering in Upper Missisauga Formation (Figs 7A, 7B and S3). Nevertheless, in western Europe, the Barremian to Early Aptian appears to have been drier (Ruffell et al., 2002) (Fig. 16). The inflection in the trend of the ratios K2O/Th and K2O/Al2O3 at about onethird of the distance above the base of the Upper Missisauga Formation (Fig. 7C and D) is interpreted to correspond to the peak of the Barremian arid period in western Europe, but this relative aridity in eastern Canada was not as pronounced as in the Tithonian. Corresponding changes in kaolinite/illite ratios are seen within the probable Barremian of the age-equivalent onshore Chaswood Formation (Pe-Piper et al., 2005a)."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "1 Geochemical provenance and weathering indicators based on major elements are limited by diagenetic effects. In particular, loss of K from sandstones for burial depths >3 km due to illitization of mixed-layer clays and smectite precludes the use of K as a provenance indicator. Addition of carbonate cement is also observed at all burial depths >2 km. Mississippi-Valley type hydrothermal mineralization of shales, presumably driven by hot basinal brines associated with salt tectonics, was an unexpected finding of the geochemical analysis. 2 Nevertheless, after consideration of diagenetic effects, a Tithonian arid period similar to that in north-western Europe is recognized from weathering indices. The Barremian arid period appears to have been much less severe in east-\n© 2013 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2013 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 61, 383–410\nern Canada, but can be tracked using stratigraphic variations in K and U. 3 Lower weathering indices in the Albian Cree Member result not from aridity in the hinterland, but rather from greater supply from higher grade metamorphic terranes. 4 Biplots of elements concentrated in heavy minerals in sandstones show stronger correlation when those minerals are of polycyclic origin and different correlation trends reflect different sources. Particular elements are diagnostic of sources: low Cr is supplied by the Meguma terrane, whereas high Cr is supplied from Labrador and the ophiolites of western Newfoundland. First cycle detrital Ti is derived from both Appalachian and Labrador sources. 5 In the Scotian Basin, high Nb and Ta are indicators of supply from alkalic volcanism, not previously recognized from mineral data as an important source to the basin. No geochemical indicator of tholeiitic volcanic supply has been recognized. 6 Despite the lack of mineralogical data, the geochemistry of the Naskapi Member mudstones shows that they have a source similar to that in the Upper and Middle Missisauga Formation of the central basin. 7 In a basin such as the Scotian Basin, which lacks highly contrasting sources, geochemistry alone is inadequate to determine sediment provenance. Published discrimination diagrams are of limited value. Principal component analysis (PCA) is strongly influenced by diagenetic processes and polycyclic concentration of resistant heavy minerals in sandstones. Single indicator elements for particular sources are generally lacking. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by the conclusions above, a careful consideration of geochemical variability on a case by case basis, integrated with detrital mineral studies, has provided important new information on sediment provenance and, hence, regional tectonics. There is no simple template for such analysis, but the approaches used in this study should be applicable to other basins."

  "abstractText": "Interpretation of bulk-sediment geochemistry is one of several approaches for determining sediment provenance. This study investigates the value added by bulk-sediment geochemical analysis in interpreting provenance in a passive margin clastic basin, the Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous deltaic sediments of the Scotian Basin. Provenance studies in this basin are challenging because source tectonic terranes are parallel to the basin margin and polycyclic sediment sources are abundant. More than 400 samples of mudstone and sandstone representing the geographical and stratigraphic range of interest were analysed for 57 elements. Diagenetic processes added calcium to many samples and removed potassium in rocks buried below 3 km, thus impacting principal component analysis and published weathering indices. However, multiple geochemical approaches to assessing the degree of weathering showed climatically controlled changes in weathering in the Tithonian and Barremian, and changes in supply from major tectonic events, such as the top-Aptian uplift in the Labrador rift. Covariance of elements in heavy minerals demonstrates the varying magnitude of polycyclic supply and stratigraphic changes in sources. Geochemical analyses revealed a previously unsuspected Tithonian alkali volcanic sediment source, characterized by high niobium and tantalum. The lack of highly contrasting sources means that geochemistry alone is inadequate to determine sediment provenance. Published discrimination diagrams are of limited value. Statistical analysis of geochemical data is strongly influenced by diagenetic processes, episodic volcanic inputs and polycyclic concentration of resistant heavy minerals in sandstones. Single indicator elements for particular sources are generally lacking. Nevertheless, careful consideration of geochemical variability on a case by case basis, integrated with detrital mineral studies, provides new insights into palaeoclimate, sediment provenance and, hence, regional tectonics. Although there is no simple template for such analysis, this study demonstrates an approach that can be used for other basins.",
