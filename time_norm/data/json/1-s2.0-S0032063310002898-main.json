Glamoc\na b s t r a c t\nThe mapped area of Harmakhis Vallis, at the eastern Hellas Planitia region (35130–421500S; 91100– 971300E), covers the surface area of about 212,000 km2. The region displays an enhanced modification of the initial topography formed by the Hellas impact. The long and complex history of degradation and alteration involves mass-wasting processes, volcanism and fluvial activity, confronting effects of climate-induced slow mass-wasting processes to effects caused by temporary, catastrophic events (impact cratering, volcanism, etc.). Geological mapping at scale of 1:1,500,000 (full scale at 1:540,000) have been carried out on multiple co-registered data sets available from the past and ongoing orbiter missions to Mars. The mapped geomorphic features of small- and medium-scales reveal in detail events that shaped the topography of the region throughout history, providing specific constraints on the geologic and climatic history of the region. This study highlights events from the most recent Martian history, including fluvial activity recorded in relation to a debris apron flanking Centauri Montes, and evidence of recent positive geothermal anomalies of a high heat-flux with relatively small spatial extents, on the timescale of several million years ago.\n& 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

    "text": "The rim-region of the eastern part of the Hellas impact basin displays enhanced degradation caused by a combination of masswasting processes, tectonic and fluvial activity that shaped the complex geology of the region (e.g. Crown et al., 1992; Crown and Greeley, 2000; Ivanov et al., 2010; Price, 1998; Leonard and Tanaka, 2001). The presence of smaller fluvial features together with larger outflow channels (Dao, Harmakhis and Reull Valles) in the region indicates past Martian environmental conditions. The geologic history of the modified terrains that surround the Hellas basin provides constraints on the role and timing of volatiledriven activity throughout the evolution of the highlands (e.g. Crown et al., 1992; Korteniemi et al., 2010; Price, 1998). Previous works are mostly focused on geological events as separate subjects; e.g. the glacial events and their timing in the area (e.g. Berman et al., 2009; Christensen, 2003; Costard et al., 2002; Forget et al., 2006; Head et al., 2003; Head et al., 2004; Head et al., 2005; Mest and Crown, 2001; Mustard et al., 2001), fluvial activity (i.e. Kostama et al., 2007) and tectonic activity (i.e. Anderson et al., 2008).

These melting events were not solely related to the slow processes of orbital and seasonal changes during the Amazonian era, but also to some of the most recent melting events and fluvial activity associated to recent geothermal fluctuations.\nThe mapped area (35130–421500S; 91100–971300E) covers a portion of the southwestern Hellas Montes highlands, Centauri Montes, Harmakhis Vallis and the smaller section of the third segment of Reull Valles (see the map in Fig. 1 and a location map in Fig. 2). Our mapping at scale 1:1,500,000 (for full resolution 1:540,000, see supplementary material) was based on the analysis of currently available data (for a full list of the images see a table in supplementary material) complements previous geological studies of Harmakhis Vallis and other highland outflow systems, drainage networks and highland debris aprons, as well as regional geologic mapping of the highlands at 1:1,004,000 (Price, 1998), 1:2,000,000 scale (Crown et al., 1992) and 1:4,336,000 (Leonard and Tanaka, 2001). Crater size-frequency distributions were compiled from previous works (i.e. Crown et al., 1992; Hartmann and Werner, 2009; Head et al., 2005; Ivanov et al., 2005; Leonard and Tanaka, 2001; Price, 1998) to constraint the relative ages of the geologic units, whereas more detailed stratigraphic constraints have been obtained through the units’ correlations (Fig. 3)."

    "text": "The mountainous landforms surrounding the Hellas impact basin, such as Centauri and Hellas Montes, comprised of Noachian materials, are considered to be the oldest rocks on Mars (Schubert et al., 1992; Tanaka, 1986; Tanaka and Leonard, 1995) (see Fig. 1 and the location map, Fig. 2). Erosion of the highland materials began during the Noachian and continued throughout the Hesperian period, resulting in the deposition of plains material in the Hellas region (e.g. Greeley and Guest, 1987; Mest and Crown, 2009).\nThe oldest volcanism in the region occurred during the late Noachian/early Hesperian period, evidenced by the formation of Hadriaca and Tyrrhena Paterae (Crown et al., 1992; Crown and Greeley, 1993; Crown and Greeley, 2000; Tanaka and Leonard, 1995). The highlands of the Paterae are interpreted to be composed of pyroclastic deposits, possibly resulting from phreatomagmatic eruptions (Crown and Greeley, 1993; Greeley and Crown, 1990; Leonard and Tanaka, 2001). The ridged plains material of Hesperia Planum in the northeasternmost portion of the area corresponds to lower Hesperian Period (Greeley and Guest, 1987; Tanaka, 1986). The presence of lava flow lobes\nwithin the 1000 km long lava flow of the Tyrrhena Patera and a smooth deposit infilling the caldera of Hadriaca Patera imply an effusive activity that occurred late in the volcanoes’ history, likely during the late Hesperian/early Amazonian (Crown et al., 1992). Volcanism-associated tectonism may have been active even during the Amazonian (Anderson et al., 2008).\nProminent outflow channel systems of Dao, Niger, Harmakhis and Reull Valles were formed during the Hesperian period by subsurface flow and collapse of plains materials combined with fluvial processes (Crown et al., 1992; Crown and Bleamaster, 2005; Harrison and Grimm, 2009; Kostama et al., 2007, 2010; Tanaka and Leonard, 1995). Erosion of the plains material took place during the upper Hesperian/lower Amazonian (Crown and Bleamaster, 2005; Ivanov et al., 2005; Kostama et al., 2007; Mest and Crown, 2001). The heads of all the outflow channels are within or adjacent to volcanic features: Harmakhis and Niger Valles are adjacent to Tyrrhena Patera flank flows; Dao cuts into the flank of Hadriaca Patera and Reull starts from ridged plains of Hesperia Planum. The close position of the channels to the volcanic features suggests channel formation by the mobilization and release of subsurface volatiles by volcanic heat (Crown et al., 1992; Crown and Bleamaster, 2005; Harrison\nand Grimm, 2009; Kostama et al., 2010; Korteniemi et al., 2010; Squyers et al., 1992).\nHighland plains units exhibit a series of landforms suggesting fluvial activity. These plains units were subsequently eroded during the late Hesperian/early Amazonian (Greeley and Guest, 1987). Furthermore, debris apron landforms and gullies on the inside walls of the Harmakhis Vallis-related collapse feature suggest that mass-wasting processes have been dominant during most recent geologic history of the region (Crown et al., 1992; Dickson et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2009; Holt et al., 2008; Tanaka and Leonard, 1995; van Gasselt et al., 2007)."

    "heading": "3. Methodology and data",
    "text": "The mapping of the area was performed using ESRI’s ArcGIS (Geographic Information System) on multiple co-registered data sets: Viking orbiter imagery, Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) altimetry, wide and narrow angle Mars Orbiter Camera (WA-, NA-MOC) images, Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) Visible (VIS) and Infrared (IR) nighttime and daytime images, High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) images (Nadir, Infrared and RGB color bands), Context Camera (CTX) and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images (for a list of images, see a table in supplementary material). USGS-ISIS (Integrated Software for\nImagers and Spectrometers) and DLR-modified VICAR systems have been employed during processing and preparation of the data for the GIS utilization. Topography and image data have been integrated into a GIS workspace using the Lambert Conformal Conic projection, and size measurements of morphological features were conducted in the Equidistant Conical projection. The IAU2000 reference ellipsoid was adopted (Seidelmann et al., 2002). The MOLA topographic data have been gridded with Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) (Wessel and Smith, 1998) at a spatial resolution of 1/1281 per pixel. Final georefferencing and co-registration of the data sets were done manually for data that had poor georefferenciation, such as Viking images.\nStratigraphic constraints are determined through a combination of absolute and relative dating techniques. Crater sizefrequency distributions were compiled from previous works (i.e. Crown et al., 1992; Hartmann and Werner, 2009; Head et al., 2005; Leonard and Tanaka, 2001; Price, 1998) to constraint the absolute ages of the geologic units, whereas more detailed stratigraphic constraints have been obtained through the units’ correlations (Fig. 3). We decided to overtake data from previous works, because of the non-uniform quality, coverage and/or resolution of newly available data sets for the area. Additionally, some of the units, such as debris aprons, have been already dated using a new imagery in numerous publications (e.g. Hartmann and Werner, 2009; Head et al., 2005).\nUnit names were overtaken from the previous mapping for the units that were similar to or the same as those previously mapped units. Naming of newly mapped or interpreted units is done as suggested by Tanaka et al. (2005)."

    "heading": "4.1. Mountainous material",
    "text": "(Nm) Mountainous material of the Hellas basin rim: rugged, mountainous material represented by isolated mountainous blocks of Hellas and Centauri Montes, located in the northern portion of the mapped region, and to the south of Reull Vallis (Figs. 1, 4). The highest topography in the mapped area belongs to this unit, summit of the Centauri Montes is about 2.8 km high, and the Hellas Montes\nare lower with the summits at altitudes of 0.2 and 1.2 km. The surface pattern of mountains on the south has a characteristic polygonal texture observed on the MOC-NA m1300764 image (Fig. 5B). Polygons are bigger and regular on the upper flanks, while becoming smaller and more irregular downslope. Their surface is from place to place covered with fine materials exhibiting longitudinal lineation.\nInterpretation: the unit represents a part of regional substratum, and a portion of the Hellas impact rim. Based on the crater sizefrequency distribution, Leonard and Tanaka (2001) and Price (1998) have determined the Noachian age for this unit (Fig. 3). The erosional features on the surface of the extensively modified highlands to the south of the Reull suggest that periglacial processes likely played a major role in this area throughout the regional history as well as in recent times (e.g. gelifluction features suggest the presence of seasonal frost cycles (Gerrard, 1992) (Fig. 5B)).\n(Ncr) Sebec crater rim: morphological unit, to the south of Reull Vallis, was formed by an impact crater (Fig. 1). The original morphology is obscured by sedimentary smooth plain material, although in the large portion the crater rim is still visible. The diameter of the rim structure is about 33 km and it has been dated by Leonard and Tanaka ((2001) (Nc unit)) Price ((1998) (c1 unit)) as Noachian age."

    "heading": "4.2. Plains materials",
    "text": "(Htf) Ridged plain material: smooth plain material with ridges of different orientations observed in the northeastern part of the mapped region. The unit is part of lateral flank flow material of Tyrrhena Patera and Hesperia Planum.\nInterpretation: the smooth plain material represents midHesperian volcanic material of Tyrrhena Patera (Leonard and Tanaka, 2001) (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 6).\n(HApt) Northern plain materials—pitted terrain: material developed only on the plains between isolated highlands (Nm), to the north of the HSC (Figs. 1, 2, 6). The low, hilly and plain topography generally exhibits an irregular surface, with small, wide pitted flat-bottomed features; inside the pits are irregularly arranged small knobs (see Fig. 6C). In its northern section where the terrain seems less ‘‘soft,’’ its pattern changes to a more linear one. This unit covers the old channel feature (fch) (see Figs. 1, 6A, B) and underlies the Hesperian volcanics, with the Nm unit it shows depositional contact.\nInterpretation: sedimentary material rich in ice that has undergone processes of deflation. The pitted texture represents collapses formed due to loss of water or ice by deflation processes. Pierce (1998 (AHpp)) discriminated the Hesperian–Amazonian age for the unit that includes here mapped HApt and HAl units (for stratigraphic position see Fig. 3).\n(HAl) Ice-facilitated landslide: the feature is observed only to the north of the HSC between isolated mountains (Figs. 1, 4B, C). Its surface morphology exhibits a corrugate structure, which indicates material movements and displacement toward the HSC, and further displacement inside the collapse area. The material started displacement from a gentle scar in the southern part of pitted terrains. The terminal part of this material is markedly visible inside the HSC. The contact of this unit with the Noachian mountainous units and Harmakhis collapse is depositional and clearly visible, indicating ages of this unit younger than both the mountainous units and the Harmakhis collapse.\nInterpretation: sedimentary material rich in ice that underwent a partial melting process, forming an ice-facilitated landslide that postdates Harmakhis fluvial activity (Fig. 3).\n(HNp2) Plain material: smooth to moderate low plain relief mapped to the southeast of the HSC, and near the terminus and to the southwest of Reull Vallis (Figs. 1, 7A). This unit is dissected by channel systems with various morphologies and different ages. The unit displays stratification of material with alternating dark and light layers visible on the eastern wall of the HSC. To the west, the unit bounds a large partially buried crater; the surface is\ndeeply dissected by semi-parallel channels, and is gently dipping in the west (Fig. 8A, C).\nInterpretation: smooth surface, stratification and low erosional resistance imply a sedimentary origin of the material, with some quantity of interstitial ice that facilitated formation of a number of channels. Price (1998 (Hps)) has dated plain materials as lower to mid-Hesperan/Amazonian age: Hps corresponds to mapped HNp1, HNp2 and HAic units here. Crown et al. (1992 (AHh5)) determined upper Hesperian age for the unit of similar coverage.\n(HNh) Hummocky plain material: hummocky material with a highly irregular surface. Impact craters with reduced ejecta and elongated, narrow topographically positive features are characteristic for the unit (Fig. 8A). The unit underlies the HNp2 unit to the south of Harmakhis (Figs. 1, 8A). To the north of Harmakhis Vallis, it underlies a dissected plain material HNp1 (Figs. 1, 8B). At two locations within the mapped superimposed HNp2 unit, the HNh is exposed through the windows formed in HNp2. The mottled relief of this unit is in the south intersected by a channel filled with the HNp2 unit material.\nInterpretation: bedrock material possibly eroded by glacial processes. Alternatively, it may also be material modified\nby volcanic processes as proposed by Korteniemi et al. (2010). This unit has been dated by Price (1998) as Noachian and Hesperian/Amazonian age, and by Korteniemi et al. (2010) as Hesperian age.\n(HAm2) Mesa material: mapped mesa material forming smooth, flat-topped features with irregular steep scarps, topographically about 150 m higher than surrounding areas. This unit has been mapped to the south of Reull Vallis, and a majority of the mesa features have general east–west orientation (Fig. 1).\n(HAm1) Mesa material-1: unit generally surrounds mesa relieves; topographically lower than the mesas, yet higher than surrounding plains (Fig. 1). The observed plain material exhibits long linear erosional pattern. The orientation of the linear erosional pattern is northwest to southeast.\nInterpretation (HAm1 and HAm2): Mesas formed as a result of differential erosional processes, suggesting a sedimentary origin of the features and a variety in lithological composition of the plain materials.\n(HAp) Eroded plain material (between montes and mesas): low relief unit made of knobby, mottled material, highly eroded, and in some places dissected by small channels. Among the plain units\nsouth of Reull Vallis, this unit is marked by the roughest surface pattern (Fig. 1, and full resolution map in supplementary material).\nInterpretation: sedimentary mantle, the unit shows difference in resistance to erosional processes, implying the presence of different lithologies in the area.\n(HAic) Inner crater fill-material: smooth plain material with a variable albedo range: it is generally lower than the surrounding units\nand from place to place high (Figs. 1, 8C). The plains are dipping westward, superposed on the old rim structure (Ncr). Apart from mesas, extensive erosional patterns have not been observed in the plains. The unit is dissected by a simple, approximately 77 km long, channel without tributaries. Rampart craters are observed on the unit. Contact of this unit and surrounding plain units is marked by the remnants of the rim structure of Sebec crater. However, the erosional\nstyle of this unit differs from the erosional pattern observed at the surfaces of other plain units.\nInterpretation: the presence of mesas implies participation of erosional processes in formation of the plain material. Rampart craters related to this unit imply the presence of water (ice/liquid) within the material (Barnouin-Jha et al., 2005). Most likely, the unit is of a sedimentary origin.\n(HNp1) Dissected plain material: plain material mostly occupying a space between Niger and Harmakhis Valles; its smooth surface has been carved by a meandering channel system (Figs. 1, 8D). In the south, a few ridge features are observed.\nInterpretation: this unit is interpreted as a possible sedimentary material, because the formation of chaotic terrains indicates the presence of an interstitial ice in the material. About previous stratigraphic discriminations, see the description of HNp2 unit."

Two characteristic locations of chaotic terrains are distinguished as the most plausible source areas of the channels: one near ejected material of the Negele crater, and the other in the vicinity of a debris apron. Evidence for precipitation fed channels was not found. The channel width downstream from the chaos is approximately 5 km, and the depth is about 100 m. Downstream the channels are cut by Harmakhis Vallis. Somewhat wider channels (around 10 km in width) originate from a chaos region formed on ejected material of a crater. These channels are observed in the southern portion of the mapped area."

    "heading": "4.3.1. Interpretation: fluvial, outwash channels",
    "text": "Channels of sub-category II: channels that flow out from a debris apron that sheds from Centauri Montes (Fig. 7C). Gently meandering channels are formed on the highly eroded portion of the debris apron and they form small, integrated drainages.\nInterpretation: fluvial channels formed by melting of interstitial ice from the debris apron.\nChannels of sub-category III: a gently meandering channel with well-developed wide levees. The channels are observed near the montes northwest of the HSC (Figs. 1, 8B). At an upstream section, a large debris apron overlays the channel’s source, and at a downstream section the channel is truncated by Harmakhis Vallis. Correlation of the channel with other units implies that the formation of the channel predates the formation of the debris aprons, and the formation of Harmakhis Vallis. The levees are well preserved along the channel sides. Fig. 8B shows a subscene of HRSC image 0528, THEMIS-VIS v06576002 image (the bottomcenter of the figure) and THEMIS-IR-day image i01021002 (right portion of the figure) that display diverse albedo values of the levees and surrounding area.\nInterpretation: the channel could have a fluvial origin and the levees might have formed by high flood overbanking (Brierley et al., 1997; Scholz et al., 1990). Alternatively, it could have a volcanic origin, inferred from morphological similarities between the observed levees and those of terrestrial lava channels characterized on Mount Etna (Italy) (Gioia et al., 2006; Mazzarini\net al., 2005), Krafla volcano (Iceland) (Rossi, 1997) and on Hawaiian volcanoes (Rowland and Walker, 1990). Similarly, volcanic channels with levees were detected among lunar volcanic features (e.g. Gifford and El-Baz, 1981; Greeley, 1971; Hulme, 1982).\nChannels of sub-category IV: a minor channel system exists on the wall inside the Negele crater (Figs. 1, 6A, B). The channels originate from the top of the crater wall and are not correlated to any specific location of the wall. Mantled wall and creep features are observed on parts of the south facing the inside wall.\nInterpretation: as there is no association of the channels and specific layers on the crater wall or alcoves that may have sourced later channels formation, which is commonly observed in association with gullies. These channels were probably formed during the settlement of the crater structure.\n(fch) Fossil/buried channels: a wide, partially buried channel to the north of the HSC, about 114 km long, with varying width from 3 to 8 km at its final, southern portion (Figs. 1, 6A, B). The channel begins from a scar positioned between two ridge features; no tributaries are observed. A HAp2 unit overlies this channel.\nA buried channel to the northeast of the HSC, about 91 km long with its width being 7 km in the upper part and approximately 10 km in the downstream portion. The upper part of the channel is partially covered by debris aprons and fan deposits of younger channels (Fig. 1). At the downstream portion, two tributaries are joining the channel, and the channel is cut by Harmakhis Vallis.\nThe third, partially buried channel system is observed in the southeastern part of the mapped area; the channels are partially filled with material of the HNp2 unit (Fig. 8A). A connection between these channels with those observed to the north of Harmakhis is possible, although unconfirmed.\n(spch) Sapping channels: a channel system mapped to the south of Reull Vallis, incising the HNp2 unit in the east–west direction, which is a general topographic inclination of the area to the south of Reull Vallis (Fig. 8C). All the channels start as narrow drainages (width range from 100 to 300 m) from the HAic unit; while they become much wider reaching a width range 2.5–8 km, lengths of the channels vary from 47 to 70 km. Cross-sectional channel profiles are wide and irregularly U-shaped. Irregular profiles with ledges on the walls could derive from a difference in rock resistance affecting erosional processes. Some of the channels are joined in their wider portions. The shortest channel is 37 km long and 100–200 m wide. Several slumps on the western flank of the Noachian mountains seem to be the source areas that fed this system. The slumps and walls of the bigger channels display the same erosional pattern."

The channel is characterized by albedo which is much lower than that of the surrounding area, as observed on IR-day images and in a HRSC nadir image. The source area of this channel seems to be covered by a well-developed debris apron of Centauri Montes. Inside this wide channel there is another younger channel about 13 km wide, with erosional features superimposed on the older one (Fig. 7B). Along with the younger channel, erosional meso-scale features were mapped: streamlined uplands (Fig. 7D), erosional collapse (bch/b unit, Fig. 7B) and features typical of backwasting erosion are visible on the wall of the HSC. The portion of the debris apron that covers possible source of the channels has been additionally resurfaced with a visible delineation between old and new apron materials (Fig. 7C).\nInterpretation: outwash channels."

The channel is approximately 25 km wide (in the section following the chaos) and about 800 m deep, U-shaped with steep walls, and without any tributary channels. The flat floor is filled with a fine, smooth material exhibiting a streamlined surface texture implying movement of the floor material. The uppermost part of Harmakhis is located within the chaos region.\nReull Vallis: the final, terminal portion of Reull Vallis is mapped. Most of the channel is covered by the debris apron of Centauri Montes, which masks one side of the channel’s wall. The other wall shows layering of materials with a range of erosional resistance. The terminal part of the channel exhibits a very dark color on a HRSC nadir image, and dark blue on one HRSC RGB image (image 0038).\n(HAct2) Chaotic terrain: the Harmakhis source area is comprised of a source collapse (12–20 km deep as measured between the deepest part of the collapse and its southern and northern edges), and a chaotic terrain next to the HSC. Within the chaotic terrain, two distinctive zones are identified (Fig. 9A). A zone next to the HSC is strongly tectonically disturbed (Fig. 9A). Many tensional fractures of northwest–southeast and northeast–southwest directions are dissecting the surface. Small erosional backwasting features are observed in association with the crosscutting fractures and the channel. Going downstream, the following zone of the chaos is marked by domination of a gravity-collapsed surface (Fig. 9A). The collapsed blocks display the original surface texture, and some of collapsed blocks have undergone minor dislocations.\nA chaotic terrain, adjusted to the Negele impact crater, is characterized by extensive fracturing and local displacements of separated blocks (Fig. 9D).\n(HAct1) Degraded chaotic terrain: as the chaotic terrain of HAct2, the HAct1 unit is characterized by extensive fracturing and likely by displacements of detached blocks. The morphology of the blocks is heavily degraded by fluvial erosion and weathering during the subsequent history (Fig. 9E). This unit is placed on a unit stratigraphically older than HAct2; it is viable that HAct1 is stratigraphically older than HAct2."

A wide diversity of fluvial and glacial morphologies offer an excellent evidence for activity dating from the earliest history of the region, which gave us an opportunity to reconstruct the water cycle during the recent history of Mars.\nWhile volcanic processes are present in the region and play an important role in land-forming processes, their presence in the mapped area is evidenced only by the extension of the smooth plain materials from Hesperia Planum. Alternatively, estimation of volcanic contributions is assessed indirectly through characterization of their interactions with other geologic processes."

The previous dating of these channels as late Hesperianearly Amazonian is consistent with our mapping; however, precise stratigraphic correlation of these channels preceding the Harmakhis activity is a newly observed fact.\nThe channel system that carved plain materials (Noachian/ Hesperian period) to the north of Harmakhis originates from two\nsource locations: the first is a chaos area located closely to the ejected material of the Negele crater, and the second location is close to the mountains bounded by debris aprons. The chaos region is in an early stage of development, characterized by fractured plain material (HNp1) with blocks that were not extensively displaced or abraded by the subsequent fluvial activity. Additional small channels associated with the chaos source-location incise the ejected material of the Negele crater. Occurrence of the crater structure, directly in correlation with the chaos area, may imply a plausible source of heat necessary for melting of subterranean ice, or the volcanic activity similar to that which formed the Harmakhis Vallis may have triggered the melting of ice. Downstream, a debris apron flanking a nearby mountain covers one of the channels, implying that debris aprons postdate the fluvial activity (Fig. 8E). The southern sections of the channels are truncated by Harmakhis Vallis. Depositional evidence of material derived from these channels has not been found inside Harmakhis Vallis, suggesting that the activity of these channels preceded the period of the Harmakhis fluvial activity and thus cannot be coeval with the Harmakhis Vallis as it was previously mapped by Price (1998). The morphological characteristics of the channels, braided in the upstream part and getting shallow and wide downstream (approximately 5 km wide in their downstream portions with relatively uniform widths, and depths of about 100 m) suggest an outwash event similar to terrestrial channels at glaciated outwash plains, where melt water streams mixed with sediment is discharged at the snout of the glacier (Hellden and Olafsdottir, 1999). The outwash event possibly did not last for a long time period or the quantities of released water were low, because even the deepest portions of the channels seem to be shallow in comparison to their widths (in ratio 1:50). Additionally, the chaos region, which appears to be the source area for the channels, has blocks that are only locally displaced (Fig. 8E).\nA channel system related to the chaos formation is observed in the southern portion of the map (Fig. 9E). This channel’s activity has ambiguous relations to the partially buried northern channels that terminate in this area and are masked by subsequent geological events. The channel is covered by the ejected material, which was later fractured into the chaos. From this location, the old channel is not observed further downstream. This may lead to two assumptions: either the impact event may have obliterated this part of the channel, or this location used to be a depositional\narea of the channel, and thus the channel morphology cannot be detected further downstream. The chaos region is characterized by fractured material and by material disrupted by small water streams. The fluvial activity that precedes the impact event is important as an evidence for the past waterways.\nAnother channel system that may have preceded the Harmakhis activity is mapped to the south of Reull Vallis, and originates from the fill-material of the Noachian buried crater (Fig. 8C). These sapping channels have a broad and, at places asymmetric U shape with highly varying ranges of width and length. The varying dimensions imply diverse duration of the groundwater sapping processes that may have lasted intermittently over a long time period, which indicate climatic influence as a dominant cause of formation rather than short-term events, such as reactivation of geothermal sources.\nFluvial system of the Harmakhis Vallis: like Dao Vallis, Harmakhis Vallis has a prominent chaos source region comprised of a large (110 km long and 47–59 km wide), deep collapse area. Unlike Dao Vallis, Harmakhis possesses a ‘‘barrier surface’’ formed immediately next to the major collapse. The collapse area is characterized by the deeper southern part with nearly V-shaped floor morphology and the northern part of the collapse that is much wider with geomorphic features characteristic of backwasting erosional processes. The floor of the northern area of the collapse is flat and gently sloping to the direction of the southern portion. Unlike most of the collapse wall that exhibits relatively straight top edge, the northern portion of the collapse shows irregular top wall morphology (Fig. 4B), which indicates subsequent involvement of weathering processes or different lithology of the material deposited in the north of the Harmakhis collapse.\nThere is no evidence of surface flow between the collapse and valley, which indicates a possible activity of a subsurface outwash system. Further evidence for this hypothesis is visible on the surface of the southern part of the chaos region, previously called the ‘‘barrier surface,’’ located immediately after the HSC. Two zones can be distinguished in this area (Fig. 9A): a zone with tensional fractures in section closer to the HSC, and another zone characterized by gravity collapses of the topmost material. The zone with tensional fractures was likely formed shortly after extensive and fast melting of subsurface ice from the zone of the HSC. Due to melting of subsurface ice/snow, extensive changes of subsurface volume occurred along with upwelling of floodwater, which deformed the uppermost material on its way to the surface. Immediately after the zone with tensional features, another zone with gravity collapses of surface material is observed.\nThe vallis section after the chaos has well-defined channel morphology with more or less constant widths and depths. Steep walls and nearly flat channel floor outline wide U-shaped channel profile. Smooth floor material exhibits lineation parallel to the channel walls in places. The texture of the material is very similar to those of debris aprons, suggesting a composition similar to those of the aprons (a mixture of ice and sedimentary material) (Berman et al., 2009; Forget et al., 2006; Holt et al., 2008; Pierce and Crown, 2003). The wide U-shaped profiles of the vallis section probably derive from this slow subsequent glacial erosion.\nYounger outwash systems: the presence of shallow, braided channels to the east of the HSC, in some places without channel walls, probably indicates more than one outwash event (Fig. 7). The first event appears to have formed a backwasting erosional feature (BEF) on the HSC eastern wall (Fig. 7B). This kind of feature on Earth is commonly a consequence of water streams that have flowed across unstable slopes during periods of heavy rains. Same fluvial events produced streamlined uplands around two impact craters located close to the HCS slope (Fig. 7D). The younger fluvial events are identified through the presence of narrower channels that incised the BEF. The source of the water is clearly\npositioned in the area covered by debris apron material or the debris apron itself, providing water to form these channels. Additional evidence in favor of the hypothesis of the debris apron as a source region is a retreated portion of the apron located near the channel, which implies that the apron lost a significant portion of its volume during the past. Afterward the eroded part was refilled by new apron material (see Fig. 7C). The outwash events were likely very short, since channel walls are often not easily detectable, and their widths may be inferred from different albedo values observed on THEMIS-IR-day and HRSC NADIR images. Based on the superposition of the features, the channels could be assumed as coeval with the formation of debris aprons in the area and as such represent an example of geologically very young fluvial events on Mars.\nThe most recent fluvial activity, postdating the abovedescribed outwash events, is observed in the same area. The channels incise the debris apron and can be followed downstream for approximately 60 km. One channel is approximately 100 m wide at its portion, where it incises the apron (Fig. 7C). At this location, the channel’s morphology is more clearly expressed since the apron material allowed deeper incision than the lithified plain material. This very small channel represents a fluvial event that postdated the formation of the debris apron, whose formation has been estimated approximately 40 Myrs ago (Head et al., 2005). Because there is no evidence for precipitation feeding the channel, and the apron surface exhibits loss of volume in the channel’s head portion, we infer that this fluvial activity, as in previously described events, has an origin in the melting of interstitial ice.\nSmall channels: channels incising inner walls of the Negele crater structure were likely formed during the settlement of the crater structure. These are small-scale channels, and no gullies are observed in the area."

    "text": "Most of glaciation-related mapped units are of periglacial origin; however, a number of units still have ambiguous origin and they are interpreted as potentially glacial or periglacial units (such as debris aprons), periglacial or fluvial (such as pitted plain materials, gullies and chaotic terrains) and glacial or fluvial (such as old partially buried channels).\nDebris aprons: a large number of debris aprons were identified in the area (Fig. 1). The debris aprons have been interpreted as a ‘‘mixture’’ of rocks and various quantities of interstitial ice, similar to rock glaciers or to debris-covered glaciers (Baratoux et al., 2002; Colaprete and Jakosky, 1998; Forget et al., 2006; Head et al., 2005; Holt et al., 2008; Lucchitta et al., 1992; McEwen, 1989; Pierce and Crown, 2003). While rock glacier interpretation requires periglacial environmental conditions allowing deformation and movement by creep, debris-covered glacial or ice-cored systems have again been recently brought to the discussion of the debris apron origin (Head et al., 2006a, 2006b). Most of the aprons in the mapped area show traces or multiple formation events. Additionally, small pits, honey-comb-like structures, flow ridges, moats and local flow dislocations are evidences of additional reworking of the surfaces related to melt or sublimation events at various scales. Based on these observations, it is possible to confirm that long-term climatic processes were involved in the formation of the debris aprons (e.g. Head et al., 2006a; van Gasselt et al., 2007). Our reconstruction includes additional short-term melting events such as those described in the previous section, and in the section ‘‘young outwash system’’ (Fig. 7).\nIce-facilitated landslide: this type of feature was observed near the northern and eastern walls of the HSC (Fig. 4B, C). The feature\nappears to be an ice-facilitated landslide that lost the stability due to melt of interstitial ice. We excluded volcanic origin of this material because: (1) the material is located in the middle of area that has been interpreted as a sedimentary material with interstitial ice; (2) the corrugate surface is dissimilar to pahoehoe lavas, since it exhibits very fine water channels that were likely produced by ice melting; (3) the source of the lavas is missing, because the material started downslope movements from a scar, and at other starting points it exhibits creep-like structures; and (4) the surface texture is nearly identical to those from the eastern location, which had developed on the debris apron (Fig. 4A). The surface of the apron displays different textures, similar to honey combs and those of the corrugate surface, evidencing an event of partially limited melting and local displacements of the material. Both types of morphologies (ice-facilitated landslide and debris apron) are likely formed in a periglacial type of environment.\nKettle-like structures: circular collapses of different sizes (1–3 km in diameter) resembling kettles are observed at the sides of the HSC and near its southern chaotic terrain (Fig. 5A). The terrestrial kettles are formed by melting of glacial ice left behind as the glacier retreated, similarly these structures may be an additional evidence of a melting event related to the formation and activity of Harmakhis Vallis.\nGelifluction features: the periglacial material of the lobate gelifluction features is observed on the flanks of the mountains located to the south of Reull Vallis (Fig. 5B). Analogous features to those on Mars might be formed by similar slow mass movements conditioned by the seasonal freeze–thaw action upon waterlogging topsoils and inducing movement downslope on slopes as gentle as 21 and as steep as 25–351 (Gerrard, 1992). The surface of the features does not exhibit impact structures, and based on their superposition we infer they were formed during the most recent Martian history.\nPitted plains material: the plains north of the HSC have been characterized by a pitted surface texture, whose formation has been interpreted as a result of partial collapsing of water- or ice-rich deposits modified by deflation processes (Crown et al., 1992; Price, 1998; Squyers et al., 1992) (Fig. 6). Within the northern part of this unit, we recognized a linear surface texture. Such texture may be produced due to the variable quantity and distribution of deposits mixed with ice, or may have formed during different time periods.\nChaotic regions: a range of chaotic regions is found in the mapped area. A large chaos region related to a catastrophic event of Harmakhis formation exposed a deformation mode verifying the existence of a discharge event, during which large quantities of deposits and water have been brought to the surface (see also paragraph ‘‘Fluvial system of the Harmakhis Vallis’’, Fig. 9A). The other chaotic region in the northern part of the map occupies a relatively small area (Fig. 9E). The deformation mode with a domination of fracturing, local dislocation of blocks and the channel morphology are consistent with the existence of a shortterm or low magnitude outwash event. These time-limited events are always related to relatively flat topographies and revealed a wide distribution and large quantities of underground ice stored here in the area. This suggests that the relatively flat topography of this part of the Eastern Hellas Region served as a collector of ice/snow/water moving down from the surrounding highlands providing a source of water for later channel formations (Forget et al., 2006; Harrison and Grimm, 2009).\nGullies: presence of shallow subsurface ice (Bleamaster and Crown, 2005; Fan et al., 2009), snowpacks (Christensen, 2003; Dickson et al., 2007), dry landslides (Treiman, 2003), or shallow aquifer (Heldmann et al., 2005) is proposed as potential mechanisms of gulley formation. From our mapping, we cannot clearly distinguish whether the gullies are of periglacial or fluvial origin. All of the mapped incised gullies have alcoves located within or close to\nlayered substrata that might have contained a source for gully formation (Fig. 10B). Mantled wall features or creep structures are clearly not of fluvial origin and they have unclear contact with the ice-facilitated landslide that entered within the HSC (Fig. 10A); in some cases, the slide is overlaying the gullies and in some cases gullies overlay the landslide. Based on this observation, it is possible to assume that mantled gulley features were formed contemporaneously or after the ice-facilitated landslide. The presence of gullies reflects one of the important mass-wasting processes in the area. This may be best observed within the Harmakhis channel and on the morphology of the channel fill-material. The channel profile displays an asymmetric U-shape, which resulted from higher accumulation of the channel fill-material in the portion with welldeveloped gullies (Fig. 10B). Additionally, the wall with gullies is less steep than the opposite side without gullies.\nPartially buried channels of an ambiguous origin: partially buried channels are the remains of a channel system that have incised plain materials dated as Noachian/Hesperian (Fig. 6A, B and 8A). Fig. 6 shows one of the mapped channels in the northeastern area above the main Harmakhis collapse. The channel is visible from the Hesperia plain material going downwards towards the main collapse, where its morphology is becoming obliterated. The material filling the channel belongs to pitted plains materials that have been interpreted as probable sedimentary deflation material—dated as lower Hesperian/Amazonian.\nA simple channel feature is observed on dissected plains (HNp1) close to the Harmakhis chaos (Fig. 8A). The channel is in its major portion covered by the HNp1unit.\nAnother partially buried channel is mapped south of Harmakhis Vallis and its incised plain units which have been dated as Noachian–Hesperian in age (Price, 1998) (see the map, Fig. 1). The major part of the channel is covered by mid-Hesperian plain materials, and on the southern part it is covered by chaos formed in an ejecta material also of the Hesperian period. Thus, this channel system was likely active during the Noachian/Hesperian period until the mid-Hesperian, when it became almost completely obscured by the sedimentary material that formed the surrounding plains.\nThe mapped partially buried channels are of unknown origin and they may have been formed by fluvial or glacial activity, as both of these processes have been shaping the topography of the area throughout history."

Juxtaposition of these units leads to an assumption that the hummocky material is older than the dissected plains. Korteniemi et al. (2010) suggested that the hummocky surface of this unit might have been modified by volcanic processes possibly related to Tyrrhena Patera volcanism or caused by local intrusive activity.\nA newly mapped buried channel system (fch) at the north of Harmakhis. The channels are extending to the south of Harmakhis, incising the HNh unit. These channels were possibly formed either by fluvial or glacial processes during the Noachian/ Hesperian period, before the emplacement of the HNp1unit. As the units of this period are extensively weathered and largely buried, little is known about geological processes involved in their formation.\nThe mesas mapped to the south of Reull Vallis (HAm1, HAm2) have been interpreted as the remnants of the older unit, possibly involving layers of volcanic origin probably during late Noachian/ early Hesperian, which would influence selective erosion that later led to the formation of the mesas (Ivanov et al., 2010) and it might have been related to possible volcanism that shaped the hummocky unit mapped further west in the same area (Korteniemi et al., 2010). This would imply that the lithological sequence of the plain materials to the south of Reull Vallis possibly started with an emplacement of late Noachian/early Hesperian volcanics from Tyrrhena Patera or other local volcanic source (Ivanov et al., 2010; Korteniemi et al., 2010). The sedimentary and volcanic mantle was later weathered by glacial, fluvial and eolian processes operating during the Hesperian and Amazonian periods (Ivanov et al., 2010; Mest and Crown, 2001)."

    "text": "The oldest units of this time-spam belong to diverse plains materials of the mapped area. The smooth ridged plain of Hesperia Planum (Htf) represents the Tyrrhenian volcanics dated as upper Hesperian/lower Amazonian (Crown et al., 1992).\nThe Hellas Planitia, plain terrain south of Reull Vallis (HAic, HNp2) and the plain terrain southwest of Reull up to Harmakhis Vallis (HNp2) have been previously dated as Hesperian/Amazonian (Price, 1998) and lower–upper Hesperian by Crown et al. (1992). Leonard and Tanaka (2001) dated the HAic unit as upper Noachian, whereas the HNp2 unit has been assigned to upper Noachian/Hesperian period. Based on superposition of these units and through correlation with different scales of previous mapping, we discriminated this terrain as Hesperian–Amazonian age.\nThe HAic unit contains superimposed mesa units (HAm1, HAm2) that could be fragments of an old sedimentary cover (Crown et al., 1992) removed by erosional processes. A crater sizefrequency distribution assigned the HAic unit to lower–upper Hesperian (Crown et al., 1992). Price (1998) dated this unit as middle Hesperian/Amazonian. The mesas postdate the formation of plain materials to the south of Reull.\nThe plain unit to the north of the HSC (lineated, pitted terrains (HApt)) has been dated as upper Hesperian/lower Amazonian (Crown et al., 1992). This unit is probably the oldest unit in the area exhibiting evidence for the accumulation of interstitial ice (Price, 1998).\nIn the previous works, all the channel systems in the area have been dated generally as Hesperian/Amazonian (Crown et al., 1992; Kostama et al., 2007; Price, 1998), excluding Reull and Harmakhis Valles that have been dated as younger features of the same period. Here, we report an existence of partially buried channels (fch unit) that belong to a period preceding emplacement of the plain materials (Noachian/Hesperian).\nMultiple channel systems belong to Hesperian–Amazonian period and they provide evidence for active fluvial systems operating in the area. Most of the mapped channels were sourced from glacial melting events triggered by volcanic activity or an impact cratering. No evidence for precipitation fed channels has been detected. Based on unit correlations, the channels starting from the chaos mapped to the south are incising plain materials HNh1 and HNp2 are dated as Hesperian/Amazonian.\nA channel with levees observed to the northwest of the HSC, is covered by a debris apron in the north and truncated by Harmakhis to the south. The channel incises the plain units that belong to the Noachian and Hesperian period (HNh, HNp1) and was truncated by Harmakhis Vallis. These facts imply that this channel represents a part of Hesperian channel systems.\nAn important part of the Hesperian–Amazonian fluvial channels comprises the Harmakhis fluvial activity, which marks and dominates the geology of the mapped area. Precise timing of the Harmakhis activity is not known and it has been suggested that it may have lasted from the upper Hesperian to midAmazonian period (Crown et al., 1992; Ivanov et al., 2005; Price, 1998).\nA sapping channel system (Fig. 8C), mapped to the south of Centauri Montes, incises the western portion of the HNp2 unit in the east–west direction, and belongs to the lower/middle Hesperian period."

    "heading": "6.4. Amazonian system",
    "text": "A number of mapped fluvial and periglacial morphologies belong to the Amazonian period. Debris aprons in the area are superimposed on most of the mapped units, and formed by multiple slow processes (e.g. Head et al., 2005; Pierce and Crown, 2003) during the late Amazonian, some 100 to a few Myrs ago (e.g. Baratoux et al., 2002; Hartmann and Werner, 2010; Head et al., 2005). Some of the aprons experienced massive resurfacing processes, contrasting slow processes of their formation with fast melting event(s) that caused local collapses and/or great loss of apron’s material with subsequent refilling and resurfacing (Fig. 7C). The formation of the aprons morphologies probably took place during a large fraction of the Amazonian era.\nAn ‘‘ice-facilitated landslide’’ developed within limited areas: at the north of the HSC between isolated Noachian mounts, and a portion of a debris apron on the northern side of Centauri Montes; it clearly postdates formation of the debris apron and pitted terrains on the north of the HSC. Its stratigraphic relation to young outwash channels is unclear.\nNewly mapped features belong to fluvial channels of Amazonian period. The braided channel that incised a plain to the east of the Harmakhis collapse started from a source that was covered by the debris aprons or the debris aprons provided a source for the channel formation. The channel enters into the Harmakhis collapse, causing a backwasting feature on the collapse wall (Fig. 7). Consequently, the channel postdates the formation of the Harmakhis collapse and the formation of the debris aprons. Another channel system incised the western portion of debris apron that sheds from Centauri Montes, and thus postdates the apron formation (Fig. 7).\nSmall-scale lobes of gelifluction on the flanks of the mountainous topography south of Reull are superimposed on all units; they do not contain cratering evidence, or exhibit post-formational erosion.\nMantled and channeled gully features represent the youngest morphological features in the area. Based on recent thermodynamical and linear perturbation models, the formation period of gullies has been determined to be between 20 and 1 Myr ago\nunder the current Martian climatic conditions (Dickson et al., 2007; Heldmann et al., 2005; Mellon and Philips, 2001)."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "In this study, geologic mapping and geomorphic analyses were conducted to distinguish and characterize geologic units and processes that operated in the source region of Harmakhis Vallis and its vicinity (Figs. 1, 2). Stratigraphic constraints provided limits on the timing and duration of observed processes offering further constraints for inferences concerning the geologic history of the region (Fig. 3). The history of degradation which marks the region of Harmakhis Vallis is strongly conditioned by: (1) the presence of volatiles through the late Noachian period; (2) the formation of valley networks through the Hesperian and early Amazonian period and its outflow channels formed by groundwater sapping and surface runoff; (3) Amazonian mass-wasting debris facilitated by melting of interstitial ice; (4) the most recent fluvial activity caused by localized melting events during the Amazonian.\nThe climatic conditions during the Noachian period must have been warm enough to support the existence of liquid water on the surface of the planet (Baker and Partridge, 1986; Jakosky and Phillips, 2001; Poulet et al., 2005). Although the climate must have been ‘warmer’ and ‘wetter’, it is still not clear what the temperature was, or how much water was at the surface or in the atmosphere (Poulet et al., 2005; Stepinski and Stepinski, 2005; Squyers and Kasting, 1994). Within the mapped area, the Noachian period was present in the form of the Hellas rim units and the volcanics, which evidence the presence of greenhouse gases in the area and most likely warm surface temperatures.\nThe transfer from Noachian to Hesperian was marked by the loss of water from the surface (e.g. Hodges, 2002) and a shift towards the cooler climatic conditions and an onset of glaciation (Baker and Partridge, 1986; Hodges, 2002; Tanaka et al., 1998). Evidence of the glaciation was recoded in the mapped area by the presence of the plain material (HApt) mapped to the north of the Harmakhis collapse. Later, the formation of multiple valleys sourced from ice melting events confirmed the accumulation of large quantities of ice in the region. During the upper Hesperian and early Amazonian, volcanic activity has likely prolonged the presence of liquid water at the surface in the eastern Hellas region. On the other hand, the presence of liquid water on Martian surface during the upper Hesperian or even Amazonian has been documented by Treiman et al. (1995) at the Valis Marineris region; Treiman et al. (1995) related their mapped units to the climatic conditions, which might have been more sustainable to the presence of liquid water at the surface and thus fluvial activity during this period.\nSince volcanic activity has deceased, glacial/periglacial processes have dominated, which had led to the formation of multiple debris aprons in the area. The evaluations of the Amazonian climatic conditions showed that the climate might have changed again during the last 250 Myrs, due to the orbital changes that may have led to the formation of flow-like glacial morphologies found on the surfaces of debris aprons, lineated valley fills, creep-like morphologies (Head et al., 2005, 2006a; Laskar et al., 2004; Mustard et al., 2001). Lineated valley fills, debris aprons and creep-like structures were observed in the mapped area supporting the record found at other Martian localities. Additionally, our analyses of currently available imagery from the area revealed an evidence for young Amazonian geothermal excursions with limited spatial exposure that produced small-scale fluvial channels. Because the orbital changes could not produce the formation of the channels in only certain,\nspatially limited areas, we interpret the formation of the channels caused by the geothermal heat.\nThe continuous presence of water on the Martian surface is an additional evidence that Mars is not geologically dormant, and geological processes appear to have been shifted through the time from large- and medium-scale to local small-scale events."

  "abstractText": "The mapped area of Harmakhis Vallis, at the eastern Hellas Planitia region (35130–421500S; 91100– 971300E), covers the surface area of about 212,000 km. The region displays an enhanced modification of the initial topography formed by the Hellas impact. The long and complex history of degradation and alteration involves mass-wasting processes, volcanism and fluvial activity, confronting effects of climate-induced slow mass-wasting processes to effects caused by temporary, catastrophic events (impact cratering, volcanism, etc.). Geological mapping at scale of 1:1,500,000 (full scale at 1:540,000) have been carried out on multiple co-registered data sets available from the past and ongoing orbiter missions to Mars. The mapped geomorphic features of smalland medium-scales reveal in detail events that shaped the topography of the region throughout history, providing specific constraints on the geologic and climatic history of the region. This study highlights events from the most recent Martian history, including fluvial activity recorded in relation to a debris apron flanking Centauri Montes, and evidence of recent positive geothermal anomalies of a high heat-flux with relatively small spatial extents, on the timescale of several million years ago. & 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
