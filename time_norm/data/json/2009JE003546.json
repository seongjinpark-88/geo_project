    "text": "Explosive lava‐water interactions in Elysium Planitia, Mars: Geologic and thermodynamic constraints on the formation of the Tartarus Colles cone groups\nChristopher W. Hamilton,1 Sarah A. Fagents,1 and Lionel Wilson2\nReceived 16 November 2009; revised 11 May 2010; accepted 3 June 2010; published 16 September 2010.\n[1] Volcanic rootless constructs (VRCs) are the products of explosive lava‐water interactions. VRCs are significant because they imply the presence of active lava and an underlying aqueous phase (e.g., groundwater or ice) at the time of their formation. Combined mapping of VRC locations, age‐dating of their host lava surfaces, and thermodynamic modeling of lava‐substrate interactions can therefore constrain where and when water has been present in volcanic regions. This information is valuable for identifying fossil hydrothermal systems and determining relationships between climate, near‐surface water abundance, and the potential development of habitable niches on Mars. We examined the western Tartarus Colles region (25–27°N, 170–171°E) in northeastern Elysium Planitia, Mars, and identified 167 VRC groups with a total area of ∼2000 km2. These VRCs preferentially occur where lava is ∼60 m thick. Crater size‐frequency relationships suggest the VRCs formed during the late to middle Amazonian. Modeling results suggest that at the time of VRC formation, near‐surface substrate was partially desiccated, but that the depth to the midlatitude ice table was ]42 m. This ground ice stability zone is consistent with climate models that predict intermediate obliquity (∼35°) between 75 and 250 Ma, with obliquity excursions descending to ∼25–32°. For lava thicknesses ranging from 30 to 60 m and ground ice fractions ranging from 0.1 to 0.3, an ice volume of ∼4–23 km3 could have been melted and/or vaporized by the time the lava solidified, and the associated hydrothermal systems could have retained temperatures >273 K for up to ∼1300 years.

    "text": "[2] Volcanic rootless constructs (VRCs) are generated by lava‐water interactions through repeated cycles of fragmentation and pyroclastic dispersal [Thorarinsson, 1951, 1953]. Terrestrial VRCs typically range from 1 to 35 m in height, 2–450 m in basal diameter, and occur in groups with total areas of up to ∼150 km2 [Fagents and Thordarson, 2007]. VRC analogs on Mars are typically larger than those on Earth, with heights of ^25 m, basal diameters of 30–1000 m [Fagents et al., 2002], and cone group areas of up to ∼1300 km2 [Hamilton and Fagents, 2009]. VRCs are significant because they imply the presence of active lava flows and an underlying volatile phase (e.g., groundwater or ice) at the time of their formation [Thorarinsson, 1951, 1953; Frey et al., 1979; Frey and Jarosewich, 1982; Greeley and Fagents, 2001; Lanagan et al., 2001; Fagents et al., 2002; Head and Wilson, 2002; Fagents and Thordarson, 2007; Hamilton et al., 2010a, 2010b]. Integrated geological mapping of VRCs, age‐dating of VRC‐hosting lava surfaces, and thermodynamic modeling of lava‐substrate interactions can establish where and when near surface groundwater (or ice) has been present in volcanic regions. This information is valuable for constraining models of global climate change on Mars [Head et al., 2003; Laskar et al., 2004; Head et al., 2009] and for understanding the relationships between climate, volcanism, volatile stability, and hydrothermal systems [Carr, 1996; Head et al., 2009]. [3] The Tartarus Colles are located in eastern Elysium\nPlanitia, ∼750 km northeast of Grjótá Vallis. Lanagan et al. [2001], Greeley and Fagents [2001], Fagents et al. [2002], Bruno et al.

    "text": "[5] The western Tartarus Colles cone groups are located on Mars between approximately 25–27° North and 170– 171° East (Figure 1). This region is situated between northeastern Elysium Planitia and southern Arcadia Planitia, and includes the Nepenthes Mensae and Elysium rise units [Tanaka et al., 2005] as well as a younger VRC‐hosting volcanic unit. [6] The Nepenthes Mensae unit includes knobs and mesas with intervening slope‐ and plains‐forming materials that outcrop in the Tartarus Colles and were emplaced during the early Hesperian to late Noachian [Tanaka et al., 2005]. The Tartarus Colles are surrounded by the Elysium rise unit (Figure 1b), which consists of lava flows that were erupted from Elysium Mons, Hecates and Albor Tholi, and local sources during the early Amazonian to late Hesperian [Tanaka et al., 2005]. [7] The Cerberus Fossae are located in Elysium Planitia and are associated with Amazonian age lava flows interspersed with aqueous flood deposits, tectonic features (e.g., fissures), and mantling deposits [Keszthelyi et al., 2004]. Lava flows and aqueous floods associated with the Cerberus Palus originated from the Cerberus Fossae fissure system [Burr et al., 2002; Fuller and Head, 2002; Plescia, 2003; Head et al., 2003]. Deposits related to Cerberus Fossae divide into three units. The oldest of these units is the early Amazonian age Cerberus Fossae 1 unit [Tanaka et al., 2005], located in southern Elysium Planitia. This unit is overlain to the north by the late to middle Amazonian age Cerberus Fossae 2 unit. Source regions for the Cerberus Fossae 2 unit are primarily located in Grjótá Vallis and, in this region, the youngest aqueous flood deposits are 10–40 Ma old [Burr et al., 2002]. Mapping of scoured channels, streamlined forms, and longitudinal lineations suggests that floodwater was released from the northernmost fissures of Cerberus Fossae to form north and south branches (Figure 1b), which flowed southeast toward Cerberus Planitia [Burr et al., 2002; Plescia, 2003; Burr and Parker, 2006]. Burr and Parker [2006] also noted small streamlined forms that suggest a portion of the floodwater may have traveled northeast (Figure 1), toward the Tartarus Colles. The Cerberus Fossae 2 unit is embayed by aqueous flood channels [Burr et al., 2002; Plescia, 2003; Head et al., 2003] and overlain by lava flows that have platy‐ridged textures resembling those of historic flood basalts in Iceland [Keszthelyi et al., 2000, 2004]. The youngest of these aqueous flood deposits and lava flows belong to the late Amazonian age Cerberus Fossae 3 unit [Tanaka et al., 2005; Jaeger et al., 2010].\n[8] Fuller and Head [2002] proposed that ascending dikes in Elysium Planitia may have cracked the cryosphere and released groundwater to form floods that were overlain by lava once the dikes reached the surface. In this model, rootless eruptions initiated when lava flows interacted with surface water and/or groundwater that had infiltrated into the substrate during the antecedent aqueous floods. In other models, dikes were not the cause of aqueous floods and lava flows, but rather groundwater and magma traveled toward the surface through zones of weakness in the cryosphere that were generated by regional tectonic stresses [Burr et al., 2002; Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Plescia, 2003]. [9] The youngest of the landforms on Mars to have been interpreted as VRCs are located in eastern Cerberus Palus, near the mouth of Marte Vallis [Lanagan et al., 2001]. In this region, lava surface ages are <1–10 Ma [Hartmann and Berman, 2000; Berman and Hartmann, 2002]. Stratigraphically, the Tartarus Colles cone groups are older than the VRCs in Marte Vallis, but if the VRCs in the Tartarus Colles region volatilized ground ice associated with a northeast component of an aqueous flood from Grjótá Vallis, then the Tartarus Colles cone groups may be on the order of several tens of millions of years old. If rootless eruptions occurred in the Tartarus Colles region ∼10–40 Ma ago then ice and fossil hydrothermal systems may be preserved to this day. These structures could potentially provide information about the development of habitable niches on Mars. However, if the volatile source for the rootless eruptions in the Tartarus Colles region was part of the global cryosphere, then the timing of these rootless eruptions would not depend on the age of floodwater from Grjótá Vallis. In this case, the Tartarus Colles cone groups could be significantly older than the Cerberus Fossae 2 unit, which would reduce the likelihood that fossil ice and hydrothermal structures would be preserved. The geological evidence in the Tartarus Colles region is examined to distinguish between these two hypotheses."

    "text": "[10] Constraints on the formation of the Tartarus Colles cone groups are established using a threefold methodology involving: (1) geologic mapping, (2) surface age estimations based on crater size‐frequency distributions, and (3) thermodynamic modeling of lava‐substrate heat transfer. Geologic mapping is used to identify geologic units, measure their areas, and constrain their stratigraphic relationships. This information is important for calculating VRC group areas, estimating lava thicknesses, and identifying the properties of the substrate beneath the VRC‐hosting Tartarus Colles lava flow. Crater size‐frequency distributions are used to constrain the age of the cone groups and determine the timing of their emplacement relative to other geologic events in Elysium Planitia. Thermodynamic modeling involves preliminary exploration of our model’s sensitivity to variations in initial conditions and validation of its results.We then apply the model to the Tartarus Colles region using geologic constraints (e.g., lava flow thicknesses and VRC distributions) to calculate isotherm depths in the substrate,\n2 of 24\n3 of 24\nestimate ice table depth, and constrain the maximum longevity of hydrothermal systems. By combining total VRC group area with estimated ground ice fractions and modeled isotherm depths, we quantify themaximum volume of ground ice that could have been vaporized and/or melted at the time of VRC formation. Last, we combine constraints on ground ice stability with surface age estimates to infer obliquity conditions on Mars during the late Amazonian."

    "text": "[11] Photogeological mapping of the Tartarus Colles region was performed in ArcGIS using a base map of twelve Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images, eleven MRO Context Camera (CTX) images, nineteen Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera Narrow Angle (MOC‐NA) images, the MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) Mission Experiment Gridded Data Record (MEGDR) at a resolution of 128 pixel/degree (0–44°N, 90– 180°E), the MOLA Precision Experiment Data Record (PEDR), thirteen Mars Odyssey Thermal EMission Imaging System (THEMIS) Visible (V) images, the THEMIS global daytime infrared (IR) mosaic (0–30°N, 150–180°E), and additional THEMIS daytime and nighttime IR images to fill gaps in the global mosaic and qualitatively examine the thermal inertia properties of surface materials. Appendix A provides details regarding the HiRISE, CTX, MOC‐NA, and THEMIS‐V images used within this study. [12] We mapped the Nepenthes Mensae unit using the criteria of Tanaka et al. [2005] and subdivided it into high‐ standing knobs and mesas, and slope‐ and plains‐forming deposits. We mapped the Elysium rise unit, following the conventions of Tanaka et al. [2005] and added subdivisions for high and low elevation smooth terrains and anomalous lava flows. We also identified a new volcanic unit, herein termed the Tartarus Colles volcanic unit, which hosts the Tartarus Colles cone groups. To constrain the interpretation that the cone groups are composed of volcanic rootless constructs (VRCs), we draw upon previous studies [Lanagan et al., 2001; Fagents et al., 2002; Bruno et al., 2004, 2006; Baloga et al., 2007; Fagents and Thordarson, 2007; Hamilton et al., 2010b]. These studies used morphological and geospatial evidence to demonstrate that Tartarus Colles cone groups are analogous to VRC groups in Iceland and therefore are the products of explosive lava‐water interactions. In this study, we mapped the cone group boundaries and used down‐flow elongated tephra deposits [Jaeger et al., 2007, 2008;Hamilton et al., 2010a, 2010b] to identify paleo‐ flow directions in the Tartarus Colles lava flow."

    "text": "[13] Hartmann [1966, 1999, 2005, 2007] discussed how crater size‐frequency relationships can be used to date the formation age of ideal surfaces, such as broad lava flows formed during a single event. Using this approach, we estimated the ages of the Tartarus Colles lava flow and the underlying smooth terrain. In ArcGIS, all discernable craters were digitized using a base map of CTX images with a resolution of ∼6 m/pixel. We employed a seamless crater digitizing approach because it eliminates the local sampling\nbiases that affect piecemeal crater counting methods. By assuming circular crater geometry, the areas of digitized polygons were used to calculate equivalent crater diameters. The diameters were binned following the method of Hartmann [1999, 2005] and plotted using the Martian crater‐count isochron diagram of Hartmann [2007], which employs a revised estimate of the Mars:Moon ratio of bolide impacts per km2 (Rbolide = 2.6). Berman and Hartmann [2002] and Hartmann [2005, 2007] discuss sources of error associated with deriving absolute ages from crater size‐frequency relationships and estimate that for Martian surfaces < 2 Ga old, absolute ages could vary from model ages by a factor of approximately ±2. Even with these large uncertainties, model ages can be used to assess if the Tartarus Colles lava flow, and/or the smooth terrain it rests upon, were contemporaneous with the ∼10–40 Ma old aqueous flood deposits in Grjótá Vallis [Burr et al., 2002], or if they are significantly older and thus do not share a genetic association with the Cerberus Fossae 2 unit."

    "text": "[14] Subaerial lava flows transfer heat into the substrate and surrounding atmosphere. In this study, we quantify heat transfer rates between lava flows and permafrost substrates containing ground ice. Wilson and Head [2007] modeled heat transfer during volcano‐ice interactions on Earth for supraglacial lava flows, subglacial flows, and dyke intrusions into glaciers. Supraglacial flows may appear to be analogous to subaerial lava emplaced over an ice‐bearing lithic substrate, but the supraglacial model of Wilson and Head [2007] assumes that meltwater can effectively escape from underneath the flow, which would buffer the basal lava temperature TB at the ice melting point (273.15 K). This assumption cannot be satisfied if the substrate contains a significant lithic component because the heat conducted into the underlying material will raise the substrate temperature TS and reduce the downward thermal gradient. Since a constant TB cannot be assumed when lava is emplaced over a lithic‐rich substrate, we treat this scenario using the analytical solution of Carslaw and Jaeger [1986, article 2.4, equation (14)]. [15] To solve for temperatures in the lava and underlying substrate, we consider a solid bounded by the plane x = 0 (i.e., the top of a lava flow) that extends downward to infinity in the direction of x positive (i.e., through a lava flow and into the underlying substrate; see Section 4.3.1 for an example of the model’s geometry). The initial temperature distribution is specified by a lava layer of thickness d and constant initial temperature TM that overlies an infinitely thick substrate at constant initial temperature TA. The model assumes that heat lost through the edges of the flow is negligible, the emplacement time of the flow is short relative to the total cooling time of the lava, the substrate and atmosphere are initially at thermal equilibrium at ambient temperature TA, and that relative to the total cooling history of the flow, the temperature at the top of the lava TT rapidly cools to TA. For the Earth, we consider TA to be 270 K, following the conventions of Wilson and Head [2007], whereas for Mars, we assume TA is equal to its blackbody temperature of 210 K [Barlow, 2008]. At any time, t, after local flow emplacement,\n4 of 24\nthe temperature, T, at any depth, x, beneath the lava surface is given by\nT ¼ TB þ 12 TL TBð Þ 2erf x 2 ffiffiffiffi t p erf x d 2 ffiffiffiffi t p xþ d 2 ffiffiffiffi t p\nð1Þ\nwhere TB is the temperature at the base of the flow (initially equal to TM), TL is the lava temperature (initially equal to TM, which for basaltic magma is ∼1450 or ∼1617 K if an adjustment is made to account for the latent heat of crystallization, see Section 4.3.3), is thermal diffusivity, and erf is the error function. The general form of equation (1) is the same as equation (3) of Wilson and Head [2007]; however, we note that there was a typographical error in their equation (3), whereby the leading factor of 1/2 was omitted. This error was not present in their numerical simulations and does not affect the validity of their calculations or results.\n[16] Our model differs from equation (3) of Wilson and Head [2007] in that we treat the effects of variable ground ice fractions in the substrate by accounting for the heat absorbed in melting and vaporizing H2O. To accomplish this, is obtained by dividing the ice‐free thermal diffusivity 0 (assumed to be 7 × 10\n−7 m2 s−1 for basaltic lava flows) by a correction term kAVG. Appendix B shows how we calculated kAVG for a range of ambient temperatures and ground ice conditions. [17] Wilson and Head [2007] modeled d = 1, 3, 10, and 30 m, TM = 1450 K, TA = 270 K, and they considered substrates composed of only pure ice and rock. In contrast, we apply our model over a wider range of initial conditions that includes d = 1 to 75 m, TM = 1450 and 1617 K, TA = 180 to 270 K, and FI = 0 to 0.3, where FI describes the initial ground ice fraction in the substrate. Our broader range of initial conditions encompasses approximate permafrost conditions on Mars (∼210 K) and the Earth (∼270 K), which allows us to improve upon the study of Wilson and Head [2007] by exploring how different planetary environments affect lava‐substrate heat transfer."

    "heading": "4.1.1. Nepenthes Mensae and Elysium Rise Units",
    "text": "[19] The oldest deposits in our study area belong to the Nepenthes Mensae unit, which is exposed in the Tartarus Colles (e.g., location a in Figure 2; HiRISEPSP_008818_2055, 25 cm/pixel). This unit includes high relief knobs and mesas with intervening slope‐ and plains‐forming materials (purple in Figure 3). The Tartarus Colles are surrounded by volcanic plains belonging to the Elysium rise unit (shades of red in Figure 3). The volcanic plains mainly consist of lava flows with east to northeast flow directions (Figure 1b). The lava flows exhibit lobate margins and irregular surface depressions (e.g., location c in Figure 2; HiRISE PSP_007526_2075, 25 cm/pixel) that are typical of pahoehoe lava that has inflated to produce lava‐rise plateaus with lava‐rise pits [Walker, 1991, 2009]. [20] Along the southeastern margin of our geological map (location d in Figure 2), there are two surfaces that appear to be part of a lava flow that traveled northward and embayed the topographic lows along the eastern side of the Tartarus Colles. We assign this lava flow to the Elysium rise unit—in accord with Tanaka et al. [2005]—but caution that the general northward flow direction of this lava is inconsistent with other lava flows in this sector of Elysium Planitia (Figure 1b) and may have originated from a different source.\n5 of 24\n[21] Smooth terrains belonging to the Elysium rise unit underlie the Tartarus Colles lava flow (Figure 4a) and, therefore, it is important to determine the nature of this material to constrain potential volatile sources for the rootless eruptions in the Tartarus Colles region. The smooth terrain includes two components: a low‐relief surface at low elevation and an elevated component. The elevated component covers a prominent south to north trending topographic ridge that is located in the western part of the study area (Figures 2 and 3). The elevated component mantles parts of the Nepenthes Mensae and Elysium rise units (location e in Figure 2, and Figure 4a), but the contacts are partly obscured by sedimentary deposits (Figure 4b). Along the topographic ridge, the elevated component of the smooth terrain reaches a height of ∼175–225 m above the surrounding plain. There is a transition within the smooth terrain (dashed white line in Figure 2) where a light tone and low‐ relief surface grades into a darker and rougher surface (location f in Figure 2, and Figure 4c). In the light‐toned region, a 1.01 km diameter impact crater generated blocky ejecta with a high thermal inertia (based on qualitative examination of THEMIS nighttime IR images, e.g., I14080005, 99.24 m/pixel) that is similar to the nearby rough surface material (Figure 4c). This suggests that the impact crater excavated through a thin mantle of smooth light‐toned material and into the underlying darker and rougher material. Craters on the light tone, low‐relief surface tend to exhibit greater sedimentary infilling than the craters on the darker rough surface (Figure 4c). The eastern boundary between the smooth terrain and the lava of the Elysium rise unit is indistinct, but may occur along the western margin of a south‐north trending wrinkle ridge (location g in Figure 2). In this vicinity, the smooth terrain exhibits a dark, rough surface with irregular depressions resembling a lava‐rise plateau (e.g., location c in Figure 2). Within the smooth terrain (e.g., CTX image P03_002344_2067_XN_26N189W, 5.73 m/pixel) there are bright streaks trending northeast‐southwest. These streaks appear preferentially on the southwest side of craters and\n6 of 24\nmay have been caused by sediment transport under a prevailing northeast wind. [22] Based on the observations presented in this section, we conclude that the smooth terrain consists of one or more lava flows belonging to the Elysium rise unit, but that its surface has been partially mantled by a westward‐thickening veneer of aeolian sediments. We infer that the substrate beneath the Tartarus Colles lava flow consists primarily of lava and that there may be an intervening layer of sediments, but we have found no evidence to suggest that these sediments were deposited by aqueous floods. 4.1.2. Tartarus Colles Volcanic Unit [23] The Tartarus Colles volcanic unit includes the youngest volcanic features in the western Tartarus Colles region. In the northern portion of the study area, there is a low (∼60–80 m high) shield‐like edifice (dark gray in Figure 3) with a well‐developed network of distributary channels and/or collapsed lava tubes (e.g., location h in Figure 2;\n7 of 24\nHiRISE PSP_008027_2070, 25 cm/pixel). The lava shield has lobate margins and, where the shield surrounds high‐ standing outcrops of the Nepenthes Mensae unit, the lava appears to have developed inflation clefts that are typical of inflated pahoeoe [Walker, 1991; Self et al., 1996, 1998]. [24] The surface of the lava shield generally has a scalloped appearance, pervasive dust mantling, and exhibits extensive degradation. Topographic lows in the northern part of the volcanic shield have been inundated by lava (location i in Figure 2 and medium gray in Figure 3), but given the flow geometry, local slope directions, and orientation of the flow margins, the mantling lava appears to associated with the same episode of volcanism that constructed the rest of the shield. [25] The shield‐like edifice is overlain by the Tartarus Colles lava flow (light gray in Figure 3) and its associated cone groups (yellow in Figure 3). The Tartarus Colles lava flow traveled downslope toward the north, but encountered a topographic barrier formed by the Nepenthes Mensae unit (e.g., location j in Figure 3). The constricted flow of lava\n8 of 24\nthrough this narrow (∼1.2 km‐wide) breach allowed the lava to over‐thicken on the south side of topographic obstacle (Figure 5). Gradual drainage of the lava through the constriction caused the lava level to decrease from its highstand elevation—marked by continuous lava deposits along the margins of the Nepenthes Mensae unit—to form a lower elevation surface that includes a late‐stage channel (Figure 5c). Lava that flowed through the constriction then spread out within the topographic lows formed between the knobs and mesas of the Nepenthes Mensae unit (e.g., location k in Figure 2). [26] Locally, the Tartarus Colles lava flow developed platy‐ridged surfaces (e.g., Figures 4a and 4b), which form as disrupted sections of lava crust are transported down‐ flow [Keszthelyi et al., 2000, 2004]. Where cone groups occur in association with platy‐ridged lava surfaces (e.g., Figure 5b), there are chains of raised‐rim deposits, which Jaeger et al. [2007, 2008] and Hamilton et al. [2010a, 2010b] interpret to be the products of rootless explosions that deposit tephra onto moving lava surfaces. The lava then rafts the tephra down‐flow to form elongated VRCs. The Tartarus Colles cone groups also include radially symmetric conical landforms with central craters (e.g., Figure 5b), which Hamilton et al. [2010a, 2010b] interpret to be the products of rootless eruptions that deposit tephra onto stationary surfaces. If rootless eruption sites are active before and after a lava surface comes to rest, then rootless eruptions can generate transitional landforms (e.g., Figure 5b), which include a chains of low‐relief tephra deposits (formed while the surface of the flow was moving) that can be traced up‐flow to radially symmetric VRCs (formed when the surface of the flow came to rest). Interactions between the Tartarus Colles lava flow and the cone groups provide evidence of their concurrent emplacement. [27] Mapping of >250 lava‐rafted tephra deposits shows that the Tartarus Colles lava flow moved through the topographic lows between the high‐standing outcrops of the Nepenthes Mensae unit to form several radiating branches (Figure 3). The flow directions were dominantly to the north, but there was also a western branch that curved to the south (Figure 3). Within the southern portion of this lava branch (location l in Figure 2) there is a region with HiRISE image coverage (PSP_003900_2055, 25 cm/pixel) that includes excellent examples of radially symmetric VRCs ranging ∼10–400 m in basal diameter with most cones being 50–150 m in diameter [Hamilton and Fagents, 2009]. To the northeast there is a type locality for Martian VRCs (location k in Figure 2), which has been studied by Lanagan et al. [2001], Fagents et al. [2002], Bruno et al. [2004, 2006], Baloga et al. [2007], and Hamilton et al. [2010b]. Hamilton et al. [2010b] interpret the smooth regions surrounding the conical landforms to be tephra deposits that grade from a sheet‐like distal facies into a platform facies with a proximal cone facies that includes welded spatter deposits. [28] The shield‐like edifice (location h in Figure 2) bifurcated the northward flowing lava into northwest and northeast branches. The northwestern branch directly overlies the smooth terrain and includes the largest cone group in the study area (1258 km2; Figure 3). VRCs in the northeastern flow branch (location m in Figure 2; CTX P14_006669_2050_XN_25N188W, 5.71 m/pixel) exhibit pronounced down‐flow elongation; however, this branch extends beyond the extent of the continuous CTX image coverage and cannot be mapped entirely. [29] Mapping of the Tartarus Colles region reveals that there are 167 cone groups, but additional VRCs are likely to be located within portions of the northeastern lava branch that extend beyond the geological map. Mapped VRC groups range in area from ∼0.01 to 1258 km2 and cover a total area of 2014 km2."

    "text": "[30] To constrain the ages of the smooth terrain and the Tartarus Colles lava flow, we digitized all recognizable craters on these two surfaces. The resulting geospatial database includes 4018 craters on the smooth terrain and 8721 craters on the Tartarus Colles lava flow. Figure 6 presents results for craters ≥44.2 m in diameter. The turning point in the frequency distribution occurs at the next largest bin size (62.5 m), which implies that smaller crater frequencies are incomplete due to data resolution limitations. The crater‐size frequency relationships also show that craters > 1.0 km are rare within both units (Figure 6). For craters < 1.0 km in diameter, the smooth terrain exhibits a gentler slope on the crater‐count isochron diagram than the Tartarus Colles lava flow (Figure 6). We attribute this gentler slope to infilling and burial of small craters in the smooth terrain due to aeolian mantling. Consequently, when using crater size‐frequency relationships to estimate the model age of the smooth terrain, we weight the larger craters more heavily. [31] Within the southern part of the study area, small (<176 m in diameter) craters in the Tartarus Colles lava flow tend to concentrate within elongate regions with unusually dense crater populations relative to their surroundings. We interpret the dense concentrations of small craters to be of secondary origin and therefore weigh the significance of larger craters more heavily when estimating the age of the Tartarus Colles lava flow. [32] Based on the crater size‐frequency relationships presented in Figure 6, and the above mentioned caveats, we estimate that the smooth terrain and the Tartarus Colles lava flow are late Hesperian and middle Amazonian age, respectively. Given that uncertainties in model ages derived from Martian crater size‐frequency relationships can vary by a factor of ±2 [Berman and Hartmann, 2002], we infer that the smooth terrain could be of early Amazonian to early Hesperian age. However, given that this terrain overlies materials from the Elysium rise unit and that Tanaka et al. [2005] estimate the Elysium rise unit to be early Amazonian to late Hesperian, we can exclude the possibility that the smooth terrain was emplaced during the early Hesperian. This constraint allows us to refine our age estimate for the smooth terrain to the early Amazonian to late Hesperian. This age estimate is in accord with the age of the Elysium Rise unit [Tanaka et al., 2005], and is consistent with the geologic interpretation that the smooth terrain belongs to the Elysium Rise unit. With a factor of ±2 uncertainty in the age of the Tartarus Colles lava flow, we estimate that it formed ∼125 Ma ago with a range of uncertainty from 75 to 250 Ma ago (i.e., late to middle Amazonian). This crater retention age is significantly older than the 10–40 Ma age of the\n9 of 24\naqueous flood deposits associated with the Cerberus Fossae 2 unit in Grjótá Valles [Burr et al., 2002]."

    "text": "[33] Figure 7 presents the components of our thermodynamic model. In this example, we consider a 1 m thick lava flow with an initial lava emplacement temperature TM = 1617 K (elevated from 1450 K by 167 K to account for the latent heat of crystallization, see Section 4.3.3), ambient temperature TA = 210 K (to simulate permafrost conditions onMars), and an initial ground ice fraction FI of 0.2. Figure 7 shows the 1273, 373, and 273 K isotherm depths as a function of time. These isotherms approximately correspond to the temperature of the basaltic solidus, water boiling point, and ice melting point, respectively. In this model, depths are calculated from the lava flow surface (x = 0), but when discussing isotherm depths in the substrate, the lava flow thickness d is subtracted from x. [34] The model reproduces the well‐documented square root of time dependence on the growth of chilled lava crusts [Hon et al., 1994; Keszthelyi and Denlinger, 1996] and—for Earth‐like conditions—estimated lava solidification times show good agreement with the emplacement duration of equivalent thickness terrestrial lava flows (see Section 4.3.6). Nevertheless, the model suffers from the following limitations. It is a one‐dimensional model that cannot directly account for the flux of lava though internal pathways (e.g., lava tubes), which would supply heat after the initial emplacement of the flow. By increasing TM to account for the latent heat of crystallization, the heat transfer rate at the base of the flow is artificially increased. It is assumed that the emplacement duration is short relative to the total cooling history of the flow and thus the flow is treated as an instantaneously emplaced unit. The temperature at the top of the flow TT is assumed to rapidly decrease to TA, but in a natural system heat flux through the top surface of the lava flow would maintain TT above TA for a significant period of time. Last, the analytical solution of Carslaw and Jaeger [1986, article 2.4, equation (14)] assumes uniform thermal diffusivity throughout the semi‐infinite half‐space of the model and thus does not treat the thermal properties of the lava flow and substrate separately. In our model, the ice‐free thermal diffusivity is divided by a correction term kAVG to account for the presence of water in the substrate\n10 of 24\n(Appendix B), but improved models would treat heat transfer through a system containing multiple layers, each with unique thermophysical properties. 4.3.2. Uncertainties in Ambient Temperature Conditions [35] The thermal effects of lava‐permafrost interactions are calculated given a range of flow thicknesses (d = 1, 10, 30, 60, and 75 m), initial lava temperatures (TM = 1450 and 1617 K), initial ground ice fractions (FI = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3), and ambient temperature conditions (TA = 180 to 270 K). This range of TA includes approximate permafrost conditions on Mars (210 K) and the Earth (270 K). Figures 8a–8d show how isotherm depths vary with TA and d, given TM = 1617 K and FI = 0. The results show that isotherm depths have a nonlinear dependence on TA and that uncertainties in TA become increasingly significant as TA approaches 273 K. [36] For approximate ambient temperature conditions on Mars and the Earth, we examined the effects of incorrectly estimating TA by 10, 20, and 30 K. The results are summarized in Appendix B and they show that for assumed ambient conditions on Mars, an overestimate (underestimate) of 30 K modifies the corresponding isotherm depths by factors of 1.09 (0.90), 1.14 (0.85), 1.16 (0.83), and 1.33 (0.65). In contrast, overestimating TA by 30 K for ambient conditions on Earth causes the depths of the 373 K isotherm at TL = 1273 K, 273 K isotherm at TL = 1273 K, maximum 373 K isotherm, and maximum 272 K isotherm, to be overestimated by factors of 1.10, 1.48, 1.24, and 3.96, respectively. This sensitivity analysis demonstrates that although isotherm depths are sensitive to TA, this model is more robust for Mars than for the Earth given equivalent uncertainties in initial ambient temperature. [37] Figures 9a and 9b show the linear relationship between lava flow thickness and isotherm depth for ambient temperature conditions on Mars (210 K) and the Earth (270 K), respectively, given no ice in the substrate and TM = 1617 K. These results show that each of the four isotherms achieve greater depths on Earth than on Mars by the following factors: 1.21 for the 373 K isotherm at TL = 1273 K, 1.73 for the 273 K isotherm at TL = 1273 K, 1.48 for the maximum 373 K isotherm, and 6.09 for the maximum 273 K isotherm. The 273 K isotherms are influenced the most by variations in TA because as the ambient temperature increases, less thermal energy is required to elevate the substrate to the ice melting point. 4.3.3. Latent Heat of Crystallization [38] The thermodynamic model does not directly calculate the latent heat of crystallization generated within cooling lava flows, but the latent heat of basaltic magma LM (∼2 ×\n11 of 24\n105 J kg−1) can be estimated by increasing TM by an amount DT such that LM is approximated by the sensible heat cMDT, where cM corresponds to the specific heat of the magma (∼1200 J kg−1 K−1 at magmatic temperatures). For basaltic magma, this correction amounts to an increase of TM by ∼167 K [Wilson and Head, 2007]. Results shown in Figures 8 and 9 were generated with TM = 1617 K. However, to assess how this assumption affects our results we have also performed simulations with TM = 1450 K, where 1450 K is assumed to be the eruption temperature of the lava. [39] For the same ambient temperature conditions, isotherm depth ratios for TM = 1617 K to TM = 1450 K should be constant because these isotherm depth relationships are linear with respect to changes in lava thickness and ground ice fraction (e.g., Figures 9a and 9b), but small uncertainties were obtained due to the resolution of the time steps in the simulations. For TA = 210 K (i.e., ambient thermal conditions on Mars), the ratio of isotherm depths obtained using TM = 1617 K to TM = 1450 K, averaged over all lava flow thicknesses and ground ice fractions (±1 standard deviation), are as follows: 1.31 ± 0.02 for the 373 K isotherm depth at TL = 1273 K; 1.26 ± 0.02 for the 273 K isotherm depth at TL = 1273 K; 1.14 ± 0.01 for the maximum 373 K isotherm depth; and 1.10 ± 0.01 for the maximum 273 K isotherm depth. 4.3.4. Interpretations of Isotherm Significance in Terms of H2O Phases [40] The isotherm depths presented in Figures 8 and 9 are significant because the maximum depths of the 373 K and 273 K isotherms describe the maximum depths to which ground ice could be vaporized and melted, respectively. In contrast, the depths of the 373 K and the 273 K isotherms at TL = 1273 K describe the thermal conditions that would exist in the substrate when the last parcel of lava cools to a temperature that is too low to generate dynamic rootless eruptions. This limit occurs because cooling‐induced increases in viscosity would reduce the efficiency of dynamic lava‐water mixing and inhibit explosive molten fuel‐coolant interactions (MFCIs) [Wohletz, 1986, 2002; Zimanowski, 1998]. Although MFCIs may be suppressed before TL = 1273 K, the time required for the lava to reach its solidus defines the maximum duration of substrate heating that could occur prior to complete lava solidification and, after this time, it would be impossible to generate rootless eruptions through\n12 of 24\n13 of 24\nexplosive MFCIs. Nevertheless, variations in either water purity or pore pressure could affect interpretations of the significance of these isotherms in terms of water phase stability. For instance, the triple point of H2O is at 273.16 K at 612 Pa, and below this pressure water would only be present in a gas phase [Carr, 2006]. Fortunately, the elevation of the Tartarus Colles region ranges from approximately −3000 m to −3300 m (Figure 2) and thus even under current environmental conditions (i.e., global mean atmospheric pressure of 560 Pa and mean atmospheric scale height of 10.8 km), liquid water could exist under the right thermal conditions because the local mean atmospheric pressure is approximately 740 to 760 Pa. [41] In the pressure range from 612 to 101,325 Pa (i.e., from the H2O triple point to standard atmospheric pressure at sea level on Earth), the ice melting point changes by only 0.01 K (i.e., from 273.16 to 273.15 K). Consequently, for expected atmospheric conditions on Mars and the Earth, it is inferred that the 273 K isotherm will approximately equal the ice melting point. However, over the same pressure range, the H2O boiling point changes from273.16 to 373.15K. The pressure‐dependence of the H2O boiling point therefore\n14 of 24\naffects interpretations of the 373 K isotherm in terms of water phase stability, but it does not affect estimates of the combined total volume of ground ice that was melted or vaporized. 4.3.5. Validation of the Model Results [42] For TM = 1617 K, lava flows ranging from 1 to 75 m in thickness, and ambient temperature conditions on Mars and the Earth, respectively, Figures 9c and 9d present the time required for lava core temperatures TL to reach 1273 K. This cooling time is approximates the lava emplacement duration, but to assess whether the modeling results are reasonable, we compared our modeled lava solidification times—given FI = 0 and TA = 270 K—to the emplacement durations of equivalent thickness pahoehoe sheet lobes on Earth [Thordarson and Self, 1998]. For the fifteen flows in\nTable 4 of Thordarson and Self [1998]—excluding Alviðruhamrar because the total lobe thickness was not measured— the ratio of calculated stagnation times to their estimated emplacement times is 0.91 ± 0.33. Thus, our results tend to slightly underestimate the time for the lava emplacement, but we infer that this is partly due to the fact that the model does not account for the supply of heat that would be introduced into the system by lava fluxing through internal pathways (e.g., lava tubes) and partly due to excess heat loss through the top surface of the lava flows because of the TT = TA boundary condition. 4.3.6. Longevity of Hydrothermal Systems Generated by Lava‐Substrate Interactions\n[43] The vast majority of all life on Earth draws its energy either directly or indirectly from photosynthesis, but there are also organisms that derive their energy from chemical disequilibria generated in hydrothermal systems, and it has been proposed that chemosynthesis may be the most plausible source of energy for putative life on Mars [Shock, 1997; Jakosky and Shock, 1998; Varnes et al., 2003]. To assess the potential for establishing near surface hydrothermal systems on Mars and the Earth, given a range of lava flow thickness from 1 to 75 m and ground ice fractions from 0.1 to 0.3, we calculated the maximum duration for which temperatures in the substrate could remain above 273 K. The results are shown in Figures 9e and 9f for ambient conditions on Mars and the Earth with TM = 1617 K and FI = 0.2, but given that our model does not take into account convective circulation, our calculations will overestimate the longevity of hydrothermal systems. For ambient temperature conditions in permafrost environments on Mars (TA = 210 K) and an initial ground ice fraction of 0.2, liquid water could only remain for <0.3 years beneath a 1 m thick flow, and <1.6 × 103 years beneath a 75 m thick flow. Given the same ground ice fraction and ambient temperature conditions on Earth (TA = 270 K), liquid water would be stable from <6.5 years for a 1 m thick flow to <3.8 × 104 years for a 75 m thick flow."

    "text": "[45] Figure 3 depicts the location of THEMIS‐V image V26915031 (18.58 m/pixel), which is shown in Figures 10a and 11. Overlapping HiRISE and CTX image coverage enables MOLA PEDR elevations to be precisely correlated with geologic features. The region shown in Figures 10a and 11a includes 24 MOLA tracks. All of these tracks show similar associations between elevations and morphological units, but we focus on a segment of track #18940 because it crosses all of the major surface types in the region. The track extends north‐northwest to south‐southeast from the smooth terrain (X in Figure 10), across a portion of the Tartarus Colles lava flow, and into part of the largest cone group (Y in Figure 10). Lava thicknesses were obtained by subtracting a local datum—extrapolated from the surface elevation of the smooth terrain—from MOLA PEDRs of the lava surface. [46] Estimating lava thicknesses as the difference between lava surface elevations and a local datum is reasonable for this portion of the Tartarus Colles lava flow because the underlying smooth terrain has a surface slope of only 0.03 to 0.09°. These slopes correspond to an elevation difference of less than ∼1.5 m/km and are comparable to Tharis‐related volcanic units, which slope gently at 0.08° for a distance of 2500 km [Aharonson et al., 1998]. [47] Along the MOLA transect, the smooth terrain (feature A in Figure 10) is overlain by lava with a sharply defined flow front (feature B in Figure 10) that consists of 100–250 m wide lobes. The lobes coalesce into a lava‐rise plateau [Walker, 1991] with a mean thickness of 30.3 ± 6.9 m (at 1 standard deviation, se = ± 0.8 m). The surface of the lava‐rise plateau is interrupted by an impact crater (feature C in Figure 10) with a rim‐to‐rim diameter of 1.53 km. The thickness of the lava‐rise plateau continues to increase gradually to the south‐southwest until it intersects a higher relief plateau (feature D in Figure 10). [48] This second lava plateau has indistinct margins, which vary from 1 to 3 km in width, and its surface is pitted and blocky. Local flow directions, defined by the orientation of elongated VRCs (Figure 3), show that the supply of lava into this region was from the east‐southeast. Along the northern slope of the second lava plateau there is a VRC group located between features E and F in Figure 10. Between features F and G (Figure 10), the second lava plateau attains a thickness of 60.2 ± 12 m (at 1 standard deviation, se = ± 2.6 m) and extends to the east to form a broad continuous platform that underlies the largest VRC group in the study area. Between features H and I (Figure 10) there is a topographic saddle between two branches of the\n15 of 24\n∼60 m thick lava plateau. At the southern end of the MOLA profile (south of feature I in Figure 10), the lava flow appears to reach a thickness of ∼100 m; however, this region coincides with a VRC group and thus the thickness of the Tartarus Colles volcanic unit at this locality would include a thickness contribution from both the Tartarus Colles lava flow and overlying rootless tephra deposits. 5.1.2. Interpretation of Lava Thickness Variations [49] We attribute the bimodal lava thickness variations in the study area to two plateaus of inflation within the Tartarus Colles lava flow, rather than the superposition of two separate flows. The sharp lobate flow margins, thickness profile, and smooth surface morphology of the lower lava plateau are characteristic of inflated pahoehoe [Thordarson and Self, 1998]. In contrast, the second plateau has indistinct margins and a rough, pitted, and blocky surface. These characteristics are consistent with rubbly pahoehoe, which forms due to pressurization of a molten lava core—either by pulsed lava supply or interactions with obstacles to flow— followed by disruption of the overlying lava into blocks and/ or slabs [Keszthelyi et al., 2004; Guilbaud et al., 2005]. The second plateau is inferred to be bounded by rubbly pahoehoe that inflated behind a peripheral blockage—perhaps caused by cooling‐induced stagnation along the thinner flow margins of the first plateau. VRCs concentrate in the second lava plateau, where lava is > 30–60 m thick, but tend not to form in the first lava plateau, which is < 30 thick (Figure 10). [50] To demonstrate that the MOLA PEDR profile shown in Figure 10 is representative of regional lava thickness distributions, we have applied a similar method of subtracting a local datum from the MOLA MEGDR 128 pixel/ degree data for a region between 26 and 27°N and 170.2– 171.2°E. This region was chosen because CTX and THEMIS‐V imagery shows that the Tartarus Colles lava flow directly overlies the low elevation component of the smooth terrain, which permits us to extrapolate the ∼0.05° slope of the smooth terrain beneath the Tartarus Colles volcanic unit to estimate the overlying lava thickness. In Figure 11a, estimated lava thicknesses and cone group boundaries show that the VRCs preferentially concentrate in\n16 of 24\nthe thicker parts of the lava. Figure 11b shows the lava thicknesses frequency distributions. [51] The lava thickness distribution is bimodal, with peaks at 25–30 m and 55–60 m, whereas the lava thicknesses within the cone groups are unimodal, with a mean of 59.5 m (s = ±8.3 m, se < ±0.1 m). The bimodal lava thickness peaks correspond to the two lava plateaus identified in Figure 10 and thus we infer that results based on MOLA PEDR track #18940 are representative of general lava thickness distributions within the Tartarus Colles lava flow. 5.1.3. Relevance of Lava Thicknesses to Thermodynamic Modeling [52] If the bimodal variations in the surface elevation of the Tartarus Colles lava flow correspond to two plateaus of inflation within a single flow, then the cooling lava layer of thickness d (equation (1)) corresponds to the combined thickness of both lava plateaus. Figure 10b shows the isotherm depths obtained by applying our thermal model to the estimated lava thicknesses along the MOLA profile in Figure 10. The simulation assumes TM = 1617 K and TA = 210 K. In this case, isotherms are diachronous and ground ice fractions are irrelevant because they affect modeled cooling rates, but not the maximum isotherm depths. The isotherms in Figure 10b exhibit bimodal depth distributions that reflect the bimodal variation in lava thicknesses, but the isotherm depths are expected to be overestimated beneath the VRC groups because rootless tephra would contribute to the apparent lava thickness. Given that the ∼30 and ∼60 m thick lava plateaus identified in Figure 10 occur in a region that contains the majority of the Tartarus Colles VRCs (Figure 3), we assume that the combined thickness of these two lava plateaus is representative of the total lava thicknesses in other VRC‐hosting sections of the Tartarus Colles lava flow."

    "text": "[53] Isotherms at TL = ∼1273 K describe the thermal conditions that exist when the core temperature of a lava flow reaches its approximate solidus temperature. After this time, rootless eruptions cannot be generated by explosive MFCIs because the lava will be in a solid state and can no longer participate in the MFCI processes of hydrodynamic premixing, triggering, fine‐fragmentation, and explosive water vaporization [Wohletz, 1986, 2002; Zimanowski, 1998]. Where VRCs are present, the ground ice table must therefore have been located above the depth of the 273 K isotherm when TL = 1273 K. [54] On Mars, a 30 m thick lava flow would reach 1273 K after ∼3 to 9 years, for a range of ground ice fractions from 0 to 0.3. When TL = 1273 K, the depth of the 373 K isotherm would be 12.6 m (with an uncertainty of +1.1 m and −1.3 m given potential errors in the estimate of TA by up to ±30 K), whereas the 273 K isotherm would reach a depth of 18.3 m (+2.6 m and −2.7 m given TA ± 30 K). The general absence of VRCs on sections of the Tartarus Colles lava flow that are <30 m thick suggests that the uppermost substrate (i.e., to depths of up to ∼16–21 m) contained insufficient ground ice to generate rootless eruptions. In contrast, rootless cones tend to occur where lava is >30–60 m thick. For ground ice fractions ranging from 0 to 0.3, a 60 m thick flow would cool to its solidus within ∼11 to 34 years and the 373 K\nand 273 K isotherms would have reached depths of 26.4 m (+2.4 m and −2.6 m given TA ± 30 K) and 37.2 m (+5.2 m and −5.6 m given TA ± 30 K), respectively. [55] These isotherm depths represent maximum estimates because the rootless eruptions must have initiated before the lava reached its solidus. For instance, within the Cerberus Fossae 3 unit on Mars, Jaeger et al. [2010] measured the thickness of tilted lava slabs in the Athabasca Valles flood lava that were upended in response to loading by rootless tephra. Jaeger et al. [2010] applied a lava cooling model— adapted from Keszthelyi and Denlinger [1996]—to estimate that the ∼1 m thick tilted slabs would have formed ∼11 days after the lava flow surface came to rest, but it is uncertain how long the flow surface was in motion before it stagnated and began to form a competent surface crust. In the Tartarus Colles region, lava surfaces have not been tilted by the loading of rootless tephra, which suggests that lava crusts were able to support the rootless tephra because they had a longer cooling duration and thus were thicker and had greater mechanical strength. This implies that prior to the initiation of rootless eruptions, the Tartarus Colles lava flow generally had a longer cooling duration than the Amazonian Athabasca Valles lava flow. However, the presence of lava‐ rafted rootless tephra deposits in the study area suggest that some rootless eruptions initiated soon after the local emplacement of the Tartarus Colles lava flow because the flow surface was still undergoing a period of autobrecciation due to flow motion [Jaeger et al., 2007, 2010]. Thus, while the time required for lava core temperatures to reach their solidus represents a maximum upper bound on the time available for heating the substrate prior to the initiation of rootless eruptions, it is inferred that rootless eruptions initiated considerably before TL = 1273 K and that results overestimate isotherm depths in the substrate at the time of cone formation."

    "text": "[56] Given that VRCs are indicative of an underlying groundwater (or ice) reservoir at the time of their formation, the mapped areal extent of rootless cone groups (i.e., 2014 km2) can be combined with the thermodynamic model to estimate the maximum volume of ground ice that could have been vaporized and/or melted at the time of the cone forming eruptions. These calculations only consider ground ice volumes directly below the Tartarus Colles cone groups and, therefore, lateral migration of volatiles in the substrate is ignored. It is assumed that TM = 1617 K and TA = 210K, but to account for uncertainties in estimates ofFI and d, the model is applied over a range of conditions that include FI = 0.1 to 0.3 and d = 30 to 60 m. The H2O melting point is generally insensitive to pressure and, therefore, the 273 K isotherm will approximately correspond to the ice melting temperature in the Tartarus Colles region. Thus, 3.7 to 22.5 km3 of ground ice could have been melted by the time the Tartarus Colles lava flow solidified. [57] In contrast to the ice melting point, the boiling point of H2O is highly sensitive to pressure and therefore given the same temperature distribution, the partitioning of melted ground ice into liquid or gas phases will depend on substrate pore pressure. If the pore pressure were ∼105 Pa (i.e., standard atmospheric pressure at sea level on Earth) then the\n17 of 24\nboiling point of water would be 373 K. Given that Martian surface gravity g is 3.71 m/s2, the pressure at the base of a basaltic lava flow, with a density r = 2500 kg/m3, would reach 101,325 Pa when the lava reached a thickness h = 9.93 m (lithostatic pressure = rgh). For pore pressure conditions of ∼105 Pa, the volume of ground ice that could have been vaporized at TL = 1273 K would therefore have been 2.5–16.0 km3, and the total volume of ground ice in a liquid state would have been 1.2–6.5 km3. If pore pressure were <105 Pa, there would be more vapor and less liquid water, whereas if the pore pressure was >105 Pa—due to lithostatic loading by the overlying substrate and Tartarus Colles lava flow—then there would have been a larger proportion of liquid water relative to vapor. Given that rootless eruptions in the Tartarus Colles region tend to occur where lava is 30– 60 m thick, we expect lithostatic pressure at the base of the flow to be 2.78–5.56 × 105 Pa, which corresponds to a water boiling point of ∼403–427 K. Given that explosive MFCIs require coolant (i.e., water) to initially be in the liquid phase, lithostatic pressure controls on the water boiling point may therefore be an important factor in determining where rootless eruptions can occur on Mars."

Link et al. [2005] demonstrated that chemical weathering of minerals in aqueous environments on Mars can provide enough geochemical energy to support the construction of potential Martian organisms at temperatures as low as 273 K. However, given that even very thick lava flows on Mars are unlikely to generate long‐lived hydrothermal systems, the rates of these geochemical weathering processes could pose a significant barrier to the habitability of ephemeral hydrothermal systems associated with lava flows in Martian environments."

    "text": "[59] The critical lava thickness required to generate rootless eruptions in the Tartarus Colles lava flow (∼30–60 m) is greater than in other VRC‐hosting regions of Mars, such as Marte Vallis, which have estimated lava thicknesses of ∼10 m [Lanagan et al., 2001]. Relative to Marte Vallis, the greater lava thickness required to generate VRCs in the Tartarus Colles region may be due to a lower ground ice abundance per unit volume of substrate, which would require thicker flows to supply sufficient thermal energy to mobilize an equivalent volume of ice. A lower abundance of ground ice in the near surface substrate of the Tartarus Colles region could have been due to lower substrate porosity and/or a greater depth to a buried ground ice reservoir. [60] The depth to the top of the global cryosphere is strongly dependant on latitude and time‐dependent variations in obliquity [Squyres et al., 1992; Mellon and Jakosky, 1995]. The current mean annual surface temperature on Mars varies with latitude from ∼160 ± 5 K at the poles to\n∼220 ± 5 K at the equator, and the global frost point temperature of water is ∼200 K [Squyres et al., 1992]. Consequently, ground ice in equilibrium with the water vapor content in the atmosphere is restricted to latitudes that are poleward of approximately ±40° [Farmer and Doms, 1979; Squyres et al., 1992]. At higher obliquities, the polar regions receive more insolation, which causes the mean annual polar temperatures to rise and the annual equatorial temperatures to decrease. Increased polar temperatures cause the polar ice caps to melt/sublime, thereby increasing the amount of water in the atmosphere, increasing the frost point temperature, and widening the near equatorial latitude belt over which ground ice is stable. [61] The obliquity of Mars is currently 25.19°, but over the past 5 Ma, Mars’ obliquity has oscillated between 15 and 40°, with a mean of 27 ± 6° [Laskar et al., 2004]. There was a significant increase in obliquity 5 Ma ago and, from 5 to 20 Ma ago, the mean obliquity was 36 ± 5°, with a range of 24–47° [Laskar et al., 2004]. VRCs near the mouth of Marte Vallis are estimated to be <10 Ma old [Lanagan et al., 2001] and therefore these low‐latitude rootless eruptions likely formed when obliquity was higher than it is at present. If the Marte Vallis and Tartarus Colles cone groups formed under similar environmental conditions, then it is probable that the Tartarus Colles lava flow was emplaced under intermediate (∼35°) obliquity conditions as well. Prior to 10–20 Ma ago, precise obliquity solutions cannot be derived due to chaotic variations [Laskar et al., 2004], but probabilistic obliquity scenarios can be constrained using geological evidence that documents changes in ground ice stability through time [Head et al., 2009] (see Section 6.2). [62] At and below the present obliquity of 25.2°, ground ice is unstable at all latitudes less than 40–50°, whereas at obliquities ≥32.3° ground ice would be stable at all latitudes, with the ice table being <5–10 cm below the surface at all latitudes [Mellon and Jakosky, 1995; Carr, 2006]. The presence of VRCs within the Tartarus Colles region implies that at the time of the rootless eruptions there was ice in the substrate and, therefore, that obliquity was >25.2°. Nevertheless, the general absence of VRCs in sections of the flow that are <30 m thick suggests that the uppermost ∼16–21 m of substrate was at least partially desiccated, which implies that the paleo‐obliquity was <32.3°. The heterogeneous VRC distributions in the Tartarus Colles region may have resulted from variations in lava flow thicknesses. Rootless eruptions may have preferentially initiated where the flow was >30 m thick because only these portions of the flow would have contained sufficient thermal energy to enable the 273 K isotherm to reach the depth of the global ice table. If so, the ice table must have been located at a depth <42.4 m based on the maximum depth of the 273 K isotherm beneath a 60 m thick lava flow when TL = 1273 K. [63] Alternatively, the Tartarus Colles flow could have volatilized water associated with a localized ground ice body that was perched above the global cryosphere. In this scenario, the distribution of rootless cone groups in the Tartarus Colles region could have been controlled by groundwater that infiltrated into the substrate during one or more aqueous floods [Lanagan et al., 2001; Fuller and Head, 2002]. This process would have preferentially generated rootless eruptions over former topographic depres-\n18 of 24\nsions because these sites would have been the most favorable locations for concentrating the flow of floodwater and lava. However, based on observed crater size‐frequency relationships, we estimate that the smooth terrain was emplaced during the early Amazonian to late Hesperian. The smooth terrain directly underlies the Tartarus Colles lava flow and, therefore, age constraints suggest that the timing of a potential aqueous flood in the Tartarus Colles region is incompatible with the late to middle Amazonian age floodwaters associated with the Cerberus Fossae 2 unit [Tanaka et al., 2005]. Consequently, if one or more aqueous floods did pass through the Tartarus Colles region, then they were not affiliated with any of the previous described units associated with the fossae in Grjótá Vallis [Burr et al., 2002; Plescia, 2003; Burr and Parker, 2006]. Consequently, the hypothesis that the volatile source for rootless eruptions in the Tartarus Colles region was the global cryosphere is favored over that of a perched ground ice reservoir that formed by infiltration of floodwater into the substrate. This suggests that rootless eruptions on Mars are not limited to regions that have been inundated by aqueous floods."

    "text": "[64] The preferential occurrence of VRCs on ∼30–60 m thick portions of the Tartarus Colles lava flow suggests that obliquity was between 25 and 32° at the time of the cone formation. If this obliquity range is compared to the fifteen probabilistic obliquity scenarios of Laskar et al. [2004] for the period over which the Tartarus Colles lava flow could have been emplaced (i.e., 75–250 Ma ago based on an estimated age of ∼125 Ma and a factor of ±2 uncertainty), geological evidence excludes models that predict extended periods of unusually high or low obliquity during the past 250 Ma. This conclusion is in accord with that of Head et al. [2009] who suggested that the intermediate obliquity scenario 301003BIN_A.N001 [Laskar et al., 2004] provides the best agreement with the geological evidence for midlatitude glaciations during the Amazonian Period in other regions of Mars. This scenario shows that on average obliquity was >32.3° during the past 250Ma, but that ∼125Ma ago there were frequent obliquity excursions descending into the range of ∼25–32° [Laskar et al., 2004]. Head et al.’s [2009] preferred scenario agrees with obliquity estimates in this study and supports our conclusion that ∼125 Ma ago, a shallow (<42.4 m depth) midlatitude (25–27°N) ice table was present below a thin (<16–21 m) zone of near surface desiccation."

    "text": "[65] The crater retention age for the Tartarus Colles lava flow (i.e., late to middle Amazonian) is younger than the early Amazonian to late Hesperian lava flows that have been attributed to the Elysium rise unit [Tanaka et al., 2005]. The Tartarus Colles lava flowed north, whereas in this sector of Elysium Planitia other lava flow directions generally range from east to northeast (Figure 1b). This anomalous flow direction could suggest that the Tartarus Colles lava flow originates from a local source to the south, or that an eastward moving lava flow was deflected to the north after being captured by the south‐southwest to north‐northeast\ntrending valley that runs between Grjótá Vallis and the Tartarus Colles. Although aqueous flood deposits from Grjótá Vallis may obscure the source region of the Tartarus Colles lava flow, age estimates suggest that this lava flow preceded the most recent episode of aqueous flooding in Grjótá Vallis. The cone‐forming rootless eruptions must therefore have volatilized an older water source, such as the global cyrosphere, and not groundwater that infiltrated into the substrate during any known aqueous flood. If the Tartarus Colles lava flow is associated with an event that occurred before the emplacement of the Cerberus Fossae 2 unit, then it may have resulted from an precursory phase of volcano‐tectonic activity that was associated with the migration of active volcanism away from central Elysium Planitia and toward Cerberus Fossae during the early to middle Amazonian—perhaps in accord with changes in the regional state of stress that led to the formation of the fossae in Grjótá Vallis during the late Amazonian."

    "text": "[66] The Tartarus Colles region includes outcrops of the early Hesperian to late Noachian Nepenthes Mensae unit, which is exposed in the Tartarus Colles, and volcanic landforms that have been attributed to the early Amazonian to late Hesperian Elysium rise unit [Tanaka et al., 2005]. Within the Elysium rise unit we have identified a series of lava‐rise plateaus, which include the sediment mantled lava flow(s) that comprise the smooth terrain. The Tartarus Colles lava flow overlies the smooth terrain and was emplaced as a northward traveling flow that overtopped a topographic low in the Nepenthes Mensae unit and inundated the valleys within the Tartarus Colles. Photogeological mapping shows that the Tartarus Colles lava flow hosts a minimum of 167 VRC groups with a total area of at least 2014 km2. These VRC groups include radially symmetric conical landforms with central pits, rootless tephra complexes, and VRCs with down‐flow elongated tephra deposits. Interactions between the Tartarus Colles lava flow and cone groups demonstrate that the lava and VRCs were emplaced concurrently and crater size‐frequency relationships suggest that the Tartarus Colles lava flow is late to middle Amazonian age. This age estimate is younger than that of the Elysium rise unit, but older than the most recent aqueous flows in Grjótá Vallis [Burr et al., 2002]. Consequently, the Tartarus Colles lava flow may have been associated with changes in the regional state of stress that led to a migration of volcanic activity away from Elysium Planitia and toward the Cerberus Fossae. [67] The Tartarus Colles lava flow exhibits two lava plateaus, which are ∼30 m and ∼60 m thick. VRCs concentrate where lava is >30–60 m, but tend not to form where the lava is <30 m thick. This suggests that the underlying ground ice was located at <42 m depth, but that VRCs did not form where the lava was <30 m thick because the uppermost 16–21 m of the substrate was partially desiccated. This zone of ground ice stability suggests the Tartarus Colles cone groups formed during a period of extended intermediate obliquity (∼35°), with excursions descending to ∼25–32°.\n19 of 24\nTable A1.

The longevity of hydrothermal systems generated by lava flows on Mars are more than an order of magnitude smaller than those calculated for equivalent thickness lava flows on Earth, which places a significant constraint on the time available for achieving the chemical disequilibria required for biological chemosynthesis through aqueous weathering of minerals in ephemeral hydrothermal systems on Mars."

Equation (B4) accounts for heat absorbed in melting H2O ice and warming the substrate to 373 K, where 373 K is assumed to be just below the water vaporization temperature. Over the range of pressure conditions that are relevant to lava‐substrate heat transfer processes, icemelting temperatures are generally insensitive to pressure, but the vaporization temperature can change dramatically. In our calculation of k373, we assume that significant volumes of water vapor will not be generated on Earth andMars below 373 K. This assumption is generally valid beneath lava flows on Mars because the pressure at the base of a 10 m thick lava flow would be ∼1.11 × 105 Pa (lava thickness × lava density × gravitational acceleration on Mars = 10 m × 3000 kg/m3 × 3.7 m/s2), which is greater than standard sea level pressure on Earth (1.01 × 105 Pa), where water vaporizes at 373.15 K. However, more sophisticated applications of our model should take into account pressure controls on phase changes when calculating corrections to ice‐free thermal diffusivity. For T above 373 K, kT becomes,\nwhere LV is the latent heat of vaporization of water (1.80 × 106 J kg−1) and cV is the specific heat of water vapor (2000 J kg−1 K−1).

Table B3 presents kAVG corrections that would apply where TA varies between 180 K and 270 K. To assess the sensitivity of the model to\nuncertainties in ambient temperature conditions, predicted isotherm depths for a range of assumed TA versus true TAwere examined given TM = 1617 K and FI = 0 (i.e., kAVG = 1 for all temperatures). Tables B4 and B5 show the results for Mars and the Earth, respectively. For Mars, overestimates and underestimates of TA by 10, 20, and 30 K were considered. For the Earth, the effects of overestimating TA by 10, 20, and 30 K were examined. Underestimates of TA are not considered because permafrost on Earth would not form above ∼270K. Simulated isothermdepth ratios for different TA values are invariant to lava flow thickness because of the linear relationship between lava flow thickness and isotherm depth.\nNotation\ncM, cR, cI, cL, cV Specific heat of magma (1200 J kg −1 K−1\nfor basaltic magma), rock (900 J kg−1 K−1 for solidified basalt), water ice (1900 J kg−1 K−1), liquid water (4186 J kg−1 K−1), and water vapor (2000 J kg−1 K−1) (J kg−1\nK−1). d Lava flow thickness (m).\nFR, FI, FW Fraction of rock, ice, and water in the substrate, respectively (dimensionless).\nCorrected thermal diffusivity ( = 0/kAVG) (m2 s−1). 0 Ice‐free thermal diffusivity (7 × 10 −7 m2 s−1\nfor basaltic lava) (m2 s−1). kAVG Average thermal diffusivity correction term\n(dimensionless). kT Thermal diffusivity correction factor at\ntemperature T (K) (dimensionless).

  "abstractText": "[1] Volcanic rootless constructs (VRCs) are the products of explosive lava‐water interactions. VRCs are significant because they imply the presence of active lava and an underlying aqueous phase (e.g., groundwater or ice) at the time of their formation. Combined mapping of VRC locations, age‐dating of their host lava surfaces, and thermodynamic modeling of lava‐substrate interactions can therefore constrain where and when water has been present in volcanic regions. This information is valuable for identifying fossil hydrothermal systems and determining relationships between climate, near‐surface water abundance, and the potential development of habitable niches on Mars. We examined the western Tartarus Colles region (25–27°N, 170–171°E) in northeastern Elysium Planitia, Mars, and identified 167 VRC groups with a total area of ∼2000 km. These VRCs preferentially occur where lava is ∼60 m thick. Crater size‐frequency relationships suggest the VRCs formed during the late to middle Amazonian. Modeling results suggest that at the time of VRC formation, near‐surface substrate was partially desiccated, but that the depth to the midlatitude ice table was ]42 m. This ground ice stability zone is consistent with climate models that predict intermediate obliquity (∼35°) between 75 and 250 Ma, with obliquity excursions descending to ∼25–32°. For lava thicknesses ranging from 30 to 60 m and ground ice fractions ranging from 0.1 to 0.3, an ice volume of ∼4–23 km could have been melted and/or vaporized by the time the lava solidified, and the associated hydrothermal systems could have retained temperatures >273 K for up to ∼1300 years.",
