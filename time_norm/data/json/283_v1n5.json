    "text": "Mass extinction events have fundamentally shaped the history of life on Earth, and many recent studies focus upon catastrophic factors as the cause. Two types of event have been invoked: episodes of continental flood basalt volcanism and major bolide impacts (asteroids or comets). Several studies have compared dates of extinction events of various magnitudes with dates of flood basalt episodes and found significant correlations, thus supporting a possible causeand-effect connection (e.g. Stothers 1993; Courtillot 1999). The apparent coincidence of eruptions in the Siberian flood basalt lava flow province with the severe extinctions at the end of the Permian, ~250 Ma ago, and the near-coincidence of activity in the Deccan flood basalt province (India) and the extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous suggest that flood basalt eruptions may have contributed significantly to some mass extinction events, as summarized by Wignall (2001 and this issue).\nContinental flood basalt (CFB) provinces are a type of large igneous province (LIP) and are erupted subaerially for the most part. CFB province formation is unique with respect to all other subaerial basaltic magmatism because it is charac-\nterized by the repeated effusion of huge magma batches over a short period of geologic time (<1 Myr). These short-lived, main pulses of eruptive activity (Rampino and Stothers 1988) consist of many large-volume and prolonged eruptions, each commonly yielding lava flow fields (see glossary) of 102–103 km3 (FIG. 1). Both the volume of magma emitted during these individual eruptions and the total volume of magma released during the main eruptive pulses (up to several million km3) are exceptional in Earth history.\nThis contribution examines the potential for volcanic gas release during flood basalt eruptions and the manner in which this gas release might then affect regional and global environments. The\nobvious major way is through the effects of gases and resultant aerosols on the Earth’s atmosphere and surface processes during and immediately after an eruption. Previous studies have not investigated the species of gas released, which are carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxides (NOx), and the dominant volcanic gas, H2O, or the quantities. Important considerations are how often these gases were released during the main eruptive pulse (i.e. what was the eruption frequency?) and the manner in which they were introduced into the atmosphere by flood lava activity. Clearly, such information will enable better constrained simulations to be made regarding the climatic and environmental impact of flood basalt volcanism.\nHere, we consider only sulfur (S), as its common gas SO2, and CO2, although it is increasingly recognized that NOx emissions may also have affected local and regional ecosystems (e.g. Mather et al. 2004). We assess the potential amount of gases released during past flood basalt eruptions in order to determine the degree of atmospheric pollution and hence potential environmental deterioration attributable to this activity. The work builds on the one study made so far that obtained a gas-release budget for an individual flood basalt eruption, that of the Roza lava flow field in the mid-Miocene Columbia River basalt province of eastern Washington State, USA (Thordarson and Self 1996), together with recent advances in knowledge concerning similar basaltic eruptions in Iceland.\n283E L E M E N T S , V O L . 1 , P P . 2 8 3 – 2 8 7 DECEMBER 2005\nStephen Self1, Thorvaldur Thordarson2, Mike Widdowson1\n1 Volcano Dynamics Group, Department of Earth Sciences, The Open University, Milton Keynes, MK7 6AA, UK\n2 Department of Geology and Geophysics University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa 1680 East-West Road, Honolulu HI 96822, USA\nCorresponding author: Stephen.Self@open.ac.uk\nSubaerial continental flood basalt volcanism is distinguished from allother volcanic activity by the repeated effusion of huge batches ofbasaltic magma (~102–103 km3 per eruption) over short periods of geologic time (<1 Myr). Flood basalt provinces are constructed of thick stacks of extensive pahoehoe-dominated lava flow fields and are the products of hundreds of eruptions. Each huge eruption comes from a dyke-fed fissure tens to hundreds of kilometres long and lasts about a decade or more. Such spatial and temporal patterns of lava production do not occur at any other time in Earth history, and, during eruptions, gas fluxes of ~1 Gt per year of SO2 and CO2 over periods of a decade or more are possible. Importantly, the atmospheric cooling associated with aerosols generated from the SO2 emissions of just one flood basalt eruption is likely to have been severe and would have persisted for a decade or longer. By contrast, warming due to volcanogenic CO2 released during an eruption is estimated to have been insignificant because the mass of CO2 would have been small compared to that already present in the atmosphere.\nKEYWORDS: flood basalt volcanism, eruption volumes,\ngas release, atmospheric impact\nBack-scattered electron map of olivine (blue) in\nglass (yellow).

Calculations assuming magma volatile contents of 1–1.5 wt% suggest that fountains during periods of peak eruptive output may have exceeded 1.5 km in height. Further, model estimates for convective plumes rising above the fountains indicate eruption column heights in excess of 13 km. Thus, at tropical to midlatitudes, flood eruptive activity is readily capable of lofting\ngases and small amounts of fine ash to mid- to uppertropospheric altitudes, and to the base of the stratosphere for high-latitude (or higher intensity) eruptions. In addition, flood lava flows themselves are also capable of releasing gas from their surfaces as they move away from the vent system (FIG. 2), thus creating a lower level atmospheric gas and aerosol cloud. The combined release of gas from fire fountains and the surface of lava would be near-continuous throughout the period of eruptive activity, which may last from a few to perhaps >100 years. Clearly, the impact of such huge, long-term degassing events is likely to be significant.\nFlood basalt events have been considered to influence the environment in two ways: (1) by atmospheric cooling caused by sulfuric acid (H2SO4) aerosols generated from the SO2 released, which scatter and absorb incoming solar radiation, thus increasing the opacity of the atmosphere (e.g. Rampino and Self 2000); and (2) by atmospheric warming through the addition of the greenhouse gas CO2 (e.g. McLean 1985; Olsen 1999). These two simple cause-andeffect scenarios are a simplification of much more complex phenomena. For instance, SO2 may act as a greenhouse gas if present in sufficient concentrations at low altitudes, whereas widespread climatic cooling would be primarily a result of the formation and spread of stratospheric sulfuric acid (H2SO4), or sulfate, aerosols formed by oxidation of the SO2 with water and hydroxyl OH- radicals in the atmosphere (Robock 2000). In addition, while anthropogenic\nCO2 emission is now known to cause measurable global warming, the actual quantities likely to be released during an individual CFB eruption, although prodigious, are very small when compared with the natural atmospheric reservoir."

    "text": "Estimates of S emissions from past eruptions can be made by measuring the pre-eruption S concentration in glass (melt) inclusions trapped within crystals (FIGS. 2 AND 3) and the post-eruption concentration (remaining in the melt after degassing) in glassy tephra or lava (Devine et al. 1984). This ‘petrologic method’ of determining degassing budgets has recently been validated for modern basaltic eruptions (Sharma et al. 2004) and from degassing estimates during recent flood lava flows such as Laki (Thordarson and Self 2003; Thordarson et al. 2003). These studies demonstrate that ~75% of volatile S species present in the rising melt are released at the vents, largely as SO2. The gas is then rapidly transported into the atmosphere where it instantly begins to convert to sulfuric acid aerosols, and continues to do so over periods of days to about 1 month. The months-long Laki eruption is estimated to have released ~120 Mt of SO2, delivered by quasi-continuous emission but with maximum fluxes reaching 6 Mt per day in the early stages [1 megatonne (Mt) = 1012 grams (g)]. At this rate, three days of Laki emissions would have released the same amount of SO2 as the entire 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption!\nSulfur gas releases from ancient flood basalt eruptions, the youngest of which is the ~16 Ma Columbia River basalt province, are more difficult to determine because the lavas have typically been affected by the action of weathering and ground water alteration, which can lead to the removal of mobile volatile elements. In addition, the petrologic method requires phenocrysts containing glass inclusions, but flood basalt successions are dominated by crystal-poor flows. However, the well-preserved and porphyritic Roza lava flow is one case where the S loss during eruption can be measured (FIG. 2), and determinations indicate that concentrations of S in the pre-eruption magma were similar to that of the Laki magma. The eruption of this 1300 km3 pahoehoe lava flow field is estimated to have released about 12 Gt of SO2 [1 gigatonne (Gt) = 1000 Mt], along with significant amounts of HF and HCl (Thordarson and Self 1996). If the Roza event lasted about 10 years, then the annual average SO2 burden added to the atmosphere could have been as much as 1.2 Gt, with a significant portion injected into the lower stratosphere above a 12 to 14 km high tropopause by fire fountains and associated convective columns (up to 15 km above the vents). This equates to ~3 Mt of SO2 per day at a lava effusion rate of ~0.3 km3 per day, a value similar to the longer term SO2 emission rate maintained from the Laki vents for several weeks during the summer of 1783.\nFor crystal-poor flood basalt lavas, or in instances where alteration renders the petrological method untenable (for instance, the 65 Ma Deccan lavas of India), a chemical ratio proxy can be used to estimate the original S content of the lavas. This method is based upon an observed relationship between the composition (i.e. FeO content) of recent and historic basaltic lavas and their observed S content derived either by direct degassing measurement or from glass inclusion data (Thordarson et al. 2003). The relationship can be further refined by substituting the FeO/TiO2 ratio of the glass or the bulk lava composition (FIG. 4). Quantitative values for the pre-degassed content of ancient lavas may be estimated for the first time using this proxy technique.\nBoth the petrologic and proxy approaches indicate that vast volumes of SO2 are likely to have been released continuously during eruption and emplacement of individual flood\nWall of Dry Falls (about 200 m high), Grand Coulee gorge, Washington, USA, in the mid-Miocene Columbia River\nflood basalt province, showing a section through four pahoehoe lava flow fields (1–4), each the product of a huge-volume eruption of >1000 km3 of lava.

Such huge gas emissions, maintained for many years, are totally unprecedented in any preconceived models of volcanic gas release and sulfate aerosol generation (cf. Pinto et al. 1989). As a crude estimate taking into account the range of magma compositions involved, for each cubic kilometre of lava emitted during basaltic flood lava eruptions, between 5 and 10 Mt of SO2 would have been released into the atmosphere.\nVolcanogenic SO2 is converted to H2SO4 aerosols in the troposphere and stratosphere; in many eruptions, magmatic water and entrained tropospheric water entering the stratosphere with the eruption columns are sufficient for this conversion. Very large burdens of SO2 would, however, have the potential to greatly deplete stratospheric H2O and OH- (Bekki 1995). The global stratosphere contains ~1 Gt of H2O, but how an enormous amount of aerosols would manifest itself on atmospheric chemistry and dynamics cannot yet be assessed. The balance between a quasi-continuous volcanogenic source of S gas, the resulting H2SO4 aerosol formation rates, and the deposition rates for aerosols is only just beginning to be tested by atmospheric chemistry models (Stevenson et al. 2003). From modern eruptions it is known that significant volcanic S injection into the stratosphere results in measurable global cooling (e.g. Blake 2003). Volcanic aerosol clouds at any altitude in the atmosphere should cool the Earth’s surface if the aerosol particle size is in the normal range (Lacis et al. 1992), and a maximum cooling effect is achieved by low-level aerosols. Therefore, volcanogenic aerosols in the troposphere, as well as the stratospheric aerosols, will lead to cooling of the surface. However, after most volcanic eruptions, tropospheric aerosols have a very short lifetime of only about one week before they are ‘washed out’ by cloud formation and rain, while stratospheric residence times are much longer (typically up to 2 years).\nEstimates suggest that single flood basalt eruptions can generate such large amounts of sulfate aerosols that they could create regional optical depths (a measure of atmospheric opacity, see glossary) of >10. At such high levels of aerosol loading, it is arguable that the immediate climate cooling might suppress convection in the lower atmosphere to the extent that ‘rain-out’ might become less effective at removing the aerosols. Similarly, stratospheric dehydration would occur due to the high-altitude portion of the injected gas and delay the conversion to aerosols of further masses of injected gas (Savarino et al. 2003) during the prolonged eruptions. Clearly, even though the cooling effect resulting from a massive continuous flux of S gas resulting from an average flood lava eruption can perhaps be crudely calculated (Jolley and Widdowson 2005), global climate models will be required in order to further explore the details regarding the extent and severity of the effect."

    "text": "To date, there are no direct measurements of CO2 concentrations in glass (melt) inclusions within crystals from flood basalt lavas that may give an indication of pre-eruption values. CO2 is relatively insoluble in basaltic melts, and even CO2 abundances in glass inclusions may not reflect the original (mantle) values (Wallace and Anderson 2000). Some arc-setting basalts contain up to 2120 ppm CO2 (i.e. 0.21 wt%), and work on Mexican and Hawaiian basaltic lavas suggests between 0.2 and 0.5 wt% (Cervantes and Wallace 2003). Nevertheless, the universally low CO2 concentrations (usually <0.03 wt%) measured in the matrix glass of recent subaerially erupted lavas indicate that degassing of CO2 is a highly efficient process.\nSchematic illustration showing the key features of a twostage degassing model for a flood basalt eruption (modi-\nfied from Thordarson et al. 2003). The amounts of SO2 degassed are\ndetermined by a study of the Roza flow, Columbia River basalt province (after Thordarson and Self 1996); the absolute masses of SO2 are based on a flow volume of 1300 km3.\nFIGURE 2\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article-pdf/1/5/283/3109458/283_v1n5.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nAccepting 0.5 wt% as a reasonable but possibly high value for pre-eruptive CO2 concentration, and assuming 100% degassing, approximately 13 Mt of CO2 could be released for every km3 of basaltic lava erupted. Thus the total CO2 release from a 1000 km3 eruption might be about 13 Gt. While this is a very large mass, it represents less than 1/200 of the amount of CO2 present in the modern atmosphere (~3000 Gt), and only about 3% of the current annual land–atmosphere CO2 flux. Moreover, because the gas would actually be released throughout the eruptive event, the annual fluxes to the atmosphere during such an eruption would be considerably smaller. A more realistic estimate might be to assume 80% efficient degassing of CO2 during a 1000 km3 eruption; this would yield a flux of ~1 and ~0.2 Gt per year for 10 and 50 year eruption durations, respectively. Clearly, such annual fluxes are negligible when compared with the natural atmospheric reservoir."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "We have shown that during decade-long flood basalt eruptive events, and over the whole period of generation of a flood basalt province, immense and sustained degassing events should occur on a periodic basis. These events are incomparably greater in scale than volcanic gas releases at any other time in Earth history. While the impact of volcanic S gas release may be profound, the mass of CO2 directly released by individual flood lava eruptive events is tiny in comparison to the normal mass in the troposphere and stratosphere. The predicted increases in atmospheric concentration are a fraction of the current anthropogenic CO2 released from hydrocarbon burning (~25 Gt per year). Moreover, while the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is currently ~3000 Gt, it was perhaps double this value during the late Cretaceous (i.e. ~6000 Gt). It is therefore unlikely that volcanic CO2 had a direct effect on mechanisms of global warming, supporting earlier findings by Caldeira and Rampino (1990). In addition, there would have been more than sufficient time for the extra mass of CO2 added to equilibrate, given that the lava-forming eruptive events must have been spaced at least hundreds, and probably thousands, of years apart. By contrast, SO2 emissions and the atmospheric burden of sulfate aerosols generated during\nflood basalt events appear to be unprecedented at any other time in Earth history. Acid rain may also have been widespread. What is less certain is whether affected biota would have had time to recover from the deleterious effects of sulfate aerosol clouds and acid rain, although quiescent intervals lasting millennia appear to offer ample time for the recovery of local biological and environmental systems (Jolley 1997).\nThe picture emerging from work on the Columbia River and Deccan flood basalt provinces is of a rapid, very voluminous eruptive pulse consisting of hundreds of eruptions, with average repose times of thousands of years between successive eruptions. However, in reality, these eruptive hiatuses must have varied considerably in duration. The SO2 released during each eruption would have formed considerable amounts of sulfate aerosols, with effects lasting at least as long as the eruptions persisted (decades and possibly longer). The potential impact of such huge, longduration degassing events under palaeoclimatic and palaeoatmospheric conditions warrants much further investigation."

Two types of event have been invoked: episodes of continental flood basalt volcanism and major bolide impacts (asteroids or comets). Several studies have compared dates of extinction events of various magnitudes with dates of flood basalt episodes and found significant correlations, thus supporting a possible causeand-effect connection (e.g. Stothers 1993; Courtillot 1999). The apparent coincidence of eruptions in the Siberian flood basalt lava flow province with the severe extinctions at the end of the Permian, ~250 Ma ago, and the near-coincidence of activity in the Deccan flood basalt province (India) and the extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous suggest that flood basalt eruptions may have contributed significantly to some mass extinction events, as summarized by Wignall (2001 and this issue)."
