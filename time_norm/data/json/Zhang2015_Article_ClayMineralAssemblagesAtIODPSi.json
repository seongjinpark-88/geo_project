The results show that clay minerals at Site U1340 are dominated by illite, with a moderate amount of smectite and chlorite, and minor kaolinite. Sediment source studies suggest that the clay mineral assemblages and their sources in the studied core are controlled primarily by the climate conditions. During the warm periods, clay minerals originated mainly from the adjacent Aleutian Islands, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios increased. During the cold periods, clay minerals from the Alaskan region distinctly increased, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios declined. Based on smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and clay mineral crystallinities, the evolutionary history of the paleoclimate was revealed in the Bering Sea. In general, the Bering Sea was characterized by warm and wet climate condition from 4.3 to 3.94 Ma, and then cold and dry condition associated with the enhanced volcanism from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thereafter, the climate gradually became cold and wet, and then was dominated by a cold and dry condition since 2.74 Ma, probably induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. The interval from 1.95 to 1.07 Ma was a transitional period of the climate gradually becoming cold and wet. After the middle Pleistocene transition (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), the Bering Sea was governed mainly by cold and wet climate with several intervals of warm climate at ~0.42 Ma (MIS 11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9) and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), respectively. During the last 9.21 ka (the Holocene), the Bering Sea was characterized primarily by relatively warm and wet climatic conditions.\nthe Bering Sea, Site U1340, clay mineral, crystallinity, paleoclimate\nCitation: Zhang Q, Chen M H, Liu J G, et al. 2015. Clay mineral assemblages at IODP Site U1340 in the Bering Sea and their paleoclimatic significance. Science China: Earth Sciences, 58: 707–717, doi: 10.1007/s11430-014-5049-3\nThe Bering Sea, as a semi-enclosed marginal sea of the Pacific Rim with a surface area of 2.29×106 km2, is the third largest marginal sea in the world, surpassed only by the Mediterranean and the South China Seas (Hood, 1983). As a depositional basin with high primary production and an outlet to both the North Pacific and the Arctic Oceans, the\nBering Sea plays a significant role in modern and past global climatic systems, and well records the climatic and environmental changes of the subarctic regions in the sediments (Takahashi, 1998, 1999). Given its unique location and pivotal role, the Bering Sea is a critical place for the reconstruction of subarctic climate variability on various time scales (Takahashi, 2005). Therefore, the comprehensive knowledge of the paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic features of the Bering Sea can improve our understanding of\nthe evolutionary history of the paleoenvironments related to the climate changes in the subarctic (Takahashi et al., 2011).\nBy employing long-term sedimentary sequences from IODP Expedition 323, Pliocene-Pleistocene paleoceanography studies have been conducted preliminarily in the Bering Sea. Aiello et al. (2012) revealed the evolution of sedimentation on the basis of sedimentary constituents, particle size and petrographic analyses. März et al. (2013) reported a special period of high export productivity from 2.6 to 1.8 Ma on the basis of the biogenic silica record at Site U1341. Onodera et al. (2013) and Teraishi et al. (2013) respectively showed diatoms, silicoflagellates, and ebridians results at Site U1341 and Site U1343 that were used to decipher the general paleoceanographic conditions. Zhang et al. (2014a) reconstructed the vertical water-mass conditions mainly on the basis of the radiolarian assemblages. Using the warm-water radiolarian species Spongodiscus biconcavus at Site U1340, Chen et al. (2014) revealed the water-mass exchanges between high and low latitudes and their relations to the global climate changes. However, these studied were focused primarily on the paleoceanophic changes and their responses to global climate change events. Systematic studies on regional climatic characteristics and their evolutionary history on long timescales in the Bering Sea and adjacent continents remained lacking until\ntoday. Clay minerals, which are provided by physical or chemical weathering processes from various lithological rocks on land, are one of the most important components in sediment of the world’s oceans. Because the clay mineral types and the proportions of the individual clay minerals are closely related to paleoclimatic conditions of continental source area and the nature of the source rocks (e.g., Singer, 1984; Chamley, 1989; Liu Z F et al., 2005, 2007, 2012; Liu J G et al., 2013), clay mineral assemblages have been widely applied to studying sediment source and paleoclimate evolution in various regions (e.g., Chamley and Diester-Haass, 1979; Ehrmann, 1998; Franke and Ehrmann, 2010). This study is aimed to present a detailed record of clay mineral assemblages at IODP Site U1340, and then discuss the source areas for clay minerals and the paleoclinatic conditions in the Bering Sea and adjacent continents."

The sediments in the studied core consisted mostly of dark greengray diatom ooze or diatom silt, except for a few volcanic ash layers and siliciclastic sediments (Takahashi et al., 2011). A total of 120 samples were taken with a sampling interval of 1.5 m from the top 15m and 6 m for the rest of the core.\nClay minerals (<2 μm) were separated based on the Stoke’s settling velocity principle after removing carbonate and organic matter with acetic acid (15%) and hydrogen peroxide (10%), respectively (Wan et al., 2006, 2007, 2008). Clay mineralogy determinations were performed by standard X-ray diffraction (XRD) on an X’Pert Pro MPD diffractometer with CuKα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) in Guangzhou Institute of Energy Conversion, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Three XRD runs were conducted, following drying at room temperature, ethylene-glycol solvation for 12 h, and heating at 490°C for 2 h. Scans were performed from 3°to 30° 2θ with a speed of 0.008 °2θ per second. Identification and interpretation of clay minerals were made mainly using the position of the (001) series of basal reflections on the three XRD diagrams of air drying, ethylene glycol solvation, and heating conditions (Moore and Reynolds, 1997). Relative percentages of the four main clay mineral groups were estimated by weighting integrated peak areas of characteristic basal reflections (smectite –17 Å, illite –10 Å, and kaolinite/chlorite –7 Å) in the glycolated state using the Topas 2P software with the empirical factors of Biscaye (1965). Relative proportions of kaolinite and chlorite were determined from the ratio of 3.57/3.54 Å peak areas.\nThe crystallinity is an effective measure of the lattice ordering and crystallite size for clay minerals (Biscaye, 1965; Ehrmann, 1998). The illite and smectite crystallinities are generally expressed as the integral breadth (2θ) of the illite 10 Å and smectite 17 Å peaks (Petschikc et al., 1996; Ehrmann, 1998). The integral breadth is the width of the rectangle, which has the same height and the same area as the measured peak. The illite chemistry index is a parameter to measure the weathering degree of illite. It is estimated using the value of the 5 Å and 10 Å illite peak areas ratio of ethylene-glycolated samples. Values below 0.4 indicate FeMg-rich illites (biotites and micas) that are characteristic of physically weathering rocks. Conversely, values above 0.4 represent Al-rich illites, which are indicative of strong hydrolysis (Ehrmann, 1998; Liu et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006). Therefore, the illite chemistry index is generally used to trace the natures of the weathering processes and climate conditions of the source areas (Ehrmann, 1998; Liu et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2006)."

    "text": "Takahashi et al. (2011) showed several biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic events at Site U1340 in the IODP Expedition 323 Preliminary Report and Proceedings volumes. However, there were some certain errors for the core depths and ages of these events because of the relatively low resolution for shipboard investigations. Zhang et al. (2014b) studied radiolarian biostratigraphy at Site U1340, and constructed the age-depth plot on the basis of the synthetical datum of the effective radiolarian, diatom, silicoflagellata and magnetostratigraphic events. In the age-depth plot established by Zhang et al. (2014b), the average radiolarian date (2.9 Ma/312.05 m) of the last occurrence of Phormostichoartus fistula (2.8–4.4 Ma/314.4 m) and the first occurrence of Phormostichoartus pitomorphus (2.15–3.63 Ma/309.7 m) was adopted as one of the age-control points. However, the ages of these two radiolarian events varied greatly and showed wide ranges in the subarctic, which was probably resulted from the regional differences, and thus were not the ideal biostratigraphic data for the age-control point. Therefore, this age point (2.9 Ma/312.05 m) was removed, and because the last occurrence of silicoflagellate Ebriopsis antiqua antiqua was approximately consistent (2.47–2.48 Ma) in the subarctic Pacific (Ling, 1992), the average date (2.475 Ma/305.5 m) of this silicoflagellate event at Site U1340 was taken as a new age point in the amended age model (Figure 2).\nAge estimation of various depths was performed by a linear interpolation between two control points. The base age of the studied core was calculated at approximately 4.3 Ma (i.e., the late Early Pliocene) (Figure 2)."

    "heading": "3 The results",
    "text": "The clay mineral assemblages at Site U1340 consist mainly of illite, smectite, and chlorite (Figure 3). Illite is the dominant clay mineral with an average of 70%, followed by smectite and chlorite with average contents of 17% and 10%, respectively. Kaolinite is a minor component with average content of 3% (Figure 3). Among the content variations of the four clay minerals, illite and chlorite have a similar variation pattern, whereas smectite content shows an opposite pattern with those of illite and chlorite. Based on the variations in smectite and illite contents, which synchronously showed three remarkable changes at 3.6, 2.74, and 1.07 Ma respectively, the evolution of the clay mineral assemblages can be subdivided into four intervals from Stages I to IV, with Stage I, Stage III divided into Substages Ia and Ib, and Substages IIIa and IIIb, and Stgae IV divided into Substages IVa, IVb and IVc, respectively (Figure 3).\nSmectite exhibited relatively high content (average of 22%) during stage Ia (4.3 to 3.94 Ma), and became more abundant (average of 36%) during stage Ib (3.94 to 3.6 Ma). Then, the smectite content (average of 9%) showed an overall decreasing trend with relatively large fluctuations and low peak values at ~3.14, ~2.99 and ~2.77 Ma during\nstage II (3.6 to 2.74 Ma). Synchronously, the illite content displayed an increasing trend and presented relatively high values. The clay mineral assemblages during stage III (2.74 to 1.07 Ma) were characterized by stably low smectite content (average of 4%) and high illite content (average of 80%), with a slight increase in the smectite content (average of 8%) during stage IIIb (1.95 to 1.07 Ma). The smectite content distinctly increased with the decrease in illite values during stage IV (after 1.07 Ma). Stage IVa (1.07 to 0.8 Ma) was characterized by large fluctuations of the smectite and illite contents. Stage IVb was an interval of distinct changes in the smectite content with peaks of 49% at ~0.42 Ma, 41% at ~0.33 Ma, and 40% at ~0.12 Ma, respectively. Stage IVc was a period of overall high smectite contents (average of 48%) and relatively low illite values (average of 36%), and the clay mineral assemblages during this stage were approximately consistent with those of the surface sediments (smectite 43% and illite 30%) near the Aleutian Island (Naidu et al., 1995).\nThe integral breadth is an inverse measure of the clay mineral crystallinity. High values of the integral breadth indicate poor crystallinities; low values indicate good crystallinities. According to the crystallinity categories for smectite and illite proposed by Ehrmann (1998), smectite\nare: Well crystalline (<1.5); moderately crystalline (1.5– 2.0); poorly crystalline (>2.0). illite are: Very well crystalline (<0.4); well crystalline (0.4–0.6); moderately crystalline (0.6–0.8); poorly crystalline (>0.8). The values of the smecite crystallinity (integral breadth, 2θ) vary between 0.14 and 3.78°2θ with an average of 1.15°2θ. These values indicated that smecite was characterized mainly by moderate to poor crystallinity before 1.07 Ma, and then good to moderate crystallinity after 1.07 Ma (Figure 4). The values of illite crystallinity at Site U1340 range from 0.23 to 0.79°2θ with an average of 0.52°2θ, and indicate that illite was very well crystalline to moderately crystalline illites before ~2.59 Ma, and overall well crystalline thereafter (Figure 4). This is approximately consistent with the changes in the illite crystallinities of Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments in the equatorial Pacific (Jacobs and Hays, 1972). The illite chemistry index fluctuates between 0.08 and 1.2, with an average of 0.24, indicating that the illite is rich in Fe-Mg and was formed primarily in an environment with physical weathering. But the peaks of the illite chemistry index (Figure 4) may suggest the environment with the relatively strong chemical weathering at ~0.12, ~0.33, ~0.42,\n~2.77, ~2.99, and ~3.14 Ma and during 4.3–4.05 Ma, respectively."

    "heading": "4.1 Source analysis of clay minerals",
    "text": "A detailed understanding of the potential source areas and the transport processes of individual clay mineral is the basis for the paleoclimatic interpretation of clay mineral assemblages in marine sediments (Diekmann et al., 1996; Gingele et al., 1998; Ehrmann, 1998; Liu et al., 2003, 2007). As the provenance is the major control on variations in clay mineral assemblages of surface sediments in the Bering Sea (Naidu et al., 1995), sources of clay minerals at Site U1340 may be determined by the distributions of surface clay minerals and major clay components of surrounding fluvial suspensions.\nThe land masses surrounding the Bering Basin include three major geologic provinces: the Aleutian Islands, eastern Siberian and Alaskan continents (Figure 1), which are\nthe potential sources of clay minerals in the studied core. The Aleutian Islands, where the volcanisms are well developed, are comprised principally of the late Cenozoic andesites and basalts, and predominated by clay mineral of smecite (more than 63%) in the soils (Ping et al, 1988, Underwood and Hathon, 1989). The clay minerals in surface sediments near the Aleutian Islands consist mainly of smectite (average of ~43%) (Gardner et al., 1980; Naidu et al., 1995), and the smectite contents in sediments decrease with distance from the Aleutian Islands. The Koryak Mountains and the Anadyr River on the eastern Siberian continent, which are primary sources of terrigeous components in the Bering Sea, contain high contents of illite and chlorite, and low contents of smectite and kaolinite (Naidu et al., 1995). The average contents of illite, chlorite, and smectite are 48%, 31%, and 12% near the Koryak Mountains, while 44%, 28%, and less than 18% near the Anadyr River estuary (Naidu et al., 1995). Clay mineral assemblages in the Alaskan continent are similar with those of the Siberian regions, characterized by high illite and chlorite contents. Clay minerals from the Alaskan continent are derived mainly by two large rivers, the Yukon and Kuskokwim, which have a mean annual discharge of 6220 m3 s1 (suspended sediments of 65×106 t) and 590 m3 s1 (suspended sediments of 8×106 t) to the Bering Sea, respectively (Roden, 1967; VanLaningham et al., 2009). Illite and chlorite contents generally are 41% and 26% near the Yukon estuary, and 60% and 35% near the Kuskokwim River estuary, respectively (Naidu and Mowatt, 1983; Mowatt and Naidu, 1987). Kaolinite (12%) and smectite (21%) are also important clay components in the Yukon River, while they are nearly absent in the Kuskokwim River (Naidu et al., 1995). Because the clay minerals can be transported to thousands of kilo-\nmeters away from their sources, the clay minerals derived from the Gulf of Alaska might have impacts on the sediments in the studied core. However, Underwood et al. (1989) speculated that the clay minerals derived from the Gulf of Alaska was transported westward mainly by the bottom current, and they reached as far west as 180° longitude. Coachman et al. (1999) suggested that the bottom current enters the Bering Sea mainly at Kamchatka strait (56°N, 164°E), which is beyond the regions that the clay minerals may reach. This means that the clay minerals derived from Gulf of Alaska can hardly be transported into the Bering Sea, and thus their impacts on the clay minerals at Site U1340 may be ignored.\nThe comparison of clay mineral assemblages at Site U1340 and surface samples from the major provenances and their offshore regions indicates multiple sources and phasic changes of clay minerals (Figure 5). In general, all samples from Site U1340 plotted between illite/chlorite group (Siberian and Alaskan continents) and smectite provenances (Aleutian Islands). Samples showed a linear correlation between illite/chlorite group (eastern Siberian) and smectite provenance during stage I, and were closer to smectite provenance during stage Ib. Samples plotted primarily between two illite/chlorite group provenances (Kuskokwim River and Koryak Mountains), with a slight shift to the smectite provenance during stage II. Samples plotted mainly in the field of the illite/chlorite provenance (Kuskokwim River), with a small number of samples closer to the Yukon River provenance during stage III. Samples plotted between the illite/chlorite provenances (Koryak Mountains and Anadyr River) during stage IVa, then were closer to smectite provenance during stage Ib, and distinctly shifted to the smectite provenance during stage IVc.\nGenerally, tectonic activities and climate changes may result in variations of clay mineral content (e.g., Ehrmann, 1998; Liu et al., 2003; Wan et al., 2010). The continental margin of the Bering Sea is thought to be an active margin during the early Cenozoic, when the Kula plate was being obliquely subducted (Scholl et al., 1968, 1975). Tectonics activities were intense since then, including fault activities, volcanisms, and formations of submarine canyons (Scholl et al., 1968, 1975). However, the tectonic evolution of the Bering Sea was generally tending towards stability since the middle Miocene (Chekhovich et al., 1999), and there was little record on tectonic activity in the Pliocene-Pleistocene Bering Sea and adjacent regions. Therefore, tectonic activities may have little impact on clay minerals in the Bering Sea, and climate changes are more likely the main reason for multiple sources and phasic changes of clay mineral assemblages at Site U1340. During the warm periods (e.g., the Holocene), the clay minerals at Site U1340 were derived mainly from the Aleutian Islands and the Siberian continent. Terrigenous materials from the Alaskan mainland were deposited mainly in the inner shelf, or transported into the Chukchi Sea through the Bering Strait by the northward flowing Alaska Coastal Current (McManus et al., 1974; Naidu and Mowatt, 1983; Mowatt and Naidu, 1987). Little material could be transported onto the outer shelf (Gardner et al., 1980; Pearson et al., 1981; Naidu and Mowatt, 1983), let alone to the farther Bering basin because of the existence of the extremely flat (gradients less than 0.25°) and broad (640 km) Bering Shelf during high sea-level periods (Hopkins, 1973; Bintanja et al., 2005). Although both smectite and illite/chlorite were major components of clay minerals in the Holocene samples at Site U1340 (Figure 3), the average content of smectite (48%) was slightly higher than that of illite/chlorite group (46%), and thus smectite/(illite+ chlorite) ratio exhibited relatively high values. This is probably caused by the long-distance transportation of the clay mineral from the Koryak Mountains and Anadyr River, and the impediment of the northeastward flowing deep current of the Bering Sea (Figure 1) (Coachman et al., 1999). Moreover, because smectites were generally the result of the chemical weathering (Chamley, 1989; Ehrmann et al., 2005), the warm climate conditions were expected to enhance the formation of smectite in the Aleutian Islands. This may be another important reason for high smectite content in the studied core. During the cold periods (e.g., the Last Glacial Maximum), there was no significant difference in the contributions of the clay minerals from the eastern Siberian continent compared with those during the warm periods, because the changes in sea level had little impact on surface circulation in the Bering basin and transportation distances of clay mineral from the Koryak Mountains and Anadyr River (Kent et al., 1971; Sancetta and Robinson, 1983). However, clay minerals from the Alaskan mainland would have increased, thereby resulting in the decline in smectite contents and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios at Site\nU1340. The shallow Bering shelf was aerially exposed due to the sea-level drops with the climate cooling (Figure 1) (Hopkins, 1973; Bintanja et al., 2005), and the mouths of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers would have undercut across the broad shelf and migrated southwestward approximately 500 km to the shelf margin (Scholl et al., 1970; Knebel and Creager, 1973). The greatly reduced transport distance of terrigenous materials may significantly promote the terrigenous input of the Alaskan mainland into the Bering basin, and eventually result in reduced relative content of smectite (28%) in the studied core because of the dilution by a large amount of high illite/chlorite contents from the Alaskan mainland. In addition, the climate cooling might have resulted in weakened chemical weathering and low concentrations of smectite in the Aleutian Islands, and this may also be responsible for declining of smectite contents at Site U1340.\nAs mentioned above, the clay mineral assemblages and their sources in the studied core were closely related to the climate changes, and were generally characterized by relatively high smectite contents and low illite/chlorite group contents during the warm periods, while low smectite contents and high illite/chlorite group contents during the cold periods. This is generally consistent with the result of the short core study in the southeastern Bering Sea (Sancetta et al., 1985), which showed that the clay minerals were characterized by higher smectite contents (average of 52%) and lower illite contents (average of 20%) during the Holocene, while lower smectite contents (average of 22%) and higher illite contents (45%) during the Last Glacial Maximum. Because the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio, which generally reflects the primary changes in clay mineral assemblages in the studied core, well responded to climate changes generally with high values during the warm periods and low values during the cold periods (Figure 4), we propose that the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio may be used as a proxy on climate changes in the Bering Sea and adjacent regions."

    "heading": "4.2 Clay mineral assemblage and climate change",
    "text": "Among the four clay minerals, illite and chlorite are detrital clay minerals, products of physical weathering and glacial scour. They are, therefore, the typical clay minerals of the recent high latitudes, and their high contents indicate the predominance of physical weathering under cold climate conditions (Singer, 1984; Chamley, 1989; Ehrmann, 1998; Ehrmann et al., 2005; Franke and Ehrmann, 2010). Illite and chlorite are considered as a whole (i.e., illite/chlorite group) in this paper, because they both have the same indicator significances of the climate conditions and the similar variation patterns at Site U1340. Moreover, the illite crystallinity and chemistry index are also effective parameters on climate changes. In general, high values of illite cystallinities and chemistry indexes are indicative of warm and humid climate, and low values indicate the cold and dry cli-\nmate (Gingele, 1996). Smectite is generally formed by chemical weathering of the basic volcanic materials and submarine alteration of basic tephras (Singer, 1984; Chamley, 1989; Ehrmann, 1998; Ehrmann et al., 2005; Franke and Ehrmann, 2010). Smectitic particles formed by chemical weathering on land generally have good crystallinities, whereas those formed by submarine alteration are poorly crystalline (Ehrmann, 1998; Jeong et al., 2004). High concentrations of kaolinite are normally restricted to temperate to tropical regions, where intense chemical weathering prevails (Singer, 1984; Chamley, 1989; Ehrmann, 1998). Kaolinite occurring in high latitudes is explained by the reworking of older, kaolinite-bearing sediments or erosion of paleosols, and thus may actually indicate the cold climate (Naidu et al., 1982; Singer, 1984; Ehrmann, 1998; Ehrmann et al., 2005). On the basis of the clay mineral assemblages indicated by smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and their crystallographic characteristics at Site U1340, we attempt to deduce the significant climate changes in the Bering Sea and adjacent continents during geological time.\nStage I (4.3 to 3.6 Ma) is characterized by overall high values of smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio with large fluctuations (Figure 4). During stage Ia (4.3 to 3.94 Ma), clay minerals were sourced mainly from the Siberian continent and the Aleutian Islands (Figure 5), and the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio (0.2 to 0.39) showed relatively stable and low values (Figure 4). These results indicate a relatively warm period in the Bering Sea. Moreover, high illite chemistry index (average of 0.8) and well crystalline smectite (average of 0.7) (Figure 4) suggest the chemical weathering prevailing in the Aleutian Islands and the eastern Siberian continent under warm and wet climate condition. These findings are in agreement with the warm climate in the Bering Sea revealed by low percentages of sea-ice diatoms (Takahashi et al., 2011), high radiolarian accumulation rates (Zhang et al., 2014a) and relatively high abundance of warm radiolarian species Spongodiscus biconcavus (Chen et al., 2014) in the studied core, and well respond to the global warm climate during this period, which was shown by the LR04 benthic oxygen isotope values (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). During stage Ib (3.94 to 3.6 Ma), the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios distinctly increased (Figure 4), indicating the enhanced contribution of the terrigenous materials from the Aleutian Islands. However, the low values of illite crystallinity (average of 0.32) and chemistry index (average of 0.34) suggest the Bering Sea and adjacent continents were characterized mainly by a cold and dry climate during this period. Synchronously, the increase in percentages of sea-ice diatoms (Takahashi et al., 2011) and cold-water radiolarian species (Zhang et al., 2014a), and decrease in the radiolarian accumulation rate (Zhang et al., 2014a) in the studied core also indicate a gradual climate cooling. High values of the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio (Figure 4) during this stage may be caused by volcanic activity, rather than the intensified chemical weathering, be-\ncause the poorly crystalline smectite (average of 2.4) suggests that smectite was formed mainly by submarine alteration of basic tephras, rather than by chemical weathering of the volcanic materials on land (Ehrmann, 1998; Jeong et al., 2004). In addition, the increased volcanic glass and magnetic susceptibility values at Site U1340 (Takahashi et al., 2011) may also suggest a period of volcanic activity from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thus, high smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios in the studied core may record the event of the enhanced volcanism.\nDuring stage II (3.6 to 2.74 Ma), clay minerals from the Alaskan continent distinctly increased (Figure 5), and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios decreased (Figure 4), suggesting a cold climate in the Bering Sea. However, good to moderate smectite crystallinity indicates that the weak chemical weathering probably still prevailed in the Aleutian Islands, and the Bering Sea was characterized by a cold and wet climate during this period, which was probably resulted from the strengthened Alaskan Stream indicated by relatively high abundance of radiolarian species Spongodiscus biconcavus (Chen et al., 2014). Iliites exhibited the good to moderate crystallinity and low values of chemistry index (Figure 4), indicating that the Alaskan continent was controlled by the cold and dry climate. In contrast with the overall low values, the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio exhibited three small peaks at ~3.14 Ma, ~2.99 Ma, and ~2.77 Ma (Figure 4), respectively, indicating the intermittent occurrences of warm and wet climate condition in the Bering Sea during this stage.\nDuring stage III (2.74 to 1.07 Ma), the extremely low values of smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio (average of 0.04) indicate that Bering Sea was characterized by a cold climate. The very well crystalline illite with low illite chemistry index and poorly crystalline smectite further suggest the prevailing physical weathering under cold and dry climate condition in the Bering Sea and adjacent continents. The cold climate during this stage well corresponds the enhancement of the sea ice covers in the Bering Sea indicated by high percentages of sea-ice diatoms (Takahashi et al., 2011), low radiolarian accumulation rates (Zhang et al., 2014a), and near absence of warm radiolarian species Spongodiscus biconcavus (Chen et al., 2014) at Site U1340, which may be induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation at ~2.7 Ma (Raymo, 1994; Maslin et al., 1996). During stage IIIb (1.95 to 1.07 Ma), smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio slightly increased, and smectite were moderately crystalline (Figure 4). These results may suggest that weak chemical weathering prevailed in the Aleutian Islands and the climate gradually got wet and dry in the Bering Sea.\nDuring stage IV (after 1.07 Ma), smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio distinctly increased and fluctuated frequently (Figure 4). It increased at the beginning of stage IVa (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), and then exhibited relatively high values (0.06 to 0.35) with a small fluctuation. The smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio\nincreased further at the end of the stage Iva, and varied with a large fluctuations thereafter. This may indicate that stage IVa is a significant transitional period of the climate in the Bering Sea, which is approximately coincident with the Middle Pleistocene Climatic Transition (MPT) mainly from 1.2 to 0.8/0.7 Ma (e.g., Pisias and Moore, 1981; Mudelsee and Schulz, 1997; Clark et al., 2006). During stage IVb, although the moderate smectite crystallinity and the good illite crystallinity (average of 0.54) with low illite chemistry index (average of 0.32) indicate that the Bering Sea was characterized mainly by the cold and wet climate, high smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios suggest the occurrences of the warm and wet climate primarily during some interglacials. At ~0.42 Ma (MIS11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9), and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio presented three peaks of 1.04, 0.7 and 0.74 (Figure 4), which are associated with good smectite crystallinity and high values of illite chemistry index, suggesting warm and wet climate conditions in the Bering Sea and adjacent continents. This finding is in agreement with the overall trend of further warming indicated by higher radiolarian accumulation rate after MIS 13 at Site U1340 (Zhang et al., 2014a), and well responded to the Mid-Brunhes Event (MBE), which was characterized by enhanced warmth during interglacial episodes after MIS 13 (e.g., Imbrie et al., 1984; Jansen et al., 1986; Rohling et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2003; EPICA community, 2004). During stage IVc (after 9.21 ka), high smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios (average of 1.01) showed a relatively warm climate in the Bering Sea, which is well consistent with the global warming background revealed by low values of LR04 benthic oxygen isotope (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). The well crystalline smectites suggest the prevailing chemical weathering under the warm and wet climate conditions in the Aleutian Islands, while the well to moderately crystalline illites indicate their source (eastern Siberian continent) are characterized mainly by relatively cold and dry climate condition, which is probably resulted from its location in high-latitude with continental climate."

    "text": "The age model of IODP Site U1340 is amended, and the base age is calculated as about 4.3 Ma, that is, the late Early Pliocene (Late Zanclean).\nClay mineral assemblages at Site U1340 consist mainly of illite (an average of 70%), followed by smectite and chlorite (an average of 17% and 10%, respectively), with minor kaolinite (an average of 3%). The sources of clay minerals are closely related to the climate conditions. During the warm periods, the clay minerals originated mainly from the adjacent Aleutian Islands, and smectite/(illite+ chlorite) ratios increased. During the cold periods, clay minerals from the Alaskan region distinctly increased, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios declined. Thus, the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio may be used as a proxy on climate\nchanges in the Bering Sea and adjacent regions. The evolutionary history of the paleoclimate was revealed in the Bering Sea based on smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and clay mineral crystallinities. In general, the Bering Sea was characterized by warm and wet climate condition from 4.3 to 3.94 Ma, and then cold and dry condition associated with the enhancing of the volcanism from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thereafter, the climate gradually became cold and wet, and then was dominated by the cold and dry climate since 2.74 Ma, probably induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. The interval from 1.95 to 1.07 Ma was a transitional period of the climate gradually becoming cold and wet. After the middle Pleistocene transition (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), the Bering Sea was governed mainly by cold and wet climate with several intervals of warm climate and intensified chemical weathering at ~0.42 Ma (MIS 11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9), and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), respectively. During the last 9.21 ka (the Holocene), the Bering Sea was characterized primarily by relatively warm and wet climatic conditions.\nSamples used in this research were provided by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP).

  "abstractText": "Clay mineral assemblages and crystallinities in sediments from IODP Site 1340 in the Bering Sea were analyzed in order to trace sediment sources and reconstruct the paleoclimatic history of the Bering Sea since Pliocene (the last ~4.3 Ma). The results show that clay minerals at Site U1340 are dominated by illite, with a moderate amount of smectite and chlorite, and minor kaolinite. Sediment source studies suggest that the clay mineral assemblages and their sources in the studied core are controlled primarily by the climate conditions. During the warm periods, clay minerals originated mainly from the adjacent Aleutian Islands, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios increased. During the cold periods, clay minerals from the Alaskan region distinctly increased, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios declined. Based on smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and clay mineral crystallinities, the evolutionary history of the paleoclimate was revealed in the Bering Sea. In general, the Bering Sea was characterized by warm and wet climate condition from 4.3 to 3.94 Ma, and then cold and dry condition associated with the enhanced volcanism from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thereafter, the climate gradually became cold and wet, and then was dominated by a cold and dry condition since 2.74 Ma, probably induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. The interval from 1.95 to 1.07 Ma was a transitional period of the climate gradually becoming cold and wet. After the middle Pleistocene transition (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), the Bering Sea was governed mainly by cold and wet climate with several intervals of warm climate at ~0.42 Ma (MIS 11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9) and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), respectively. During the last 9.21 ka (the Holocene), the Bering Sea was characterized primarily by relatively warm and wet climatic conditions.",
