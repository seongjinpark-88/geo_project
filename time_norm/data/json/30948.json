Central to revealing the ancient volcano–climate connection have been studies linking single eruptions to features of climate-proxy records such as found in ice-core3–5 and treering6–8 chronologies. Such records also suggest that the known inventory of eruptions is incomplete, and that the climatic significance of unreported or poorly understood eruptions remains to be revealed. The AD1600 eruption of Huaynaputina, in southern Peru, has been speculated to be one of the largest eruptions of the past 500 years; acidity spikes from Greenland and Antarctica ice3–5, tree-ring chronologies6–8, along with records of atmospheric perturbations in early seventeenth-century Europe and China9,10, implicate an eruption of similar or greater magnitude than that of Krakatau in 1883. Here we use tephra deposits to estimate the volume of the AD1600 Huaynaputina eruption, revealing that it was indeed one of the largest eruptions in historic times. The chemical characteristics of the glass from juvenile tephra allow a firm cause–effect link to be established with glass from the Antarctic ice, and thus improve on estimates of the stratospheric loading of the eruption.\nVolcan Huaynaputina, located at 168 359 S, 708 529 W in the Moquegua region of southern Peru (Fig. 1), consists of three craters situated at 4,500 m within the amphitheatre of an ancient stratovolcano. A compilation of historical and parochial literature11 reveals that the volcano formed during an eruption that began on 19 February 1600 and continued until 5 March. The fall deposit covered an area of at least 300,000 km2 in southern and west central Peru, western Bolivia and north Chile (Fig. 1). Ashfall was reported on the major cities of Lima, La Paz (Bolivia) and Arica (Chile) as well as on a ship 1,000 km to the west11. The fall seems to have been\ndistributed predominantly to the west and north. Local proximal pyroclastic flows and secondary mass flows were insignificant in volume. This large plinian eruption destroyed local communities with a loss of over 1,000 lives and caused considerable damage to the major cities of Arequipa and Moquegua. The loss of farmland, crops, livestock, vineyards, and water resources compounded the significant economic burden on this region.

Volcan Ticsani, the site of a similar but smaller eruption to Huaynaputina, is also shown. Values associated with contours are in centimetres; two innermost contours not labelled are 200 and 600 cm respectively, and the 1,500 cm contour is covered by the symbol for the volcano. The graph in the upper right corner shows a plot of thickness (T) on a logarithmic scale against the square root of isopach area31,32. The thickness data are described by three line segments that define a typical exponential profile. Integration beneath the line segments with respect to area, following the method of Fierstein and Nathenson32, and removing the volume achieved by extrapolating the data to zero thickness31, yields the volumes noted for each segment and the minimum volume of tephra of 19.2 km3. Negative error in this estimate is limited to measurement and area estimation errors and is ,10% for this data set. Positive errors far outweigh this, as discussed in the text. Inset (bottom left) shows the known distribution of the fall from the AD1600 eruption (broken line) based on a compilation of parochial and historical accounts11. The box in the inset shows the area covered in the larger map. Note that our data cover only a small portion of the known distribution of the AD1600 tephra fall, albeit along the main axis. As most of the distal tephra has been lost, a considerable volume of distal tephra cannot be measured.\nTable 1Main oxide composition of individual juvenile clasts and volcanic glass from theHuaynaputina eruption comparedwith tephra from theearly 1600sof the Antarctica and Greenland ice cores\nHuaynaputina bulk rock* (21 samples)\nHuaynaputina glass* (n ¼ 103; 6 samples)\nHuaynaputina glass† (n ¼ 7)\nSouth Pole glass† (n ¼ 16)\nGISP2 glass* (n ¼ 16)\n...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................

Arrows denote mid-summer for the year shown. Maximum dating error for this period is only ,2 years. It is believed, from correlation with the other ice cores, that the ages shown might be 1 or 2 years too young, although the red Suns observed in China in 1603 (Table 2) indicate that there still was a significant stratospheric aerosol loading in that year. Deposition of those aerosols on Greenland could easily have been in 1604. Even if the two sulphate spikes correspond to 1601/1602 and 1602/1603, these are ages within the error of the\nGSIP2 dating shown on the figure. Fluxof the volcanic sulphate component of the record is 13 kg km−2 per 0.5 year for peak A and 21 kg km−2 per 0.5 yr for peak B from the detailed (,14 samples yr−1) results presented here. Total volcanic flux of 34 kg km−2 per 2 yr agrees well with the 36 kg km−2 per 2 yr obtained from the original biyearly sampling done on the GISP2 core4 and given in Table 1. Total\nvolcanic sulphate flux is determined by the sum of the products of concentration,\nmeasured ice density and length for each sample. Volcanic sulphate concentra-\ntion is the total concentration minus average background levels. Sea-salt sul-\nphate was removed from the calculations.

A full recovery of the economy took almost 150 years (ref. 11).\nWe calculated new estimates of the volume erupted on the basis of field measurements of present-day tephra thicknesses and the construction of an isopach map (Fig. 1). From this a minimum erupted tephra volume of ,19.2 km3 was calculated. Preliminary measurements of bulk tephra densities yield a weighted average density of ,1,200 kg m−3, which yields a minimum dense rock equivalent (DRE) or magma equivalent volume of ,9.6 km3. This is the first and only volume estimate based on field measurements for this eruption. The true volume of the eruption might be considerably larger. First, our estimate does not include distal tephra outside the mapped isopachs. Second, our measurements cover only a portion of the area of the fall deposit, albeit along the main axis of the deposit (Fig. 1). Last, historical and anecdotal information11 clearly report greater thicknesses of tephra deposition than we find in the field today. For instance, during the first 24 h alone, over 20 cm of sand-sized tephra fell in Arequipa. Over 1 m of ash was reported in regions to the north and west of Arequipa after the eruption; today we find a maximum of 10 cm. Even allowing for compaction of distal ash, this still suggests that a considerable amount of the tephra has been lost, most obviously to deflation, mass wasting, and agriculture. Speculation about true volume aside, our minimum estimate for the tephra deposit of 19.2 km3 firmly establishes this eruption as a magnitude 6 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI (ref. 12)). This alone places this eruption firmly in the realms of the largest historic eruptions such as Krakatau in 1883 (ref. 13) (18 km3 tephra; VEI ,6), Novarupta (Katmai) in 1912 (ref. 14) (,20–25 km3 tephra; VEI ,6) and Mt Pinatubo in 1991 (ref. 15) (10 km3 tephra; VEI 6).\nNew geochemical data on the products of the eruption now allow us to establish a much firmer link between this eruption and the volcanic glass found in the ice-core record. These data reveal that the magma of the AD1600 eruption was a monotonous calcalkaline dacite (Table 1). The juvenile clasts of non-expanded to moderately expanded dacite contain ,30–35 vol.% phenocrysts of plagioclase . amphibole . oxides . apatite set in a matrix of fresh glass. Huaynaputina magmatic compositions are distinct from other late Cenozoic to recent volcanics of similar composition in this region; of particular note here is that the ratio of Na2O to K2O is greater than 1 for the Huaynaputina magma (Table 1). Our data for the glass reveal this same distinctive character (Table 1) and are a much closer match to the analyses of volcanic glass in the South Pole ice core than presented in previous studies16. These data provide the strongest support yet for the presence of volcanic glass from Huaynaputina in the South Pole ice core and thus the climatic impact of the eruption might be better delineated.\nClimate-proxy data (Table 2) indicate that the earliest part of the seventeenth century and especially the summer of 1601 was the coldest of the past 600 years throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere and among the coldest of the past 1,500 years in Fennoscandia. High levels of H2SO4 found in ice-core layers dated to 1599–1604 (with dating error) from both polar regions, together with observed atmospheric phenomena (Table 2), strongly suggest that volcanism, and presumably an equatorial eruption such as Huaynaputina, had some role in forcing that cooling17. In fact, the mean estimate of the stratospheric loading of H2SO4 based on the Greenland ice core record is 67 6 16 Mt or twice that estimated for the Mt Pinatubo eruption in 1991 (,30 Mt; ref. 18). The 67 Mt estimate is ,78% of the stratospheric loading estimated for the 1815 Tambora eruption from data from these same ice cores (Table 2). The only estimate for Huaynaputina from Antarctica is 100 Mt H2SO4 (Table 2). These values are substantial enough to force climate cooling.\nHow much of this stratospheric loading and subsequent cooling can confidently be attributed to Huaynaputina? On the basis of the strong evidence for Huaynaputina glass in the South Pole core, the\n100 Mt estimate can reasonably be related entirely to the Huaynaputina eruption.\nThe Greenland data are more problematic because the volcanic signal occurs as a distinct doublet peak in Northern-Hemisphere ice cores, and we cannot link the earlier peak of the GISP2 core doublet (Fig. 2) to Huaynaputina because the glass compositions do not match (Table 1). This implicates another eruption as the main source of the sulphate; glass from Asama, Japan19, do not match either, so the most likely source is either the Suwanose-Jima eruption (Table 2) or a previously undocumented eruption originating in the Northern Hemisphere. Higher total volcanic flux values in signals from the early 1600s in the Greenland ice cores relative to Antarctica, particularly given the 178 S location of Huaynaputina, would probably result from an eruption directly upwind from Greenland. This notwithstanding, it is reasonable to argue that ash particles are less likely than aerosols to be transported interhemispherically from a tropical eruption such as Huaynaputina: the lack of ash particles does not categorically negate a role for this eruption. We therefore make the conservative assumption that the younger sulphate spike in the GISP2 core (B in Fig. 2) is from Huaynaputina. This yields a volcanic sulphate flux of 21 kg km−2 per 0.5 yr from the GISP2 core, which translates to a stratospheric mass loading estimate of ,50 Mt (ref. 4) or two-thirds of the total GISP2 volcanic signal over these two years. If a similar proportion of Huaynaputina acid is found in the total signals for the other Greenland cores, then the mean Northern Hemisphere loading for Huaynaputina would be ,42 6 10 Mt or almost 50% greater loading than Pinatubo, but only one-half of the Tambora loading for the Northern Hemisphere. A composite estimate of stratospheric loading from Greenland snow records for the equatorial El Chichón eruption agreed well with satellite estimates20; thus our estimate of the stratospheric loading for the Huaynaputina eruption derived from this series of Greenland ice cores should be reliable. The 100 Mt loading estimate for the Southern Hemisphere, based on the South Pole core (Table 2), might be a reflection of the southern equatorial location of the volcano and the greater distribution of aerosols to southern polar regions. These two hemispheric estimates yield a global average of ,70 Mt H2SO4 for the Huaynaputina eruption. This is only 35% of the ,200 Mt (global average) estimated for Tambora, the greatest sulphur-producing eruption of at least the past ,750 years. Nevertheless, these data indicate that the Huaynaputina eruption was very capable of forcing global climate, and its atmospheric perturbation was not only far greater than any eruption in the twentieth century, it is also one of the greatest of historical time.

The discovery in the Northern Danakil (Afar) Depression, Eritrea, of a well-preserved Homo cranium with a mixture of characters typical of H. erectus and H. sapiens contributes significantly to this debate. The cranium was found in a succession of fluvio-deltaic and lacustrine deposits and is associated with a rich\nmammalian fauna of early to early-middle Pleistocene age. A magnetostratigraphic survey indicates two reversed and two normal magnetozones. The layer in which the cranium was found is near the top of the lower normal magnetozone, which is identified as the Jaramillo subchron. Consequently, the human remains can be dated at ,1 million years before present.\nThe cranium, two incisors and two pelvic fragments were recovered between 1995 and 1997 near the village of Buia, Eritrea, about 100 km south-south-east of Massawa in the Danakil Formation, which is more than 1,000 m thick. This unit, also known as the Red Series4,5, crops out extensively in the Danakil Depression, a belt of pronounced lithospheric extension at the intersection of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and the East African rift systems6 (Fig. 1). It consists mainly of siliciclastic continental deposits with intercalations of lava flows and tuff beds at different levels. A Miocene to Pleistocene age is commonly assumed4,5,7,8, and from a chronological and palaeo-environmental point of view, this formation can be correlated with the well-known hominid-bearing Awash Group in Ethiopia9.\nWe examined the upper 500-m-thick portion of the Danakil Formation that is composed of grey to whitish clayey silts and sands with small amounts of marls laid down in fluvio-deltaic and lacustrine environments (Fig. 2).\nAsh layers containing biotite have been found in the lower portion of the section. An initial attempt to date a biotite bulk separate by 39Ar/40Ar failed because of xenocrystic contamination.\nAs well as freshwater gastropod and fish remains, a large amount of fossil bones were found along the entire Buia section, and five mammal-rich levels have been identified (Fig. 2). The third level from the base yielded Homo remains consisting of a nearly complete and undeformed adult cranium (UA 31) (Fig. 3), two pelvic fragments (UA 173), and two permanent lower incisors (UA 222 and UA 369).\nIn the Homo-bearing outcrop, silts and clays alternate with sands. The cranium and pelvic fragments come from the upper part of a layer of laminated silty clays 1.4 m thick. The UA 369 incisor was\nFigure 1 Simplified geology of the Northern Danakil Depression between the Eritrean-Ethiopian plateau and the Southern Red Sea.
