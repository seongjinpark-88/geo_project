  "abstractText": "Southern Africa’s high Kalahari plateau and its flanking mountain ranges formed over an extended period of ~200 million years through vertical tectonic processes different from those at convergent plate boundaries. We refer to this as the Kalahari epeirogeny. Episodic uplift and erosion during the Kalahari epeirogeny is inferred from thermo-chronology and from stratigraphy of sediment accumulated around its continental margin. A total thickness of 2 to 7 km of rock (of which basalt was a major component) was eroded from the subcontinent’s surface during two punctuated episodes of exhumation, in the early-Cretaceous and in the mid-Cretaceous. Major exhumation was over by the end of the Cretaceous, and the rate of erosion decreased by more than an order of magnitude to remove less than 1 km thickness of rock during the Cenozoic. Cosmogenic dating shows that erosion rates today are almost an order of magnitude less still. The cause for the Kalahari epeirogeny remains elusive, but three striking observations stand out: (i) major exhumation occurred during the late Mesozoic break-up of Gondwana; (ii) large scale basaltic magmatism closely match two accelerated episodes of exhumation: first along the west coast (~132 Ma, Etendeka large igneous province [LIP], associated with vast amounts of underplating along this entire passive margin), and the second flanking the sheared south coast margin (~90 Ma, Agulhas oceanic LIP). Yet exhumation that might have accompanied the vast Karoo LIP (~180 Ma) is not readily detected; (iii) the two main regional episodes of accelerated exhumation and coastal sediment accumulation are near synchronous with two regional ‘spikes’ of kimberlite intrusions: >450 kimberlites at ~90 Ma, and >200 kimberlites at ~120 Ma. Southern Africa is underlain by an anomalous warm region in the lowermost ~1500 km of the mantle that is linked to core to mantle heat loss. This warm region was inherited from a large Cretaceous thermo-chemical anomaly in the mantle created during long-lived subduction beneath Gondwana. Associated Mesozoic kimberlite genesis and basaltic magmatism may have been sufficient to cause volatile/heat-induced density changes in the lithospheric mantle of southern Africa to sustain the Kalahari plateau. In addition, such changes may have been induced by tectonic uplift and decompressional melting resulting from far-field collision processes between Africa and Europe, and/or final continental lithosphere decoupling between the Falkland plateau and southern Africa. CO2 released into the ocean-atmosphere system during the Kalahari epeirogeny contributed to the global mid-Cretaceous hot-house conditions. However, because the CO2-consumption rate associated with basalt weathering is about eight times that of granite, atmospheric CO2 was also efficiently sequestrated during the rapid erosion of Karoo basalt. Thus, the Kalahari epeirogeny also may have catalysed the onset of long-term global Cenozoic cooling. doi:10.2113/gssajg.110.2-3.367 because of their effects on, and response to, the oceanatmosphere system, forcing climate change, erosion and run-off, and tectonic uplift (e.g. Molnar and England, 1990; Edmond, 1992; Raymo and Ruddiman, 1992; Veizer et al., 1999; Dupré et al., 2003; Fluteau 2003; Lamb and Davis, 2003; Alonso et al., 2006; Bayon et al., 2006). To track paleo-epeirogeny and related earth systems on a global scale, such as during Gondwana break-up and continental drift, models must also incorporate the changing paleo-geography of its shifting continental fragments such as Africa. The time-integrated paleo-positions of Gondwana continents are now known to within acceptable limits for high resolution numerical and graphical modeling to facilitate paleogeographical reconstructions (Scotese, 2001; Reeves and de Wit, 2000; Rosenbaum et al., 2002; Jokat et al., 2003; Collins, 2003; Stampfli and Borel, 2004; König, 2006; Smith 2006). Burke and Wilson (1972) and Burke (1976; 1996) suggested that because the horizontal motion of the SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY THE KALAHARI EPEIROGENY AND CLIMATE CHANGE 368 Figure 1. General topography of the African Plate, which emphases that the African continent is dominated by two broad (>1000 km) elevated regions in the southeast (greens; 500 to 3000 m; average elevation = 1015 m, with local peaks at >5 km): (i) the volcanically active northeast African Highlands, and (ii) the quiescent southern Kalahari Africa Plateau (range 900–1200 m, with local non-volcanic peaks just less than 3500 m Thabana Ntlenyana 3482 m). The more subdued low-lying terrain of central-, westand north-Africa (yellows; 300 to 1500 m; average elevation = 450 m) is interspersed regionally with local high volcanic centres such as Tibesti at >3 km (for discussion of this bimodal African topography and its origin, see Doucouré and de Wit, 2003a). Note that the continent is surrounded mostly by midocean ridge plate boundaries; only the sector from the Atlas Mountains to the eastern Mediterranean is part of the (complex) convergent plate boundary between Africa and Eurasia, driven by oceanic lithopshere slab retreat towards Africa. Three parallel paths of past motions of Africa relative to Eurasia are shown from three present day locations (white circles D1-3) backwards to the start of this motion at 175 Ma (points A). Motions between the two continents are fast for the periods represented by the blue segments, and reach near stand-still for ~20 to ~15 Ma at the red squares (age span at B= ~140 to ~125 Ma; at C = ~75 to ~55 Ma; adapted from Smith (2006). African continent came to rest with respect to the mantle at ~30 Ma, the entire continent responded to this stasis by epeirogeny through thermal feedback with its underlying mantle. They concluded from this that large scale epeirogeny is likely to occur when continents come to such a standstill, and that this would be manifested by regional alkaline-dominated igneous activity. This is compatible with a manifold of geoscientific observations across the highlands of East Africa where the intense Cenozoic volcanism peaked between ~20 and ~40 Ma (e.g. Bond, 1979, Crough 1979, Smith, 1994; Ebinger and Sleep, 1998; Nyblade et al., 2000 a; b; Yirgu et al., 2006 and references therein), but not so for high southern Africa, which is dominated by Mesozoic alkaline volcanism and was already a high region at that time (Doucouré and de Wit, 2003a). Relative motions between the Africa and Eurasia plates also changed episodically during the Mesozoic. Substantial slowing in the rate of convergent motion between the two continents occurred during the end Mesozoic, at times leading to a ‘gridlock’ between them (e.g. Smith, 1971; 2006; Figure 1). It is possible therefore that this too affected the thermal balance between the African lithosphere and its underlying mantle. Evidence for such far-field effects might be preserved in southern Africa where repeated regional uplift and diffuse alkaline magmatism (in the form of more than a thousand kimberlites and related mantle-derived rock types, many of which have been dated) occurred in tandem during punctuated episodes: the two biggest ‘jerks’ in cooling and uplift/exhumation calculated from fission track data across the Kalahari plateau and from the accumulation-rates of the eroded products around its margins, are at ~120 and ~90 Ma, both episodes that coincide with two intense, short-lived episodes of kimberlite intrusions. (e.g. Jelsma et al., 2004; Tinker 2005; Tinker et al., 2007, in review). Other proposed geodynamic models compatible with the present high topography of Africa, include: (i) plume head impingement of the lithosphere under southern Ethiopia (Ebinger and Sleep, 1998), and/or under the eastern margins of the Tanzanian craton (Nyblade et al., 2000b); (ii) dynamic topography due to vertical stresses at the base of the southern African lithosphere generated by flow in the lower mantle, or positive buoyancy in the mid-lower mantle beneath southern Africa (Lithgow-Bertelloni and Silver, 1998; Ritsema et al., 1999; Gurnis et al., 2000). Seismic tomography studies show that a substantial region of lower mantle beneath southern Africa is presently anomalously hot and possibly also chemically different from the surrounding and overlying mantle (e.g. Montelli et al., 2006, and references therein). If this deep mantle thermal perturbation beneath southern Africa is responsible for its present-day high topography, this would implicate its existence also in the Mesozoic, because the timing of major uplift and associated alkaline volcanicity of southern Africa date primarily to this time. However, temperature gradients in the mantle transition zone and upper mantle beneath southern Africa and northeastern Africa today are fundamentally different: it is ‘hot’ directly beneath east Africa, and ‘cold’ directly beneath southern Africa (e.g. Crough, 1979; Doucouré and de Wit 2003a; Montelli et al., 2006; Shen and Blum, 2003; Benoit et al., 2006). These differences may, therefore, represent distinct phases of deep mantle thermal dynamics, perhaps triggered by temporal variations of heat flux across the core-mantle boundary, in which case answers to epeirogeny might be recorded in past variations of Earth’s outer core convection and hence its paleo-magnetic field (c.f. Nicolayson, 1985a; b; Loper and McCartney, 1986; Larson 1991; Courtillot et al., 1978; 2007; Dormy and Mandea 2005). Such a fundamental causal relationship that may exist between epeirogeny and core-mantle processes should be preserved in the stratigraphic record (c.f. White and Lovell, 1997; Courtillot et al., 2007), and can now be numerically modeled and tested (Bunge et al., 1998; Bunge et al., 2002; Conrad and Gurnis, 2003). Southern Africa is the world’s best field laboratory where this can be accomplished (e.g. de Wit and Horsfield, 2006). We examine some of these issues below, in the framework of this natural laboratory and in context of the African plate as a whole. High topography of Africa Africa is surrounded mostly (>90%) by extensional plate margins in the form of spreading ridges. Yet Africa is host to some of the world’s greatest elevated regions. Africa’s topography is therefore unique in a global perspective. Whereas elevated topography of most continents can be related to processes across compressional plate tectonic margins (e.g. Andes, Cordilleras, Himalayas, Tibet), this is not so for Africa (Figure 1). Africa’s first-order, long wavelength, topography is distinctly bimodal (Figure 1). Southern Africa and eastern Africa are rugged and of elevations generally >1000 m; centraland west-Africa are relatively smooth at <500 m. Poor correlations between free-air gravity and surface topography at long wavelengths show that the broad African uplifts are not simple crustal features, and that the bimodal topography must be linked to sources as deep as the sublithospheric mantle. Positively correlated features between gravity and geographic features in Africa (e.g. the basins and swells of Holmes, 1965) are limited to second order epeirogenic effects and confined to the lithosphere (Doucouré and de Wit, 2003a, and references therein). There is considerable controversy about the age and origin of these topographic features and the bimodal topography of Africa in particular. Some workers believe most of these to be Cenozoic in age (du Toit, 1933; King, 1951; 1967; Burke, 1996; and see Partridge and Maud, 1987; 2000). Others believe that a significant number of the features date to the Mesozoic (Sahagian 1988; MAARTEN DE WIT SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY 369",
