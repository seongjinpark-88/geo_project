    "text": "The seismically and volcanically active Kivu Rift, in the western branch of the East African Rift\nSystem, is a type locale for studies of high-elevation, humid-climate rift basins, as well as magmatic\nbasin development. Interpretations of offshore multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection data, terres-\ntrial radar topography, lake bathymetry and seismicity data recorded on a temporary array provide\nnew insights into the structure, stratigraphy and evolution of the Kivu rift. The Kivu rift is an asymmetric graben controlled on its west side by a ca. 110 km-long, N-S striking border fault. The southern basins of the lake and the upper Rusizi river basin are an accommodation zone effectively linking\n1470 m-high Lake Kivu to 770 m-high Lake Tanganyika. MCS data in the eastern Kivu lake basin reveal a west-dipping half graben with at least 1.5 km of sedimentary section; most of the ca. 2 km of extension in this sub-basin is accommodated by the east-dipping Iwawa normal fault, which\nbounds an intrabasinal horst. Lake Kivu experienced at least three periods of near desiccation. The\ntwo most recent of these approximately correlate to the African Megadrought and Last Glacial Max-\nimum. There was a rapid lake level transgression of at least 400 m in the early Holocene. The line\nload of the Virunga volcanic chain enhances the fault-controlled basin subsidence; simple elastic\nplate models suggest that the line load of the Virunga volcanic chain depresses the basin by more\nthan 1 km, reduces flank uplift locally and broadens the depocentre. Not only do the voluminous\nmagmatism and degassing to the lake pose a hazard to the riparian population, but our studies dem-\nonstrate that magmatism has important implications for short-term processes such as lake levels,\ninflow and outlets, as well as long term modification of classic half-graben basin morphology."

    "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "Sedimentary basins in magmatic continental rift zones record the complex interplay between mechanical stretching accommodated by faulting and magma intrusion, changing drainage and depositional patterns in response to accompanying vertical crustal movements and volcanic construction, as well as time-varying patterns in rainfall and base level (e.g. Cohen, 2003; Ebinger & Scholz, 2012). The faulting, magmatism, tectonic and dynamic uplift processes that created the East African Rift (EAR) altered the landscape, redirected drainage patterns, changed regional climate and modified the state of stress with the continental lithosphere (e.g. Ebinger et al., 1989; Sepulchre et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2012). The deep, thermo-chemically stratified tropical lakes that occur along approximately two-thirds of the length of the Western rift system, East Africa, facilitate high-resolution marine seismic data acquisition, and the sedimentary\nstrata they contain serve as high-fidelity records of these interplays. The seismically and volcanically active Western Rift lakes, therefore, provide opportunities to distinguish contributions to depositional patterns from these diverse processes, and to develop new models for the evolution of magmatic rift basins.\nSedimentary strata partially filling the lake basins provide sensitive markers to horizontal and vertical crustal movements caused by faulting and magmatism, and are modulated by broader-scale lithospheric stretching, and mantle dynamics. Overprinted on these signals are the effects of a regional hydroclimate regime documented as intensely dynamic through the middle and late-Quaternary (e.g. Scholz & Rosendahl, 1988; Johnson et al., 1995; Scholz et al., 2007; Tierney et al., 2008). Prior studies provided a framework for the 12 Ma-recent volcano-tectonic history in the Kivu rift region (Ebinger et al., 1989; Pasteels et al., 1989; Kampunzu et al., 1998) as well as constraints on volcano-tectonic deformation processes (Shuler & Ekstr€om, 2009; D’Oreye et al., 2011; Wauthier et al., 2012), but only sparse, crudely located seismic data, and limited core data constrained the Kivu rift subsidence\nCorrespondence: Douglas A.

These data are constrained by sediment core samples, a merged bathymetric and topographic Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and existing geological and geophysical data to: (1) determine the geometry and kinematics of faults bounding and linking Kivu rift basins; (2) estimate the amount of fault-controlled extension and compare it to independent estimates of lithospheric stretching; (3) map the location and depth of microseismicity characterizing active fault and magmatic systems; (4) evaluate the role of volcanic loading within the Virunga Volcanic Province (VVP) on the subsidence history of the Kivu basin, using simple flexural models. Our results not only document the interplay between climate, faulting and magmatism in rift basin evolution, but provide new insights into the relative importance of magmatic processes in time and in space."

    "text": "Extension and magmatism in East Africa are in large part driven by one or more mantle plumes, but the dynamics of plume-lithosphere interactions in strain and magmatic localisation remain weakly constrained in the Western rift (e.g. Walker et al., 2004; W€olbern et al., 2010; O’Donnell et al., 2013). Unlike the widespread, 25 Ma-present magmatism in the Eastern Rift, the magmatic provinces along the ca. 2500 km length of the Western rift are small in volume and relatively young (<24 Ma) (e.g. Ebinger & Furman, 2002). Two of the four localized volcanic regions of the Western Rift, the South Kivu and Virunga magmatic provinces, are located at the south and north ends of Lake Kivu (Fig. 1). Magmatism has affected the Kivu rift zone since at least ca. 12 Ma when lavas at the base of the NE-trending Virunga volcanic chain were erupted (Sahama, 1973; Kampunzu et al., 1998; Smets et al., 2010) and ca. 10 Ma in the South Kivu province (Ebinger et al., 1989; Pasteels et al., 1989). The modern lake system is strongly influenced by magmatism; stratification of the lake’s water column is maintained by solutes and CO2 injected into the deep waters by subaqueous hot springs whose locations remain elusive (e.g. Schoell, 1988; Pasche et al., 2011; Bhattarai et al., 2012). The ENE-trending VVP overlies older lavas erupted between ca. 12 and 9 Ma (Pasteels et al., 1989; Kampunzu et al., 1998). Volcanoes Nyamuragira, Nyiragongo, Karisimbi and Bisoke have been active in historic time, while Sabinyo, Muhabura, Gahinga and Mikeno are dormant (Demant et al., 1994; Rogers et al., 1998). Mikeno volcano developed by ca. 2.6 Ma, but Karisimbi, Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira developed during the Late Pleis-\ntocene (e.g. De Mulder & Pasteels, 1986; Boven et al., 1998; Kampunzu et al., 1998). The Western rift is punctuated by characteristically asymmetric basins bounded by long, large offset border fault systems that may penetrate into the lower crust, based on the >15 km depths of teleseismically detected earthquakes (e.g. Yang & Chen, 2010; Craig et al., 2011; D’Oreye et al., 2011) and from local arrays (e.g. Lindenfeld & R€umpker, 2011). The deep water basins are flanked by uplifts that rise more than 1000 m above the broad, dynamically supported plateau; the rift flank and half-graben basin shapes and associated gravity anomalies can be explained by flexural unloading of relatively strong lithosphere with effective elastic thickness ranging from 15– 60 km (e.g. Ebinger et al., 1991; P erez-Gussiny e et al., 2006). Interpreted together, these results indicate that the Western rift developed in relatively strong, cold lithosphere where heating from plume processes has yet to elevate geotherms within the upper part of the plate, except within the volcanic provinces. Flexural models of topography and gravity anomalies suggest that small amounts of crustal extension (ca. 4–5 km) have occurred across the Kivu rift zone (Ebinger et al., 1991), consistent with\n© 2015 The Authors Basin Research © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers and International Association of Sedimentologists176\nmodels of the Edward and Albert rift basins to the north (e.g. Upcott et al., 1996). Rigid plate models of sparse GPS data and Global Centroid Moment Tensor solutions for earthquake source mechanisms predict an extensional velocity of ca. 2.8 mm/year and opening direction of 110° (Stamps et al., 2008; Saria et al., 2013). In separate analyses of opening direction that allow for a broadly distributed zone of strain, Lindsey et al. (2010) find an extension direction of N105°E. A damaging Mw 5.9 earthquake at ca. 8 km depth occurred in the southern Kivu basin in 2008, causing surface deformation detected by InSAR and field observations (D’Oreye et al., 2011). Insights into rift kinematics also come from active dike intrusion processes. On 17 January, 2002 Nyiragongo volcano erupted creating new, and reactivating pre-existing N-S striking fractures on the south flank of the volcano, parallel to chains of aligned eruptive centres and normal faults in the immediate area (Tedesco et al., 2007; Wauthier et al., 2012). Based on InSAR data and 3D numerical modelling, Wauthier explains the 2002 InSAR deformation signal with two subvertical, ca. N10˚E striking dikes extending from the Nyiragongo volcano south beneath the East Kivu basin.\nFaults of the Kivu rift zone developed in metamorphic rocks of the Mesoproterozoic Kibaran orogenic belt (Fernandez-Alonso & Theunissen, 1998). Basement folds, faults and contacts strike N-S and NW (FernandezAlonso & Theunissen, 1998); these fabrics are apparent in high resolution topography (e.g. Fig. 1). The crustal thickness beneath the Kivu rift is estimated, by legacy seismic refraction experiments, to be ca. 30 km (Bram & Schmeling, 1975). Receiver function estimates of crustal thickness beneath the Virunga volcanic province indicate that crustal thickness is 36 – 39 km beneath the western rift flanks, where a sharp velocity contrast is observed (Mavonga et al., 2010). The site near Nyiragongo volcano reveals a gradational boundary between 30 and 41 km (Mavonga, 2009); this transition zone may indicate a zone of melt ponding in the upper mantle, or in the lower crust (e.g. Wauthier et al., 2012)."

    "text": "Lake Kivu drains southward into Lake Tanganyika via the Rusizi River (Fig. 1), and Lake Kivu is a major contributor of water, and the primary contributor of solutes into Tanganyika (Stoffers & Hecky, 1978). Currently the Kivu-based inflow into Lake Tanganyika via the Rusizi River exceeds Tanganyika’s outflow; termination of Kivu’s outflow into the Rusizi River would close Lake Tanganyika and lower its surface by ca. 75 m, if other factors remain constant (Haberyan & Hecky, 1987). Several indirect lines of evidence indicate that Lake Kivu drained northward, to Lake Edward and was a source of the White Nile prior to the growth of the VVP (e.g. Brooks, 1950; Degens et al., 1973; Haberyan & Hecky, 1987). In late-\nQuaternary age sediment cores, Virunga-derived solutes are not observed in Lake Tanganyika sediments before 10.6 thousand years before present (ka), suggesting that immediately prior to that time Lake Kivu did not drain to Lake Tanganyika (Felton et al., 2007). Earlier data show large combined lake-level and tectonic changes; palaeobeach deposits were recovered from cores at ca. 300 m water depth (Stoffers & Hecky, 1978), and diatomaceous strata are observed on the Idjwi Island horst ca. 120 m above the modern lake (Degens et al., 1973). Recently recovered radiocarbon-dated sediment cores indicate that a major transgression began ca. 12.2 ka (Zhang et al., 2014)."

    "heading": "METHODS",
    "text": "Between 2010 and 2013, over 1000 km of marine seismic reflection data from the eastern basin of Lake Kivu in Rwandan territorial waters were acquired from the 40-foot, twin hulled R/V Kilindi and a 24-foot rigid inflatable boat. MCS data were acquired using an ION Geophysical Corp. (Houston, TX, USA) 40 cu in airgun and a 600 m-long, 48 channel ITITM (Innovative Transducers, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA) streamer with hydrophone groups on 12.5 m centres (Fig. 2). The resulting 24-fold data contained frequencies in the range-of 5–250 Hz and have a vertical resolution of ca. 5 m; in addition to the ca. 130 km of MCS data, ca. 370 km of single-channel high-resolution airgun data and CHIRP sub-bottom profiler data were also acquired. Positioning was constrained by a TrimbleTM AG132 GPS (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) receiver in differential mode during airgun operations, where differential GPS data were corrected to sub-meter accuracy using the OmnistarTM system (Houston, TX, USA). MCS reflection data were processed at Syracuse University using Promax 2DTM software by Landmark Graphics Corporation (Houston, TX, USA), and commercially, by Statcom, LTD. Structural and sedimentary characteristics of the eastern basin (Fig. 3) were interpreted using DecisionSpaceTM by Landmark Graphics Corporation. Data presented in this study were converted from two-way travel time (TWTT) to depth below current lake surface by applying the internal velocity picks created for each line. Semblance velocities were analyzed by generating 5-shot supergathers at 25 shot increments. Data presented in this study are reported in metres below the modern lake level (MLL) datum, which is the height of the lake surface: 1465 metres above mean sea level.\nHigh resolution bathymetry, with 10 m resolution (Lahmeyer International and OSAE, 1998), and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data, with 30 m resolution were used to conduct quantitative analyses of fault length, orientation, and to correlate these with earthquake patterns. Slope analyses were used to identify and map 68 faults (Figs 4 and 5). These were correlated with faults mapped in the field (Ebinger, 1989), from aerial photo-\n© 2015 The Authors Basin Research © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers and International Association of Sedimentologists 177\ngraphs (Villeneuve, 1980), and with those observed in the seismic reflection and seismicity data, as well as aligned chains of eruptive centres (Figs 3, 4 and 5).\nContinuous waveforms from the KIVU12 array were manually scanned and analyzed using the analysis program Seismic Handler Motif (SHM) (Stammler, 1993). P- and S-wave arrival times were picked manually on Butterworth filtered (1–10 Hz) vertical and horizontal components. P phase arrival times were assigned quality factors of 0, 1, 2 or 3 according to estimated measurement errors of 0.05 s, 0.1 s, 0.15 s and 0.3 s respectively. S-wave quality factors of 0, 1, 2 and 3 were assigned to arrivals with estimated measurement errors of 0.1 s, 0.175 s, 0.25 s and 0.3 s respectively. Only events with a minimum of 5 phases, including at least 3 P-arrivals, were used in the locations. GPS timing failures at two sites led to gaps during the last 3 months of the array (Jan-March, 2013). The initial locations of earthquakes were found assuming the local velocity model of Mavonga et al. (2010) using a hypoinverse absolute location algorithm (Klein, 2002). We located 1739 earthquakes on the 8-station array between March 20, 2012 and April 2, 2013. Of these seismic events, 709 occurred within, or near the network and had well-constrained positions and depths; only the 709 are considered in this paper (Fig. 5). Many of the earthquakes were volcano-tectonic with dominant frequencies ranging from 3 s for some events at Nyiragongo, to 10 Hz, typical of tectonic earthquakes. Errors in position are <4 km in depth, and ≤1.5 km in position. The assumption of a simple 1-D velocity model also affects locations, particularly those in the lower crust beneath the VVP (e.g. Kissling et al., 1994). By far the largest number of earthquakes occurred beneath and around Nyiragongo volcano, which was in a state of unrest throughout 2013 (N. D’Oreye, pers. comm., 2014), but many also occurred beneath Nyamuragira volcano where the lava lake was beginning to refill (e.g. Smets et al., 2014) (Fig. 5). Cross sections shown in Fig. 6 reveal the depth distribution of earth-\n(a) (b)\nFig. 2.

Note the three NE-striking faults (circled) that intersect line MCS-10 (Fig. 9).

    "text": "The Kivu rift is the asymmetric rift segment bounded by the ca. 110-km-long large offset border fault (West Kivu BFS) which extends from north of the VVP to ca. 2° S (Figs 4 and 6d). Throw along the West Kivu BFS ranges from 2500 m from the footwall crest to the lake bottom, and the basin contains an unknown thickness of sediments. Late Pleistocene-Holocene lavas of the VVP flood the basin near the centre of this fault system at the north end of the lake, where displacement is expected to be the largest. Unlike elliptical-shaped normal fault displacements, throw and flank uplift decrease to ca. 500 m at the centre of the rift segment beside Nyamuragira and Nyiragongo, suggesting that volcanic loads have suppressed flank uplift in that area (Figs 4, 5 and 6c); we explore this possibility in the discussion. The eastern side of the Kivu rift segment is a heavily incised ramp that is faulted in some areas, and masked by the VVP along its central and northern limits (Fig. 4).\nThe northern termination of the Kivu segment becomes a ridge within the southern Edward basin. The southern termination of the Kivu rift has the form of an asymmetric full-graben separated by a horst: Idjwi Island (Fig. 4). South of the Kivu rift segment is a broad zone of faults and relay ramps that link extensional strain and vertical crustal movements in the Kivu rift to the ca. 700 m lower, and probably more highly extended Tanganyika rift sectors (e.g. Ebinger et al., 1989) (Figs 1 and 4). Intrabasinal faults show predominantly N10-15E orientations, but with notable exceptions (Figs 4, 5 and 7). The Mbuzi Peninsula is a ca. 5 km wide, NNE-striking horst bounded by normal faults; the eastern fault appears to extend northward and continues beneath the flank of Nyiragongo volcano (Fig. 3). Sublacustrine eruptive centres and maars occur along and parallel to this fault (Ross et al., 2014), indicating magmatic interactions at least during the late-stage history of the basin. Aligned chains of eruptive fissures, cinder cones and maars radiate from the volcanoes, and form ridges between nearby volcanoes (Poppe et al., 2013; Ross et al., 2014) (Figs 4 and 5). Specifically, eruptive fissures and cones form a NW-trending ridge between Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira, and NS and NE-striking chains on the northern and southern slopes of the volcanic chain (Fig. 4).\nThe Nyabihu fault is a major NE-trending, normal fault bounding the south side of the Bisoke- MuhaburaSabinyo volcanic chain, and it continues west beneath the lake to form a shallow ridge that is cut by N-S striking\nfaults (Figs 3, 4, 5 and 6c). Seismicity and facetted spurs attest to ongoing activity along this fault system (Fig. 5). Hypocentral depths range from 2–31 km along its strike, but the majority of earthquake ruptures are at depths 10 km subsurface (Fig. 6c). The proximity of the fault to active volcanoes with lower crustal seismicity, the intersection of N-S striking faults and the short time period of observations prevent characterization of fault geometry at depth, as illustrated in one transect along Profile C-C0 (Fig. 6c). Profile C-C0 crosses Nyamuragira, the NE flank of Nyiragongo, and the many monogenetic cones and fissures on the SW flank of Karisimbi, and reveals pervasive lower crustal seismicity beneath the VVP.\nOur structural and stratigraphic studies focus on the eastern part of the Kivu rift segment, in Rwanda. The width of the eastern sub-basin of Lake Kivu reaches a maximum of ca. 30 km near Kibuye. MCS data, however, show that the NS-striking, west-dipping sediment wedge is generally less than ca. 10 km wide and ca. 1.5 km thick (Fig. 3). Basement-involved faults within the East Kivu sub-basin strike N-S, and dip eastward, producing a westward-dipping half-graben (Figs 3, 6 and 7). Fault reconstructions, assuming planar faults, indicate that 2 km of extension has occurred along the East Iwawa Fault (EIF)\n© 2015 The Authors Basin Research © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers and International Association of Sedimentologists 179\n(Fig. 8a). The throw of the EIF is ca. 2.5 km, which includes the sediment wedge, water depth, and height to the top of the footwall block (Iwawa Island). The fault dips steeply eastward at ca. 50° near the lake floor, but velocity control and resolution are too poor to quantify fault dips below 1.5 s TWTT (Fig. 8a). Extrapolation of stratal dips to the west of the survey area suggests that sedimentary thickness exceeds 2 km near Idjwi Island (Figs 3 and 8b). The eastern basin’s basement dips westward at an average of ca. 11° at line 18A (Fig. 8a), but dip decreases to ca. 6° at line MCS-34 (Fig. 8b) south of Iwawa Island and near the widest part of the basin. Shallow rupture depths of a spatial cluster of earthquakes along Profile D-D crossing the eastern Kivu basin have depth errors <1.5 km (Figs 5 and 6d). Other shallow earthquakes beneath the East Kivu basin and along faults that offset the lake bottom, as seen in CHIRP seismic reflection profiles (Zhang et al., 2014). Only three of the NE-striking faults intersect the MCS survey area, these intersect profile MCS-10 near the north end of the reflection seismic survey area (Figs 3 and 9). These faults show displacement of acoustic basement and lower strata but little or no displacement is observed in younger sediments (Fig. 9), indicating that they could be from an earlier episode of extension. Currently they may function as relay ramps between active faults or zones of\ndifferential subsidence. Direct field observation of subaerially exposed faults is difficult, as outcrops are sparse or covered by forest or intensive agriculture; however, a few observed NE-striking faults are documented as obliqueslip (Ebinger, 1989)."

    "text": "The ca. 1500 m-thick, westward-dipping sedimentary wedge contains several areally extensive erosional unconformities that are indicative of extreme variability in water levels, as well as tectonism. Angular unconformities labelled H1 and H2 divide the sediments into three major seismic sequences: Kibuye, Idjwi and Iwawa (Fig. 10). The Kibuye Sequence is up to 1200 m-thick, and therefore records most of the sedimentary history of the lake. The Kibuye Sequence is characterized by low-frequency, high-amplitude, moderate to semi-continuous reflections. On the eastern, flexural margin of the basin, Kibuye sediments occur at subsurface depths of ca. 320 m below the current lake level. At the end of the time period corresponding to the upper Kibuye sequence, a large set of progradational clinoforms was deposited at the northern end of the eastern basin (Fig. 11). This south-dipping clinoform package is ca. 200 m thick and extends ca. 1.5 km in the dip direction. The geometry of the clinoform package suggests that it was deposited by a major southward-flowing river system. The topset of this interpreted palaeo-delta is ca. 500–600 m below the modern lake surface. The upper Kibuye sediments are truncated by the H1 surface (Fig. 10).\nThe Idjwi seismic sequence onlaps the H1 unconformity (Fig. 11) indicating that the lake level cycled to a lower state after deposition of this delta then transgressed to the Idjwi stage. The Idjwi sequence shows higher frequency reflections than the Kibuye seismic sequence, as well as high-amplitude reflections with excellent continuity. The Idjwi sediment wedge is 450 m-thick on the hanging wall of the EIF. The top of the Idjwi sediments are truncated by the H2 surface, which shows extensive, channelized erosion of both Idjwi and Kibuye sediments in the southern part of the eastern sub-basin.\nThe Iwawa reflectors onlap the H2 surface and are as thick as 100 m in some localities (Figs 10 and 11). These show excellent continuity and higher-amplitudes than either the Kibuye or Idjwi sediments. High-resolution, single-channel and CHIRP reflection seismic data provide additional details of the Iwawa sequence, as presented in Zhang et al. (2014)."

The lower crustal earthquakes between Nyiragongo and Karisimbi volcanoes (Profile A-A0) occurred during two intense swarms in May and November 2012 interpreted as magmatic intrusions from beneath Nyiragongo. However, no surface deformation was detected in InSAR, and we cannot constrain the geometry of intrusions (N. D’Oreye et al., pers. comm., 2013). Beneath Nyamuragira volcano, the dense cluster of earthquakes at 8–12 km subsurface may correspond to the hot rock zone surrounding a pressurized magma chamber (Fig. 6c). Swarms of earthquakes beneath the western flank of Karisimbi suggest an active magma reservoir beneath this large shield volcano. The easternmost volcanoes of the volcanic chain show no earthquake activity (Fig. 5) arguing against pressurized magma chambers beneath these volcanoes.\nThe vertically exaggerated enlargement of Profile B-B0 (Fig. 12) shows sharp breaks in slope at the base of the narrow Nyiragongo volcano, suggesting the volcano formed on a pre-existing NW-trending volcanic ridge between Karisimbi and the West Kivu Border fault. Volcanic construction probably shaped the northern basin\nbefore Nyiragongo developed in the past ca. 125 thousand years (e.g. De Mulder & Pasteels, 1986; Kampunzu et al., 1998). The knickpoint in the lava slope at the lake surface level suggests long-lived magma-fluid interactions (Figs 6b and 12). The westward-tilted asymmetry of the 4600 m-high Karisimbi volcano also is apparent in profile A-A0 consistent with ongoing subsidence of the westwardtilted basin. Note as well that the rift flank uplift, which is more than 1500 m along most of the North Kivu basin length, is only ca. 500 m above the background elevation. Using receiver function analyses, Mavonga et al. (2010) estimated velocities of ca. 7 km/s in the upper 10 km of the crust beneath the volcanic ridge. These high velocities indicate a thick sequence of basalts and intrusive gabbros infill parts of the basin and intrude the upper crust."

The ca. 110 km-long, 45 km-wide North Kivu lake basin formed by the West Kivu BFS, has similar dimensions to the ca. 110 km by ca. 40–47 km-wide Edward basin to the north. Both basins are narrower than the 55–60 km-wide Tanganyika and Malawi rift basins. If\nthe 1.5 km sediment thickness in the eastern part Kivu half-graben is half the total thickness at the foot of the West Kivu border fault, the Kivu basin would still be one of the thinnest sedimentary sequences in the Western rift system. Without seismic data from the western basin in D.R. Congo, we can only make crude estimates of faultcontrolled extension across the Kivu rift. Assuming that the West Kivu BFS accommodates at least as much extension as the E Kivu survey area, then the minimum faultcontrolled extension is ca. 4 km, as compared to 4–5 km predicted from predictive flexural models of basin and flank morphology and free-air gravity anomalies (Ebinger et al., 1991). The inclusion of flexure in basin subsidence models leads to basin depths more than two times greater than models that assume local isostasy (Te = 0), and flexural uplift also predicts the tall broad rift flanks (e.g. Ebinger et al., 1991). The predicted basin and flank morphology (without erosion) is compared to topography and structural interpretations in Fig. 6e, which shows the predicted basin depth of 6 km, as compared to our estimate of ca. 5 km from projections of fault dips. The ca. 1000 m-high uplifted flanks of the partially water and sediment-filled Kivu basin can be explained by 4 km of heave across a single master fault in a finite strength lithosphere. Without direct observations from the western side of the rift, more sophisticated modelling is unwarranted.\n© 2015 The Authors Basin Research © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers and International Association of Sedimentologists182\nThe narrow basin width and comparatively thin sedimentary layer thickness suggest that the Kivu rift is less extended, and perhaps younger, than the Albert, Edward, Tanganyika and northern Malawi rift sectors, each of which contain four or more kilometres of Early Miocene to recent strata, and with 5–10 km of fault-controlled extension (e.g. Rosendahl, 1987; Rosendahl et al., 1988; Cohen et al., 1993; Upcott et al., 1996; Karp et al., 2012). The Kivu rift zone has another distinctive feature, in that much of the shallow southern part of the lake was flooded in late-Quaternary time, producing the irregular coastline. The southern lake basin area, part of the accommodation zone between the Rusizi (Tanganyika) and Kivu basins, has experienced less subsidence, and probably less stretching, than the basin bounded by the West Kivu BFS.\nActive magmatic underplating and magma intrusion may also explain some of the unusual features of the Kivu basin. By analogy to the Main Ethiopian rift, where extensive crust and mantle imaging reveals active magmatic underplating, the lower crustal seismicity and gradational Moho beneath the VVP may indicate active underplating, with the addition of new magmatic crust to counter\nmechanical thinning (e.g. Keir et al., 2009). The variable flank elevation along strike, the narrow basin, and the presence of several large shield volcanoes within the central rift all indicate that the volcanic loading, as well as the crustal stretching, control the basin and flank morphology in the central and northern parts of the Kivu rift (Fig. 6).\nThe volcanic loading effect of the Virunga volcanic chain on the rift morphology can be quantified, and superposed on the topography predicted by flexural models of extension along the West Kivu border fault (Fig. 6a). As a conservative estimate of deflection by a volcanic load, we assume a line load 40 km in length, 1 km-high, 20 km at its base (4 9 1011 N/m) and with triangular cross- section centred beneath Karisimbi volcano. We assume that the volcano loads a plate of Te = 17 km, as used in earlier studies. We assume the load deflects a mantle with density contrast with the crust of 500 kg/m3, using relations in Turcotte & Schubert (2002). We estimate an additional 1.1 km of subsidence centred beneath Karisimbi volcano, which formed along the eastern flank of the basin. This is a crude estimate intended to demonstrate the effect of the volcanic loading\nFig. 9. Profile MCS-10 showing three NE-striking faults. See Fig. 3 for map view of faults. These faults displace the bedrock and earlier sediments but not sediments above the dashed line.\nFig. 10. Profile of MCS-18A showing angular unconformity surfaces H1 and H2 which divide the stratigraphic column into three primary sedimentary sequences: Kibuye, Idjwi and Iwawa. White arrows show points of sediment truncation. The lowermost Kibuye Sequence is observed to be up to ca. 1200 m thick in the eastern basin; the Idjwi Sequence is a maximum of ca. 450 m thick, and the uppermost Iwawa Sequence is observed to have a maximum thickness of ca. 100 m. A third angular unconformity, H3, subdivides the Iwawa sequence and is discernable in higher resolution CHIRP reflection seismic data (Zhang et al., 2014).\n© 2015 The Authors Basin Research © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers and International Association of Sedimentologists 183\non rift basin shape in areas where the strength of the extended lithosphere is considerable. The combination of extension and volcanic loading sum to produce a basin that is deeper on the eastern side and broader than the basin shape predicted by extension alone. The downward deflection by the volcanic loading decreases the rift flank uplift from ca. 1.9 km to 1.4 km relative to the background elevation of 1900 m (Fig. 6a, d, e). This simple model over-predicts the rift flank uplift by about 400 m,\nbut we have neglected erosion, considered a modest line load and assumed basin fill is sediments and water, all factors that will decrease flank height. The merged bathymetry-topography profile (Fig. 12) shows a broad northward dip in the basin. However, within the spatially limited MCS data set, a clear, northward dip of deep sedimentary strata toward the volcanic province is not observed, possibly due to short-wavelength tilting associated with the oblique-striking Nyabihu fault.\n(a)\n(b)\n© 2015 The Authors Basin Research © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers and International Association of Sedimentologists184\nThe shallow hypocenters beneath the E. Kivu basin (>5 km) are unusual, given the limited overburden (sedimentary rocks) and the absence of eruptive centres in the East Kivu basin (Fig. 6d). The unusually shallow clusters of earthquakes beneath the East Kivu basin may indicate that fluid pressures are high in the upper crust and lake sedimentary strata, inducing failure at low overburden stress as is seen near CO2 vents (e.g. Miller et al., 2004; Rutledge et al., 2004). These observations are consistent with the high levels of volcanic degassing indicated by lake hydrology and chemistry (e.g. Schmid et al., 2005; Borges et al., 2009)."

    "heading": "Lake Basinage",
    "text": "A first-order estimate of the eastern basin age can be determined by assuming that the modern depositional rates are representative of the full basin history, and ignoring the as yet undated erosional hiatuses. Using radiometric dating of materials recovered from sediment cores, Lake Kivu’s average sedimentation rate since an early Holocene, ca. 400 m lake transgression is calculated to be 0.7 m/ka (Zhang et al., 2014). Prior to ca. 12.2 ka, the lake level was lower and the lake basin was smaller, while more of the catchment was subaerial and subject to erosion; as a result, sedimentary rates were likely higher during these times of lower lake level. Assuming that the average sedimentary rate was 1 m/ka, then the observed ca. 1500 m sedimentary section represents ca. 1.5 million years of sedimentation. However, this crude estimate is likely a minimum age, as sediment compaction, intervals of non-deposition, and material lost to erosion are not considered. In addition, our surveys were made near the southern limit of the North Kivu basin, and sedimentary sequences are likely much thicker beneath the western and central North Kivu basin, part of which is now overlain by the VVP.\nThe Idjwi and Iwawa Sequence sediments above the palaeo-delta and erosional surface H1 (Fig. 10) are ca. 500 m-thick, indicating that this lake lowstand occurred at ca. 500 ka, using the assumed sedimentation rate. Iwawa Sequence sediments are as thick as ca. 100 m in many localities; if the assumed sedimentation rate is correct, the H2 erosional event likely correlates to the widespread African Megadrought period at ca. 135–75 ka (e.g. Cohen et al., 2007; Scholz et al., 2007)."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "A synthesis of new and existing structural and stratigraphic data from the Kivu rift sector, East Africa, provides critical constraints on syn-rift basin evolution, and the increasing influence of magmatic processes with time. Our new multi-channel seismic reflection data from the southeastern sector of the Kivu rift (within Rwanda territorial waters) reveal classic tilted fault blocks in a half\ngraben, with at least 1.5 km of sedimentary strata tilted westward toward the West Kivu border fault. The sedimentary record observed in the MCS data contains at least three angular unconformities indicative of desiccation events, with the most recent probably corresponding to the African Megadrought period (135–75 ka); and a more recent lowstand dating from the late Pleistocene is not observed in MCS data, but is well documented in high-resolution CHIRP seismic reflection data (Zhang et al., 2014). Using the crude assumption that modern sedimentation rates (1 km/My) are representative of mean deposition rates over time, and ignoring the hiatuses indicated by the two erosional unconformities, the minimum age estimate is ca. 1.5 Ma, but is more likely to be 3–5 Ma given the simplistic assumptions. Stratigraphic analyses indicate major changes in basin morphology and depositional systems occurred since the last erosional unconformity. The southward-flowing river that produced the palaeo-delta sequence no longer exists, and subaerial evidence of this ancient drainage is now obscured by the flows of the Virunga volcanic province. The modern, deepwater stage of the rift appears to characterize only the most recent phase of basin development.\nFault-controlled extension in the surveyed eastern Kivu basin is at least ca. 2 km; by assuming equal extension per unit width, fault-controlled extension is estimated at ca. 5 km. The extension estimate is on the low end for fault-controlled extension in the Western rift (4–10 km; Ebinger et al., 1991), but consistent with the apparently younger age of the Kivu rift zone. Although volcanism has occurred from ca. 12 Ma to present within the VVP, and from ca. 10 Ma to present within the South Kivu province, volcanoes of the Virunga chain developed in the past 2.6 My, forming first on the eastern flank, and migrating to the central Kivu rift basin. Assuming a spoon-shaped half-graben basin morphology, maximum sedimentary thickness should occur at the foot of the West Kivu border fault, beneath the Virunga volcanic province. The surface volcanic loading adds to the fault-controlled subsidence, increasing basin depth by more than 1 km. Both N-S and NE-striking faults are active based on lake bottom warping and faulting, CHIRP seismic reflection data (Zhang et al., 2014), as well comparisons of earthquake epicentral locations and surface fault locations projected to depth. During the 13-month period of observation, intense earthquake activity occurred at Nyiragongo volcano, as well as a focused earthquake cluster beneath Nyamuragira volcano. The lower crust beneath the volcanic province and NE-striking Nyabihu fault zone shows unusual lower crustal seismicity, possibly indicating active magma intrusion, some of which feeds Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira. The magma intrusions attest to ongoing modification of the crust, and motivate future studies of magmatic and fault connectivity between nearby volcanoes.\n© 2015 The Authors Basin Research © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers and International Association of Sedimentologists 185"

  "abstractText": "The seismically and volcanically active Kivu Rift, in the western branch of the East African Rift System, is a type locale for studies of high-elevation, humid-climate rift basins, as well as magmatic basin development. Interpretations of offshore multi-channel seismic (MCS) reflection data, terrestrial radar topography, lake bathymetry and seismicity data recorded on a temporary array provide new insights into the structure, stratigraphy and evolution of the Kivu rift. The Kivu rift is an asymmetric graben controlled on its west side by a ca. 110 km-long, N-S striking border fault. The southern basins of the lake and the upper Rusizi river basin are an accommodation zone effectively linking 1470 m-high Lake Kivu to 770 m-high Lake Tanganyika. MCS data in the eastern Kivu lake basin reveal a west-dipping half graben with at least 1.5 km of sedimentary section; most of the ca. 2 km of extension in this sub-basin is accommodated by the east-dipping Iwawa normal fault, which bounds an intrabasinal horst. Lake Kivu experienced at least three periods of near desiccation. The two most recent of these approximately correlate to the African Megadrought and Last Glacial Maximum. There was a rapid lake level transgression of at least 400 m in the early Holocene. The line load of the Virunga volcanic chain enhances the fault-controlled basin subsidence; simple elastic plate models suggest that the line load of the Virunga volcanic chain depresses the basin by more than 1 km, reduces flank uplift locally and broadens the depocentre. Not only do the voluminous magmatism and degassing to the lake pose a hazard to the riparian population, but our studies demonstrate that magmatism has important implications for short-term processes such as lake levels, inflow and outlets, as well as long term modification of classic half-graben basin morphology.",
