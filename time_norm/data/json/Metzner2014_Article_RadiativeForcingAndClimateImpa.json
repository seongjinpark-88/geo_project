    "text": "methodology connecting volcanological field data to global climate model estimates for a regional time series of explosive volcanic events. Using the petrologic method, we estimated SO2 emissions from 36 detected Plinian volcanic eruptions occurring at the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) during the past 200,000 years. Together with simple parametrized relationships collected from past studies, we derive estimates of global maximum volcanic aerosol optical depth (AOD) and radiative forcing (RF) describing the effect of each eruption on radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. In parallel, AOD and RF time series for selected CAVA eruptions are simulated with the global aerosol model MAECHAM5-HAM, which shows a relationship between stratospheric SO2 injection and maximum global mean AOD that is linear for smaller volcanic eruptions (\\5 Mt SO2) and nonlinear for larger ones (C5 Mt SO2) and is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the relationship used in the simple parametrized approximation. Potential climate impacts of the selected CAVA eruptions are estimated using an earth system model of intermediate complexity by RF time series derived by (1) directly from the global aerosol model and (2) from the simple parametrized approximation assuming a 12-month exponential decay of global AOD. We find that\nwhile the maximum AOD and RF values are consistent between the two methods, their temporal evolutions are significantly different. As a result, simulated global maximum temperature anomalies and the duration of the temperature response depend on which RF time series is used, varying between 2 and 3 K and 60 and 90 years for the largest eruption of the CAVA dataset. Comparing the recurrence time of eruptions, based on the CAVA dataset, with the duration of climate impacts, based on the model results, we conclude that cumulative impacts due to successive eruptions are unlikely. The methodology and results presented here can be used to calculate approximate volcanic forcings and potential climate impacts from sulfur emissions, sulfate aerosol or AOD data for any eruption that injects sulfur into the tropical stratosphere.\nKeywords Volcanic eruptions Radiative forcing CAVA Climate Petrologic method"

    "text": "The impact of volcanic eruptions on the climate system has recently become an important research topic (Robock 2000; Timmreck 2012), adding to the understanding of the global climate system. Analysis of external climate forcings (by using a multi-fingerprint detection and attribution method) suggests that volcanism is the most prominent factor for natural climate variability within the last 700 years (e.g., Hegerl et al. 2007).\nVolcanic eruptions have a significant impact on global climate when sulfur-containing gas species such as SO2 and H2S are transported from magma into the stratosphere where they are oxidized by OH into sulfuric acid gas with an e-folding time of about 1 month (Bluth et al. 1992).\nD. Metzner S. Kutterolf M. Toohey A. Freundt K. Krüger (&) GEOMAR, Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Kiel, Germany e-mail: kkrueger@geomar.de\nD. Metzner e-mail: dmetzner@geomar.de\nC. Timmreck U. Niemeier Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany\nFormation of new particles due to binary nucleation of H2SO4/H2O and condensation of H2SO4 on pre-existing particles enhances the stratospheric background aerosol layer, depending on the strength of the eruption, significantly over a couple of months to years. These stratospheric aerosols have a direct radiative effect by scattering incoming solar radiation back to space and absorbing outgoing terrestrial radiation, with the net effect being cooling of the Earth’s surface. The climatic impact of volcanic eruptions varies depending primarily on the amount of sulfur injected into the stratosphere and the atmospheric lifetime of the volcanic sulfate aerosols. The lifetime and spatial extent of the climate impact is controlled by the transport of aerosols within the stratosphere via the stratospheric circulation. In particular, tropical eruptions have a global climate impact due to the poleward transport of volcanic aerosols by the large-scale meridional circulation in the stratosphere (Toohey et al. 2011), the so-called Brewer–Dobson circulation (BDC) (Holton et al. 1995). In contrast, aerosols from eruptions in higher latitudes stay mostly in the hemisphere of the eruption and have a shorter lifetime compared with tropical eruptions (Oman et al. 2006).\nThe last volcanic eruption having a global climate impact was the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, Philippines, in June 1991 with approximately 17 Mt SO2 release (Read et al. 1993; Guo 2004) and a maximum global cooling up to 0.4 K (e.g., Dutton and Christy 1992; Santer et al. 2001; Thompson et al. 2009). Recent estimates for the 1815 Tambora eruption, the largest Plinian eruption in the last 500 years with a stratospheric SO2 emission of 53–58 Mt (Self et al. 2004), are between 1 and 1.5 K (Self et al. 2004; Stenchikov et al. 2009), while global model simulations for the Young Toba Tuff (YTT) eruption, *74 ka ago on Sumatra, with 100 times the Pinatubo strength give global maximum cooling values between 3.5 and 10 K dependent on the model approach (Jones et al. 2005; Robock et al. 2009; Timmreck et al. 2010).\nTo evaluate the climatic response of paleo-volcanic eruptions, usually earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMIC) or coupled climate models, that is, coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (GCMs), are employed. These models typically need a volcanic radiative forcing dataset as input, which could be either a direct reduction in global radiative forcing (RF) (neglecting spatial patterns) as used for paleo-simulations (e.g., Jansen et al. 2007), or latitudinally varying aerosol optical depth (AOD) as in the case of IPCC AR4 simulations (Stenchikov et al. 2006). AOD is a dimensionless quantity that describes a measure of atmospheric opacity due to scattering and absorption of radiation by aerosols, while the RF (given in W/m2) defines the reduction in the incoming solar radiation.\nThe estimation of volcanic RF data is a difficult task with a high uncertainty since direct measurements of volcanic RF\nare available for only a few modern eruptions. Different independent methods for creating RF datasets are commonly used including direct radiative measurements, analysis of ice core records, and other proxy data and modeling. Measurements from which AOD can be directly estimated started in the second half of the nineteenth century and are derived today by ground- and satellite-based instruments (Sato et al. 1993; SPARC 2006). In contrast, through analysis of ice cores, one can estimate global or hemispheric sulfate aerosol loading based on the deposition of sulfate on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (e.g., Zielinski 1995). Additionally, using the electrical conductivity method (ECM), the chemical composition and quantity of acid gases can be measured (Hammer 1980). In the last decade, a relatively large number of new ice core volcanic records have been published with higher quality than previous ice core records (Cole-Dai 2010). In addition to the long volcanic records from Greenland (Zielinski 1995; Zielinski et al. 1997), now also long records from Antarctica are available, that is, from the EPICA Dome C ice core (Castellano et al. 2004, 2005) and Siple Dome, West Antarctica (Kurbatov et al. 2006). However, uncertainties in these volcanic records arise from many sources (Robock and Free 1995), including errors in dating and spatial variability between individual ice cores (Gao et al. 2007). Another method for determining the mass of volatiles released by large volcanic eruptions in the long-term past is the petrologic method (e.g., Devine et al. 1984). Through this method, stratospheric SO2 injections are estimated from a combination of geochemical and volcanological analysis of eruption deposits. This method has the advantage of analyzing the volcanic eruption directly at its source, and so uncertainties brought about through variations in transport pathway between emission and eventual deposition are minimized, but it generally underestimates the SO2 emissions compared with SO2 estimates derived from atmospheric aerosol measurements (Self and King 1996).\nIn this study, we present for the first time a self-consistent methodology connecting volcanological field data to global climate model estimates for a regional time series of volcanic events over the last 200 ka. By doing this, we use parametrized relationships from earlier studies (e.g., Hyde and Crowley 2000) and additionally verify these existing relationships. We concentrate on the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) because it is one of the most volcanically active regions in the world and little is known about the climate effect of CAVA volcanoes. A few climate modeling studies have been carried out only for the very recent eruptions of Santa Maria, Guatemala, in 1902, and the 1982 eruption of El Chichón,1 Mexico (e.g., Robock 1984; Tie et al. 1994).\n1 EL Chichón (17 21N, 93 13W) is located in the southern Mexican state Chipas and belongs to the Chiapanecan Volcanic Arc system.\nWe first describe our method and models used to derive SO2 emissions and the according volcanic radiative forcing and climate response (section ‘‘Method and models’’). Our results are shown and discussed in section ‘‘Results and discussion.’’ The results comprise a unique dataset of petrologically estimated SO2 emissions by highly explosive eruptions that occurred at the CAVA during the last 200 ka (section ‘‘CAVA sulfur emissions’’). Then, based on these data, we apply simple parametrized relationships and model simulations to derive estimates of AOD and RF for detected Plinian volcanic eruptions of the CAVA over the last 200 ka (section ‘‘Volcanic forcing from CAVA eruptions’’). The global aerosol model MAECHAM5-HAM is used to validate the simple relationships between the emitted SO2 mass and AOD, by simulating a range of CAVA eruptions of different SO2 emissions. Both volcanic forcings are then used to drive an EMIC, from which estimates of the climate response of volcanic SO2 injections into the stratosphere are obtained (section ‘‘Climate response to the CAVA eruptions’’). Finally, we summarize and conclude our measurement and modeling results (section ‘‘Summary and conclusions’’)."

    "text": "Petrologic method\nThe determination of sulfur injection into the stratosphere during large past Central American Plinian eruptions is based on a two-step approach.\nThe first step is the determination of erupted magma mass. Tephras identified by our field work were exposed on land and recovered by sediment cores on the Pacific seafloor to create isopach (thickness) maps that serve as a basis to determine erupted magma masses as described in Kutterolf et al. (2007, 2008). Additionally used data on erupted magma masses are from Wundermann (1982), CEL (1992, 1995), Koch and McLean (1975), Rose (1987), Rose et al. (1987), Self et al. (1989), Kempter et al. (1996) as well as this study.\nThe second step is the measurement of sulfur contents for each tephra in both melt inclusion and matrix glasses. Matrix glass represents the degassed melt after eruption. Droplets of melt included in minerals during their growth in the magma chamber, however, are assumed to not have degassed during a rapid eruption and thus preserve the pre-eruptive sulfur contents of the melt. The concentration difference between melt inclusion and matrix glasses yields the sulfur fraction degassed during an eruption, and multiplication with erupted magma mass gives the mass of emitted sulfur. Sulfur measurements of both melt inclusions and matrix glasses are performed by electron microprobe; the analytical error for sulfur measurements by electron microprobe is\\20 %.\nModels\nIn this study, two different kinds of models are applied. First, we use a global aerosol climate model (MAECHAM5-HAM) to evaluate the volcanic radiative forcing for a given volcanic SO2 injection into the stratosphere. Then, an EMIC (CLIMBER-2) is employed to assess the potential global climate impact."

    "text": "The GCM MAECHAM5 (Giorgetta et al. 2006) is a middle atmosphere version of the ECHAM5 model (Roeckner et al. 2003). MAECHAM5 is used here in a free-running climate mode, with a spectral truncation of 42 (T42) and 39 vertical levels up to 0.01 hPa (*80 km). Model processes related to sulfate aerosols are calculated by the modal aerosol microphysical module HAM (Stier et al. 2005), which is interactively coupled to MAECHAM5 (Niemeier et al. 2009). The model simulates the full lifecycle of the volcanic sulfate aerosols, including oxidation of SO2, conversion to aerosols, and microphysical evolution via nucleation, condensation, accumulation and coagulation, as well as the removal processes of sedimentation and deposition. The aerosols are dispersed and advected by the model winds. The radiative effects of the aerosols are explicitly taken into account, and so the radiative transfer of both solar short-wave and terrestrial long-wave radiation is dependent on detailed microphysical properties of the aerosols, including their size distribution. MAECHAM5HAM simulations of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption by Niemeier et al. (2009) and Toohey et al. (2011) have shown good agreement between modeled and observed aerosol properties and radiative anomalies. Modeled stratospheric aerosol loading and optical depth reach maximum levels approximately 5 months after the eruption and thereafter exponentially decay with an e-folding lifetime of 12 months, in agreement with observations by McCormick et al. (1995). The modeled global mean AOD within the first year after the eruption is *10 to 20 % larger than observed values, with better agreement after the first year. SAGE satellite measurements underestimate AOD because of saturation of the signal above the tropopause (Russell et al. 1996). In addition, the modeled maximum effective radius of the sulfate aerosols is within the spread of values measured by lidar after the Pinatubo eruption (Jaeger et al. 1995; Ansmann et al. 1997)."

It is comparable with comprehensive models including many processes and feedbacks in the climate earth system (Ganopolski et al. 2000), but with its fast turnaround time due to low spatial resolution and simplified governing equations, it is especially suitable for longterm simulations (Ganopolski et al. 1998; Claussen et al. 1999; Brovkin et al. 2002).\nVolcanic radiative forcing\nThe conversion of petrologically estimated CAVA SO2 emissions to volcanic radiative forcing that can be used in climate models is a main goal of this study. In this section, methods for two kinds of volcanic radiative forcings, AOD and RF, are presented.\nAerosol optical depth is a key quantity for the RF calculations. Giving the degree to which aerosols prevent the transmission of solar radiation to the Earth’s surface by absorption or scattering, AOD is given by dimensionless values. The larger the AOD becomes, the less solar radiation reaches the surface, which results in a net radiation change indicated by RF. In the following, we employ two different methods to estimate the AOD, a simple parametrized approximation (section ‘‘Simple parametrized approximation’’) and a model estimation (section ‘‘Model estimation’’)."

    "text": "Stratospheric SO2 injections spread within a timescale of weeks around the earth (Bluth et al. 1992) and react with OH and H2O to form stratospheric sulfate (SO4 2-) aerosols (Bekki 1995). The emitted mass of SO2 is converted to sulfate mass by multiplication by 1.53, the ratio of the molecular weights of two species, to determine the maximum stratospheric sulfate loading (MSL). Further, we assume a volcanic sulfate aerosol composition of 75 % H2SO4 and 25 % H2O by weight (Hamill et al. 1977), such that multiplying the MSL by 1.25 yields the maximum (total) sulfate aerosol loading (MD). The term ‘‘maximum’’ reflects the assumptions that all of the volcanically released SO2 reaches the stratosphere and that all SO2 is converted to sulfate aerosols before any is removed from the stratosphere. Combining these chemical scaling factors yields the relationship between MD and SO2 injection (MSO2 ) as: MD ¼ 1:91 MSO2 : ð1Þ\nAerosol optical depth Stothers (1984a, b) introduced a linear relationship between MD (in Mt) and the corresponding global mean AOD at 0.55 lm (sD), which we re-arranged to:\nsD ¼ 0:0067 MD: ð2Þ\nLinearity between aerosol loading and AOD was assumed by many early reconstructions of past RF (Crowley and Kim 1999; Free and Robock 1999), until it was noted that such relationships gave unrealistically large AOD values for the larger eruptions of the historical record. Subsequent studies (e.g., Hyde and Crowley 2000; Ammann et al. 2003; Gao et al. 2008) have used an AOD to aerosol loading relationship that scaled as the 2/3 power of aerosol loading for large eruptions. Physically this can be explained by the fact that under higher concentrations, sulfuric acid will preferentially condense on existing particles rather than forming new particle via nucleation (Pinto et al. 1989). Therefore, above some threshold, increases in stratospheric SO2 injections will result in larger particles rather than increased aerosol number density. Since the AOD scales with the surface area (rather than the volume) of the aerosols, scaling the aerosol mass by the power of 2/3 corrects for the surface area to volume ratio. We therefore use a function to relate AOD and MD above a certain threshold that takes the general form:\nsD ¼ a M2=3D þ b; ð3Þ\nwhere a and b are constants that control the slope and y-intercept of the relationship.\nHyde and Crowley (2000) set their threshold value in terms of RF. Using a relationship between RF and AOD (Eq. 5 in this section further down; see also Hansen et al. 2005) and Eq. 1, we translate their -1.5 W/m2 threshold to MD = 9.4 Mt (or MSO2 = 4.9 Mt). It should be noted that Crowley (2000) used MD = 15 Mt as a threshold value, but we find that such changes in the assumed threshold value lead to only small differences in the relationship derived below. Hyde and Crowley (2000) scaled their power law relationship such that their RF produced for the 1883 Krakatau eruption was consistent with the estimate from Sato et al. (1993). In order to derive a relationship that is comparable to theirs, we use the fact reported by Hyde and Crowley (2000) that their 2/3 power law relationship reduced their RF estimate for the 1815 Tambora eruption to -6.1 W/m2 compared with -8.3 W/m2 calculated via the linear relationship. By first applying Eqs. 5 and 1 to solve for a MD, which results in a -8.3 W/m2 RF using the linear relationship (Eq. 2), and secondly the AOD corresponding to -6.1 W/m2 through Eq. 5, we can fill these values into Eq. 3 to define one equation in terms of only a and b. By also requiring that Eqs. 2 and 3 agree at the threshold value, we are able to solve two equations for the constants a and b. Finally, combining our power law relationship for larger eruptions with the linear relationship for smaller ones (Eq. 2), our resulting full AOD to MD relationship is given by:\nsD ¼ 0:0067 MD MD\\9:4 Mt 0:02 M2=3D 0:028 MD 9:4 Mt : ð4Þ\nRadiative forcing The RF of the climate system is closely connected to the AOD. The RF values are negative to emphasize that volcanic eruptions reduce the net radiation. Based on the study by Hansen et al. (2005), we assume a globally uniform stratospheric aerosol layer causing a net radiative flux (DFnet) at the tropopause approximated by DFnet = c sD, where c can vary between -20 and -30 based on different model versions and spatial resolutions of a global climate model. For the conversion of AOD to the changes in downward short-wave RF, we chose the adjusted RF at the tropopause with a factor of -24 and derive the according relationship:\nDFnet ¼ 24 sD; ð5Þ\nwith an AOD (sD) within an accuracy of about 25 % for aerosol size distribution with effective radii between 0.1 and 1 lm (Hansen and Travis 1974). We calculated the annual mean RF for each post-eruption year (assuming an eruption time of June according to the eruption time of Mt. Pinatubo) according to the assumption used by Ammann et al. (2003) and Gao et al. (2008) that RF increases linearly to its maximum value over a period of 4 months and that it subsequently decays with an e-folding lifetime of 12 months."

    "text": "Aerosol optical depth The relationship connecting AOD with aerosol loading derived above (Eq. 4) is based on observations. Given that the largest eruptions for which AOD has been estimated from observations (Tambora and Krakatau) occurred when measurement capabilities were more limited than they are today, there is obviously a certain amount of uncertainty in the AOD to aerosol loading relationship at large loadings. For example, the AOD after the eruption of Krakatau estimated by Stothers (1996) is approximately 50 % larger than that estimated by Sato et al. (1993), the latter being used by Hyde and Crowley (2000) to scale their AOD to aerosol loading relationship. With observational uncertainties in mind, in order to gain confidence in our AOD to SO2 injection relationship, we compare it with the results from a GCM interactively coupled to an aerosol microphysics module. This model has the advantage that particle evolution and associated radiative effects of volcanic sulfate aerosols are explicitly taken into account.\nFor consistency, for all eruption simulations, the estimated SO2 mass was injected into the model gridbox closest to the location of the Los Chocoyos eruption site (section\n‘‘Model estimation—results’’) (*14.6 N, *91.2 W) in the lower stratosphere between 23 and 25 km (at 30 hPa). Satellite observations after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption show that the bulk of the aerosol cloud was centered around 25 km (Sparks et al. 1997), and for consistency, we use this injection height for all simulations. All simulations are performed with eruptions on 1 January. For eruptions with magnitudes equal to or smaller than Pinatubo (17 Mt), the sulfur gases are injected over a time span of 3 h, while a duration of 24 h is used for eruptions larger than Pinatubo.\nRadiative forcing An annual mean model-based RF is constructed based on the monthly mean AOD produced by the MAECHAM5-HAM simulations and converted to RF through Eq. 5. By using this model-based RF for our climate simulations (section ‘‘Climate response’’), we address the varying e-folding time for different strength volcanic eruptions.\nClimate response\nTo estimate the climate response from the CAVA eruptions, we drive CLIMBER-2 with two different volcanic radiative forcing sets, one from the simple parametrized approximation of Eqs. 1, 4, 5 (section ‘‘Simple parametrized approximation’’) and one based on the results of the MAECHAM5-HAM simulations (section ‘‘Model estimation’’).\nWithin the EMIC, the volcanic forcing is implemented by a reduction in the annual mean solar constant as given by the two differently calculated annual mean RF (described in section ‘‘Volcanic radiative forcing’’). This approach is similar to the studies by Bauer et al. (2003) and Brovkin et al. (2009). Each simulation is performed for 200 years, considering the feedbacks in the climate earth system, in particular the ocean and the vegetation. Temperature anomalies for the seven volcanic eruptions, for which already the constructed SO2 to AOD relationship with the MAECHAM5-HAM have been tested, are calculated relative to the climatology of a control run (200 years) without the prescribed forcing."

Table 1 includes another 19 tephras for which erupted masses had been determined by other\nauthors and thus lists 55 volcanic eruptions considering magnitudes. In total, erupted magma masses are well constrained for 55 eruptions that are listed in Table 1, where erupted magma mass is also expressed in terms of eruptions magnitude (column 7) defined as M = log(m) - 7, where m is erupted magma mass in (kg). All eruptions reached magnitudes of M C 4. Figure 2a, b show that eruption magnitudes are fairly uniformly distributed across the 200 ka age range and that the frequency of explosive eruptions generally decreases with higher magnitude, respectively.\nFor 36 tephras (marked in Table 1), isopleths maps of maximum grain size have been constructed, which allows to measure the cross-wind and down-wind dispersal of clasts of a given size; comparing these data with eruption column modeling results of Carey and Sparks (1986) allows to estimate paleo-maximum eruption column heights (Fig. 3). While these estimates are subject to errors arising from both field measurements of largest clasts at any locality and assumptions in the Carey and Sparks (1986) model used here (an empirical method for\nquantifying how the maximum clast size dispersal is determined by column height and wind strength), they are sufficiently accurate to verify that tropical volcanic SO2 injections reached well into the stratosphere ([15 km).\nWe have performed petrologic analyses on 36 tephras originating from 14 volcanic complexes (marked in\nTable 1).

Glass analyses can only determine the concentration of\ndissolved sulfur. An exsolved sulfurous fluid already coexisting with the melt in the magma chamber cannot be identified by this method, but may be a major source of total sulfur emission during the eruption. Comparison of sulfur contents between primitive and evolved magmas in principle allows one to estimate the maximum total sulfur emission from an evolved magma chamber, but it remains highly uncertain how much of that sulfur was actually emitted during the Plinian eruption rather than by quiescent degassing\nT a\nb le\n1 V\no lc\nan ic\ner u\np ti\no n\ns o\nrd er\ned b\ny ag\ne (k\na) fo\nr th\ne la\nst 2\n0 0\nk a;\nth e\nac co\nrd in\ng m\nax .\ner u\np ti\no n\nco lu\nm n\nh ei\ng h\nt (k\nm ),\nte p\nh ra\nv o\nlu m\ne (k\nm 3 ),\nm ag\nm a\nm as\ns (k\ng ),\nm ag\nn it\nu d\ne, th\ne D\nsu lf\nu r\n(m ax\n.)\n(p p\nm ),\nth e\nm ax\n. su\nlf u\nr re\nle as\ne (k\ng ),\nan d\nth e\nre le\nas ed\nS O\n2 (M\nt)\nT ep\nh ra\nA cr\no n\ny m\nA g\ne (k a)\nM ax\n. er\nu p\nti o\nn co\nlu m\nn\nh ei\ng h\nt (k\nm )\nT ep\nh ra\nv o\nlu m\ne\n(k m\n3 )\nM ag\nm a\nm as\ns\n(k g\n)\nM ag\nn it\nu d\ne D\nS u\nlf u\nr (m\nax )\n(p p\nm )\nM ax\n. su\nlf u\nr\nre le\nas e\n(k g\n)\nS O\n2 (M t)\nS a\nn ta\nM a\nri a\n(G U\nA )\nS M\nT 0\n.1 3\n0 9\n.4 6\n.6 5\nE 1\n1 2\n5 .8\n2 2\n3 1\n1 .5\n3 E\n1 0\n9 3\n.0 7\nC o\nsi q\nü in\na (N\nC A\n) 1\n8 3\n5 0\n.1 7\n2 5\n2 .9\n1 .1\n5 E\n1 1\n2 5\n.0 6\n2 7\n8 3\n.1 9\nE 1\n0 8\n0 .6\n4\nT er\nra B\nla n\nca J\no v en (E S A /S L V )\nT B\nJ 1\n.5 5\n3 1\n8 4\n8 .1\n5 E\n1 1\n3 6\n.9 1\n9 6\n7 .8\n3 E\n1 0\n9 1\n5 .6\n5\nM a\nsa y\na T\nu ff\n(N C\nA )\nM T\n1 .8\n2 1\n6 .6\n1 4\n.9 3\nE 1\n1 2\n5 .6\n9 9\n5 0\n4 .6\n9 E\n1 0\n9 9\n.3 6\nC h\nil te\np e\nP u\nm ic\ne (N\nC A\n) C\nT 1\n.9 3\n9 1\n7 .8\n9 2\n.1 8\nE 1\n1 3\n6 .3\n4 8\n1 2\n1 .7\n7 E\n1 1\n0 3\n5 .3\n3\nM a\nsa y\na T\nri p\nle L\na y er (N C A\n) M\nT L\n2 .1\n2 5\n3 .4\n3 4\n.7 7\nE 1\n1 2\n5 .6\n8 6\n8 7\n3 .2\n7 E\n1 0\n9 6\n.5 4\nL o\ns C\ned ro\ns C\nd T\n3 1\n5 1\n2 .0\n5 E\n?

Melt inclusions may have lost volatiles during or after\neruption. However, we only use concentration data from melt inclusions without vesicles or petrographic evidence of cracking, and we use the maximum concentration for each sample to represent the dissolved sulfur in the reservoir melt. 3. Assimilation of sulfur-rich country rocks by the\nmagma can potentially increase the eruptive sulfur emission, but there is no geographical, geochemical, or petrographic evidence for such assimilation in the volcanic rocks studied here.\nTable 1 summarizes the data from 561 melt inclusion and 431 matrix glass measurements from the 36 tephras analyzed. Column 8 of Table 1 shows the difference between maximum analyzed sulfur concentration in melt inclusions to minimum concentration in matrix glass that is used to estimate the emitted sulfur masses (column 9) recalculated to emitted mass SO2 in column 10.\nSince magmatic sulfur concentrations typically vary over an order of magnitude, but erupted magma masses vary over several orders of magnitude, emitted masses of SO2 generally increase with eruption magnitude (Fig. 4). A regression through our data yields SO2 (Mt) = 1.3 9 10-5e2.16M, with M equal to the magnitude of the eruption; the variation around the regression for any given magnitude covers one order of magnitude in SO2 emission. Pyle et al. (1996) have used satellite data to correlate SO2 emissions with eruption magnitudes and obtained a relationship qualitatively similar to ours. Their function, originally reported in terms of log10 (SO2) (Mt), can be rewritten as SO2 (Mt) = 6.2 9 10 -4e1.72M. Comparison of our regression to that of Pyle et al. (1996) in Fig. 4 shows that their function lies along the upper bound of our data. This likely is indicative of the potential underestimation of SO2 emissions by the petrologic method although we emphasize that the extent of underestimation varies for each specific eruption.\nVolcanic forcing from CAVA eruptions\nIn this section, the volcanic radiative forcing from Plinian eruptions is evaluated according to the two different methods described above (section ‘‘Volcanic radiative\nforcing’’). We create AOD and RF datasets using the SO2 emissions (section ‘‘CAVA sulfur emissions’’) derived via the petrologic method for 36 large CAVA eruptions (Table 2)."

    "text": "Using the relationships given by Eqs. 1, 4, and 5, the 17 Mt SO2 release (MD = 32.5 Mt) derived from satellite data for the Mt. Pinatubo 1991 eruption yields a maximum global mean AOD of 0.18. This is comparable to AVHRR measurements (Long and Stowe 1994) but up to 20 % higher than the maximum AOD included in the updated reconstructions of SAGE II measurements by Sato et al. (1993). However, it should be noted that SAGE II satellite observations of the peak AOD in the first months after the Pinatubo eruption are uncertain due to saturation effects (e.g., McCormick and Veiga 1992; see also section ‘‘MAECHAM5-HAM’’). The E-Fall eruption (51 ka) of the CAVA time series, with the petrologically derived *18 Mt SO2 release, results in a maximum global mean AOD estimate of 0.19 (column 6 of Table 2; Fig. 5, red bars). For the strongest eruption of the CAVA record, the Los Chocoyos eruption (84 ka) with a volcanic explosivity index of VEI = 7 and a magnitude M = 7.9, a maximum global mean AOD of *2.4 is calculated based on 1,313 Mt MD (1,050 Mt MSL) or 687 Mt SO2 injection (Table 2). Using Eq. 4 to calculate the maximum global mean AOD from the petrologically constrained 300–600 Mt H2SO4 release of the 74 ka Toba eruption (Chesner and Luhr 2010), we accordingly derive an AOD of 1.01–1.62 for\nToba that is 58–32 % smaller than for the Los Chocoyos eruption. For Santa Maria (1902), the most recent eruption in the CAVA time series, we obtain a maximum global mean AOD of *0.04. This is significantly smaller than values obtained for the time period around 1902 by either atmospheric measurements (Sato et al. 1993; Stothers 1996; Crowley 2000) or based on analysis of Greenland ice cores (Zielinski 1995), which may reflect the underestimation by the petrologic method. However, this may also be due to the fact that between May and October 1902 in addition to Santa Maria, two other volcanic eruptions occurred in the tropics (Soufrière and Mt. Pelée in the Caribbean) (Stothers 1996), simultaneously impacting the atmosphere and glacial ice sheets.\nWe calculated the maximum RF (Table 2, column 6) based on the maximum global mean AOD values described above and Eq. 5 (section ‘‘Simple parametrized approximation’’). For example, RF for the Santa Maria (0.1 ka) and E-Fall (51 ka) eruption are estimated as -0.94 and -4.47 W/m2, respectively. The largest RF is found for the Los Chocoyos (84 ka) eruption, with maximum RF estimated as -56.89 W/m2 (Fig. 5, blue bars)."

    "text": "We show results from seven simulations of a subset of the available CAVA eruption time series, made up of volcanic eruptions that (1) have estimated maximum column heights higher than 30 hPa (Fig. 3; Table 2) and (2) roughly evenly span the range of magnitudes and SO2 emissions (Fig. 2a; Table 3) found in the CAVA dataset. In order to fill in the gap in SO2 injection magnitudes between the Los Chocoyos (LCY) and Upper Apoyo (UAT) eruptions (Table 3), we include a hypothetical eruption with a SO2 injection of 170 Mt [approximately 10 times the SO2 injection for the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption (Guo 2004)].\nFigure 6 shows simulated maximum global/monthly mean AOD, which occurs approximately 3–6 months after the eruption (Toohey et al. 2011), versus the stratospheric SO2 injection used in each experiment. Also shown is the relationship from Eq. 4 for the maximum global mean AODs derived through the parametrized method described above (red line). In close agreement with Hyde and Crowley (2000), the model results show a notable change in slope in the AOD to SO2 relationship somewhere between 4 and 10 Mt SO2 release. A power law fit (not shown) for the eruptions of magnitudes less than 4.9 Mt finds that AOD scales with the SO2 injection to the power of 1.06, while a similar fit for eruptions with SO2 injections greater than or equal to 4.9 Mt leads to a relationship scaling to the power of 0.67. These values agree well with the linear (power 1) and nonlinear (power 2/3) relationships suggested by Hyde and Crowley (2000) and used in\nEqs. 3 and 4, reflecting the self-limiting effects of very large volcanic eruptions. Large volcanic eruptions have a smaller optical depth per unit mass than smaller ones (Pinto et al. 1989; Timmreck et al. 2009). Their larger aerosols also fall out of the stratosphere much faster as smaller particles, thereby reducing the stratosphere lifetime of the volcanic cloud. Both processes that influence the volcanic\nclimate impact suggest that volcanic effects may be selflimiting (Pinto et al. 1989).\nThe resulting annual mean model-based RF as well as the parametrized RF is listed in Table 3 for the first 3 years after the eruption.\nIn our simulations described above, the maximum effective radii at 50 hPa range from 0.20 lm for an SO2\nTable 2 Volcanic eruptions ordered by age (ka) for the last 200 ka\nAcronym Age (ka) SO2 (Mt) Max stratospheric\nloading MSL (Mt)\nMax. total stratospheric loading MD (Mt)\nMax. stratospheric optical depth sD\nRadiative forcing DFnet (W/m 2)\nSMT* 0.1 3.07 4.70 5.87 0.039 -0.94\n1835 0.17 0.64 0.98 1.22 0.008 -0.20\nTBJ 1.55 15.65 23.94 29.93 0.165 -3.96\nMT 1.8 9.36 14.32 17.90 0.109 -2.61\nCT 1.9 35.33 54.05 67.57 0.304 -7.29\nMTL 2.1 6.54 10.01 12.51 0.080 -1.91\nRBT 3.5 1.75 2.68 3.35 0.022 -0.54\nMAT 4 2.36 3.61 4.51 0.030 -0.72\nSAT 6 43.74 66.92 83.65 0.355 -8.51\nXT 6.1 0.46 0.70 0.88 0.006 -0.14\nLHP 10 0.36 0.55 0.69 0.005 -0.11\nUAQ* 12.4 1.46 2.23 2.79 0.019 -0.45\nUCT 15 1.29 1.97 2.47 0.017 -0.39\nLAQ 17 1.99 3.04 3.81 0.025 -0.61\nUOT 19 4.30 6.58 8.22 0.053 -1.28\nLCT 20 0.75 1.15 1.43 0.010 -0.23\nPAT 23 2.01 3.08 3.84 0.026 -0.62\nUAT* 24.5 44.56 68.18 85.22 0.359 -8.62\nLAT 24.8 2.15 3.29 4.11 0.028 -0.66\nTB4 36 7.15 10.94 13.67 0.086 -2.07\nMXT 39 1.70 2.60 3.25 0.022 -0.52\nIFT* 40 0.42 0.64 0.80 0.005 -0.13\nPY1 50 0.19 0.29 0.36 0.002 -0.06\nCFT 50 0.35 0.54 0.67 0.004 -0.11\nCCT 51 4.1 6.27 7.84 0.051 -1.22\nEFT* 51 18.35 28.08 35.09 0.186 -4.47\nCGT 53 39.71 60.76 75.95 0.331 -7.94\nFT 60 2.88 4.41 5.51 0.037 -0.88\nTTA 61 3.92 6.00 7.50 0.050 -1.20\nUT 70 0.21 0.32 0.40 0.003 -0.06\nACT 72 19.41 29.70 37.12 0.195 -4.67\nBRT 75 2.36 3.61 4.51 0.030 -0.72\nLCY* 84 686.59 1,050.48 1,313.10 2.370 -56.89\nTFT 119 49.54 75.80 94.75 0.388 -9.30\nWFT 158 14.81 22.66 28.32 0.158 -3.79\nLFT 191 46.78 71.57 89.47 0.372 -8.93\nIncluded are further the estimates of SO2 release (Mt), maximum stratospheric loading (MSL in Mt), maximum total stratospheric loading (MD in Mt) as well as the resulting maximum stratospheric optical depth (sD) and the radiative forcing (W/m 2). Stars indicate the selected eruptions taken for the volcanic climate modeling\nemission of 0.42 Mt to 1.17 lm for an SO2 emission of 686.59 Mt. Thus, for the very large eruptions C170 Mt (our hypothetical volcanic eruption) and maximum effective radii in the range of 1 lm, we are, in the range at the upper boundary for Eq. 5, using to calculate the RF (section ‘‘Simple parametrized approximation’’).\nClimate response to the CAVA eruptions\nTo derive the climate response to the CAVA eruptions of different strength, we carried out CLIMBER-2 simulations with varying stratospheric sulfur injections to compare the evaluated SO2 to AOD relationship (section ‘‘Simple parametrized approximation—results,’’ Fig. 6).\nIn Fig. 7, the maximum global/annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies according to the stratospheric SO2 mass injection are shown for the CLIMBER-2 simulations forced with parametrized RF (open red circles) and with model-based RF (blue crosses). The maximum cooling occurs within the second year after the eruption. Similar to\nthe SO2 to AOD relationship, Fig. 7 shows a linear increase in negative SAT anomalies with increasing SO2 injection for the smaller volcanic eruptions but a deviation from linearity for the large eruptions. The E-Fall eruption with 18 Mt SO2 release yields by using the model-based and parametrized RF global/annual mean maximum cooling of 0.38 and 0.24 K, respectively, in qualitative good agreement with the volcanically induced maximum temperature anomalies analyzed for the first year after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption (*17 Mt) by Thompson et al. (2009). Further, this global cooling after the E-Fall eruption lasts up to 7 and 5 years (Fig. 8) (depending on which RF is used, the modelbased or the parametrized), which also appears consistent with the relaxation of post-Pinatubo temperature anomalies as shown in Figure 7 of Thompson et al. (2009). This comparison between climatic effects as modeled for the E-fall and observed for Pinatubo, eruptions that had comparable SO2 injections, demonstrates that CLIMBER-2 is able to simulate the global climate temperature response in agreement with observational and more complex model studies (e.g., Thompson et al. 2009; Stenchikov et al. 2009). Especially for the largest CAVA eruption, the climate response seems to follow a nonlinear relation (Fig. 7). The model simulations show a global/annual mean SAT reduction maximizing in the second year after the eruption up to 2.1 K for the model-based RF compared with 3.1 K for the parametrized RF, and a climate effect lasting up to 9–18 times longer relative to the Pinatubo comparable EFT eruption, that is, 61–91 years (Fig. 8). Regarding the very low internal variability in CLIMBER-2, the absolute values given for duration of climate disturbance can be considered as an upper limit of possible climate impact. For the 3 Mt SO2 injection into the stratosphere by the eruption of Santa Maria in October 1902, the model simulates a global/annual mean SAT decrease of about 0.08 and 0.05 K up to 2 and 1 years, again derived with the model-based and parametrized RF, respectively. This simulated cooling contributes\nto the observed temperature drop of up to 0.2 K in the years following 1902 due to a series of three tropical volcanic eruptions between May and October 1902: two in the Caribbean and one in Guatemala (Thompson et al. 2009). The temperature responses for the two smallest eruptions of the I-Tephra (IFT) and the Upper Apoyeque Pumice (UAQ)\nonly last for up to one year and are therefore not included in Fig. 8.\nIn Figs. 7 and 8, the temperature response according to the used RF seems to be switched between the smaller and the two largest volcanic SO2 injections. For the smaller eruptions, it appears that with the parametrized RF, the temperature response is smaller in comparison with the simulation with the model-based RF. For the two largest selected volcanic eruptions, CLIMBER-2 simulates a larger negative SAT anomaly and longer lasting SAT signal with the parametrized RF than with the MAECHAM5-HAM model-based RF. Because of the similarity in the magnitude of maximum AOD used by both methods (Fig. 6), these differences result from the different time evolution of the RF. Thus, the comparison of both model experiments can provide an estimate of error introduced by using a parametrized time evolution (linear increase/exponential decay assumption) for volcanic simulations (Ammann et al. 2003; Gao et al. 2008). In Table 3, the RF obtained by both methods is compared. RF values are larger for the 1st year after all eruptions due to a shorter linear increase for the model-based RF (not shown here). The varying e-folding timescales for the model-based RF (not shown here) after reaching their maximum (Table 2) is apparent by the different annual mean RF for the model-based and parametrized RF in the 2nd and 3rd year after the eruption (Table 3). These different timescales result from the fact that only the model-based RF considers the longer atmospheric lifetime of the smaller aerosol particles compared\nwith the larger ones. Thus, the different SAT responses for smaller and larger volcanic eruptions simulated with the parametrized RF in comparison with the model-based RF can be explained by these varying lifetime evolutions.\nThe duration of a climate disturbance for any given CAVA eruption magnitude remains significantly shorter than the recurrence time of a volcanic eruption of that magnitude, as estimated using our SO2 fit from Fig. 4 and applying the global magnitude–frequency relationship from Deligne et al. (2010) (Fig. 8). Thus, a cumulative climate effect of successive eruptions seems unlikely. Moreover, only for very large eruptions (SO2 C 40 Mt; M C 6), the predicted duration of climate disturbance is longer (10–90 years) than the typical turnover time of the stratosphere (1–6 years; Waugh and Hall 2002). These extreme eruptions occur only very rarely, about every hundreds to thousands years (this study, Deligne et al. 2010). However, they can cluster, as was observed during the early nineteenth century with the eruption of the unknown tropical volcano in 1809 and the Tambora 1815 eruptions, which together led to the coldest decade of the last millennium (Cole-Dai et al. 2009). Most recently in the model study by Miller et al. (2012), the role of the most volcanically perturbed thirteenth century in triggering the little ice age was investigated."

    "text": "We use a new volcanic dataset of erupted magma and SO2 masses of detected Plinian eruptions (M C 4) that occurred along the Central American Volcanic Arc during the past 200 ka to estimate the aerosol optical depth, radiative forcing, and climate impacts of these eruptions.\nErupted magma masses determined by mapping of the volcanic deposits (Kutterolf et al. 2008) and analyses of sulfur concentrations analyzed in melt inclusions and matrix glasses (this study) constrain the minimum masses of SO2 emitted by 36 out of 92 recorded highly explosive eruptions at the CAVA, which had reached stratospheric eruption column heights as deduced from clast dispersal patterns. The estimated SO2 mass emissions of these eruptions range from 0.19 to 687 Mt, which are minimum estimates, because the petrologic method used here cannot capture sulfurous fluids that may have coexisted with the magmas. The extent of potential underestimation is illustrated by comparing the variation of SO2 emissions with eruption magnitudes as obtained here by the petrologic method with the results of Pyle et al. (1996) using satellite measurements of historic eruptions; for individual eruptions, the difference in SO2 emission ranges from zero up to an order of magnitude.\nA critical step in addressing possible climate impacts is the conversion of volcanic SO2 emissions into AOD and RF. We used a complex atmosphere-microphysical model to evaluate existing relationships. This had the advantage of accounting for the evolution of the sulfate aerosol size, which depends on the strength of the eruption, and has an influence on the radiative impact of the aerosol. Our results show that the maximum global mean AOD can be derived from emitted SO2 mass by a linear function as long as the SO2 emission is\\5 Mt, whereas a nonlinear (power of 2/3) relationship has to be used for larger volcanic SO2 emissions. These verified functions can be applied to calculate maximum global mean AOD and RF from the sulfate aerosol mass estimates, whether these are derived from petrologic analysis, ice core analysis, or atmospheric measurements.\nThe climate impact resulting from either RF estimated through the simple parametrized approximation or as modeled by MAECHAM5-HAM is calculated with an earth system model of intermediate complexity for selected CAVA eruptions spanning the full range of estimated CAVA sulfur emissions. For simulations using the parametrized RF, we find an almost linear relationship between emitted SO2 mass and global/annual mean surface cooling, which ranges from -0.05 K for a smaller eruption (Santa Maria) up to -3.1 K for an extremely large eruption (Los Chocoyos). For the same eruptions but using the modeled RF, the surface temperature reduction varies between -0.08 and -2.1 K. The values of these modelbased RF simulations are in the range of observed volcanic climate impacts, for example, for the Pinatubo eruption. For the smallest eruptions, the model simulates a climate impact lasting up to 1 year for the model-based RF and even \\1 year for the parametrized RF. For the largest eruption of the CAVA time series, Los Chocoyos, the model simulates a climate impact lasting up to 60 years for the model-based RF and 90 years for the parametrized RF. Relative to an eruption comparable to Pinatubo size, the climate disturbance after Los Chocoyos lasts 9–18 times longer. Comparing simulations forced by RF time series from our two construction methods, we find that the modelbased RF leads to a larger magnitude and longer duration of the surface air temperature anomaly for the smaller volcanic eruptions compared with the simulations forced with the parametrized RF, and vice versa for the large eruptions. These differences arise because only the modelbased RF explicitly accounts for the variable aerosol lifetime as a function of aerosol particle size. In particular, with the modeled RF, CLIMBER-2 is able to simulate the climate response in agreement with observations and other studies. This shows that not only the maximum RF itself is important but also the temporal evolution of the RF to\nsimulate a realistic climate response after volcanic eruptions. The duration of a climate disturbance for any given CAVA eruption magnitude remains significantly shorter than the recurrence time of a volcanic eruption of that magnitude; thus, a cumulative climate effect of successive eruptions seems unlikely. Moreover, only for very large eruptions (SO2 C 40 Mt; M C 6), the predicted duration of climate disturbance is longer (10–90 years) than the typical turnover time of the stratosphere (1–6 years). These extreme eruptions occur only very rarely, about every hundreds to thousands years. However, they can cluster, as was observed during the early nineteenth century with the eruption of the unknown tropical volcano in 1809 and the Tambora 1815 eruptions.\nUpcoming model studies will investigate the Southern Hemisphere climate impact of the CAVA time series and in particular the effect of the largest eruption of the record, Los Chocoyos, with the global aerosol climate model and a complex earth system model, in more detail.\nFuture studies of volcanic impact on climate can make use of our verified relationships between SO2 emission, volcanic forcing, and climate response, having the advantage to also taking a more complex (nonlinear) volcanic forcing into account. The unique subset of volcanic time series of the CAVA can be employed for upcoming paleo-climate studies to address the climate effects of volcanism in the long-term past over the last interglacial and glacial periods.\nAcknowledgments This publication is contribution no. 204 of the Sonderforschungsbereich 574 ‘‘Volatiles and Fluids in Subduction Zones’’ at Kiel University.

  "abstractText": "We present for the first time a self-consistent methodology connecting volcanological field data to global climate model estimates for a regional time series of explosive volcanic events. Using the petrologic method, we estimated SO2 emissions from 36 detected Plinian volcanic eruptions occurring at the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) during the past 200,000 years. Together with simple parametrized relationships collected from past studies, we derive estimates of global maximum volcanic aerosol optical depth (AOD) and radiative forcing (RF) describing the effect of each eruption on radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. In parallel, AOD and RF time series for selected CAVA eruptions are simulated with the global aerosol model MAECHAM5-HAM, which shows a relationship between stratospheric SO2 injection and maximum global mean AOD that is linear for smaller volcanic eruptions (\\5 Mt SO2) and nonlinear for larger ones (C5 Mt SO2) and is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the relationship used in the simple parametrized approximation. Potential climate impacts of the selected CAVA eruptions are estimated using an earth system model of intermediate complexity by RF time series derived by (1) directly from the global aerosol model and (2) from the simple parametrized approximation assuming a 12-month exponential decay of global AOD. We find that while the maximum AOD and RF values are consistent between the two methods, their temporal evolutions are significantly different. As a result, simulated global maximum temperature anomalies and the duration of the temperature response depend on which RF time series is used, varying between 2 and 3 K and 60 and 90 years for the largest eruption of the CAVA dataset. Comparing the recurrence time of eruptions, based on the CAVA dataset, with the duration of climate impacts, based on the model results, we conclude that cumulative impacts due to successive eruptions are unlikely. The methodology and results presented here can be used to calculate approximate volcanic forcings and potential climate impacts from sulfur emissions, sulfate aerosol or AOD data for any eruption that injects sulfur into the tropical stratosphere.",
