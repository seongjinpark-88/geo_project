    "text": "Of late discovery (Keller et al. 2009a; Khosala et al. 2009) of brackish water ostrocod and planktonic foraminifera fossils from Jhilmili intertrappean bed (~13 m thick succession, located in the eastern periphery of the Deccan volcanic province) attracted attention of several workers as it discusses precise age that corresponds to the K-T transition and marine incursion in this area. Acceptance of continental flood basalt as the main cause of K/T mass extinction is\nlagging as no connection between these two events could be recognized. However, for Jhilmili (Madhya Pradesh) and Rajahmundry (Andhra Pradesh) sections, Keller et al. (2008, 2009a,b) have established a direct link between the main phase of Deccan volcanism and the K/T mass extinctions. These assumptions were exclusively based on the first report of planktic foraminifera that suffered the most devastating mass extinction globally. In the intertrappean succession of the Jhilmili area, early Danian and P1a zones were marked\n0016-7622/2013-82-1-38/$ 1.00 © GEOL. SOC. INDIA\nJOUR.GEOL.SOC.INDIA, VOL.82, JULY 2013\nby the planktic foraminifera assemblages (Cited Figure.6; Keller et al. 2009a) incidental to K/T boundary at or near the end of the lower trap basalt eruption - correlated with the end phase of the Deccan volcanic activity as it was recognized over the top of the Ambenali Formation (Cited Figure.2; Jay and Widdowson, 2008). Whatever may be the cause of K/T mass extinction, it has affected biosphere and induced global environmental changes (Self et al. 2006). However, absolute age and duration of the Deccan volcanism and its genetic link with the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary still remains uncertain. In this context, detrital clays (0.2-2 µm fraction) associated with the intertrappean bed assume significance. However, very limited work has so far been attempted on it. More recently, Keller et al. (2009a) have studied bulk composition of various litho-units of the Jhilmili intertrappean, comprising 12-78% phyllosilicates, chiefly composed of smectite, illite and palygorskite suggestive of the existence of contemporaneous semi-arid climatic conditions. Based on the occurrence of palygorskite clays, they presume marine incursion, linked to the K/T transition. Main objective of the present work is to study the mineralogical and chemical attributes of the clays from the Jhilmili intertrappean succession and to compare them with the other clays associated with the infra (Lametas) - /inter-trappeans, bole beds of the eastern and Ir bearing Anjar intertrappean succession of the western Deccan volcanic province to understand palaeoenvironmental changes that occurred during K/T boundary transition."

    "text": "The Jhilmili intertrappean bed (Fig. 1) is located near the village of Jhilmili (22°02'44\" N, 79°09'34\" E) in the Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh. It represents freshly exposed rock surfaces, discontinuities and undulating contacts. Based on physical attributes, lithological contacts marked across the succession (Fig.2), five physically distinct litho-units are recognized such as (a) lowermost chocolate brown siltstone with green patches, (b) brick red clayey siltstone, (c) greenish grey clay, (d) yellowish brown clay and (e) uppermost olive grey to dark brown silt layers. Samples collected from these units were marked over the litho-log (Fig. 2). Approximately, 500 gm material is collected by digging fresh surfaces using hallow steel pipe to avoid contamination\nPrior to geochemical analysis, clay (0.2-2.0 µm) fractions for XRD analyses were separated out from each of the bulk samples using procedure discussed by Jha et al. (2012) which involves disaggregating each sample in the\ndistilled water, then treated with 1N HCl (to dissolve and minimize carbonates) and thoroughly cleaned by centrifugation and finally suspension was removed. The clay fraction was separated out after specified time intervals (based on the settling velocity of particles) following the dispersion-centrifugation-decantation procedure (Jackson, 1985; Larid and Nater, 1993) and dried in the oven. Oriented clay mounts (Drever, 1973) were also prepared simultaneously. Oriented as well as randomly oriented mounts prepared over glass slides were scanned using a computer controlled X-ray diffractometer (Bruker Make; Model - D8) with Cu Ká radiations at an adopted scanning speed of 1°/min and obtained diffraction patterns (Fig.1). Glycol solvated slides were also prepared by treating these mounts in the ambiance of ethylene glycol vapour at 60ºC for 24 hours and scanned (Fig.1) under similar experimental conditions. Internal standard technique (Shordon et al. 2001) was used for the quantitative determination of clay minerals and results obtained are within an error of < 5 wt %.\nGold coated clay specimens were prepared for scanning electron microscopic (SEM) study. These specimens were scanned (from 1000 X - 5000 KX magnifications) under the SEM (Zeiss Make; Model EVO MA -15) and back scattered electron (BSE) images (Fig.2) were obtained to understand morphological characters of the clay minerals. To determine major oxide compositions, the clay minerals from Jhilmili area were coated with a thin layer of carbon and analyses of these specimens were done using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer [(EDS) (Oxford Make; Model-Inca X-Act)] in a window mode and data presented in Table.3.\nMajor (Table 2) and trace (Table 3) element analyses were done using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at Activation Laboratory, Canada. For major and trace elemental analysis, air dried, 0.25 gm of powdered (-220 mesh, ASTM) clay (0.2-2.0 µm fraction) samples were placed in the FEPTeflon beakers. Each sample was moistened with few drops of water and concentrated acids of 7 ml of HF, 3 ml of HNO3 and 1 ml of M HClO4 were added for analysis. Each beaker was swirled until the sample was completely wetted and then covered with a lid and kept overnight after adding 1 ml each of 10 µg/ml Rh and Bi as internal standards. The beakers were heated at 200ºC for an hour, after which the lids were removed and the contents were evaporated almost to dryness. Further 3ml of concentrated acids of HF and 1 ml HClO4 were added to each sample and evaporation was repeated. The contents were finally dissolved using 10 ml of 1:1 volume of HNO3 and water and the volume was increased to 100 ml by\nJOUR.GEOL.SOC.INDIA, VOL.82, JULY 2013\nadding water. Solutions of various internal rock standards were also prepared and analyzed during the same period. The standard deviation (1σ) and uncertainty between the results and recommended values were calculated for all the data determined using standards (GXR-1, WMG-1, DNC-1, BIR-1, GXR-2, LKSD-3, MAG-1, W-2a and CTAAC-1).The values of REE and other elements of SRMGBW07304 (GSD-4), for quality control of the data, agreed well with the recommended values within the tolerance\nlimits. The δCe and δEu anomalies were calculated based on the formulae δCe = CeN/(LaN x PrN)\n0.5 and δEu = EuN/ (SmN x GdN)\n0.5, respectively, where δCe and δEu were obtained by linear interpolation between Post Archean Average Australian Sedimentary (PAAS) rocks (Taylor and McLennan, 1988) normalized La, Pr, and Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm and Yb abundances (Hongbing et al. 2000). La/Yb ratios were also calculated as (La/Yb)N = LaN/YbN (Table 3).\nFig.1.

    "text": "X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig.1) of the clay (0.2- 2.0 µm fraction) smears show predominance of montmorillonite in units 2, 3, 5 and 6 as identified by its 001 reflection in the range of 18.03-18.40 Å (Weaver, 1989). Presence of montmorillonite is further confirmed by glycolation test in which it absorbs ethylene glycol, causing expansion in its basal spacing - ethylene glycol solvated diffraction patterns show sharpening of the peaks and characteristic shift in 17.67-21.55 Å regions (Weaver, 1989). Illite is manifested by 006 reflections in the region of 3.3 Å (Tucker, 1988) in units 5 and 6. The variation in the position of basal reflections is attributed to the number of water layers and the nature of cations present in the inter-lamellar spaces between octahedron and tetrahedron sheets of the montmorillonite structure (Brown, 1961). Montmorillonite/ chlorite (M/C) mixed layer is identified by its characteristics basal 020 reflections in the region of 4.50-4.55 Å in units 2 and 3. Palygorskite is identified by its 110 reflections at 10.40 Å in unit-4. Thus, the XRD data revealed predominance of montmorillonite throughout this succession (including lowermost chocolate brown siltstone with green patches, brick red clayey siltstone, greenish grey clay, yellowish brown clay and uppermost dark brown clay and silt layers), but sub-ordinate amount of palygorskite in lithounit 4 (sample JM 3) and it also contains little amount of\nmontmorillonite/chlorite (M/C) mixed layer. Very low amount of quartz and feldspar is also present and identified by their weak reflections at 3.36 Å and 2.3 Å, respectively. Presence of M/C mixed layers along with the montmorillonite reflects their derivation from the montmorillonite (Weaver, 1989), although montmorillonite is the predominant clay mineral throughout the sequence. When Mg content in volcanic ash is low, halloysite is formed, otherwise montmorillonite is developed (Weaver, 1989). The temporal appearance of palygorskite in litho-unit-4 (sample JM 3) is indicative of existence of semi-arid or arid conditions during their transformations, where water is drawn to the surface (by capillary) action and evaporated (Singer, 1989; Bellanca, 1992).\nMineralogical studies (Ahmad and Shrivastava, 2008) on detrital clays of the bole horizons from the eastern Deccan volcanic province show dominance of montmorillonite in almost all the seven groups (montmorillonite predominant, montmorillonite with sub-ordinate amount of halloysite, montmorillonite<halloysite, montmorillonite+I/S+other mineral phases, montmorillonite+C/S+other mineral phases, kaolinite ±montmorillonite and palygorskite predominant). Salil et al. (1997) have established dominance of montmorillonite with sub-ordinate amount of chlorite, illite and kaolinite in the Maastritchtian Lameta and intertrappean sediments as well as weathered Deccan basalt from the eastern Deccan volcanic province. However, palygorskite\nFig.2.

Thus, clay mineral assemblages found in the Jhilmili intertrappean largely corresponds to the mineral assemblages which are\nJOUR.GEOL.SOC.INDIA, VOL.82, JULY 2013\noriented, fibrous palygorskite grains were observed only in specimen JM3 of unit 4. It also shows lamellar sheets of montmorillonite/chlorite mixed layer. These clay minerals were analyzed for their major oxide contents (Table 2). Bulk compositions with respect to clay (0.2-2.0 µm) fraction as well as mineral chemistry data for individual clay minerals (Table 1) form the basis on which structural formulae were calculated and presented in Table 4. In the present study, TiO2 and MnO values were excluded from the major oxide data as Ti4+ and Mn2+ values obtained in the chemical analysis of smectite is the representative of crypto-crystalline rutile and manganese oxide, respectively (Weaver and\nPollard, 1973). The weight percentages of the major oxides after corrections were normalized to 100% for structural formulae calculations. Using the procedure discussed by Bain and Smith (1987), structural formulae of clay minerals were calculated from major oxide data on half unit cell basis, consisting of 22 negative charges (i.e. O10 (OH)2). The FeO percentage required for structural formulae calculations was calculated from the Fe2O3 using the conversion factor (Ragland, 1989). The number of the cations occupying the octahedral sites of the studied smectites (Table 4) is moderately higher than the assigned (Weaver, 1989) values for the dioctahedral smectites. Structural considerations for\nFig.3.

Sample JM 3 from this data-set represents low values for octahedral occupancy (< 1.97), attributed to the fact that Fe2+ and Mg2+ cations replacing a portion of octahedral Al and generating net negative charge on the octahedral sheet.\nRansom and Helgeson (1993) in their studies on smectite solid solutions suggested that the compositional variation in non-stoichiometric smectites could be explained by defining their thermodynamic components (where the term thermodynamic component was used in its strict sense and corresponds to a chemical formula unit representing one of the minimum numbers of independent variables required to describe the composition of a mineral). The thermodynamic components accountable for the formation of smectites in the samples were calculated from their structural formulae, following the procedure discussed by Ransom and Helgeson (1993). This way, nine generic thermodynamic components responsible for smectite solid solutions were recast into actual thermodynamic components of smectites in the samples (Table 5). Smectites form solid solutions within the compositional end members of Al- smectite, Mg-smectite and celadonite and the compositional plane of smectite formed of these end members (Fig.4) is defined by the equation:\n25 = 2 Zo + Zt – Ooc., .(1)\nwhere, Zo = octahedral charge, Zt = tetrahedral charge and Ooc = total number of cations in the octahedral region.\nThe sum of total charges and cation occupancies is less than 25 for all the samples, thus satisfy equation (1), indicating that the sample compositions are well within the compositional limits of the smectite solid solution. Present clay mineral study shows that the data plots for the smectite phases of montmorillonite predominant clays lie within the smectite/illite mixed layer field, when plotted over ternary AR2 3+Si3O10(OH)2 - R2 3+SiO4O10(OH)2 - A3AlSi4O10(OH)2\nFig.4.

    "text": "It is assumed that the clay sediments associated with the intertrappeans/bole beds were derived from the alteration of Deccan basalt protolith, so the amount of conversion of feldspars (which dominate the upper crust) in to clays\n(Nesbitt and Young, 1984; Fedo et al. 1995) is related to the extent of weathering. Thus, based on major oxides data (Table 2), Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) were calculated, using formulae discussed by Sheldon (2005). Owing to the presence of high amount of Ca-plagioclase in these basalts, plagioclase index of alteration (PIA) was also calculated. These values were calculated for all the samples collected from the succession. As a reference, these parameters were compared with the CIA, CIW and PIA values of the underlying unaltered lava flows (protoliths) to assess the extent of weathering that each horizon has undergone (Table 1). The CIA, CIW and PIA values for the Jhimili intertrappean layers range between 12.35 - 57.15, 12.51 - 75.47 and 11.33 - 63.90, respectively. These values indicate that the lava flows suffered rigorous weathering. The extent of weathering is much higher than the underlying lava flows as they are very much obliterated and transformed into clays that necessitated a long interval of time or hiatus. Sheldon et al. (2006) have discussed a quantitative approach to compare precipitation regimes of modern soils with indices of chemical weathering, thus unitwise Chemical Index of Alteration of the Jhilmili intertappean is correlated with the mean annual palaeoprecipitation. The climatic variation is sensitive to short as well as long-term variation (138.59 - 1039.01 mm) in the rainfall. The two lowermost intertrappean layers such as unit 2 (lower chocolate brown siltstone with green patches - JM 1 sample) and unit 3(brick red clayey siltstone - JM 2 sample), represent semi-arid (468.50-583.80) climate. The brackish water ostrocod and planktonic foraminifera fossil (Keller et al. 2009) bearing greenish grey clay unit 4 (JM3 sample) shows very low palaeoprecepetation (138.59) and represents arid climatic conditions. But, again it is followed by wetter (1039.01) and semi arid (405.45) climatic conditions as represented by unit 5 (yellowish brown clay - JM4 sample) and unit 6 (uppermost dark brown clay and silt layers - JM5 sample) in the succession, respectively.

These cyclic changes in the climate coupled with the long-term mean annual precipitation together with the higher weathering indices of these layers (as compared to their parent basalt) suggest that the lava flows were exposed to the atmosphere for a longer period and suffered terrestrial weathering to a great extent. The association of palygorskite and smectite strongly supports the derivation of the former from the latter. It is inferred that the arid environment required for the development of palygorskite was induced by volcanism (e.g., Harris and van Couvering, 1995) as also supported by very less amount of palaeoprecipitation. Almost similar climatic changes were also assigned by Shrivastava et al. (2012) for the bole horizons that occur in the eastern Deccan volcanic province, thus suggesting more or less similar climatic conditions prevailed over spatially larger area."

    "heading": "TRACE ELEMENTS",
    "text": "Trace elemental abundance in the smectite predominant Jhilmili intertrappean succession shows wide variation (Fig.6) and weathering resulted in the depletion of majority of trace elements, thus leaving behind immobile elements, selectively adsorbed by the clays. Trace elements when plotted, their distribution patterns show - (i) strong leaching of Sr, (ii) moderate depletion in Ba and Ni with progressive increase in the weathering indices (iii) Zr, Cr and V remain in the system preferentially as these elements are immobile, but they are not associated with the clay fraction to a great extent. Chemical weathering under tropical conditions is capable of leaching elements such as K and Rb, but immobile elements such as Hf, Zr and Ti are preferentially retained in the clays (Zou et al. 2004). Hongbing et al. (2000) considered Ni and Cr as the most immobile elements amongst other trace elements, but it is unlikely for Jhilmili and Anjar areas. During strong leaching at the initial stage, Sr remains in the system and is not adsorbed by the clay fraction, but in progressive weathering its concentration gradually decreases and in the final product (i.e. laterite) its concentration becomes less. Ba and Sr values found in the montmorillonite of Jhilmili intertrappean are not high, although such clays possess high ion exchange capacity. Leaching experiments of Price et al. (1991) on basalts have demonstrated that Nb is the least mobile element, therefore, present Nb data (Table. 1) on clays show more or less nonvariable concentration levels throughout the succession. Leaching of a particular trace element is related to climate, water rock ratio, Eh and pH conditions under which chemical alteration has taken place. PAAS normalized average trace elemental concentrations of Jhilmili area\nwhen plotted over the fields of the Jabalpur infra-/intertrappeans, Anjar intertrappean and eastern Deccan Traps bole horizons (Fig.6), it is observed that the Jhilmili intertrappean trends are very much similar to that of the infra (Lametas)-/inter-trappeans (including Anjar intertrappean) and bole horizons of the eastern Deccan Traps. Perhaps, differential mobility of these elements in the weathering environment is accountable for its low order\nFig.6.

Data plots show almost constant release of Cu throughout the succession, thus, pointing towards more oxidizing conditions (Debra et al. 1992) as also found in case of Anjar area.\nPAAS-normalized (Taylor and Mclennan, 1988) REE data (Table 1) plots for Jhilmili intertrappean clays (Fig.7) show higher abundance of heavy rare earth elements (HREE) in comparison to light rare earth elements (LREE). They also show impoverishment in the middle rare earth elements,\nbut sample from unit-5 shows LREE enrichment. The LREE/ HREE ratio is high. Elements such as Eu and Ce are of great interest as they occur in different oxidation states and often show degree of fractionation relative to other rare earth elements. Clay samples have average δCe and δEu values of 2.15 and 1.65, respectively (Table 1). The Eu, Ce anomalies and La/Yb ratios of the samples when plotted against their stratigraphic positions in the Jhilmili intertrappean sequences (Fig.8), show distinctive breaks in their dispositions, reflecting variations in the water/rock ratios, Eh, pH conditions during the development of weathering profile. The Ce anomaly plots abruptly shows positive trend (close to sample JM4), whereas Eu trend is negative (Fig. 7), indicative of oxic condition prevalent during its formation. The positive Ce values found in this sequence are indicative of oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ which precipitates as an insoluble phase. Thus, Ce decouples from more soluble trivalent rare earth elements (Braun et al. 1990 and Marsh, 1991) and oxidized to Ce4+ which is possibly incorporated in the clay structure. There is no significant change in the La/Yb values from lower to upper units, suggestive of lesser degree of REE fractionation throughout the succession. These REE patterns for these smectite rich clays were compared with the other smectite rich clays associated with the bole horizons of the eastern Deccan volcanic province, Anjar intertrappean and infra (Lametas)/inter-trappeans. It has been found that the infra (Lametas) / inter-trappeans do not show such Ce anomalies, but Jhilmili intertrappean clays show relatively higher degree of REE fractionation (Fig. 7). Bole clays from eastern Deccan volcanic province represent HREE enrichment, but as such no positive Ce anomalies were identified from these boles. The REE patterns of the infra (Lametas) /inter-trappeans are sub-parallel with the weathered basalt, show enrichment of the LREE in relation to HREE (Salil et al. 1996). The REE patterns of the Lametas are conspicuous and show depletion of Ce and Eu. The significant change in Ce anomaly occurring in the middle part of the Jhilmili intertrappean succession is comparable to clays that form during the continental weathering of basaltic lava flows (Salil et al. 1997). Such variations are suggestive of drastic changes in the oxidizing conditions, as a result of shift in the terrestrial conditions."

The common association of montmorillonite with the palygorskite indicates that the former served as a source of Al and also some of the Si and Mg ions for the latter. When pH is lowered with the increase in the rainfall, palygorskite is desilicated and reverts back to montmorillonite (Weaver, 1989). Presence of palygorskite in association with montmorillonite suggests existence of arid climate during the formation of palygorskite in unit 5 of the Jhilmili succession. Thermodynamic data for clays associated with the Jhilmili intertrappean layers and Anjar intertrappean and Jabalpur infra (Lametas)-/inter-trappeans when plotted over ternary [AR2\n3+Si3O10(OH)2 - R2\n3+SiO4O10(OH)2 - A3AlSi4O10(OH)2] diagram (Ransom and Helgeson, 1993) the data plots in the smectite, illite, celadonite and mixed layer clay compositional fields (Fig. 6). It is observed that the Jhilmili samples lie within the I/S mixed layer and celadonite fields, whereas, Jabalpur infra-/inter-trappean samples confine to compositional fields represented by Al and Mg smectites, and celadonite end members. These observations suggest continental origin of the Jhilmili intertrappean clays as they show compositional commonality with that of the other clays,\nderived from the continental weathering of basalt protolith. Besides this, majority of the average trace elemental values for Jhilmili intertrappean clay plots (Fig. 6) lie within the upper and lower limits of infra (Lametas)-/inter-trappeans from Jabalpur area, bole horizons from eastern Deccan volcanic province and Anjar intertrappean clays, respectively. Weathering resulted in the depletion of majority of trace elements. The continuous release of Cu throughout the succession (mainly in the palygorskite dominated clays) indicates oxidizing conditions. Since, palygorskite is the characteristic clay mineral formed in the arid environment, it represents low REE values, implying that water/rock ratio seems to have played a significant role. Data between octahedral (Zo) vs. interlayer (Zt) charges, tetrahedral (Zt) vs. octahedral (Zo) charges and tetrahedral (Zt) vs. interlayer (Zi) charges for the all samples from Jhilmili intertrappean sequence alongwith smectite rich clays [from Anjar intertrappeans, weathered Deccan basalt, infra (Lametas)/inter-trappeans and bole horizons] from Deccan volcanic province when plotted on bivariate diagrams (Fig.9) show dispositions very close to the Anjar intertrappean clays for all the Jhilmili data plots, except for sample JM3 (this work) that lies distinctively much away from rest of the smectite rich clay data plots. The closeness in the data plots for the\nFig.8. Jhilmili intertrappean lithological log showing excursions of δCe, δEu and La/Yb ratio plotted across the sequence.\nJOUR.GEOL.SOC.INDIA, VOL.82, JULY 2013\nclays from Anjar and Jhilmili areas is due to their similar charge occupancies at different sites, however, former contains relatively higher amount of palygorskite, formed under the arid environmental conditions (Shrivastava et al. 2000). These findings draw support from the compositional data plot dispositions (Fig.10) of smectites and smectitechlorite mixtures (C/S), separated from five physically distinct litho-units of the Jhilmili intertrappean succession. To distinguish between smectites, chlorite and smectite/ chlorite mixture, the clay compositions were re-calculated (based on 28 charges equivalent to chlorite formula), using procedure discussed by Neuhoff et al. (2006) and Gysi and Stefansson (2012) and sum of tetrahedral and octahedral cations (Si+Al+Mg+Fe) were compared with the inter-layer charges (2Ca+Na+K). In this way, compositional data for smectites and smectite-chlorite mixtures (C/S) separated from various litho-units of the Jhilmili intertrappean succession were plotted simultaneously along with the data for the experimentally synthesized clays formed at 150°- 250ºC, natural clay compositions formed during basalt\nalteration (Neuhoff et al. 1999, 2006; Rogers et al. 2006) and published (Salil et al. 1996; Shrivastava and Ahmad, 2008; Ahmad et al. 2012) data on infra (Lametas)- /intertrappeans from Jabalpur area, Anjar intertrappean and surrounding bole beds of the eastern Deccan volcanic province. Data plots (Fig. 10) for the experimentally synthesized clays formed at 150° and 250ºC show compositions between dioctahedral and trioctahedral smectites, but some smectites formed at 250ºC having compositions between trioctahedral smectite and chlorite (Fig.10). While plotting present data and other data from Anjar and Jabalpur intertrappeans and bole clays form the eastern Deccan volcanic province (Fig. 10) indicate that data plot dispositions for JM 2, JM 4 and JM 5 samples (from the Jhilmili intertrappean) lie close to the dioctahedral and trioctahedral smectite fields (Fig.10). These clay data plots are also lying very close to those clays formed at temperatures of 250°, 150° and 250ºC. Thus, it is presumed that the clays associated with the Jhilmili intertrappean were formed at relatively higher temperatures, ranging\nFig.9.

(2012).\nJOUR.GEOL.SOC.INDIA, VOL.82, JULY 2013\nbetween 150°-250 ºC and the heat required for the formation of these clays was possibly derived from the hydrothermal fluids, associated with the Deccan volcanism. Bole clays from eastern Deccan volcanic province, intertrappean clays from Anjar and Jabalpur areas also lies within the dioctahedral and trioctahedral smectite field (Fig.10), inferring identical temperatures for their formation. But, sample JM 4 is remarkably falling very close to celadonite field (Fig.10), showing compositional proximity with the celadonite as also established by its data plot disposition in Fig. 5."

    "heading": "CONCLUSION",
    "text": "It is concluded that the Jhilmili intertrappean sequence dominated by dioctahedral iron rich montmorillonite clay is formed under alkaline conditions with alternate wet and long spell of dry seasons. Mixed layer of clays formed by transformation of montmorillonite under cold or temperate climate. Presence of palygorskite + montmorillonite suggested arid climate. Major part of the volcanosedimentary sequence of the eastern Deccan was developed under the influence of semi arid climate (predominance of montmorillonite). The dominance of montmorillonite in the clay assemblage of the Jhilmili sediments is indicative of\ntheir derivation from a volcanogenic source rock as it has been observed that if the detrital fissile clays are comprised of >70% smectite, its source rock would be volcanic (Weaver, 1989). In fact, Jhilmili intertrappean bed spatially located very close to the previously studied bole horizons of the eastern Deccan volcanic province (Ahmad et al. 2012), infra-/inter-trappean beds from Jabalpur area (Salil et al. 1996; Shrivastava and Ahmad, 2008). Its mineralogy and chemistry is also comparable to Anjar intertrappean clays. By comparing the clay mineralogy and mineral chemistry of Jhilmili intertrappean clays with other infra-/intertrappean from Jabalpur and Anjar areas, the existence of non-marine palaeoenvironment is inferred. Clay minerals such as smectite palygorskite were derived from weathering of the adjacent basalt outcrops which are useful palaeoclimate proxies bearing records of the environments in which they were formed. The smectite present in the intertrappean sediments sandwiched between Deccan basaltic lava flows was derived from the terrestrial weathering and hydrothermal alteration of Deccan basalt.\nAcknowledgement: We acknowledge CSIR, New Delhi for financial assistance (Project Grant No: 24(0315)/11/ EMR-II) towards this work.\nFig.10.

  "abstractText": "Jhilmili intertrappean bed (~13 m thick) attains its significance with the recent discovery of brackish water ostrocod and planktonic foraminifera fossils (Keller et al. 2009; Khosala et al. 2009). Present XRD data revealed abundance of montmorillonite > montmorillonite/chlorite mixed layer > palygorskite in five physically distinct lithounits namely: (a) lower chocolate brown siltstone with green patches, followed by (b) brick red clayey siltstone, (c) greenish grey clay, (d) yellowish brown clay and (e) uppermost olive grey to dark brown silt layers in the successionrepresent higher weathering indices and annual precipitation, reflecting cyclic, but longer spells of weathering. Occurrence of M/C mixed layer with the smectite in Jhilmili area is suggestive of their derivation from the later, whilst montmorillonite to palygorskite transformation is ascribed to the drastic changes in the humid to arid climate, where former served as a source of Al and some of the Si and Mg ions for the later. Jhilmili and Anjar clays represent similar charge occupancies at different sites, but later contains relatively higher amount of palygorskite, formed in the arid environment. Majority of the trace elemental data plots for Jhilmili clays lie within the upper and lower limits of infra (Lametas)-/inter-trappeans clays. The continuous release of Cu throughout the succession (mainly in the palygorskite dominated clays) indicates oxidizing conditions. PAAS normalized REE data plots for these clays show progressive enrichment in the HREE contents in the lower part, but, upper part of the succession is marked by positive cerium anomaly, reflecting oxidizing conditions prevailed at the later stage of the succession. These conditions continued, but, were not conducive to HREE enrichment as evidenced by their depletion in the upper part of the succession. The Ce anomaly observed in the middle part of the succession is similar to that form by continental weathering of the basalt, ascribed to Ce precipitation in the oxic environment, thus suggestive of drastic changes in the oxidizing conditions. Thermodynamic data-sets for Jhilmili clays show I/S mixed layer and celadonite compositions, whereas, Jabalpur infra-/inter-trappean clays correspond to Mg smectites and celadonite end members, thus, representing compositional commonality with those of the other clays derived from the continental weathering of basalt protolith. Jhilmili smectites and smectite-chlorite mixtures show compositional similarity with the dioctahedral and trioctahedral smectites and the smectites formed at 250oC, having compositions between trioctahedral smectite and chlorite, thus, assigning high temperatures for their formation, where the heat required for the formation of these clays was possibly derived from the hydrothermal fluids, associated with the Deccan volcanism.",
