    "text": "Th e Cretaceous is a critical time to understand the tectonic evolution of the Black Sea and the mountain ranges surrounding this landlocked oceanic basin. It is generally accepted that the Black Sea region was aff ected by an extensional tectonic regime during the Early Cretaceous (Letouzey et al. 1977; Zonenshain & Le Pichon 1986; Görür 1988; Manetti et al. 1988), resulting in the development of the Western and Eastern Black Sea basins and other sedimentary basins on its southern continental margin.\nTh e Pontides (Ketin 1966; Şengör & Yılmaz 1981; Okay & Tüysüz 1999), forming the southern continental margin of the Black Sea, can be separated into the Western, Central and Eastern Pontides. Th e Western Pontides corresponds to the İstanbul Zone and Central and Eastern Pontides correspond to the Sakarya Zone of Okay (1989). Th e Zonguldak and the Ulus basins on the İstanbul Zone and the Sinop Basin on the Sakarya Zone (Figure 1) were mainly fi lled by Cretaceous sedimentary and volcanic units. Tüysüz (1999) concluded that the stratigraphy of the Lower Cretaceous units of both the Zonguldak and the Ulus basins (Figure 1) is diff erent from that of the Sinop Basin, while the stratigraphy of the Upper Cretaceous and younger units of all these basins are the same. Based on this, Tüysüz (1999) deduced that the İstanbul and the Sakarya zones were juxtaposed at the end of the Early Cretaceous.\nSedimentary fi ll of the Zonguldak, Ulus and Sinop basins (Figure 1; Tüysüz 1999) refl ects opening and deepening periods of these basins east of the BoluEreğli line (Figure 1) during the Late Barremian to Cenomanian interval (Tüysüz 1999; Masse et al. 2009). At that time, the western part of this line remained as an erosional area. Th e Upper Barremian–Aptian basal parts of the fi lls of the basins are mainly represented by siliciclastics and carbonates deposited during the rift ing of these basins (Figure 2). Th e Aptian– Cenomanian sediments are mainly composed of ammonite-bearing dark shales, marls and siliciclastic turbidites refl ecting anoxic basin conditions. Following a short uplift and erosional period within the Cenomanian, the nature of the sedimentation totally changed; deposition of dark shales and siliciclastic turbidites were replaced by volcanics, volcaniclastics and alternating red pelagic shales and\nlimestones indicating oxic conditions (Görür et al. 1993). Th is new period of sedimentation was mainly associated with extensive volcanism, produced by a magmatic arc extending from the Srednagorie Zone in Bulgaria to the Caucasus in Georgia. It is generally accepted that this arc trending parallel to the southern Black Sea coast was established in response to northward subduction of the Intra-Pontide and Ankara-Erzincan-Sevan branches of Tethys Ocean from west to east, respectively (Peccerillo & Taylor 1975; Şengör & Yılmaz 1981; Manetti et al. 1988; Aykol & Tokel 1991; Tüysüz 1993; Okay & Tüysüz 1999; Karacık & Tüysüz 2010).\nTh e Pontide magmatic arc comprises mainly volcanics, volcaniclastics and alternating clastics and carbonates and granitic intrusions in its western and eastern parts. Th e thickness of the volcanic succession exceeds a few kilometres in places. Both radiometric and fossil age data from diff erent parts of the magmatic belt imply that the volcanism was active between the Middle Turonian and Maastrichtian (Çoğulu 1975; Akın 1978; Moore et al. 1980; Stanisheva-Vassileva 1980; Popov 1981; Akıncı 1984; Ohta et al. 1988; Aykol & Tokel 1991; Çamur et al. 1996; Berza et al. 1998; von Quadt et al. 2005; Karacık & Tüysüz 2010).\nGörür et al. (1993) concluded that the rift ing of the Black Sea back-arc basin was initiated during the Aptian and this was followed by syn-rift sedimentation and subsidence until the late Cenomanian, when ocean fl oor spreading and thermally induced subsidence started. Aft er the breakup of the continental crust in the late Cenomanian, basinward tilting and subsidence of the southern margin of the Black Sea caused widespread transgression and a major post-breakup unconformity, above which pelagic limestones and marls were deposited. Following the onset of spreading in the Black Sea, the euxinic conditions of the rift stage were replaced with oxic conditions, giving way to the deposition of red pelagic carbonates and marls.\nTüysüz (1999) and Tüysüz et al. (2004) indicated that post-breakup sequence of Görür et al. (1993) in the Western Pontides is represented by two diff erent volcanic successions separated by the Unaz Formation. According to fossil data, the lower volcanic succession, the Dereköy Formation (Tüysüz\nFi gu\nre 1\n. S im\npl ifi\ned ge\nol og\ny m ap\no f t\nhe W\nes te\nrn an\nd C\nen tr\nal P\non tid\nes .

In places, where its base is visible, this formation rests unconformably on the Lower Cretaceous and older units and starts with a thick basal conglomerate grading upward into an alternation of calc-alkaline and acidic to intermediate porphyritic lavas and pyroclastics, pelagic micritic red to whitish limestones and turbiditic clastics. Th e oldest Middle Turonian age comes from the fi rst pelagic limestone horizons and the matrix of debrisfl ow horizons in the middle part of the formation; thus lower parts of the formation can be as old as Late Cenomanian or Early Turonian. Geochemical features of the Dereköy Formation magmatic rocks imply that they were produced by a depleted mantle\nbearing the signature of a subduction zone (Keskin & Tüysüz 1999, 2001).\nTh e Dereköy Formation comprises abundant blocks (olistoliths) and debris-fl ow horizons (olistostromes) in some locations (Figure 3). Th e matrix of these debris horizons is composed of micritic limestones and siltstones with abundant planktonic foraminifera including Marginotruncana coronata, Marginotrunca pseudolinneiana; Marginotruncana schneegansi, Muricohedbergella fl andrini; Dicarinella cf. hangi-primitiva, Dicarinella cf. concavata, Dicarinella canaliculata, Dicarinella imbricata, Praeglobotruncana cf. stephani, Hedbergella sp., indicating an age between Middle Turonian and Early\nSantonian. Blocks and pebbles embedded within this matrix are angular, poorly sorted and composed of Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic shallow water platform limestones (Figure 3). In the light of the lithology and geometry of these debris-fl ows and blocks, together with sudden thickness and facies changes of the formation, Tüysüz (1999) concluded that these chaotic units were deposited in front of normal faults around the shelf margin facing towards a deep marine environment. Th e deepening and fi ning upward character of the Dereköy Formation in the debris-fl ow horizons support this interpretation.\nTh e second magmatic series, the Cambu Formation (Figure 2), started aft er the deposition of the Unaz Formation. Th e Cambu Formation is represented by an alternation of basaltic and andesitic lava, pyroclastics, volcaniclastics and pelagic micritic limestones. Th is second episode of magmatism was more voluminous than the fi rst stage and was active throughout the Campanian. Th e lavas belonging to this second episode are both tholeiitic/calcalkaline and within-plate high-K shoshonitic series following two diff erent trends. Th e amphibole-bearing fi rst series is similar to lavas of the Dereköy Formation and derived from a mantle source. Th e second series displays within-plate characteristics and implies thinning of the lithosphere and upwelling of the asthenosphere in the region, probably due to backarc opening (Keskin & Tüysüz 1999, 2001).\nTh e Late Santonian Unaz Formation (Figure 2), separating two stages of the volcanism (the Dereköy and the Cambu formations), is the subject of this paper. Th is formation is represented by a 5–20-m-thick micritic limestone and extends throughout the Western and Central Pontides as a marker horizon. Although both the Dereköy and Cambu formations contain several pelagic limestone horizons, it is easy to distinguish the limestones of the Unaz Formation from these horizons by using following criteria: (1) Volcanic rocks of the Dereköy and the Cambu formations can be distinguished in the fi eld by their diff erent mineralogical and textural properties (Keskin & Tüysüz 1999, 2001), the Unaz Formation occurs stratigraphically between these two diff erent formations, (2) Th e Unaz Formation rests on an unconformity/disconformity surface in most places, (3) Th ere is a 0–10-m-thick clastic sequence, the Kökyol Formation, below the Unaz Formation in some areas (4) None of the pelagic limestone horizons within the Dereköy and Unaz formations is laterally as continuous as those of the Unaz Formation, (4) Fossils from each of these formations indicate diff erent ages.\nDuring the deposition of the Unaz Formation, the volcanism ceased and no volcaniclastics and/ or siliciclastics were produced, implying that the Unaz Formation marks the end of the fi rst period of volcanism and submergence of the whole region. Th e geochemical nature of the magmatism changed aft er the deposition of the Unaz Formation (Keskin & Tüysüz 1999, 2001). Th ese data imply that the Unaz Formation is a key unit in understanding the Late Cretaceous evolution of the Pontides.\nIn this paper we follow the stratigraphic nomenclature of the Western Pontides published by the Turkish Stratigraphy Commission (Tüysüz et al. 2004). Recently Hippolyte et al. (2010) suggested a revision of the Cretaceous to Palaeogene stratigraphy of the Western and Central Pontides based on nannofossil determinations. Th ey did not take account of the formal stratigraphic nomenclature (Tüysüz et al. 2004) and instead of the Dereköy Formation of Turonian–Coniacian age they show non-deposition. However, as shown here, this period is represented by a thick volcanic succession corresponding to the Dereköy Formation (Akyol et al. 1974; Tüysüz 1999).\nFigure 3. Debris-fl ow horizon within the Dereköy Formation. Angular and unsorted Lower Cretaceous neritic limestone pebbles and blocks are embedded within pink Middle Turonian–Lower Santonian pelagic limestones and siltstones.\nTh ey terminated the second period of magmatism at the end of Santonian although it extends in the north to the Campanian (Akyol et al. 1974; Tüysüz 1999 and references therein).\nIn this study, we examined diff erent stratigraphic sections in the Western Pontides and investigated the basal contacts of the Unaz Formation with the underlying units, which allowed us to obtain a palaeogeographic picture of the region just before and during the deposition of the Unaz Formation, and to interpret the Late Cretaceous geological events."

    "text": "Th e Unaz Formation is a rather uniform unit. It is represented by red to pinkish, thinly-bedded, sometimes laminated bioclastic micritic limestones. Stylolites parallel to the bedding are common. A few-mm-thick red shale interbeds can also be seen. Some slump structures within the Unaz Formation have also been observed. In thin sections, wellpreserved microfossils are seen scattered within the micritic matrix. Hematite concentrations along the lamina surfaces and scattered hematite fragments are common. Minor amounts of quartz, feldspar and echinoid fragments were also observed. Some sections of the Unaz Formation will be described briefl y in the following paragraphs from west to east (Figure 4).\nIn the east of Ereğli town, on the road from Ereğli to Zonguldak (36T 373500/4570310), the Unaz Formation is seen between two volcanic successions (Figure 5). Tokay (1952), who mapped this region in detail, separated the lower volcanic succession into two members: Lower Series (La Série inférieure de Crétacé supérior) and Agglomerates, both of which correspond to the Dereköy Formation. He named the overlying pelagic limestones and marls together as ‘İkse-Köristan marnocalcaires’. Th e pelagic limestones at the base of the ‘İkse-Köristan marnocalcaires’ correspond to the Unaz Formation while the marls and overlying four volcanic-volcanogenic members correspond to the Cambu Formation.\nTh e Dereköy Formation, consisting of tuff s, agglomerates, marls and thinly-bedded pelagic limestones, transgressively overlies both the Cenomanian marls and the Palaeozoic substratum.\nTokay (1952) identifi ed Globotruncana ex gr. lapparenti and Globotruncana ex gr. helvetica from the basal part, and Cephalopoda specimen Peroniceras moureti De Gros from the upper part of this succession and assigned an Early Turonian to Coniacian age for the deposition of the lower volcanic succession. He also indicated the occurrence of submarine slump structures, olistoliths and 15–20-cm-thick radiolarites within this unit, implying deepening upward and a tectonically active environment of deposition.\nTh e red pelagic limestones of the Unaz Formation rest on the agglomerates, pillow lava and alternating volcaniclastics of the Dereköy Formation. Th ere is a thin conglomeratic horizon at the base of the Unaz Formation, which can be compared to the Kökyol Formation in the Amasra section described below. Th is conglomeratic horizon probably indicates a disconformity separating the Unaz Formation from the underlying Dereköy Formation. Th e Unaz limestone is pink to red, micritic, thinly bedded, laminated and is about 8–10 metres thick. It grades upward into red pelagic marls, shales, andesites, basalts and tuff s of the Cambu Formation (Figure 5). Tokay (1952) reported Globotruncana ex gr. lapparenti, Stomiosphaeridae and Cadosinidae fossils from the Unaz limestones.\nTokay (1952) separated diff erent members within the Cambu Formation and described fossils indicating a period between Late Santonian and Late Campanian for its deposition. Th ese data bracket the age of the Unaz Formation in the Ereğli region between the Late Coniacian and Late Santonian."

Although this outcrop of the Unaz Formation can be traced for about 60 km laterally, stratigraphically it is very uniform.\nFigure 5. Th e Unaz Formation and overlying Cambu Formation on the Ereğli-Zonguldak road.\nTh e Kökyol Formation below the Unaz Formation is a 0.2–15-m-thick clastic unit consisting of grey to yellowish sandstones and conglomerates. Th e sandstones are rich in quartz and lithic fragments, medium bedded, and well to medium sorted. Its matrix is composed mainly of yellowish silt and clay. Th e presence of symmetrical ripple marks indicates a shallow environment of deposition. Conglomerates are less dominant compared to sandstones within the formation. Most of the pebbles are rounded, semi-spherical, medium to poorly sorted and tightly cemented with calcite. Th ey are 1–5 cm in diameter. Although the lithology of the pebbles varies laterally, Devonian limestones are dominant in the west, while Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous limestones dominate towards the east. In general, the conglomerates are seen as laterally discontinuous lenses, refl ecting channel-type geometry. Within this clastic unit, there are abundant macrofossils such as Gastropods, Pelecypods and Brachiopods. Hippolyte et al. (2010) reported Santonain and Coniacian–Santonian nannofossils from this unit.\nHigher in the section, this clastic sequence is overlain by red pelagic limestones. Th e contact between the clastics and the limestones is very sharp. In places, the fi ne clastic sequence is absent and there are 10–30 cm of thick grey to mottled basal conglomerate at the base of the pelagic limestones resting unconformably on the older units (Figure 6). Th e pebbles of this conglomerate are 1–2 cm in diameter, poorly sorted, elongate and rounded. Most of them are reworked intraformational red pelagic limestones. Th ey are tightly cemented by calcite. Some sole marks at the base of the conglomerates and a fi ning-upward structure are interpreted as evidence of a turbiditic origin.\nTh e pelagic limestones of the Unaz Formation are red, pink or whitish and thinly bedded. Bedding is smooth, parallel and well exposed in most places, but some undulating bedding was also observed. In the lowest 10–20 cm of the section, the thickness of the bedding is about 1–3 cm, but it reaches to 5–8 cm in the upper part. Th e total thickness of the limestone varies between 3 to 10 metres. Nannofossils and Calculites obscurus (Defl andre) Prinsand Sissingh from this outcrop indicate a Late Santonian–Early Campanian age for the pelagic limestones.\nHigher up the section, some tuff and red shale horizons start to be seen; they increase toward the top and the limestones grade into the volcanicvolcaniclastics of the Cambu Formation."

At the top of the Dereköy Formation, there is a 10–15-cm-thick, loose, greyish to pinkish, intensively bioturbated marl horizon just below the Unaz Formation (Figure 7b). Within this horizon, there are abundant borings fi lled with grey to pink hardened marls. In general, borings are parallel to the unconformity surface but some of them are vertical and penetrate into the unconformity surface. Th is horizon represents a hard ground surface and implies subaerial exposure of the Dereköy Formation just before the deposition of the Unaz Formation.\nTh e localization of bored surfaces (hard grounds) at the top of the thin-bedded carbonates of the Dereköy Formation is interpreted as being the result of regression and following transgression and lithifi cation prior to the onset of the deep marine sedimentation of the Unaz Formation. In addition, the presence of the genera Lucianorhabdus and\nBraarudosphaera just below the unconformity also indicates shallow-marine conditions (regression).\nOn top of the marl horizon there is a single bed of sandy micritic limestone belonging to the Unaz Formation, which is overlain by homogeneous pink, thin-bedded biomicritic limestone 8 metres thick (Figure 7b). Within these limestones foraminifera Dicarinella asymetrica, Dicarinella concavata, Globotruncanita stuartiformis, Muricohedbergella fl andrini, Globotruncanita cf. elevata and radiolarians have been found indicating a Late Santonian age (Tüysüz et al. 1997).

    "text": "Th e Ağlı Basin is a small sedimentary basin lying unconformably on Lower Cretaceous and older units of the Central Pontides (the Sakarya Zone). It is fi lled by a continuous Upper Cretaceous to Middle Eocene sedimentary sequence (Tüysüz et al. 2000). At its base (36T 542050/4617750) is a detrital limestone and carbonaceous sandstone 20–30 metres thick, named the Kayıkçı Formation. In places, at the base of the Kayıkçı Formation, there is a grainsupported coarse conglomerate horizon. Angular and disordered pebbles and blocks of this conglomerate are very poorly sorted. Grain size ranges between a few millimetres to one metre. Th e conglomerate has a lensoid geometry and grades upward and laterally into cross-bedded sandstones and carbonaceous pebbly limestones, which unconformably rest on the older rocks. Th e nature of the conglomerate implies very rapid deposition close to a tectonically controlled uplift and very rapid deepening, probably on a downthrown fault block. Large-scale cross bedding, thick bedding and abundant benthic fossil and coral fragments within the sandstones imply a shallow marine environment for the deposition. Similarly, the presence of abundant coral fragments and binding algae within the pebbly limestones imply a depositional environment close to a reef front. No characteristic fossil had been found within the Kayıkçı Formation. Th is unit can be correlated with the clastic Kökyol Formation just below the Unaz Formation in the Amasra region on account of its stratigraphic position and depositional conditions.\nTh e Kayıkçı Formation is disconformably overlain by white, pink and red, thinly-bedded micritic limestones of the Unaz Formation. Th e contact between these two formations is very sharp and probably indicate a sudden subsidence of the region or, alternatively, sudden rise of the sea level. In places, the Kayıkçı Formation is missing and the Unaz Formation rests directly on older units, which supports this idea.\nTh e Unaz Formation is about 30–40 metres thick in the Ağlı Basin. It sits on diff erent lithologies of the Kayıkçı Formation, including conglomerates, sandstones and limestones. In most places, the lowest part of the sequence 5–25 cm thick consists of white clayey and micritic limestones rich in pyrite crystals, which are mostly oxidized. Th is lower part indicates deposition under partly anoxic conditions, grading upward into reddish to pink, homogenous thinly-bedded micritic limestones indicating oxic conditions. Foraminifera Globotruncanita elevata, Globotruncanita stuartiformis, Dicarinella asymetrica, Marginotruncana coronata, Globotruncana linneiana, Heterohelix sp., Hedbergella sp. and radiolarians have been found within these limestones and a Late Santonian age has been assigned for the deposition. Th e same age has also been determined in this location based on nannofossils (Hippolyte et al. 2010). In the Ağlı Basin, the Unaz Formation grades upward into the Ağlı Formation consisting of sandstone, mudstone, marl and clayey micritic limestones. According to fossil fi ndings from its upper parts, the Ağlı Formation is Maastrichtian in age and its lower parts may be Campanian."

    "text": "Th e Pontides consists of two tectonic units, the İstanbul Zone in the west and the Sakarya Zone in the east. Th ese two zones are separated by AraçDaday Shear Zone, which has been regarded as the eastern continuation of the Intra-Pontide suture (Şengör & Yılmaz 1981; Tüysüz 1999; Okay & Tüysüz 1999). In the eastern part of the İstanbul Zone, the Zonguldak and Ulus sedimentary basins started to open during the Late Barremian. Upper\nBarremian–Cenomanian deposits in these basins represent the opening and deepening of the basins, probably contemporaneously with the opening of the Western Black Sea Basin. Based on data provided by Masse et al. (2009), Tüysüz (2009) concluded that an archipelago separated the Western Black Sea Basin from the Zonguldak-Ulus Basin and a short-lived carbonate platform developed in this archipelago during Late Barremian time. A regional Late (?) Cenomanian unconformity separates mainly anoxic basin sediments from the overlying volcanics and volcanic-rich sediments (Görür 1997). Th e tectonic meaning of this unconformity is not clear due to insuffi cient data. Th is event may be attributed either to a regional thermal doming just before the start of arc magmatism produced by northward subduction of the Intra-Pontide Ocean (Şengör & Yılmaz 1981; Aykol & Tokel 1991; Tüysüz 1999; Karacık & Tüysüz 2010), or to the juxtaposition of the İstanbul and Sakarya zones. Th is subject is beyond the scope of this paper.\nAlthough the fossil data indicate that the beginning of the magmatism on the İstanbul Zone is Middle Turonian, it may be as early as Late Cenomanian or Early Turonian as fossil fi ndings come from the pelagic limestones in the middle part of the succession (Tüysüz et al. 1997).\nTh e early Cretaceous stratigraphy of the Sakarya Zone in the Central Pontides is diff erent from that of the İstanbul Zone (Tüysüz 1999). In that area, Upper Barremian to Cenomanian sediments fi lling the Sinop Basin record the opening of the north-facing asymmetric Sinop Basin. Th e basin started to open under the control of horst-graben topography and rapidly deepened, especially in its northern part, towards the Eastern Black Sea Basin (Tüysüz 2009). In contrast to the İstanbul Zone, the Cenomanian–Turonian transition is represented by radiolaria-bearing deep marine red carbonates and red shales resting conformably or, in most outcrops, disconformably on Albian–Cenomanian dark shales (Tüysüz 1999; Luo 2005; Yılmaz et al. 2010). In contrast to pre-magmatic period, units deposited during the late- and post-magmatic period on both the İstanbul and the Sakarya zones are very similar and can be correlated with each other. Based on these stratigraphic data, Tüysüz (1999) concluded that the\nIntra-Pontide Ocean separating the İstanbul and Sakarya zones closed during the Albian–Cenomanian period, defi nitely before the deposition of the Unaz Formation, or probably before the deposition of the Dereköy Formation.\nTh e Turonian–Santonian period is represented by extensive magmatism throughout the Pontides. In both the İstanbul and the Sakarya zones, and even in the Th race Zone in the west, this magmatic activity is mainly represented by submarine extrusives. Th e geochemical properties of the fi rst magmatic stage indicate a subduction-related magmatic origin. Blocks and debris-fl ow horizons within the Dereköy Formation imply the development of normal faulting associated with the arc magmatism. Th is extensional tectonic regime was probably created by a roll-back mechanism of the subducting oceanic plate in the south of the Pontides.\nTh e stratigraphic relationships between the Unaz and the underlying Dereköy formations imply that just before the deposition of the Unaz Formation some areas in the southern coast of the Black Sea were elevated as horsts and eroded (for example Cide area) or remained covered by a very shallow sea (Amasra), while others remained or deepened as grabens (Turabi, Köseli and the area between Cide and İnebolu), where the volcanism is associated with deep marine sedimentation (Figure 8)."

    "text": "Th e Unaz Formation itself is a quite homogeneous unit extending for about 250 km between Ereğli and İnebolu. Although there is no detailed map of this unit in the Central and Eastern Pontides, our fi eld observations indicate that it is possible to trace it eastward for hundreds more kilometres.\nIn the west, north of İstanbul, Upper Cretaceous rocks are represented only by the Cambu Formation and the Dereköy Formation is absent. Gedik et al. (2005) indicated that, in the European part of İstanbul, Palaeozoic rocks are thrust over the Upper Cretaceous volcanics, but in the Asian part of the city, on the Bithynian Peninsula, the Cambu Formation rests unconformably on Triassic rocks. Gedik et al. (2005) found a rich nannofossil and foraminifera\nfauna from this formation and based on this data gave a Late Santonian–Early Campanian age. Th ey did not map the Unaz Formation as a separate unit in this area but indicated the occurrence of the red pelagic micrites within the volcanic succession. As they did not fi nd any fossil data older than Late Santonian, we interpret that the Unaz and Cambu formations rest directly on the pre-Upper Cretaceous basement in this area without the Dereköy Formation, as in the Bartın and Amasra regions. In the upper parts of the volcanic succession (the Cambu Formation) Gedik et al. (2005) found calcareous nannofl ora and assigned it a Late Campanian age.\nBetween İstanbul and Ereğli, the base of the Upper Cretaceous volcanic succession cannot be seen. In that area, there are some volcanic interbeds within the carbonate-dominant Campanian units.\nTh e lower volcanic succession transgressively overlies the Cenomanian marls and older units and is disconformably overlain by the Unaz Formation between Ereğli and Filyos (Figure 1). East of this area, from west of Bartın to east of Amasra, the Dereköy\nFormation is absent. From east of Amasra to Cide (Figure 1), as seen in the Turabi section, the lower volcanic succession was deposited in a deep, but shallowing-upward marine environment. Around Cide, the Unaz Formation directly overlies Jurassic limestones: the Dereköy Formation is absent. East of Cide, a disconformity separates the Dereköy and the Unaz formations, which were deposited in deep marine environments.\nAs can be seen from these relationships, in places there is a thick sequence of Upper Cenomanian (?)– Turonian to Santonian sedimentary and volcanic rocks at the base of the Unaz Formation. Th e Unaz Formation unconformably or conformably overlies the Lower Cretaceous to Palaeozoic units. In the latter case, there is a shallow-marine clastic sequence a few metres thick at the base of the formation. In the light of these stratigraphic data and the evidence of synsedimentary faulting within the Dereköy Formation, we deduce that the southern Black Sea margin was dissected by normal faults and the area formed horsts and grabens during the Middle Turonian–Coniacian.\nFigure 8. Schematic cross-sections showing the Turonian to Late Santonian tectonic evolution of the İstanbul Zone (not to scale). Grey shaded areas represent the Lower Cretaceous and older units. Red lines and green dotted areas represent the Dereköy Formation and debris-fl ow deposits within this formation, respectively. Green limestone symbol on the lower fi gure represents the Unaz Formation.\nTh e areas where the Dereköy Formation is absent are interpreted as horsts. In these areas, shallow marine clastics were deposited while deep marine deposition was continuing within the grabens. By using these stratigraphic properties it is possible to conclude that the İstanbul-Ereğli, Bartın-Amasra and Cide areas were emergent horsts, while the Ereğli-Bartın, Kurucaşile-Cide and Cide-İnebolu regions were covered by deep water during Turonian-Coniacian times (Figure 8).\nPelagic micrites of the Unaz Formation overlie diff erent units as a common cover. Except for a shallow-marine clastic or siliciclastic turbidite horizon in its base, there are neither volcanic nor clastic fragments within the Unaz Formation. Th e lower contact of the micritic limestones, including the contact with its clastic basal part, is quite sharp. Th ese imply: (1) Termination of the First Period of the Magmatism\n– During the deposition of the Unaz Formation magmatism stopped but it restarted aft er the deposition of the limestones. Th e geochemical natures of magmatism in these two periods, separated by the Unaz Formation, are diff erent. Th e pre-Unaz period is represented by typical arc magmatism, while the post-Unaz period bears the clues of within-plate signature which can be attributed to an uplift ed asthenosphere due to rift ing and oceanic spreading in the Western Black Sea Basin (Keskin & Tüysüz 1999, 2001). Th is change can be attributed to a southward jump of the magmatic arc axis as a result of slab roll-back, and relaxation and subsidence in the north, corresponding to the present location of the Western Black Sea Basin.\n(2) Sudden Change in the Physical Conditions of Deposition – Th e Unaz limestone implies a rather quiet and deep depositional environment developed aft er an intense extensional tectonic period. Th e presence of slump structures indicates that the eff ect of this tectonic activity was still continuing in some places. Th e absence of any siliciclastic fragments during the deposition of these limestones implies that all emergent areas that provided siliciclastics to the Dereköy and Kökyol formations during Turonian–Santonian time were submerged during the Late Santonian\ndue to either sudden submergence of the whole region or sudden sea-level rise. Th e red colour of the Unaz limestones indicates oxygenated conditions during deposition (Görür et al. 1993; Hu et al. 2005; Yılmaz 2008)."

    "heading": "Tectonic and Depositional Interpretations of the Unaz Formation",
    "text": "Data presented above clearly indicate that the Unaz Formation represents a sudden change in the depositional system along the southern coast of the Black Sea Basin. Görür et al. (1993), Görür (1997) and Tüysüz (1999) attributed this change to the tectonic evolution of the Western Black Sea Basin. According to these authors, the unconformity at the base of the Unaz Formation represents the breakup of continental crust in the Black Sea Basin and indicates the onset of oceanic spreading. Görür et al. (1993) considered diff erent red pelagic micrite horizons within the lower and upper volcanic successions as a unique sequence, the Kapanboğazı Formation, and they produced a model based on these data. Our recent observations (Tüysüz et al. 2004) indicated that the name Kapanboğazı Formation is applied, incorrectly, to diff erent pelagic micrite horizons without regard to stratigraphic position and age. In fact, the Kapanboğazı Formation occurs only in the Sinop Basin (Sakarya Zone) and its age is Turonian (based on radiolarians, Luo 2005) or Late Cenomanian–Early/Middle Turonian (based on nannofossils Tüysüz and Melinte, unpublished data and based on radiolaria and planktonik forminifera, Yılmaz et al. 2010). In this study, we agree with the tectonic model of Görür et al. (1993), except for the timing. Görür et al. (1993) implied that the unconformity at the base of the oxic sediments and volcanics separate the faulted syn-rift sequence from the unfaulted post-rift sequence. Our data shows that the rift ing was eff ective until the deposition of the Unaz Formation during the Late Santonian. Extensional tectonics and the consequent faulting period before the deposition of the Unaz Formation can be attributed to the rift ing period; and sudden deepening of the region during the deposition of the Unaz Formation can be attributed to break up of the already thinned continental crust. Th is tectonic model is also supported by the geochemical nature\nof the volcanism, indicating uplift of asthenosphere (Keskin & Tüysüz 1999, 2001)."
  }, {
    "heading": "Discussion",
    "text": "Th e Unaz Formation clearly indicates sudden deepening of the region and/or sudden sea-level rise during the Late Santonian. Although the tectonic model presented above fi ts the stratigraphic and palaeogeographic data well, regional distribution of Upper Santonian micritic carbonates indicate that this event is not only limited to the Black Sea region. Deposition of Upper Santonian red pelagic limestones and/or shales is very common in diff erent parts of the Tethyan realm (Hu et al. 2005). Th is indicates that purely local tectonic events cannot explain the sudden regional change of physical conditions during the Late Santonian.\nUpper Santonian red pelagic sediments are also recorded in the Mudurnu-Göynük and Haymana basins in the western and central parts of the Sakarya Zone. In the Mudurnu-Göynük Basin, which is a rift basin along the Sakarya continental margin (Koçyiğit et al. 1991), Upper Santonian red pelagic micrites (Değirmenözü Member of the Yenipazar Formation, Timur & Aksay 2002) unconformably overlie the Albian to Coniacian basinal facies and older elevated areas (Yılmaz 2008). In the Haymana Basin, which is an ‘accretionary fore-arc basin’ (Koçyiğit 1991) near Ankara, NW Turkey, the same Upper Santonian red pelagic limestones and marls (Kocatepe Formation, Yüksel 1970; Ünalan et al. 1976) rest unconformably on the Tethyan accretionary complex (Ankara Mélange). Th is formation approximately marks the base of the Haymana Basin and turbiditic sequences lie above. Th is indicates deep slope environments aft er the deposition of the red pelagic limestones.\nIn the Kargı Massif, in the southern part of the Central Pontides (Sakarya Zone) Late Santonian pelagic limestones lie unconformably on Early Cretaceous sediments (Okay et al. 2006). Although red pelagic limestones were also reported from the southern part of the Kargı Massif (Yiğitbaş et al. 1990; Okay et al. 2006; Tüysüz & Tekin 2007), those were deposited on an active continental margin facing the Tethyan Ocean to the south. Tüysüz & Tekin (2007)\nclearly demonstrated that this margin was active between the Late Valanginian and Campanian.\nSome authors attributed the Late Santonian event to a sea-level change, as the Late Cretaceous is the time of globally high sea level, high seasurface temperatures and a peak in the production of organic matter. Larson (1991a, b) postulated that massive upwelling of magma from the core/mantle boundary to the surface of the Earth brought these extraordinary circumstances. Th e elevated young oceanic crust resulted in a sea level rise (Hays & Pitman 1973). Furthermore, the augmented release of CO2 raised atmospheric CO2-levels to about four times higher than at present, causing warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and subsequent additional sea level rise (Huber et al. 2002).\nData from diff erent parts of Tethys indicate that the Late Santonian event is regional rather than local. For example, Late Santonian sea level changes have been described by Flexer et al. (1986) from Israel, Bosworth et al. (1999) from Syria, Bilotte et al. (2005) from the Pyrénéés, Liu (2007) from the Gulf of Mexico, Ghabeishavi et al. (2008) from the Zagros area, and Voigt et al. (2008) from Central Europe. Dercourt et al. (1986) mentioned that diff erential changes in the rotation of poles between Africa and Eurasia during Santonian eff ected the reorganization of spreading ridges and the closure rate of Neotethys.\nHu et al. (2005) demonstrated the widespread occurrence of Upper Cretaceous Red Beds (CORBs) within the large geographic belt extending from the Caribbean across the central North Atlantic, southern and Eastern Europe to Asia. Th ey indicated that oceanic red bed occurrences are generally associated with Alpine tectonic deformations creating changes in oceanic circulation and/or palaeoclimate. Ogg et al. (2008) indicated a major global sequence boundary in the Late Santonian within the Dicarinella asymetrica biozone and this sequence boundary is followed by a major maximum fl ooding surface within the same biozone. Forster et al. (2007) mentioned the pronounced cooling in the Santonian and related this event to the fi rst progressive opening of a deep-water passage through the equatorial Atlantic gateway. Friedrich & Erbacher (2006) reported sudden changes in benthic foraminifera population within\nthe Late Santonian to Early Campanian interval in the Demerara Rise in association with anoxic shale deposition in the South Atlantic and interpreted this event as recording progressive opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway.\nIn the light of all these data and interpretations, it can be stated that the acceleration in the opening of the equatorial Atlantic Gateway gave rise to the formation of background tectonic forces recorded even in far distant areas and changed the oceanic circulation in the Atlantic and triggered an increase in the heat transfer between the ocean-atmosphere interactions. Th erefore, a drop in temperature of the surface ocean water appeared in parallel with the increase in the nutrient infl ux due to ventilation and caused some red colouring in slope and elevated off shore equatorial areas. Overprinting of change in heat budget/climate, sea level and accelerated opening of the South Atlantic caused the formation of a widespread Upper Santonian red pelagic succession. In our case, deposition of the red pelagic sediments of the Unaz Formation was controlled mainly by local tectonics related to the start of oceanic spreading in the Western Black Sea Basin and this event was probably overprinted by the regional Late Santonian sea level rise."

    "text": "Th e Pontide magmatic arc was established in response to the northward subduction of the northern branches of the Tethys Ocean and its fi rst eruptions occurred in the İstanbul Zone during the Middle Turonian. Th is arc persisted until the collision of the İstanbul, Sakarya and Kırşehir zones during\nthe Maastrichtian. Arc magmatics and associated sediments in the İstanbul Zone are represented by two diff erent sequences separated by the Upper Santonian Unaz Formation. During the deposition of the lower volcanic sequence, an extensional tectonic regime prevailed in the region and created a horstgraben topography. Th e lower volcanic succession was mainly deposited within the grabens during Late Cenomanian (?)–Turonian–Santonian time.\nDuring the Late Santonian the whole region subsided suddenly and the pelagic limestones of the Unaz Formation were deposited on both horsts and grabens. Deposition of the Unaz Formation was a combined eff ect of extensional tectonics resulting in the break-up of continental crust, the onset of oceanic spreading in the Western Black Sea Basin and the global sea level change triggered by opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Gateway."

  "abstractText": "Th e Pontide magmatic belt in the Western Pontides, which developed in response to the northward subduction of the northern branches of the Tethys Ocean, consists of two diff erent volcanic successions separated by an Upper Santonian pelagic limestone unit, the Unaz Formation. Th e fi rst period of volcanism and associated sedimentation started during the Middle Turonian and lasted until the Early Santonian under the control of an extensional tectonic regime, which created horst-graben topography along the southern Black Sea region. Th e lower volcanic succession, the Dereköy Formation, was deposited mainly within these grabens. Th is extensional period probably represents the rift ing of magmatic arc, giving rise to the opening of the Western Black Sea back–intra-arc basin. Th e Unaz Formation commonly covers horsts and grabens developed before its deposition. Th is formation implies sudden subsidence of the region and termination of the volcanism during the Late Santonian. Th is period was interpreted as the time of the beginning of the oceanic spreading in the Western Black Sea Basin. Th e second period of magmatism developed on the Unaz Formation was more voluminous and was active during the Campanian. Stratigraphy, contact relationships and regional correlations indicate that the deposition of the Unaz Formation and similar deep marine red pelagic sediments in the Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean region were probably controlled by local and regional tectonic events and sea level and/or climate changes.",
