This grassland radiation introduced a biogeochemical mechanism for enhancing widespread and sustained mobilization of usable silica and other nutrients. Volcanism was probably responsible for episodic nonmarine diatomaceous sediments from the advent of the oldest known nonmarine diatoms in the Late Cretaceous through the Oligocene. Although prolific Miocene volcanism was undoubtedly still important in the development of many diatomites, feedback from grassland colonization of volcanic soils may explain why diatomaceous sedimentation surged in the Miocene following a more sparse pre-Miocene record.\nThe initial rise of the grass-dominated ecosystem, increased nonmarine diatomite accumulation, and Early Miocene evolutionary radiations of nonmarine diatom taxa are at least approximately coeval. Although the earliest known grass is Paleocene, multiple lines of evidence, including mollic-epipedon paleosols, fossil occurrences of hypsodontic ungulate grazers, and fossil phytoliths, suggest that the grass-dominated ecosystem did not expand significantly until Early Miocene. The grassland radiation apparently was delayed until Middle Miocene in parts of Eurasia, Africa, and Australia. If that delay is real, the diatom/diatomite record in those regions should coincide with it. The onset of increased Miocene diatomite accumulation is as yet imprecisely dated, but coincidence with the rise of the grassdominated ecosystem is predicted herein. Early Miocene diversifications of Actinocyclus and Thalassiosira diatoms are consistent temporally with grassland expansion where it is Early Miocene.\nSubsequent adjustments in the silica cycle also may be attributed to grasslands. Nonmarine diatom radiations in the Late Miocene and Pliocene coincide with sharp regressions that may have released nutrients and soluble phytolith opal stored in Miocene soils and paleosols as well as dissolved silica in soil pore waters. Regressional erosive pulses of phytoliths provide a new explanation for low Ge/ Si ratios in marine diatoms during Pleistocene glacial intervals. Nonmarine diatoms from regressive intervals should record lower Ge/Si ratios than before and after those regressions because of phytolith contributions with low Ge/Si ratios. Late Miocene radiations of C4 and moist tall-grass ecosystems may have mobilized even more silica than the short, dry-climate Early Miocene grasses. Abundance of diatomite may have fluctuated in concert with\nchanges in degree of volcanism, even after grassland expansion, but at substantially higher levels than before this new terrestrial ecosystem arose."

    "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "A commonly held perception is that the presence of nonmarine diatomite reflects volcanic sources of silica and other nutrients (e.g., Bramlette, 1946; Kociolek and Stoermer, 1989). However, Barron (1987) pointed out that lacustrine diatoms commonly flourish independently from volcanic sources of silica. The Miocene rise of the grassdominated ecosystem potentially was an important biogeochemical stimulus for sharply increased abundance of diatomaceous sediment in the Miocene. Grasslands typically take up several times more silica per unit of carbon than other terrestrial ecosystems (Jones and Handreck, 1967; Raven, 1983; Epstein, 1999). In doing so, they create a reservoir of soluble opal phytoliths, some of which are released quickly, such as during fires (e.g., Laclau et al., 2002; Pisaric, 2002), whereas others are stored in soil for later release (Meunier et al., 1999). Volcanism is a viable supplier of silica for diatomite deposition, and rivers draining volcanic-source terranes carry dissolved silica loads that rival the most silica-rich tropical rivers, such as the Amazon (Berner and Berner, 1996). Glass in volcanic ash delivered to lakes is another volcanic silica supply line (e.g., Dieke and Jones, 1980; Churchman, 2000). Such glass can dissolve quickly in lakes (Churchman, 2000). However, uptake of silica by grasses and dispersal of that silica via soluble opal grass phytoliths potentially can generate a more continuous, widespread, and sustained supply of dissolved silica than is likely from volcanism. Diatomite abundance increased sharply at about the same time as the grassland radiation rather than during earlier volcanic episodes, which suggests possible linkage between grasses and diatom accumulation. Although volcanism is a critical primary silica/nutrient source, the added impact of grasses may have been the key factor in mobilizing sufficient silica and other nutrients to boost diatomite accumulation and potentially trigger diatom diversification.\nThe evolutionary innovation of the grasses, and, particularly, the subsequent expansion of the grassland ecosystem, altered the Cenozoic landscape, and is thought to have had far-reaching effects on the Earth system. For example, coevolution between grasslands and the teeth of grazing mammals that began in the Miocene is well known (e.g., MacFadden, 1992; Jacobs et al., 1999). Retallack (2001) suggested that the spread of sod-forming grasslands in the Early Miocene drew down sufficient atmospheric CO2 to have triggered global cooling. Even if grasslands were not a climate trigger, they most likely contributed to positive feedback as icehouse conditions intensified. Worsley and Nance (1989) suggested that the first grasses increased silica mobilization from soils so as to stimulate marine diatom productivity. The later expansion of the widespread sod-forming grasslands documented from many Miocene locations (Retallack, 1997; Retallack, 2001; Jacobs et al., 1999) probably had a greater effect on the silica cycle than the Paleocene appearance of the grasses. Johannson (1993) may have been the first to\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/sepm/palaios/article-pdf/20/2/198/2840160/i0883-1351-020-02-0198.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\npropose that grasslands drove increased Miocene diatomite abundance and diversity. Kidder and Erwin (2001) invoked the Early Miocene expansion of grass-dominated ecosystems as a contributor to major marine diatomite and chert units along continental margins in deposits such as the mid-late Miocene Monterey Formation and its stratigraphic equivalents around the northern Pacific basin. Falkowski (2003) furthered the case for this biogeochemical terrestrial–marine linkage from considerations of marine plankton responses to climate change and carbon isotopic data. However, feedbacks from factors such as tectonics, cooling, and ocean circulation probably also contributed to the Monterey marine siliceous interval (Vincent and Berger, 1985). Additional potential inputs of dissolved silica to Miocene oceans include weathering of fresh silicate rocks during and after a significant Early Miocene pulse of Himalayan orogenic activity and the Middle Miocene Columbia River basalts (e.g., Zachos et al., 2001).\nPotential biogeochemical linkages between grasses and diatoms are explored herein with a focus on the nonmarine silica cycle to reduce the variables in evaluating the effects of grassland expansion. The initial expansion of the grass-dominated ecosystem, not the later expansion of C4 grasses, is the main thrust herein."

    "heading": "SILICA MOBILIZATION BY GRASSES",
    "text": "Grasses are among the most effective silica-accumulating plants. They extract dissolved silica from soil pore waters and deposit opaline phytoliths within and among their cellular tissues (Jones and Handreck, 1967; Lewin and Reimann, 1969; Raven, 1983; Epstein, 1999). Short grasses in dryland prairies commonly take up 1–3% SiO2 on a dry-weight basis. Most dicots take up less than 1% SiO2 (Jones and Handreck, 1967), and often less than 0.5% SiO2 (Marschner, 1995). Wetland-grass uptake commonly reaches 10–15% SiO2 (Jones and Handreck, 1967; Raven, 1983), but these grasses do not cover the vast areas occupied by savannas, prairies, and steppes. Modern C4 grasses sometimes incorporate up to 6–7% SiO2 by dry weight (Lanning and Eleuterius, 1989).\nAt least some of the silica mobilized by grasslands becomes trapped in a recycling loop. Grazing stimulates grass growth, and the feces of grazers help distribute nutrients and phytolith silica across the landscape. Fecal breakdown releases some phytoliths for transport by wind and water (Fig. 1A). Many of these phytoliths, along with those released during decomposition of dead grass, may not escape a large grassland without additional mechanisms. Under these conditions, considerable recycling of silica and nutrients is expected given the large distances that phytoliths must travel to escape a major grassland (Fig. 1A).\nGrass-dominated ecosystems probably release silica more readily than forest ecosystems, though confirming studies of this are needed. Modern tropical rain forests can recycle more than 90% of available silica efficiently (Alexandre et al., 1997). Silica recycling in grasslands appears to be considerably less efficient than in forests, based on both empirical and theoretical considerations. Measurements by Meunier et al. (1999) suggest that at least half of the phytolith silica in a bamboo forest is stored in the soil for recycling, but bamboo grasses are a poor analog for vast grassland prairies. Just how much phytolith silica escapes the grassland via typical levels of wind and runoff, as well as dissolved in groundwater, is not well known. Furthermore, the bamboo study by Meunier et al. (1999) did not consider the effects of fire—an important component of grass-dominated ecosystems. Grassland wildfires provide a significant mechanism for releasing large amounts of silica and other nutrients (Fig. 1A). Over 90% of the biomass burned in savanna fires is broken down and mobilized, leaving less than 10% of the original mass as ash (LaClau et al., 2002). Opaline phytoliths likely make up a significant component of that ash, which, in a denuded landscape, will be eroded readily and transported by wind and water. Macroscopic plant material can be transported at least 20 km via fires (Pisaric, 2002); thus, microscopic phytoliths should be even more mobile. Conservative estimates derived from LaClau et al. (2002) suggest that about 5 g of silica per m2 are released by fire from the nutrient-poor savannas of Congo.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/sepm/palaios/article-pdf/20/2/198/2840160/i0883-1351-020-02-0198.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nSeveral additional lines of evidence support escape of phytolith silica from grasslands. Phytolith escape from grasslands is evident from their presence in lacustrine sediments (Piperno, 2001). Some phytoliths transported by rivers will dissolve into silicic acid for diatom uptake, most likely after reaching a lake. The amount of dissolution that occurs during transport and in lakes prior to phytolith burial has not been reported, but that amount should approximate the grass-generated increase in silica available to diatoms. Diatom opal dissolves readily when delivered to the ocean (Conley et al., 1989; Conley, 1997). The lack of organic coatings, such as those that retard diatom dissolution (Bidle and Azam, 1999), should favor phytolith dissolution in nonmarine waters. On the other hand, phytolith dissolution rates in rivers probably are retarded by their typically high dissolved silica concentrations. Even if phytolith dissolution is minimal during river transport, lakes can favor diatom dissolution both in the water column and in the pore waters of lake-bottom sediments (Hecky et al., 1996), so many phytoliths presumably dissolve as well. Existing studies of phytoliths in lake sediments do not give an indication as to the quantity of phytoliths that may be transported. However, Ge/Si ratios offer an alternative approach. Derry et al. (2001) analyzed Ge/Si ratios in Hawaiian stream waters and concluded that more than 80% of the silica flux in those streams is derived from the phytolith pool. Finally, the sharp rise in abundance of Miocene diatomite cited herein, as compared to the minimal reported pre-Miocene evidence for such deposits, represents an indirect line of evidence. Most preMiocene nonmarine diatom occurrences are merely diatom-bearing sediment rather than diatomite, whereas most Miocene occurrences are true diatomites (Table 1). Although it is perhaps conceivable that grassland uptake of silica might lead to increased silicate weathering rates if recycling of opaline silica were minimal, it is not proposed herein that grasses raised those rates. Rather, the phytolith pool of opaline silica is suggested to have served a critical function in making silica available for diatoms. The greater amount of subsurface biomass in grass-dominated ecosystems versus forests should give them a significant advantage in maximizing uptake of silica and nutrients from soils—forests store far more carbon above ground than grasslands. Forests store 4.5 kg of carbon per square meter above ground whereas tall grasslands manage a value of only 0.7 kg C/m2 (McGuire et al., 1992). The underground story is quite the reverse, with tall grasslands storing 16 kg C/m2, surpassing the underground carbon storage value of 11.1 kg C/m2 for forests (McGuire et al., 1992). Given the smaller roots of grasses,\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/sepm/palaios/article-pdf/20/2/198/2840160/i0883-1351-020-02-0198.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nthis greater degree of underground biomass in the grassland ecosystem probably translates into more efficient distribution of fine roots that process a more significant surface area of soil, at least at some depths, than do forest root systems. More effective coverage of the underground nutrient reservoir means that when sufficient water is available, grasses should be able to mine more silica and nutrients per unit area of land than forests for an equal mass of carbon. Although grassland soils store and recycle nutrients, it may be shown ultimately that, relative to forests, grasses lose more silica from the system because some phytoliths escape this drier ecosystem before they dissolve.\nMany phytoliths in Cenozoic soils are likely to be preserved as opal on short geologic time scales, particularly in dry climates (Piperno, 1988). Others may be dissolved and recycled as silicic acid that further stimulates grass growth. Some dissolved silica will percolate into groundwater and escape to a river, a lake, or the sea. Some opalA phytoliths may be converted into opal-CT and quartz (e.g., Kastner et al., 1977), but proper burial conditions for this were rare in Cenozoic terrestrial sediments.\nRegressions induced by either eustasy or tectonics should release silica from soils by eroding opaline silica stored in grassland soils during downcutting and expansion of river drainage networks (Fig. 1B). Dissolution of opaline phytoliths from these young soils would sustain and/or boost populations of lacustrine diatoms. Dissolved silica in soil fluids also would be released during erosive intervals. Dickens (2003) suggested that sea-floor sediments serve as a gas-hydrate capacitor by storing carbon and then releasing that carbon in massive methane pulses that significantly affect climate. Opal phytoliths stored in soils may similarly serve as a biosiliceous capacitor, which may have significant impact on both the nonmarine and marine silica cycles when regressions release that soluble silica supply."

    "heading": "THE RISE OF GRASS-DOMINATED ECOSYSTEMS",
    "text": "Three lines of evidence support radiation of the grassdominated ecosystem in the Early Miocene of North America. First, Retallack (1997, 2001) reported widespread occurrences of mollic epipedon paleosols, which are characterized by a thick paleosol horizon bearing a distinctive fabric of organic crumbs produced by sod-forming grassland ecosystems. These paleosols suggest the rise of sod-forming grasslands in the Early Miocene (;20 Ma) in the western and central United States. Mollic epipedons appeared more recently in East Africa (;18 Ma) and not until about 13–15 Ma in Pakistan (Retallack, 2001). Second, high-crowned ungulate teeth that evolved in response to grassland ecosystems (MacFadden, 1992; Jacobs et al., 1999) also appeared in the Early Miocene of North America and, like the grassland paleosols, appeared later in Africa and Eurasia (Jacobs et al., 1999). Such teeth appeared in Australian marsupials somewhat later in the mid–late Miocene (Jacobs et al., 1999). Third, a sharp increase in grass phytolith abundance in the Early Miocene also supports expansion of the grass-dominated ecosystem at this time (Stromberg, 2004).\nGiven their potential for high levels of silica uptake, later Miocene appearances of the tall, moist grasslands (Re-\ntallack, 1997; Retallack, 2001) and the C4 grasslands in tropical climates (e.g., Cerling et al., 1993; Quade and Cerling, 1995) may have triggered a response in the diatom record. Retallack (2001) integrated values for depth to the calcic horizon as an approximation of paleo-rainfall penetration with his mollic epipedon results and concluded that the first sod-forming grasslands were short-grass dry prairies (Fig. 2). Moister tall-grass prairies appeared later—at perhaps 8 Ma in the western and central U.S. and at about 4–5 Ma in East Africa and Pakistan (Retallack, 2001). The rises of the C4 and tall-grass ecosystems later in the Miocene overlap temporally with one another (Fig. 2), and some of the tall grasses probably were C4 grasses. In tropical regions, where C4 grasses thrive, the effects of these two later grass radiations on the silica cycle are difficult to separate."

    "heading": "TESTS AND RELATION TO GE/SI RECORDS",
    "text": "Examination of diatomite abundance constitutes one test for increased supplies of dissolved silica and other nutrients that are critical to diatom productivity (e.g., Paasche and Ostergren, 1980; Laws and Bannister, 1980). Sharp Miocene increases in both the numbers of diatomite deposits and the volume of diatomite deposition are apparent from general observations. The number of deposits of lacustrine diatomite increased significantly in the Miocene (e.g., Starratt, 1998; Cohen, 2003). Diatomite ore records approximate volumetric changes in diatomite accumulation through time, and most nonmarine diatomite ores are extracted from Miocene and younger strata (Dolley, 2000).\nThe Miocene rise in nonmarine diatomite abundance probably is not an artifact of diagenesis, which typically converts diatomite to chert at low burial temperatures of about 508C (Harwood, 1999), for two reasons. First, burial conditions for conversion of opal-A to chert are uncommon in such young terrestrial facies. Second, well-preserved nonmarine pre-Miocene diatomites and other diatom-rich sediments exist, although they are not common (Table 1). The sudden burst in diatomite abundance in the Miocene was more likely a function of increased diatom productivity rather than diagenetic conversion of diatomite to chert. The latter would result in a gradual decline in diatomite abundance in progressively older strata.\nPreliminary assessment of nonmarine diatom occurrences reveals only seven pre-Miocene nonmarine diatom occurrences from four regions, and only one of those was reported as diatomite (Table 1). Contrastingly, large numbers of Miocene deposits occur in a wide range of locations, and many of these are diatomite, rather than simply diatom-bearing sediment, suggesting a significant increase in diatom production (Table 1). All of the pre-Miocene examples are associated with volcanism, but a few Miocene examples are not (Table 1).\nDiatomite probably can form via stimulus by either volcanism or grassland activity. The Miocene represents the first time in Earth history when the effects of both acted in concert, and the colonization of volcanic soils by grasses likely would have set up a strong feedback, which may explain not only why diatomite abundance increased sharply when the grass-dominated ecosystem expanded, but also why diatomites remained relatively scarce before the Miocene.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/sepm/palaios/article-pdf/20/2/198/2840160/i0883-1351-020-02-0198.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nMiocene nonmarine diatom radiations (Fig. 2) also serve to test for pulses of silica supply and other nutrients. Following the Cretaceous appearance of nonmarine diatoms (Chacon-Baca et al., 2002), Cenozoic nonmarine diatom diversity in North America was fairly low and static through the Eocene and Oligocene (Bradbury and Krebs, 1995; Bradbury, 1999). Two marine genera, Thalassiosira and Actinocyclus, radiated into nonmarine environments in the Early Miocene (Bradbury, 1999), not long after the radiation of sod-forming short-grass prairies (Fig. 2). Nonmarine diatom radiations, comparable to those illustrated in Figure 2, also characterize the assemblages in Russia (Khursevich, 1991), suggesting a consistent pattern throughout the northern hemisphere. Increased nutrient availability can expand both biomass and diversity (Bambach, 1993; Vermeij, 1995), although the role of consumers in driving diversity increases can be difficult to separate from that of nutrient supply (Worm, 2002). Diatom evolution in lakes may provide an excellent example of linkage between nutrient availability and diversity, given that the silica and other nutrients mobilized by grasslands would be distributed to a wide variety of relatively isolated lake niches.\nSubsequent diversifications of nonmarine diatoms also may be related to grass-driven silica/nutrient mobilization. The Late Miocene radiations of Mesodictyon and Cyclotella coincide with one of the largest rapid sea-level drops in the Cenozoic (Fig. 2). This could reflect significant erosion and release of phytoliths and silica-rich waters that were stored in young soils prior to downcutting and drainage network expansion as base level fell (Fig. 1B). Those processes likely would have destroyed existing lakes and created new ones. There appears, however, to be no evolutionary response in the nonmarine diatom record to pre-Miocene regressions. The Pliocene radiations of Cyclostephanous and Stephanodiscus occurred during an interval of pronounced fluctuations of sea level (Fig. 2) that began near the end of the Late Miocene, but linkage between these radiations and sea-level change is weak. If Pliocene regressions that extensively eroded phytolith-rich soils turn out to be marked by pulses of diatomite, support for a grassland effect on the silica cycle would be more robust. Data for such a test are not presently available.\nAnother test can be derived from relative timing of grassland appearances and diatomite occurrences, but both of these require better documentation. If the grassland radiation is diachronous on a global scale, as suggested earlier (Jacobs et al., 1999; Retallack, 2001), both diatomite abundance and diatom radiations comparable to those in North America (Fig. 2) and Russia (Khursevich, 1991) should reflect the differential timing of the spread of the grass-dominated ecosystem. Conversely, future research eventually may show that the rise of the grassdominated ecosystem was more-or-less synchronous globally, and it is only patchiness of the known record that suggests diachronism. A globally synchronous rise of grass-dominated ecosystems should be matched by a coeval and synchronous burst in nonmarine diatomite abundance.\nDiatom diversification is not apparent from existing data when the tall and C4 grasses become abundant (Fig. 2), which argues against a grassland trigger at that time. Similarly, no data are evident that suggest a Late Miocene pulse in lacustrine diatomite accumulation (Fig. 2). Such a\npulse would be expected if the rise of C4 grasses mobilized more silica than their C3 predecessors. The moist environments in which the tall grasslands thrive and the tropical settings of the C4 grasses may favor enough phytolith dissolution and silica recycling to prevent a diatomite pulse, particularly if some of the soil waters were seasonally alkaline.\nVolcanism also can supply silica and other nutrients for genesis of diatom-rich deposits. Silica release from opaline phytolith dissolution can be double that of silica release from weathering of silicates (Alexandre et al., 1997), but probably not twice that of chemically unstable volcanic glasses. Although volcanics have been suggested as critical in supplying the silica and other nutrients for genesis of diatomite (e.g., Bramlette, 1946; Kociolek and Stoermer, 1989), Barron (1987) has pointed out that lacustrine diatoms commonly flourish independently from volcanic sources of silica. Barron (1987) also suggested that the common association of interbedded volcanics and diatomites in the geologic record may reflect a preservational role for volcanic rocks, which often are more resistant to erosion than diatomite, rather than the volcanics being a silica source.\nVolcanic rocks are, nevertheless, a viable source of silica and other nutrients. Prior to the rise of sod-forming, grassdominated ecosystems, the occurrence of lacustrine diatomites and diatomaceous sediments (Table 1) probably were triggered episodically by volcanogenic releases of silica and other nutrients (Fig. 2D). Once grass-dominated ecosystems established a more continuous supply of silica and other nutrients, the potential for generating diatomite probably increased significantly. The sporadic occurrence of diatomite prior to the Miocene suggests that volcanism alone is only a moderately effective stimulus for producing diatomite.\nThree hypothetical pathways that the diatomite records may have followed are illustrated in Figure 2D. Following the aforementioned pre-Miocene sporadic pulses, diatomite abundance may simply have increased quickly to a new equilibrium in the Miocene. Alternatively, there may have been a second increase in diatomite abundance when the C4 grasses became abundant. Another possibility is the Early Miocene rise of grasslands triggered a pulse of diatomite accumulation as diatoms capitalized on the grass-generated increase in nutrient and silica availability, followed by a decline to a steady state that was higher than pre-Miocene levels. Regression-induced pulses of diatomite abundance suggested earlier also are possible. Other patterns may have occurred. Data of higher resolution could narrow the scope of possibilities, particularly if combined with Ge/Si data.\nMarine Ge/Si ratios record differential terrestrial weathering (e.g., Froelich et al., 1992; Kurtz et al., 2002). Froelich et al. (1992) used Ge/Si values analyzed from marine diatoms to suggest that glacial intervals in the past 400,000 years were characterized by delivery of higher amounts of riverine silica to ocean waters than during interglacial intervals. They noted that this is opposite to the expectation that higher silica fluxes should be generated during warm interglacial intervals when chemical weathering should be more intense. To explain their suggested doubling of silica flux from land to oceans during Pleistocene glacial intervals, Froelich et al. (1992) suggested that\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/sepm/palaios/article-pdf/20/2/198/2840160/i0883-1351-020-02-0198.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019\nF IG\nU R\nE 2—\nT im\nin g\nof gr\nas sl\nan d\nex pa\nns io\nn, no\nnm ar\nin e\ndi at\nom ev\nol ut\nio n,\nse a\nle ve\nl, an\nd ac\ncu m\nul at\nio n\nof no\nnm ar\nin e\ndi at\nom ite\n.

Froelich et al. (1992) correctly noted that chemical weathering alone may not suffice to raise dissolved silica input to oceans because physical removal of overburden is necessary to keep rates of chemical weathering at high levels (Stallard, 1988). The problem with invoking physical transport to explain the doubled silica input during glacial advances is that much of the silica supplied to the ocean in this manner is detrital quartz, which is unlikely to dissolve rapidly enough for use by diatoms. However, glacial grinding may abrade rocks and sediment to the point at which silicates less stable than quartz will dissolve. Opaline phytoliths probably will dissolve even more rapidly, and will be usable by the diatoms as discussed earlier (Conley, 1997). The suggested importance of phytoliths has significant bearing on this question because grassland area was considerably higher during the last glacial interval, and, hence, could have generated significantly more phytoliths. Adams et al. (1990) reported that tropical grasslands and savannas, which occur at the warm latitudes where most dissolved silica is generated, expanded by 59%. Tropical grasslands alone expanded in area by 73% during the last glacial interval at 18 Ka (Adams et al., 1990). Even if the decreased areal coverage of temperate and montane grasslands where glaciers cannibalized those landscapes are taken into account, total grassland area was still 22% larger at 18 Ka than it is today (Adams et al., 1990). This greater amount of grassland, particularly in the warm climates where it probably matters most, would result in a much larger phytolith contribution to the silica flux.\nTwo additional predictive tests rely on Ge/Si ratios. First, pre-Miocene Ge/Si ratios in the few available nonmarine diatomites should be higher than post-Miocene values after grasslands became well established. Clay minerals in soil preferentially remove Ge during weathering (Kurtz et al., 2002), thus lowering the Ge/Si ratio of waters draining those landscapes. Because grasses take up very low Ge/Si values of ;0.3 mmol/mol (Derry et al., 2001), increased phytolith contributions should further lower Ge/Si ratios in runoff. Second, drops in sea level that could have erosively released large volumes of phytoliths and nutrients stored in unlithified soils (Figs. 1 and 2) should be represented by diatom Ge/Si values that are lower than before and after those regressions. These hypothetical tests await further collection of Ge/Si data.\nThe questions considered herein ultimately may go beyond consideration of triggers by volcanism, grasslands, and combinations of the two. Miocene Earth-system adjustments, such as Himalayan orogenic activity and tectonic activity in other parts of the globe, may have resulted not only in increased volcanism, but also in cool, dry climates that favored grassland expansion. Considered from this broader perspective, volcanic- and grass-enhanced supplies of silica and other nutrients simply may be components—albeit important ones—in a feedback loop of Earth-system change."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "The initial Early Miocene expansion of the grass-dominated ecosystem fundamentally changed the nature of the nonmarine silica cycle by mobilizing and releasing silica and other nutrients more effectively than previous ecosystems. This new ecosystem probably served as a positive feedback to magnify volcanic and other sources of silica and other nutrients, as well as to distribute them more widely and sustainably than volcanic sources alone. Opaline phytoliths secreted by grasses serve to effectively distribute soluble silica during short-term release (e.g., when fires facilitate widespread phytolith dispersal). Other opal phytoliths stored in soils can be released later when regression-induced downcutting expands drainage networks. Miocene increases in diatomite abundance and diversification of diatom taxa generally are consistent with the predicted grass-driven increase in silica and nutrient mobilization, but the timing of the increased diatomite accumulation needs to be constrained better. Nonmarine diatomite accumulation should show a marked increase when grasslands radiated (apparently diachronously) in different parts of the world. Nonmarine diatoms diversified in North America and the former Soviet Union in the Early Miocene, just about when the grasslands expanded. Better age control can serve to test for this linkage. The Late Miocene increase in abundance of silica-rich grasses in tall-grass moist-prairie settings and C4 grasses in tropical settings do not appear to have affected diatom diversity. Whether or not there were Late Miocene increases in diatomite abundance is unclear.\nLate Miocene and Pliocene diatom diversifications may have been triggered at least in part by silica and nutrient release from soils eroded during regressions. Regressions are predicted to have triggered as yet unknown pulses in nonmarine diatomite deposition. Ratios of Ge/Si (Froelich et al., 1992) suggest doublings of usable silica flux to the oceans during Pleistocene glacial intervals. Grass-generated phytoliths provide a more suitable mechanism (or at the very least a complimentary one) than detrital quartz for facilitating that flux, and perhaps one that is more effective than weathering of less stable silicates. Lows in Ge/ Si ratios in both marine and nonmarine diatoms are expected for Miocene and subsequent regressions."

  "abstractText": "The Early Miocene rise of the grass-dominated ecosystem is a plausible trigger for a sharp Miocene increase in accumulation of nonmarine diatomaceous sediment as well as diversification of nonmarine diatoms. This grassland radiation introduced a biogeochemical mechanism for enhancing widespread and sustained mobilization of usable silica and other nutrients. Volcanism was probably responsible for episodic nonmarine diatomaceous sediments from the advent of the oldest known nonmarine diatoms in the Late Cretaceous through the Oligocene. Although prolific Miocene volcanism was undoubtedly still important in the development of many diatomites, feedback from grassland colonization of volcanic soils may explain why diatomaceous sedimentation surged in the Miocene following a more sparse pre-Miocene record. The initial rise of the grass-dominated ecosystem, increased nonmarine diatomite accumulation, and Early Miocene evolutionary radiations of nonmarine diatom taxa are at least approximately coeval. Although the earliest known grass is Paleocene, multiple lines of evidence, including mollic-epipedon paleosols, fossil occurrences of hypsodontic ungulate grazers, and fossil phytoliths, suggest that the grass-dominated ecosystem did not expand significantly until Early Miocene. The grassland radiation apparently was delayed until Middle Miocene in parts of Eurasia, Africa, and Australia. If that delay is real, the diatom/diatomite record in those regions should coincide with it. The onset of increased Miocene diatomite accumulation is as yet imprecisely dated, but coincidence with the rise of the grassdominated ecosystem is predicted herein. Early Miocene diversifications of Actinocyclus and Thalassiosira diatoms are consistent temporally with grassland expansion where it is Early Miocene. Subsequent adjustments in the silica cycle also may be attributed to grasslands. Nonmarine diatom radiations in the Late Miocene and Pliocene coincide with sharp regressions that may have released nutrients and soluble phytolith opal stored in Miocene soils and paleosols as well as dissolved silica in soil pore waters. Regressional erosive pulses of phytoliths provide a new explanation for low Ge/ Si ratios in marine diatoms during Pleistocene glacial intervals. Nonmarine diatoms from regressive intervals should record lower Ge/Si ratios than before and after those regressions because of phytolith contributions with low Ge/Si ratios. Late Miocene radiations of C4 and moist tall-grass ecosystems may have mobilized even more silica than the short, dry-climate Early Miocene grasses. Abundance of diatomite may have fluctuated in concert with changes in degree of volcanism, even after grassland expansion, but at substantially higher levels than before this new terrestrial ecosystem arose.",
