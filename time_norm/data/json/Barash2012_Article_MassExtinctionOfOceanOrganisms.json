Up to 96% of the marine invertebrates became extinct. The biodiversity decreased from ~250 thousand species to less than 10 thousand. In addition, ~70% of the species of terrestrial vertebrates died off. The scale, specifics, and the time structure of this disaster and the reasons for it can be determined from various paleontological, lithological, petro graphic, chemical, isotopic, and other types of data generated when examining the sediments of the Per mian–Triassic boundary (PTB) interval.\nA specific feature of the Permian paleogeography was the existence of the supercontinent Pangea stretching from one pole to the other and of two oceans—Panthalassa and Thetys. The bed of the Per mian–Triassic Superocean Panthalassa occupying two thirds of the Earth’s surface was almost com pletely absorbed as a result of subduction. Fragments of mid oceanic rocks were preserved as accretionary blocks near active continental margins. Sediments of the PTB interval in the central parts of the ocean are represented by shallow water carbonates of paleoa tolls, and sediments of deep water regions, by sili ceous deposits. Sediments of peripheral and shelf seas were encountered in many parts of the present day continents.\nDuring the disastrous events of the PTB interval, archaic Paleozoic fishes (acanthodians and placo derms) died off, as did trilobites, sea scorpions (Eurypterida), graptolites, and fusulinids (bottom for aminifera). Others survived the disaster with an abrupt reduction in their biodiversity. 97% of the foraminifera (Foraminifera), 99% of the radiolarians (Radiolaria), 79% of the bryozoans (Bryozoa), and 96% of the bra chiopods (Brachipoda) became extinct with produc tids characteristic of the Paleozoic completely disap pearing. 59% of the bivalves (Bivalvia), 98% of the gas tropods (Gastropoda), 97% of the ammonites (Ammonoidea), 98% of the echinoderms (Echinoder mata), and 59% of the ostracods (Ostracoda) also died off [12, 16, 33–35].\nThe extinction of organisms occupying different environmental niches was not simultaneous. Both the extinction of biota and the global changes in the ambi ent conditions occurred during two phases: the first one at the boundary between the Middle and Late Per mian (Р2/Р3, 260 Ma) and the second at the PTB (251–252 Ma) (Fig. 1).\nA specific feature of the first phase is the predomi nant deaths of benthos organisms (rugose coral, fusulinids, brachiopods, bryozoans, etc) explained by the beginning of oceanic anoxia. During the second phase (PTB), the biodiversity decreased primarily due to nekton and plankton. At both levels of the Per mian–Triassic extinction, the ratios of the biomarkers\nDOI: 10.1134/S000143701201002X\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 52 No. 2 2012\nMASS EXTINCTION OF OCEAN ORGANISMS AT THE PALEOZOIC–MESOZOIC 239\nmanifest values normally associated with anoxic con ditions [50]. At first (Р2/Р3), the anoxic conditions developed in the deep water environment, but they later (PTB) spread to the shelves dragging the chemocline to the ocean’s surface. Low oxygen or anoxic conditions embraced almost the entire mass of the ocean waters (superanoxia).\nDuring the Late Permian, large reef constructions developed, while the end of the Permian was charac terized by the termination of the long term develop ment of rugose and tabulate corals. The development of reefs ceased for a period of 7–8 Myr. The environ mental characteristics of the reefs at the PTB interval correspond to the pattern of a reduction in the quan tity of the atmospheric oxygen during the Permian [20]. After almost complete extinction at the PTB, there are practically no radiolarians in the sediments for ~1 Myr. The mass mortality of the radiolarians is explained by\nthe global collapse of the bioproductivity. The degra dation of fusulinids and, equally, the simultaneous similar development of bivalves and rugose corals could also have been caused by the extinction of sym biotic algae, which, in turn, was probably due to the reduced insolation [42]. The quantitative examination of the morphology of brachiopods indicated a consid erable reduction in their shell sizes before, during, and after the PTB interval [19]. The authors explain this by a reduction in and the collapse of the primary produc tion confirming the data on other organisms.\nA detailed stratigraphic analysis of the rock sequence from the Middle to Late Permian boundary to the Lower Triassic was conducted in Chaotian, China [22]. Two considerable mass disappearance horizons were identified, one at the Р2/Р3 boundary, and the other at the PTB. At each of the boundaries, the biodiversity abruptly reduces, and later new fauna\n240\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 52 No. 2 2012\nBARASH\nappears. Acid tuff layers are present at these disappear ance horizons. Thus, the Late Permian biosphere underwent the effect of strong explosive volcanism twice. Both of the tuff layers were traced at the same stratigraphic levels in South China and Japan, thus confirming the large scale association between the explosive volcanism and mass extinctions.\nThe rock sequences of the PTB interval in the Meishan prefecture in South China were examined in the greatest detail [24] (Fig. 2). A statistical analysis of the distribution of 162 genera and 333 species from 15 different groups of marine organisms was conducted. The extinction at the PTB occurred for 3 Myr both before and after it. However, the extinction was the most intense and sudden (for a period of less than 500 years) 251.4 Myr ago. The event coincides with an abrupt reduction in the δ13Сcarb and a ~100 times increase in the number of presumably volcanic micro spherules compared with the overlying and underlying sediments. In the PTB region, interbeds of pyrite (evi dence of anoxia) and volcanic ash are observed. Finally, a rapid transgression occurred at the PTB (a cosmopolitan conodont species H. parvus appeared). An elevated Ir content was discovered, which is an order of magnitude higher than the background con centration in the Upper Permian and Lower Triassic sediments [51]. This rock sequence and equally a number of others are characterized by abundant fungi\nspores, which is an indicator of a strong disturbance in the land ecosystems.\nThe examination of the distribution of a number of chemical components and the relationship between the isotopes allows defining the ambient conditions and the processes of their change during the Permian. Siliceous mid oceanic sediments in Japan and British Columbia (Canada) reflect superanoxic conditions (pyretic alteration, the sulfur isotope ratio, the geochemistry of the organic matter, rare elements, and dolomite concretions). The anoxia lasted for ~20 Myr from the Late Permian to the Middle Triassic [20]. For 50 Myr before and after that interval, oxygen satu rated waters dominated near the deep water portion of the seabed. The oxygen concentration in the atmo sphere also reduced at the end of the Permian, whereas, at the Carboniferous–Permian boundary, it reached the maximum level of 35%. At the end of the Permian, it decreased to 15% [45].\nAccording to Hallam and Wignall [16], the princi pal episode of global warming at the end of the Per mian was caused by a strong increase in the CO2 con tent in the atmosphere as a result of strong volcanism. The level of atmospheric CO2 expressed as parts per million by volume (μL L–1) increased from 1500 to"

In combination with the reduced oxygen con centration in the water, this created conditions for\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 52 No. 2 2012\nMASS EXTINCTION OF OCEAN ORGANISMS AT THE PALEOZOIC–MESOZOIC 241\nanoxia. Most scientists consider anoxia as a direct rea son for the mass mortality of organisms, but others believe that hypercapnia—CO2 intoxication—was more harmful [30]. Under the anoxic conditions of the end of the Permian, the sulfate reducing bacteria Chlorobiaceae could become dominant in the oceanic ecosystems by discharging hydrogen sulfide, which was deleterious for terrestrial and marine animals and made the ozone layer of the atmosphere thinner. As a result, organisms were exposed to increased deleteri ous ultraviolet radiation [31]. In addition, hydrogen sulfide intoxication by itself could be one of the rea sons for the extinction [14].\nDuring the Phanerozoic, the Mg/Ca ratio in the sea water varied from 1.0 to 5.2, which was caused by the predominant accumulation of either aragonite and high magnesium calcite (mMg/Ca > 2; “aragonite seas”) or low magnesium calcite (mMg/Ca < 2; “cal cite seas”). This ratio is governed by the mixing of the hydrothermal waters of middle ridges and river waters and is traced in the geological record (fluid inclusions in primary marine halite, the Mg content in fossil sea urchins and mollusks, and the primary mineralogy of sediments of abiotic carbonates and marine evapor ites). The Mg/Ca ratio in sea water varies in inverse proportion to the global rate of growth of the oceanic crust [40]. The end of the Paleozoic to the beginning of Mesozoic was a period of predominantly aragonite sedimentation. The rate of global rifting was therefore minimal.\nAt the PTB, some isotope ratios changed abruptly. The abrupt decrease in δ18O observed at the PTB interval was caused by warming [16]. Negative devia tions of the δ13C values were observed for both extinc tion phases (P2/P3 and PTB). At P2/P3, a 2–4‰ neg ative shift in the δ13C values in the carbonates and organic matter was discovered in marine (including mid oceanic) and terrestrial sediments in South China, Japan, British Columbia (Canada), Greece, and Armenia [20, 21, 24]. An unusually high positive shift in δ13C (5–7‰) was observed before this negative shift. The interval of positive deviations that lasted 3– 4 Myr was called the Kamura event. It may represent a high bioproductivity interval caused by the activation of vertical circulation. The following processes are suggested to explain the rapid decrease in δ13C at the PTB: a reduction in the supply of biogenic elements in the euphotic zone, a decrease in the bioproductivity, the effects of volcanism, weathering, gas hydrate dis charge, and biomass oxidation [16].\nThe negative shift in the δ13C in the rock sequences of the PTB interval in South China might have been caused by eruptions of the Siberian Traps, a change in the supply ratio between the terrestrial and marine organic carbon, or a change in the dominant commu nities of marine organisms due to the changing envi ronment. Thus, a transition from cyanobacteria to phototrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria is assumed for the shelf environment due to the rise of euxinic water\nto the photic zone. The diagenetic processes led to a change in the isotope ratios [38, 39]. At both levels of the Permian–Triassic extinction, the ratios of the biomarkers manifest values normally associated with anoxic conditions [50]. At first (Р2/Р3), the anoxic conditions developed in a deep water environment, but they later (PTB) spread to the shelves dragging the chemocline to the ocean’s surface.\nD. Erwin [12] believes that the only process that can quantitatively correspond to the total global decrease in the 13C/12C ratio of ~10‰ is methane dis charge from gas hydrates of marine sediments. This occurs in the case of a rapid increase in the tempera ture or a pressure decrease. Such a process might, for instance, take place during the eruption of the lavas of the Siberian Traps onto the beds of the neighboring Arctic seas.\nThe reduction in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio at the end of the Permian to the Phanerozoic minimum is explained by the change in the weathering pattern during the land aridization [20]. The aridization was caused by the appearance of the giant supercontinent Pangea, warming, and the formation of the atmospheric circu lation system in which the supply of moisture in the central parts of the continent was minimal.\nA shift in the δ34S values was also observed at the PTB interval. The following factors are suggested to explain it: (1) the predominant withdrawal of 32S dur ing the pyrite burial via the bacterial sulfate reduction must have increased the δ34S in the evaporites [16]; (2) the formation of framboidal pyrite with wide spread euxinic conditions [49]; (3) sulfur discharge from the mantle during the impact event [25].\nA number of hypotheses were suggested to explain the extinction of organisms: the disappearance of environmental niches in the course of the integration of the continental plates into Pangea; a fall in the sea level to the minimum value during the Phanerozoic; transgressions; climatic fluctuations (in particular, warming and acid rainfalls as a result of volcanism and methane discharge from gas hydrates); hypersalinity; anoxia; elevated СО2 and H2S contents; volcanism. A shift in the facies as a result of any changes (tempera ture, sea level, etc) had an adverse impact, particularly in the marginal and shallow water regions. All these factors that reduced the biodiversity are substantiated by paleontological, geological, geochemical, isotopic, and other types of data. Some of these factors are in subordination to others, while obvious relations between others are lacking or unknown. Why did dif ferent processes harmful for the biota proceed simul taneously within a limited time interval from the geo logical viewpoint? Did asteroid impacts play any role 65 Myr ago at the Mesozoic–Cenozoic boundary and during a number of other events of mass mortality of organisms [1, 2]?\nDuring the Permian, the sea level lowered to the Phanerozoic minimum, which is associated with Pan gea’s integration. This happened ~260 Myr ago [18].\n242\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 52 No. 2 2012\nBARASH\nAt the same time, a short term cooling probably took place, which was determined from the Late Guade loupean limestone from the low latitude regions of the Panthalassa Ocean [21] and from the glacial tillite in the high latitudes. A transgression followed it in the Thetys region. A regression occurred again at the end of the Permian (PTB). For a long time, rapid changes in the sea level were considered as one of the major reasons for the mass extinction of marine organisms. However, the examination of a number of rock sequences at the PTB interval in combination with an improved conodont biostratigraphy cast doubt on the importance of the transgression–regression patterns. Although the end of the Permian is normally consid ered to be a period of the low standing of the sea level, new data indicate that mass extinction occurred dur ing the phases of a rapid rise and expansion of the low oxygen or anoxic deep waters in shallow water envi ronments [17]. Shelf communities suffered the most.\nD. Kidder and T. Worsley [27] described the changes in the climate system at the end of the Per mian to the beginning of the Triassic and the associ ated processes. During the Permian, the Hercynian orogenesis gradually stopped, which weakened the chemical weathering of silicates. The supply of bio genic components in the biosphere was reduced accordingly; it decreased even more as a result of the increased СО2 content and warming. The polar ice melting reduced the submersion of cold sea waters rich in О2 and biogenic elements. The pole–equator tem perature gradient decreased, upwellings relaxed, and the productivity and carbonate sedimentation reduced even more. As the climate became warmer, arid condi tions embraced the middle latitudes causing a latitudi nal expansion of the mid latitude atmospheric circu lation Ferrel cells, while the polar cells reduced. The increased coastal evaporation led to the submersion of warm surface waters deficient in О2 and biogenic water elements and to the formation of poorly circulated bottom waters. These waters transported heat to the high latitudes and rose in upwelling zones. When the submersion of subpolar waters stopped, the ocean was rapidly filled in with warm low oxygen water. Trans gressions brought anoxic conditions to the shelf regions. Anoxia or hypoxia was a reason for the mass extinctions, which is proved for the end of the Permian by the investigations of the facies, geochemistry, and biomarkers [14, 49]. Short term cold events are also known for the end of the Permian; these periods caused a shift in the facies and had an adverse effect on the shelf ecosystems.\nThe comprehensive modeling of the climate condi tions for the end of the Permian [29] indicated that the sea surface temperatures (SST) in the tropical zone were comparable to the present day temperatures, but those in the high latitudes were 8–10°C higher. The salinity also increased. The modeling of the tempera ture at the PTB interval for the inland parts of the\nsupercontinent Pangea manifested very high average annual values (over 40°C) [28].\nThe most popular hypothesis tries to explain the Late Permian extinction by large scale volcanism pri marily due to the fact that the time ranges of these two events coincide. Both basalt magmatism of mid oce anic ridges and within plate magmatism existed. Fel sic volcanism also made its contribution to the sup pression of the Permian biosphere in a few large igne ous rock provinces in East Pangea. Temporal coincidence was noted between the basalt eruptions in South China and the first phase of the biota’s extinc tion at the end of the Permian, and also between the largest eruptions of the Siberian Traps and the second, principal phase of extinction.\nVolcanism at the PTB, felsic and medium, was widespread along the western edge of Panthalassa, in South Primorye [48], South China [53], and Gond wana [46]. It could have been associated with plate convergence or rifting. The subsequent subduction hid the sources of the eruptions. However, in South China alone, the volcanoclastic rock layer covers over 1 mil lion km2. The volcanism had an explosive nature. In the case of such volcanism, enormous masses of gases and ashes are discharged. The volcanism took place in the carbonate sediment area, which led to a discharge of large volumes of CH4 and CO2 supplementing the effect of the Siberian Traps.\nThe Siberian Traps are a result of the largest volca nic eruption in the Earth’s history (Fig. 3). Traps are widespread on the entire East Siberian Platform, in the Khatanga downfold, and in the Minusinsk depres sion; there is a magmatic zone on the bed of the Kara Sea as well. Apart from trap fields and interstratal lava intrusions (sills), enormous regions within this volca nic province are covered with volcanic tuffs—a result of explosive eruptions. The trap province encompasses ~2 million km2; its initial size is estimated at 7 million km2; and the volume of the lavas, at 1–4 × 106 km3 [5]. The thickness of the volcanic rocks is occasionally considerable, e.g., 3.5 km in the vicinity of Norilsk. Siberian trap volcanism began 251.7 ± 0.4 Myr ago and relaxed 251.1 ± 0.3 Myr ago. It was most intense 250.2 ± 0.3 Myr ago. The coincidence of the time interval of this eruption and the age of the PTB con firms that this was the principal cause of the mass extinction of organisms at the end of the Permian. When up to 4 × 106 km3 of volcanic material was erupted within a short time (~0.6 Myr), large quanti ties of CO2, SO2, fluorine, and chlorine must have been released quite rapidly to destroy the atmospheric and biosphere systems [26]. These components of vol canic outbursts to the atmosphere could affect the ambient conditions. The discharge of СО2 led to glo bal warming, and the release of SO2 and sulfate aero sols resulted in global cooling. Halogens and their compounds caused a reduction in the ozone content and an increase in the deleterious ultraviolet radiation [37]. Where the eruptions of the Siberian Traps\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 52 No. 2 2012\nMASS EXTINCTION OF OCEAN ORGANISMS AT THE PALEOZOIC–MESOZOIC 243\noccurred in the areas with coal fields and oil shales, enormous volumes of СО2 and methane must have been emitted into the atmosphere in the case of ther mal metamorphism. This strengthened the green house effect [43]. The marine sediments of the end of the Permian that deposited immediately before the mass mortality contain noticeable quantities of free car bon that formed when coal and oil shales burned and then spread wide. These carbon particles were similar to the present day products of coal burning and could have poisoned the aquatic environment [13].\nThus, the eruptions caused a “volcanic winter” with global cooling due to the aerosol screening of the atmosphere with cinder particles, gas discharge, and acid rainfalls poisonous to plants. The main basalt eruption was followed by a “volcanic summer,” which delayed the recovery of the biodiversity and enhanced the ocean’s stratification. The decomposition of the gas hydrates led to the emission of enormous quanti ties of СО2 and methane into the atmosphere and a very strong deleterious greenhouse effect. The rapid global warming caused environmental changes harm\nful to the biosphere: weakening of upwellings, ocean stagnation, and a decrease in the productivity. This occurred twice, during the first and the second phases of the Late Permian extinction.\nAlthough the factors considered had an adverse effect on the biodiversity, they developed relatively slowly and could not have caused the sudden mass mortality of organisms globally. The abrupt changes in the environmental conditions could have possibly been triggered by impacts of large asteroids or comets. In is only in the recent years that the effect of impact events has been proved. Material typical of impact events was encountered at the PTB in a number of rock sequences: shocked quartz in Antarctica and Australia and Fe–Ni–Si and Fe–Ni fragments and spherules and fullerenes with indicators of extraterres trial gases (3He) in China and Japan (the latter possi bly formed somewhat earlier). According to Kaiho et al. [25], noticeable variations in the values of 34S/32S and 87Sr/86Sr in Chinese rock sequences of the end of the Permian, along with high concentrations of impact minerals and a considerable reduction in the contents\n244\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 52 No. 2 2012\nBARASH\nof Mn, P, Ca, and microfossils, prove the fall of an asteroid or a comet to the ocean, which caused a mas sive discharge of sulfur from the mantle to the ocean– atmosphere system. This led to a considerable decrease in the oxygen concentration, acid rainfalls, and a biotic crisis. J. Théry et al. [44] present data on the microspherules of a Cr/Ni spinel of cosmic origin in a number of rock sequences at the PTB, which was exactly determined based on micropaleontological data in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region.\nHowever, it is only in the recent years that actual craters have been discovered (Fig. 4). Thus, evidence of the sediment buried Bedout (Bedoo) impact struc ture was found on the northwestern continental mar gin of Australia 25 km away from the coast (18.18° S, 119.25° E) [9, 10]. Seismic and gravity surveys were conducted there, and two holes were drilled to the 3000 m depth. An impact breccia was discovered a few hundred meters thick with almost pure glass and disin tegrated plagioclase grains. Just like in the Chicxulub crater, there is a central uplift typical of large astrob lemes in the center of the crater 180–200 km in diam eter. Based on the plagioclase, the Ar/Ar age was esti mated at 250.1 ± 4.5 and 253 ± 5 Ma, which corre sponds to the PTB.\nThere are other known craters formed at the PTB [11]. The Araguainha crater was discovered in Brazil (16.77° S, 52.98° W; 40 km in diameter) with an age of ~250 Ma according to [32] and 244.4 ± 3.25 Ma according to [11]. The 40 km wide Araguainha struc ture is the largest crater in South America. The crater penetrates horizontally lying sediments of the basin of the Parana River in Central Brazil. The asteroid fell ~250 Myr ago. It had a diameter of 2–3 km and broke through the 2 km thick sediments exposing crystalline rocks of the basement on a 4 km wide territory. The central uplift 6–7 km wide and the circular trough are well defined topographically. The impact melt has a granite composition. During the Jurassic, the crater was filled in with sediments and basaltic lavas.\nThe Arganaty crater in Kazakhstan is referred to observed craters. It was discovered based on the results of satellite photography [4]. The crater is located between lakes Balkhash and Sasykkol. The inner circle 60 km in diameter reflects the pediment levee of the crater. The diameter of the structure is up to 300– 315 km based on external arched faults. The circular rim is over 700 m high and 7.5–11.5 km wide. The cra ter and its circular structures are represented by sandy sediments underlied by granites in the central portion. The cosmogenic origin of the crater was confirmed by petrographic studies (shocked quartz) and the exist ence of circular magnetic and gravity anomalies. There is an oval massif of leucocratic granites in the center of the structure under an unconsolidated sedi ment cover. The author believes that a release of gran ite magma from a deep focus was initiated by a cos mogenic explosion. Based on combined geological\nand geophysical data, the age of the crater corresponds to the PTB.\nInferred craters include the Falkland crater near the coast of Argentina (51° S, 60° W, 300 km in diam eter, age 250 Ma). Less reliable craters are the follow ing on the Siberian Platform: the Great Kuonamki (70° N, 111° E, diameter not available, age 251 Ma), the Gulinskii Massif (70.91° N, 101.2° E, over 50 km in diameter, age 251 Ma), the Essei (68.81° N, 102.18° E, 4.5 km in diameter, age 251 Ma), as well as the Alpian crater in Europe (43° N, 8° E, age ~250 Ma) and SAR 28 in Canada (56.57° N, 110.57° W, 7.5 km in diame ter, age ~250 Ma) [11].\nNumerous fragments of chondritic meteorites with characteristic geochemical indicators, shocked quartz, and extraterrestrial fullerenes with trapped 3He were discovered in argillite breccia of the PTB at Graphite Peak in the Central Trans Antarctic Moun tains near the Beardmore Glacier in Antarctica [8]. Metallic grains were found similar to those encoun tered in boundary layers in South China and Japan. The age was determined from the paleobotanic and isotopic data. The discovery confirms the occurrence of a global impact event.\nSuch an event might be the largest impact event in the Earth’s history that occurred in Wilkes Land, Ant arctica [47]. A large negative magnetic anomaly was discovered there; it coincides with a circular topo graphic depression 243 km wide having a minimum depth of 848 m with the center being at 70° S, 120° E. In 2006, satellite gravity mapping detected a positive gravity anomaly reflecting a protuberance of ultrama fic mantle rocks, which is typical of large impact cra ters. Subsurface radar mapping by NASA detected a 500 km crater located under the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is assumed to be a consequence of the impact of a 55 km asteroid that was 4–5 times greater than the Chicxulub asteroid, which led to the mass extinction of organisms 65 Myr ago. The impact caused the rise of a 200 km dome of mantle material. Based on the gravity data, this impact event occurred ~250 Myr ago. Along with the large Bedout impact event and others, this impact event probably was the most important reason for the sudden mass extinction of organisms at the PTB. No geological samples have been collected from under the ice sheet yet, and direct evidence is required to confirm the occurrence of the impact event. There are also other hypotheses regarding the origin of this structure: the formation of a mantle plume or the manifestation of different large scale volcanic activity.\nThe consequences of the impacts of large asteroids (even more so a number of them occurring within a short time interval) must have exerted a deleterious influence on marine and terrestrial organisms [7]. The lighting intensity reduced and temperature changes, acid rainfalls, and fires happened. Global expansion of dust clouds consisting of fragmented rock of the Earth’s crust thrown out of the crater and the material\nOCEANOLOGY Vol. 52 No. 2 2012\nMASS EXTINCTION OF OCEAN ORGANISMS AT THE PALEOZOIC–MESOZOIC 245\nof the cosmic body weakened the photosynthesis and disturbed the entire food chain. The effect must have been strengthened by fires. The outburst of water vapor to the atmosphere when the asteroid fell to the ocean must have triggered a greenhouse effect. The impact of the asteroid on carbonate rocks with high contents of CaCO3 and CaSO4 resulted in an increase in the con tents of CO2 and sulfurous aerosols in the atmosphere. This must have led to acid rainfalls and a few degrees temperature increase.\nAccording to Isozaki et al. [20], changes in the geo systems began ~265 Myr ago, when, after 50 Myr of the geomagnetic field’s stability, the Illawarra Reversal occurred. After it, a long period of frequent changes in the geomagnetic field began. This event caused by changes in the condition of the Earth’s nucleus and mantle manifested itself on the Earth’s surface as a series of the above listed events.\nExtraterrestrial cosmic causes probably triggered both changes in the Earth’s spheres and asteroid attacks. The influence of outer space on earthly pro cesses was suspected as early as in the first half of the 20th century (V.I. Vernadskii, A.L. Chizhevskii, M. Milankovich, etc) and has been studied since the mid 20th century. The influence of solar activity fluc tuations, the interaction of the Earth and the Moon, the Earth’s orbital revolution, and collisions of cosmic bodies—asteroids and comets—with the Earth were considered. In the recent years, studies in this direc tion have been actively conducted. The reasons for the geological periodicity normally mentioned are changes in the gravity potential of the Galaxy at differ ent distances from its center, variations in the rate of the Sun’s orbital motion, the Sun’s transit of spiral\narms of the Galaxy, its oscillations perpendicular to the galactic plane, etc.\nThe period of the Sun’s orbital motion in the Gal axy (200–300 Myr) is compared to the duration of the geological eras. The time required to transit a galactic arm is 20–30 Myr, and the time during which the Solar system is exposed to the effect of galactic shock waves is 4–5 Myr [6]. These periodic intervals are associated with the boundaries between different level subdivisions of the stratigraphic scale of the Phanero zoic. Geological and, primarily, paleontological changes occurring every 0.1–10 Myr can be explained either by collisions of large solitary asteroids a few kilometers in size with the Earth or by asteroid attacks—the fall of a series of asteroids to the Earth [36, and others]. A.A. Barenbaum [3] believes that the mortality of organisms and the activity of tectonic pro cesses abruptly increase when the Sun is in the regions of gas condensation and star formation within the galactic arms.\nThe estimates of the ages of the impact craters cor relate with the events of mass extinction of organisms (Fig. 5). Mass extinctions have a periodicity of 26– 30 Myr, and the series of well dated impact craters has periodicities of 30 ± 0.5 and 35 ± 2 Myr [36]. The above mentioned cosmic phenomena of similar fre quency are suggested to explain this quasi periodicity.

  "abstractText": "At the end of the Permian, at the boundary between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (251.0 ± 0.4 Ma), the largest mass extinction of organisms on the Earth occurred. Up to 96% of the species of marine inverte brates and ~70% of the terrestrial vertebrates died off. A lot of factors were suggested and substantiated to explain this mass mortality, such as the disappearance of environmental niches in the course of the amalgam ation of the continental plates into Pangea, sea level fluctuations, anoxia, an elevated CO2 content, H2S intoxication, volcanism, methane discharge from gas hydrates, climate changes, impact events (collisions with large asteroids), or combinations of many of these reasons. Some of these factors are in subordination to others, while others are independent. Almost all of these factors developed relatively slowly and could not cause the sudden mass mortality of organisms globally. It could have happened when large asteroids, whose craters have been discovered lately, fell to the Earth. It is suggested that the impact events “finished off” the already suppressed biota. A simultaneous change in many of the factors responsible for the biodiversity, including those not connected in a cause and effect relationship, proves the existence of a common extrater restrial cause that affected both the changes in the internal and external geospheres and the activation of asteroid attacks (the Sun’s transit of spiral arms of our galaxy, the Sun’s oscillations perpendicularly to the galactic plane, etc).
