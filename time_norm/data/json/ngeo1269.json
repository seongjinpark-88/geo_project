    "text": "We find that although the main component of stress recorded during dyke intrusion relates to plate extension, another component of stress is consistent with the stress field caused by the retreating ice cap. We conclude that the retreating ice cap led to enhanced capture of magma within the crust. We suggest that ice-cap retreat can promote magma storage, rather than eruption, at least in the short term.\nIceland lies on the boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates, above a zone of upwelling mantle. As mantle material ascends, the reduction in pressure leads to the generation of magma by partial melting6. A reduction in ice load also decreases the pressure in the mantle, leading to the generation of additional magma; at the end of the last glacial period there was a massive pulse of erupted material in Iceland, ∼30 times the usual rate, which lasted ∼1,000 years beyond the disappearance of most of the ice. At present, it is estimated that the retreat of the largest ice cap, Vatnajökull, results in the generation of ∼14millionm3 yr−1 of additional magma4. The ascent of magma through the crust is driven primarily by buoyancy forces, which lead to opening of fractures above7. In an isotropic stress field, fractures below can contract as magma is squeezed upwards. However, if the principal components of the stress field within the crust are unequal, they are relaxed by non-reversible opening of the magma-filled fractures. Hence extensional stress environments favour intrusion over eruption8. The magma volume, V , that can be accommodated by this relaxation of the deviatoric stress is proportional to the difference\n1Delft University of Technology, Kluyerweg 1, 2629 HS, Delft, Netherlands, 2Nordic Volcanological Center, Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Iceland, Sturlugata 7, Askja IS-101, Reykjavik, Iceland, 3Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University, Villavägen 16, SE-752 36, Uppsala, Sweden, 4Icelandic Meteorological Office, Bústaðavegi 9, IS-150, Reykjavik, Iceland, 5Department of Earth Sciences, University of Gothenburg, Box 460, SE-405 30, Gothenburg, Sweden. *e-mail: a.j.hooper@tudelft.nl.\nindicate pre-existing eruptive fissures and yellow regions outline volcanic systems.

In Iceland, spreading across the rift zones, of 19.7mmyr−1 (ref. 9), is the primary contributor to 1P in the crust, but changes in the ice load also affect it. Here we estimate the contribution to 1P from the reduction in mass of Icelandic ice caps since glacial retreat began circa 1890 (Fig. 1). We use a model for Earth rheology constrained by global positioning system (GPS)measurements of glacial isostatic adjustment10, which consists of a 40 km elastic plate overlying a Maxwell half-space with viscosity 1019 Pa s. Our results are, however, not particularly sensitive to the Earth model we use beneath the elastic plate (see Supplementary Information). We calculate 1P for two different scenarios, the first when the dyke is perpendicular to σ3 induced by the melting ice cap and the second when the dyke is parallel with the rift zone. We see that whether intrusion is encouraged or\ndiscouraged depends on dyke orientation, although away from the edges of the ice cap, intrusive activity is always favoured. It is usually assumed that dykes propagate perpendicular to the direction of σ3 and that σ3 in this region is dictated by plate spreading, in which case the second scenario should apply. However, the orientation of a recent dyke intruded into the lower crust near the largest ice cap in Iceland11 actually agrees better with the first scenario. This raises the question of whether the stress field there is actually dominated by the melting ice cap. Also, our model considers only the elastic response in the upper 40 km, whereas below the purely brittle zone, estimated to be 7–8 km thick in this region12, stress may be relaxed by ductile flow. Geodetic observations of the dyke intrusion provide a unique opportunity to probe the current stress state in the lower crust, and to ascertain whether stress change due to glacial retreat can result in increased magma capture.\nBetween February 2007 and April 2008, swarms of small, deepseated earthquakes were detected within the Kverkfjöll volcanic system in north-eastern Iceland11,13. The activity originated in the region of Mt. Upptyppingar, and migrated with time northeastwards. The dominant focal depths lie between 14 and 22 km,\n784 NATURE GEOSCIENCE | VOL 4 | NOVEMBER 2011 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience\n© 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Our geodetic observations show that the dyke does not only dilate, as is often assumed, but there is also translational motion of the opposing walls, as occurs on faults. Deformation associated with fault slip can only be interpreted in terms of a change in stress, but because friction between the dyke walls is reduced to zero by their separation, we can assume full stress drop and therefore shed light on the pre-existing stress state.\nWe used radar data acquired by the European Space Agency’s Envisat satellite, complemented by GPS data acquired at fixed benchmarks, to constrain the surface deformation associated with the dyke intrusion (Fig. 2). Interferograms formed from the radar data provide estimates of displacement in two different groundsatellite directions, whichwe corrected for background and seasonal motions. The difference in the number of colour fringes for the two directions indicates that the centre of uplift also had an eastward component of motion. The GPS data were acquired continuously at one site and campaign-style at a further six sites. The continuous station shows a change in velocity towards the end of April 2007, then steady deformation until March 2008 when the velocity reverts again to the background rate (Supplementary Fig. S3). From the horizontal GPS data, we simultaneously estimated the background motion due to plate spreading and the thinning of the ice caps, seasonal motion due to snow loading, and the additional velocity during the intrusion.\nInitially, we modelled the geodetic data using kinematic elastic half-space models for various simple geometries. The asymmetry of the motion precludes most source geometries, but we found that a tilted rectangular tensile–shear dislocation17 provides a reasonable fit to both data sets. To constrain the stress field within the crust, we then developed a mechanical boundary-element model. We assumed lithostatic pressure and an unknown deviatoric stress within the host rock, hydrostatic excess pressure within the source, and a traction-free interface. We divided the potential source area into smaller elements, each of which could be active or not, subject to connectivity constraints. In the forwardmodel, we solved for the opening and slip of each element for a given strike, dip and set of tractions acting on the dyke. These were mapped to surface deformation using elastic Green’s functions that include vertical variation in elastic stiffness18. We used a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm19 to invert the geodetic data in a Bayesian manner, resulting in a joint probability distribution for the location, orientation and magnitude of dyke opening/slip, and the tractions acting on the dyke. Earthquake locations11 were used to provide prior constraints on the dip and strike of the dyke.\nThe results are shown in Figs 2 and 3. The spatial structure of the residual interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) phase\nis consistent with noise due to lateral variation in atmospheric refractivity (Supplementary Fig. S4). Strike and dip of the dyke are 81◦–82◦ and 42◦–43◦ respectively and the volume is 42–47millionm3, at 95% confidence. Significant shear tractions acting on the dyke walls are necessary to explain the eastward components of the radar and the GPS data; allowing only opening results in model GPS vectors that lie mostly west of the 95% confidence ellipses. These tractions cannot be explained by the stress imparted by ice unloading alone, but could be caused by extension in direction N114◦ E to N138◦ E, at an angle of between 32◦ and 57◦ to the dyke, with 8.4 to 14MPa of differential stress. Assuming that the extensional strain due to plate spreading is spread over 100 km or less, this implies a minimum viscosity of 1.3×1021 Pa s (see Methods) for this region of crust, which is consistent with values of 1.0×1021 Pa s or higher frommodelling of glacial isostatic adjustment10. This viscosity is equivalent to a relaxation time of ∼1,000 years, a timescale that would allow deviatoric stress from ice loss to also build to significant levels and hence allow for increased magma capture.\nThe direction of σ3 estimated from our model deviates from estimates of plate spreading that are in the rangeN101◦ E toN108◦ E (ref. 20). Estimates from earthquake fault plane solutions also indicate clockwise rotation of the stress field from that expected from plate spreading alone11. The rotation of the stress field can be partly explained by the glacial retreat since 1890. Applying the stress imposed by recent ice loss results in a clockwise rotation of the extension direction by about 1◦ and an increase in the differential stress of 40 kPa. The remaining discrepancy may be due to rotation of the stress field by the en echelon pattern of the rift zones.\nOur modelling demonstrates that the orientation of this deep dyke is not perpendicular to the local direction of σ3, which is approximately parallel with plate spreading. It is, however, almost perpendicular to the direction of σ3 resulting from the ice retreat; a dyke perpendicular to σ3 calculated from our model for ice loss would have a dip of 54◦ and strike 86◦, which is close to the optimal values of 43◦ and 82◦ for the current intrusion. Although the stress imparted by current deglaciation does not dominate, and cannot explain the orientation of the dyke, its magnitude was far greater as each glacial period came to an end. Once plate-spreading stresses were relaxed by rifting episodes, the controlling stress for any subsequent dykes would have been dictated by the melting ice caps. Eruptive fissures and extensional structures with similar trends that may have been generated by this process have been found in at least two places in the rift zone; a 5 km long eruptive fissure at Hrímalda mountain, 12 km from the edge of Vatnajökull ice cap, has a strike of 89◦ and a 5.5 km long graben with eruptive activity at Urðarháls, about 1 km from the edge of Vatnajökull, has a trend of 90◦\nNATURE GEOSCIENCE | VOL 4 | NOVEMBER 2011 | www.nature.com/naturegeoscience 785\n© 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The plausibility of contrasting mechanical properties to alter the direction of dyke propagation has been demonstrated by numerical modelling21.\nRetreating ice caps can influence eruptive activity in at least three ways: by increasing mantle melting, by changing the conditions required for dyke initiation22,23, and by the process evaluated here, which is to alter the capacity for magma storage in the crust by intrusive activity. In Iceland we expect the first of these processes to dominate in the long term, as was the case for past deglaciations, leading to greater-than-usual volcanism. However, in the short term, we can expect the last process to also be important, both in Iceland and at glaciated volcanoes in other regions. Whether it encourages or discourages eruptive activity depends on the orientation of the dykes that carry magma from depth. For the Upptyppingar region the process works to reduce the erupted volume whatever the orientation, but beneath the ice cap the effect would be to increase the erupted volume, if dykes are intruded parallel with the rift zone as expected. For glaciated volcanoes not situated in rift zones, dykes oriented broadly parallel with the edges of the ice cap can be expected to capture more magma as the ice cap melts, whereas radial dykes should capture less."

    "text": "To correct the interferograms for orbit errors, secular and seasonal motion we estimated a bilinear function for regions not affected by the dyke intrusion, using weighted least squares. We then estimated a 1D exponential covariance function from the corrected phase of the same regions. We estimated variances for the GPS data using the percentile bootstrap method24 and errors for both GPS and InSAR data were assumed to be multivariate Gaussian in our inversion, with no additional relative weighting applied. In the mechanical model we solved for the opening of each element for a given hydrostatic excess pressure, using a boundary-element approach, assuming a density difference between the magma and surrounding rock of 250 kgm−3 and a traction-free interface. Our model extends that of Yun and colleagues25 in three ways. First, the imposed pressure boundary condition is hydrostatic rather than uniform. This means that, given magma density less than that of the host rock, the excess pressure decreases with depth. Second, we allow for shear tractions acting on the dyke, which we estimate in our inversion. Third, we constrain the perimeter-to-area ratio to be less than two times that of a circle, to avoid isolated elements. To account for vertical variation in stiffness values we divided the crust into four layers of increasing stiffness overlying a half-space. Stiffness values were calculated from seismic profiles26 (see Supplementary Table S1) and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.27 was assumed. Our prior probability for strike and dip was assumed Gaussian and derived by iteratively fitting a plane to bootstrap samples of the relocated hypocentres24, using weighted least-squares. For other parameters the prior probability was assumed constant. The minimum viscosity for the lower crust was calculated using a Maxwell model of viscoelasticity and assuming that an equilibrium stress state was reached. In this case the differential stress is equal to the product of viscosity and strain rate. In the case where equilibrium is not attained, the viscosity will be higher.\nReceived 13 September 2010; accepted 23 August 2011; published online 25 September 2011"

  "abstractText": "Climate warming at the end of the last glaciation caused ice caps on Icelandic volcanoes to retreat. Removal of surface ice load is thought to have decreased pressures in the underlying mantle, triggering decompression melting, enhanced magma generation and increased volcanic activity1–3. Present-day climate change could have the same effect, although there may be a time lag of hundreds of years between magma generation and eruption4,5. However, in addition to increased magma generation, pressure changes associated with ice retreat should also alter the capacity for storing magma within the crust. Here we use a numerical model to evaluate the effect of the current decrease in ice load on magma storage in the crust at the Kverkfjöll volcanic system, located partially beneath Iceland’s largest ice cap. We compare the model results with radar and global positioning system measurements of surface displacement and changes in crustal stress between 2007 and 2008, during the intrusion of a deep dyke at Upptyppingar. We find that although the main component of stress recorded during dyke intrusion relates to plate extension, another component of stress is consistent with the stress field caused by the retreating ice cap. We conclude that the retreating ice cap led to enhanced capture of magma within the crust. We suggest that ice-cap retreat can promote magma storage, rather than eruption, at least in the short term. Iceland lies on the boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates, above a zone of upwelling mantle. As mantle material ascends, the reduction in pressure leads to the generation of magma by partial melting6. A reduction in ice load also decreases the pressure in the mantle, leading to the generation of additional magma; at the end of the last glacial period there was a massive pulse of erupted material in Iceland, ∼30 times the usual rate, which lasted ∼1,000 years beyond the disappearance of most of the ice. At present, it is estimated that the retreat of the largest ice cap, Vatnajökull, results in the generation of ∼14millionm3 yr−1 of additional magma4. The ascent of magma through the crust is driven primarily by buoyancy forces, which lead to opening of fractures above7. In an isotropic stress field, fractures below can contract as magma is squeezed upwards. However, if the principal components of the stress field within the crust are unequal, they are relaxed by non-reversible opening of the magma-filled fractures. Hence extensional stress environments favour intrusion over eruption8. The magma volume, V , that can be accommodated by this relaxation of the deviatoric stress is proportional to the difference",
