    "text": "Large volcanic eruptions on the Earth’s surface are commonly associated with the liberation of vast amounts of strong-acid gases which are ejected high into the atmosphere. The chemical composition and quantity of the gases vary with the magnitude and nature of the eruption. The acid gases from massive eruptions are usually atmospherically transported great distances, diffuse laterally, and generally are deposited on the Earth’s surface as H2SO4; more rarely as HCl and HF. It is shown (Hammer et al., 1980, 19941; Legrand and Delmas, 1987; Delmas et al., 1992; Clausen and Hammer, 19882; Langway et al., 1988; Fisher and Koerner, 1994; Zielinski et al., 1994) that these strong-acids become incorporated in the annual snow deposits of polar ice sheets and produce valuable volcanic index horizons.\nWe submit that at least three major conditions must be satisfied to establish a volcanic chronology from a deep ice core:\n(i) the core must be dated with reasonable accuracy; (ii) the annual accumulation layers must be representative of the years in question,\nand (iii) the transfer function of volcanic air impurities to the glacier surface must be\nreasonably well known.\nFor high-latitude ice sheet locations, the first two conditions are usually fulfilled, if the annual snow deposit is sufficiently high at the relevant location. Studies by Jaffrezo and Davidson (1993) and Davidson et al. (19893) demonstrate that the third condition is within approximate boundary limits to satisfy the precepts for at\nClimatic Change 35: 1–15, 1997. c 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

On the other hand, even with the rational fulfilment of the three general conditions listed above, amendments must be applied to accommodate other recognized differences in the compositional nature of ice sheets. For instance we found the snowfall on the Greenland Ice Sheet is highly alkaline during the Wisconsin ice age and not ameniable to ECM measurements due to the increased availability and subsequent wind-transport and deposition of alkalinerich continental dust (Cragin et al., 1977; Hammer et al., 1985). This does not exclude the possibility of infering details of past volcanism in alkaline ice cores. It only requires a time-consuming process of continuously measuring the ions; at least the sulphate ion. Conversely, ice cores from Antarctica offer less complicated data on past volcanism, mainly because the continent is so distant from alkaline dust sources that the snowfall remained essentially acidic even during the Wisconsin stage (Hammer et al., 1994). With this knowledge we used the ECM technique (Hammer, 1980,4 1989) to continuously examine the Byrd Station, West Antarctic deep ice core (BS68) for strong-acid signals over the past 50,000 years. In a previously published study on the BS68 core strong acids were used to identify seasonal snow accumulation layers to great depths (Hammer et al., 1994). For a complete time-scale discussion on BS68 see Hammer et al. (1994).\nSince only about 19% of the Earth’s active volcanoes are now located below 10 S and about 66% are located above the Equator (Simkin and Siebert, 1994) it follows that the frequency and magnitude of volcanic acid peaks observed in Antarctica should be on average less than in Greenland. It is probable, however, that local or regional volcanic eruptions could give rise to very high peak concentrations of impurities on the ice sheet. As discussed later, criteria do exist which helps to distinguish between local or regional signals and global events."

    "text": "Figure 1 shows the isotopic composition (18O) in ‰ (Johnsen et al., 1972) and the newly measured acidity, ECM in equiv. H+/kg of ice (Hammer et al., 1994; Langway et al., 19945) for the BS68 ice core. Although both data sets were measured continuously here they are plotted as 10 m averages. The lack of acidity data between 300 m to 900 m (1B) is due to the inability to continuously measure ECM on the fractured ice existing in this ‘brittle-ice zone’ (Johnsen et al., 1972; Shoji and Langway, 1982, 1985). Several distinct and eventful correlations exist between the (18O) and acidity curves. The Holocene/Wisconsin (H/W) climate transition is identified between 1080 m and 1294 m on the (18O) curve (1A). The depth interval between 90 m and 990 m, representing the Holocene, has an average background acid value only slightly higher than those representing both the H/W transition (approximately 1080 m to 1294 m) and the Wisconsin-age ice below 1294 m. The Wisconsin ice has a relatively higher average acidity level than the H/W transition. The off-scale acidity peak (2.3 equiv. H+/kg) shown in Figure 1B\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.2\nbetween 1280 m and 1290 m is by far the single highest acidity value measured over the entire 2191 m of the BS68 ice core. Note also that the 10 m averages plotted in Figure 1 represent progressively more years with depth. Annual layer thicknesses decrease from 11.2 cm of ice equivalent at the surface to 6.5 cm at about the end of the H/W transition, and to about 2.5 cm just below 1300 m; finally, to about 1.5 cm at 1900 m (Hammer et al., 1994). Below 1900 m to the bottom of the ice core, the annual layering is disrupted to some extent by the ice flow conditions existing close to bedrock.\nFigure 2 shows continuous acidity curves for several representative depth levels in the BS68 core. A time-period when no or little volcanism took place is shown in Figure 2A. Here observed cyclic variations represent only systematic seasonal changes and provide an average acidity background value of 1.8 equiv. H+/kg.\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.3\nFigures 2B through 2F each display prominent acid peaks easily identified from the essentially background waves which represent annual ice accumulation layers (Hammer, 1980; Langway et al., 1994). On average a strong-acid signal in the BS68 core usually registers between 4 to 10 equiv. H+/kg over about two to five annual layers. In most cases the prominent acid peaks from all depth levels consist mainly of H2SO4. Over a 10 to 30-year time-period the non-volcanic average acid background may vary from between 0.8 to 2.0 equiv. H+/kg, due to possible changes in climate, accumulation rates, and other environmental factors, which sometimes handicap clear identification of intermediate and especially the lowlevel volcanic acid signals from distant sources."

    "text": "Figure 3 presents the chronological record of the 57 major high-acid volcanic signals measured from the present back to 50 ka BP. A correction is made for thinning of layers with depth and therefore the plotted values represent the magnitude of the original acid deposit in meq H+/m2 for those events above an arbitrary threshold level of 0.4 meq H+/m2: A volcanic signal of this magnitude would correspond to a violent and voluminous eruption which produced of the order of at least 270 Mtons of H2SO4, if the eruption occurred in the equatorial zone (Clausen and Hammer, 19882).\nThis equatorial source location obviously holds for only some eruptions, but since all of the 57 major prehistorical events identified in this study have as yet an uncertain source, we opted to normalize these data (Table I). We interpreted the results accordingly, in terms of volcanic acid gases in Mtons which originated at the equator and were atmospherically transported to the Byrd Station area. If the eruption took place closer to Byrd Station the original magnitude of acid-gases produced at the emission site would decrease correspondingly, for example by a factor of 3 or less. The relationship between the amount of acid deposited on an ice sheet and which is originally produced as acid-gas at an eruption site has been discussed previously (Hammer et al., 1980; Clausen and Hammer, 19882). As an example, the historically eventful Krakatoa eruption of 1883 AD, which produced between 30 to 50 Mtons of H2SO4 equivalent at the Indonesian eruption site, as determined in our ECM measurements on the new Byrd Station (NBY89) ice core (Langway et al., 19945), is below the treshhold level and would not be represented in Figure 3.\nThe chronology presented in Figure 3 begins with the prominent 1259 AD index horizon (Hammer et al., 1980; Langway et al., 1988), which is plotted as the first bar at the extreme left. This event is registered as 0.51 meq/m2 (= 25 kg H2SO4/km2), and corresponds to a total volcanic acid production of about 340 Mtons H2SO4 (Langway et al., 1988). As observed in the figure the prominent eruptions are fairly uniformly distributed over a 50 ka time interval (but for the\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.4\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.5\nTable I\nTable I (Continued)\nDepth Calc.

All other Holocene events plotted in this volcanic chronology are clearly due to a single event, with an acid fall out time-period averaging about 2–5 years. For deeper and older strata the time-periods of high-level acidity do not directly reflect the actual fall-out times as diffusive processes in the ice become increasingly active with depths. This can clearly be seen in Figure 2. These data indicate that the apparent acid deposit period as a function of depth is well represented in the curves (and Table I) back to about 15 ka BP. Thereafter a steady increase occurs to about 30 ka BP where the apparent acid-deposit time-period is nearly twice the fall-out time-period and then increase even more with depth due to diffusion (Hammer et al., 1994). Accompanying the diffusion a noticable decrease is evident in peak-acid values (Table I). Due to\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.7\nall these factors it is presently not possible to compare directly the stratospheric residence times of acid signals between the Holocene and the Wisconsin.\nIn an earlier report on the BS68 ice core visible volcanic ash fragments were found between the 1300 m and 1700 m depths (about 20 to 40 ka BP in our time-scale); their origin was attributed to local West Antarctic eruptions (Gow and Williamson, 1971). Nearly all the ice layers containing the occluded detrital material were removed from the core during the 1968 drilling operation and consequently not available for our measurements. Fortunately, a few sparsely distributed, slightly discoloured and faintly visible layers with a small content of fine-sized particles were discovered while making our cold room survey in 1982. The ECM measurements on these few specimens are uniformly characterized by low-acid signals. A reasonable explanation for the low values is that chemical mixing reactions occurred between the fine ash particles and the strong-acids in the eruptive plume or during airborne transport, or simply they are products of local eruptions of low\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.8\nmagnitude. Results of other studies which involved measurement of acidity or sulphate concentration levels in various shallow ice cores from Antarctica, using ECM or ion chromatography detection techniques, have also ascribed high-acid concentration levels to non-Antarctic volcanic sources (Legrand and Delmas, 1987; Delmas et al., 1992)."

    "heading": "4. The Main Event",
    "text": "The most spectacular volcanic activity recorded in the BS68 core occurred over a 4 m long increment between 1279.5 m to 1283.5 m; dated 17:5 0:5 ka BP in our time scale (Hammer et al., 1994), at the beginning of the transition from the cold glacial to a warmer Holocene climate (Figure 1). The total acid deposit is more than 20 times higher than for any other event shown in Figure 3. A remarkable peculiarity of this event is its multiple-pulsed continuity sustained for nearly 170 years. Figure 4 presents the results of the subsequent multiparameter laboratory investigation performed on a continuous 8 m core interval bracketing the phenomenon, once this extraordinary event was discovered by ECM.\nThe curves of the various chemical parameters measured are independently plotted in Figure 4A–I. Although measured, the NH+4 , Mg\n2+, K+ and Ca2+ ions are not included in Figure 4 since these cations totaled less than 1.3 equiv./kg. and are essentially background values. The (18O), dust, NO 3 , Na\n+ and most of the SO2 4 results from this depth interval provide little chronological insight to delineate chemical cycles, stratigraphy or even the conspicuous volcanic activity. Figure 4G, H shows the H+ concentration levels measured both by the standard pH technique and the ECM technique. These two curves show consistent concentration variability and magnitude as well as stratigraphic compatability. The unusually high concentration levels registered for HCl (Figure 4E) and HF (Figure 4F), and their coherence with the acid curves shown in Figure 4G, H, are of special interest.\nThe reported normal background concentration level for F in Antarctic ice is generally below 0.01 equiv./kg (Saigne et al., 1987). The F concentration levels shown in Figure 4F are abnormally high by about two to three orders of magnitude. As a consequence the ice core F /Cl ratios average up to three to four orders of magnitude higher than found in sea water (1:28 10 4). Though some of the Cl measured is considered to be of sea spray origin (the non-acid portion) the extremely high F content clearly eliminates an ocean source for this element. In short, we conclude that the unusually high acidity measured over this core interval is due to a dramatic and massive volcanic event that fluctuated and lasted for 170 years. We calculate the combined suite of events produced between 5 to 11 billion tons of acids, as HCl. As explained earlier for consistency and comparative purposes, we calculated the magnitude for all the eruptions identified in this study as originating in the equatorial zone.\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.9\nAlthough the specific source of the tremendous volcanic emission, which produced the high concentrations of HCl and HF at 17:5 0:5 ka BP, is at this time unknown, certain features in Figure 4 are evident: The background sulphate concentration levels are relatively low over the 8 m profile, yet consistently higher during the ECM peak spectacles of the major event; the F concentration levels are variable but abnormally high at the beginning of the spectacles and noticeably decrease in strength as the event evolves; and the Cl concentration levels are protacted at high levels throughout nearly the entire 170 years. On the other hand,\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.10\nFigure 4. Multiple chemical analyses made on laterally adjacent segments of the BS68 core from the 1278 m to 1286 m depths.

All data are plotted in 5 cm depth increments. At least six especially violent emissions are coupled within the 170 year time interval.\nthe dust content is quite low over the profile, and supports the hypothesis that the event is likely to have occurred some distance from the Antarctic continent; yet, if we accept this hypothesis, it becomes difficult to explain how huge amounts of hydrophilic acids could be transported to Antarctica without being depleted or at least greatly reduced by post-emission precipitation scavenging.\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.11\nAn opposing view on the source location might consider a volcanic event happening closer to Byrd Station even without the presence of visible ash layers. How could this happen? One possibility might be that a local or regional sub-glacier eruption occurred in West Antarctica and that a substantial fraction of the sulphur was differentially retained in the magma (Moore and Calk, 1991), preferentially releasing HCl and then later HF in diminishing belches. Such a remarkable course of events might have been triggered by an incipient geological re-adjustment of the entire West Antarctic bedrock and of course the overlying ice sheet, but physical evidence in the core is lacking. Nevertheless, this postulated sequence may have served as a precursor of the transition from the Late Wisconsin to the Holocene period. To shed further light on the topic, a comprehensive chemical parameter analysis is planned of the relevant time-period in the Greenland, Dye 3 (Hammer et al., 1985), and the new GRIP (Dansgaard et al., 1993) ice cores. A recent high precision stratigraphic dating of the GRIP core shows an interesting and persistent lowering in the (18O) of about 1.5‰ at 17:6 0:1 ka BP (also observed in the Dye 3 core). This is within the time-range of the BS68 main event and might provide some insight to the questions raised, particularly in regard to the F and Cl content at appropriate depths in the Greenland cores for a bi-polar connection to BS68.\nShort of this solution, answers to the perplexing questions regarding the complete history, cause-effect, and evolution of the extraordinary 17.5 0.5 ka BP main event will have to await its discovery in other Earth materials, or, most probably, from new measurements on deep ice cores from Antarctica and Greenland.9"

All of the original 1408 core tubes existing at the time were individually opened and all the core remaining in the tubes was measured in the cold room over a 2 12 month period. The authors regret the delay in publishing the full results, but inadvertent delays were experienced by new and often unrelated field and laboratory research obligations and divergent schedules. Some laboratory assistance for a variety of ionic chemistry measurements was made by K. Osada at the SUNY/Buffalo Ice Core Laboratory. We are indebted to the Danish Natural Science Research Council (SNF), the Commission for Scientific Research in Greenland (KVUG) and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF/DPP) for support covering various periods of the study. We appreciate the constructive comments by T. Simkin and an anonymous reviewer.\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.12\nNotes\n1. This reference is not the first paper describing the use of seasonal variations of strong acids for dating ice cores, but it is the first to describe the annual stratigraphic layers of the entire BS68 ice core. The ECM method used was originally presented in C. U. Hammer, J. Glac. 25, 359 (1980). 2. The assessment of the amount of volcanic-acid production at an eruptive site location and that measured in the acid layers found in ice cores is of course an approximation. Our calculations were based on estimates made from nuclear bomb tests and various background factors as described in this reference. 3. Although these studies were performed in South Greenland where the yearly snow deposition is high, the results should be valid for those areas of Antarctica where the snow deposition is not too low (>5 cm of H2O equiv./yr). 4. ECM refers to the Electrical Conductivity Method and is distinguished from the classical DC conductivity. The two are closely related, but the instrumental ECM measurement applies to moving electrodes and is theoretically basically different from the classical capacity measurement. 5. The first 88.4 m of the original BS68 core was discarded in the field and not available for this study. The NBY-89 core was drilled to 164 m in 1989 about 1 km from the old Byrd location and served to laterally connect to the BS68 core below 88.4 m. The lateral stratigraphic overlap was accomplished by using several common volcanic signals; especially the prominent 1259 AD event.\nIn this reference a strong correlation is established between the ECM seasonal peaks and excess sulfate peaks. These Antarctic results are counter to Greenland ice core results and probably due to the strong and variable seasonality of the oceanic source of sulfurous gases around West Antarctica. 6. During transportation and storage the highly fractured ‘brittle-zone’ ice core was exposed to ambient air/gas components, like ammonia, which penetrated the core and neutralized the acids much faster than that experienced in unfractured cores. 7. In a recent letter, Tom Simkin and Lee Siebert have provided an updated chronological listing of large Holocene eruptions. It is premature to compare our large Holocene signals with this list, because we require more chemical analyses of the major ice core signals; we also need to include all volcanic signals in the Holocene ice. Such a study is planned, but must await further laboratory and data analysis. 8. In order to be of climatic significance, the volcanic products (like acid gases, and other impurities) must reach into the stratosphere in substantial amounts. To influence the radiation balance in a detectable way these products or their chemical derivatives also must disperse in significant amounts, at least 10M tons, usually much more over large parts of the stratosphere for a time-period of at least a few months. These a priori requirements are necessary to insure that snow accumulating on the ice sheets contain adequate volcanic impurities to affect their impact on climate change. 9. The reader might ask, what is the situation for locating the ‘main event’ in the two other deep ice cores from East Antarctica? The climate records of the Dome C and Vostok ice cores are both published: C Lorius, L. Merlivat and M. Pourchet, Nature 280, 644 (1979) and C. Lorius et al., Nature 316, 591 (1985). We inquired of our French Colleagues in Grenoble, where any available relevant ice cores are stored, about the possibility of such an investigation. They invited us to make the measurements but also informed us that several sequences from the appropriate depths were already used for other purposes and anything remaining was in ‘bad shape’. The ECM method requires mostly continuous and competent ice core sections from well-identified depth levels. In addition, since both these core sites had very low net accumulation rates at the estimated age of interest, a continuous core length of only 1 to 1 12 m would represent the 170 years of accumulation in question. Consequently, any possible measurements on any available existing core would most probably have provided inconclusive and questionable data; the comparative study will have to await the success of the next new deep drilling in Antarctica.\nclim1544.tex; 11/02/1997; 16:07; v.6; p.13"

  "abstractText": "The 2191 m long ice core recovered at Byrd Station Antarctica in 1968 (BS68) was measured continuously by an electrical conductivity method (ECM). The ECM curve inferes the acidity of seasonal ice layers and major peaks, which identify clearly intermediate and prominent past volcanic activity over the last 50,000 years. We here also present recent data for a suite of the most striking volcanic events that occurred around 17.5 ka 0.5 BP. These events emitted enormous amounts of HCl and HF into the atmosphere.",
