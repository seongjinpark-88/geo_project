Formation of the predicted “icy highlands” ice sheets is coincident with a peak in the volcanic flux of Mars involving the emplacement of the Late Noachian – Early Hesperian ridged plains unit. We explore the relationship between the predicted early Mars “icy highlands” ice sheets, and the extensive early flood volcanism to gain insight into the surface conditions prevalent during the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian transition period. Using Hesperia Planum as a type area, we develop an ice sheet lava heating and loading model. We quantitatively assess the thermal and melting processes involved in the lava heating and loading process following the chronological sequence of lava emplacement. We test a broad range of parameters to thoroughly constrain the lava heating and loading process and outline predictions for the formation of resulting geological features. We apply the theoretical model to a study area within the Hesperia Planum region and assess the observed geology against predictions derived from the ice sheet lava heating and loading model. Due to the highly cratered nature of the Noachian highlands terrain onto which the volcanic plains were emplaced, we predict highly asymmetrical lava loading conditions. Crater interiors are predicted to accumulate greater thicknesses of lava over more rapid timescales, while in the intercrater plains, lava accumulation occurs over longer timescales and does not reach great thicknesses. We find that top-down melting due to conductive heat transfer from supraglacial lava flows is generally limited when the emplaced lava flows are less than ∼10 m thick, but is very significant at lava flow thicknesses of ∼100 m or greater. We find that bottom-up cryosphere and ice sheet melting is most likely to occur within crater interiors where lavas accumulate to a sufficient thickness to raise the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the superposed lavas. In these locations, if lava accumulation occurs rapidly, bottom-up melting of the ice sheet can continue, or begin, after lava accumulation has completed in a process we term “deferred melting”. Subsurface mass loss through melting of the buried ice sheets is predicted to cause substantial subsidence in the superposed lavas, leading to the formation of associated collapse features including fracture systems, depressions, surface faulting and folding, wrinkle-ridge formation, and chaos terrain. In addition, if meltwater generated from the lava heating and loading process becomes trapped at the lava flow margins due to the presence of impermeable confining units, large highly pressurized episodic flooding events could occur. Examination of the study area reveals geological features which are generally consistent with those predicted to form as a result of the ice sheet lava heating and loading process, suggesting the presence of surface snow and ice during the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian period.\n© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These predictions are generally inonsistent with a “warm and wet” early Mars climate ( Craddock nd Howard, 2002 ) interpreted from the widespread presence of alley network systems ( Howard, 2007; Fassett and Head, 2008; arnhart et al., 2009; Hynek et al., 2010; Hoke et al., 2011 ), open nd closed-basin lakes ( Cabrol and Grin, 1999; Carr, 2006; Fassett nd Head, 2008b ), and phyllosilicate-bearing units in Noachianged terrains ( Bibring et al., 2006; Ehlmann et al., 2011 ), as well\nt o i l i H o c a s T L f h\nt d r r a a H t 2 t ( h P a f d t a w p\nh i t o p e s o e i s H s c w\nf t r p t\n2\nw a t b a\nas the degraded state of Noachian-aged impact craters ( Craddock and Maxwell, 1993; Craddock et al., 1997; Craddock and Howard, 2002; Weiss and Head, 2015 ). Results from recent investigations modeling a thicker early Mars CO 2 atmosphere ( Forget et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2013, 2015 ) suggest that increased atmospheric pressure causes atmosphere–surface thermal coupling. This coupling leads to adiabatic cooling and a decrease in the mean annual temperatures of high elevation regions across Mars. The cooled highland regions act as cold traps and experience preferential accumulation of water–ice, leading to establishment of regional highland ice sheets which characterize the “icy highlands” early Mars climate model ( Forget et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2013, 2015; Head and Marchant, 2014 ).\nThe formation of regional ice sheets in the martian highlands predicted by the “icy highlands” model is coincident with the transition from the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian period on Mars, a time of dramatic change in both the geologic and climatic evolution of the planet ( Carr and Head, 2010 ). The transitional Hesperian period of Mars history is characterized by a shift in the dominant mineralogic weathering style ( Bibring et al., 2006 ), a sharp decrease in evidence for flowing surface water ( e.g. valley networks; Fassett and Head, 2008 ), and a peak in volcanic flux ( Craddock and Greeley, 2009; Carr and Head, 2010; Tanaka et al., 2014 ). The observed peak in volcanic activity occurred in the late Noachian and early during the Hesperian ( Craddock and Greeley, 2009; Rogers and Nazarian, 2013; Tanaka et al., 2014a ) in the form of planetary-scale flood volcanism, involving vast outpourings of volcanic material that resulted in the resurfacing of a significant portion of the planetary surface ( Head et al., 2002 , 2006; Goudge et al., 2012; Rogers and Nazarian, 2013 ). Conversely, fluvial activity waned throughout the Hesperian period ( Fassett and Head, 2008a ), followed by the emergence of the outflow channels during the Late Hesperian ( Baker and Milton, 1974 ; Sharp and Malin, 1975 ; Carr, 1979 ; Carr and Clow, 1981 ; Baker, 1982 ; Baker et al., 1992 ; Carr, 1996 ; Carr, 20 0 0 ; Baker, 20 01 ; Burr et al., 20 09 ; Irwin and Grant, 2009 ; Carr, 2012 ). Understanding the individual nature of these processes can provide insight into the conditions of the martian interior as well as the climate and state of volatiles at the surface of the planet. In addition, understanding the relationship between these major surface processes may be able to provide further information into the nature of the conditions on the surface of Mars during the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian transition.\nHere we explore the relationship between the predicted early Mars “icy highlands” ice sheets, and the extensive Late Noachian and Early Hesperian flood volcanism to gain insight into the surface conditions prevalent during this critical transition period. In the “icy highlands” climate scenario, accumulation of snowfall would lead to the deposition of regional ice sheets hundreds of meters thick within the Hesperia Planum region ( Wordsworth et al., 2013, 2015; Head and Marchant, 2014 ) which could then participate in a number of volcano–ice interactions including: (1) Direct interaction between extrusive lavas and surficial snow and ice deposits resulting in heating, melting, and explosive events ( e.g. Wilson and Head, 2007 ). (2) Thick accumulations of lava could provide a thermal blanket, raising the ice-melting isotherm thereby inducing widespread melt of cryospheric ice leading to groundwater recharge ( Clifford, 1993; Carr and Head, 2003; Russell and Head, 2007; Clifford et al., 2010; Cassanelli et al., 2015 ). (3) Accumulation of supraglacial lavas could raise the ice-melting isotherm into surface ice deposits causing widespread basal melting (similar in nature to the effect of sedimentary materials superposed upon ice sheets as investigated by Zegers et al., 2010 ). (4) Localized heating from individual volcanic structures ( e.g. edifices, vents; Head and Wilson, 20 02, 20 07; Shean et al., 2005; Kadish et al., 2008; Scanlon et al., 2014 ) could serve as heat-pipes ( Cassanelli et al., 2015 ), removing the cryosphere (defined as the portion of\nhe martian crust which lies between the surface and the depth f the ice-melting isotherm) and inducing ice sheet basal meltng at local scales. (5) Volcanic emissions ( e.g. Craddock and Greeey, 2009 ) could produce episodic greenhouse atmospheric warmng and allow transient top-down ice sheet melting events ( e.g.\nalevy and Head, 2014 ). These interactions are not predicted to ccur in a “warm and wet” climate scenario, because under these onditions, a vertically integrated hydrological cycle ( e.g. Craddock nd Howard, 2002 ) would allow surface water to infiltrate into the ubsurface, limiting interactions with extrusive volcanic processes. herefore, evidence of surficial volcano–ice interactions during the ate Noachian to Early Hesperian transition would provide support or the dominance of “cold and icy” conditions at this time of Mars\nistory.\nTo perform this assessment, we examine Hesperia Planum, the ype area for the Hesperian Period ( Fig. 1 ) and a region of preicted “icy highlands” ice sheet formation which contains an aray of volcanic and fluvial features and evidence for volatileelated processes ( Squyres et al., 1987; Crown et al., 1992; Mest nd Crown, 20 01, 20 02, 20 03, 2014; Ivanov et al., 20 05; Gregg nd Crown, 2009 ). Hesperia Planum is an extensive ∼2 ×10 6 km 2 esperian-aged smooth plains unit ( Gregg and Crown, 2005 ) and he type location for the Hesperian Ridged plains ( Tanaka et al., 014b ), a unit characterized by the presence of wrinkle ridge strucures and interpreted to represent effusive flood volcanic deposits Head et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2014b ). Previous contributions ave explored the role of volcano–ice interactions in the Hesperia lanum region ( Squyres et al., 1987 ) and have invoked the interction of intrusive and extrusive volcanism with ground-ice in the ormation of several observed features. Here, in light of the pre-\nictions made by the recent “icy highlands” model, we re-examine he role of volcano–ice interactions in the Hesperia Planum region nd test an “ice sheet lava heating and loading” mechanism in\nhich the Early Hesperian volcanic plains are emplaced atop the\nredicted regional “icy highlands” ice sheets.\nIn this contribution we detail a theoretical analysis of the lava eating and loading mechanism treating each aspect of the process\nn chronological sequence. (1) We first examine the volcano–ice ineractions and melting processes associated with the emplacement\nf an initial lava flow, which we define as a lava flow which is emlaced directly upon the ice sheet surface. (2) We then modify and xtend this initial treatment to assess the effects and melting reulting from emplacement of subsequent lava flows. (3) Lastly, we utline and implement a numerical model to test the long-term ffects and bottom-up melting processes resulting from continued ce sheet lava heating and loading. The analyses presented here asume ice sheet formation prior to the onset of volcanic activity.\nowever, accumulation of ice and lava could have been coeval, re-\nulting in interspersed deposits of ice and lava. The implications of oeval ice and lava accumulation for the interactions and processes\ne explore are discussed in a later section.\nResults from these analyses are used to synthesize predictions or the generation of geological features, which are then compared o the geological record observed in a study region within Hespeia Planum. This morphological comparison is used to derive im-\nlications for the prevailing conditions during the Late Noachian o Early Hesperian transition period.\n. Lava thicknesses and accumulation timescales\nThe total thickness of lava accumulated atop the ice sheet, along ith the thickness of individually emplaced lava flows and the\nccumulation timescale are the most important factors controlling he thermal aspects of the lava heating and loading process. This is ecause these factors determine the amount and timing of heating nd insulation being provided to the loaded ice sheet. Therefore,\nw l t m c m a c\nl r a h r t a a e begin by making estimates of the range of total volcanic plains ava thicknesses in the Hesperia Planum study region. In order o make this determination, diameters and topographic measureents were collected from 51 buried and partially buried impact raters ( Fig. 2 ; SI Table 1). We first make the assumption that the easured crater diameters are representative of the fresh crater dimeters and then translate the measured crater diameters to postollapse crater rim height and crater depths through crater scaling aws ( Craddock et al., 1997; Tornabene et al., 2014 ). The crater im crest heights and diameters calculated in this manner serve s upper limits because many of the measured buried craters may ave been degraded prior to lava flow emplacement, which would educe both the crater rim crest height and crater depths. Noting hat these estimates will reflect upper limits, we obtain minimum ccumulated lava thicknesses by assuming that lava must have ccumulated to at least the height of the crater rim crests to bury\na t\n3\ni t d a c o i v t 2 l\n3\nd s o\no W ( s r l ( a fl i p 2 s ( w t o a t 1 s a a m a e fl l\nT\nw\nthe crater. Maximum accumulated lava thicknesses were then obtained by assuming that all the filling material inside the crater is sourced from the Hesperian volcanic plains (thus the difference between the currently observed crater floor depth, and the fresh crater depth give the maximum accumulated lava thickness). This estimate also provides an upper limit since the measured craters may have been filled to some extent by other materials prior to lava emplacement. Histograms showing the distribution of measurements taken from the Hesperia Planum are shown in Fig. 2 and the measured crater locations and diameters are tabulated in SI Table 1. Based on these assumptions the collected measurements yield an average minimum accumulated lava thickness of ∼500 m, and an average maximum accumulated lava thickness of ∼2 km.\nTo estimate the thickness of the individual lava flows we consider the general nature of the Hesperia Planum volcanic plains which are thought to have been emplaced in a flood basalt mode ( Head and Coffin, 1997; Head et al., 20 02, 20 06 ), similar in nature to the terrestrial continental large igneous provinces ( e.g. Coffin and Eldholm, 1994; Self et al., 1997 ). In the terrestrial continental large igneous provinces, lava flows are emplaced ( Reidel et al., 2013 ) as either distinct individual series of compound flows, or as extensive, high-volume sheet flows. In general, the continental flood basalt provinces are predominantly constructed from the accumulation of sheet flows ( Reidel et al., 2013 ). The individual thickness of these sheet flows varies considerably from ∼1 m to as much as 150 m ( Self et al., 1997; Sharma, 1997 ), with flow thicknesses observed in the Columbia River Flood basalt province generally in the range of ∼10 to 50 m ( Self et al., 1997 ). These lava flow thicknesses bracket the observed terrestrial flood basalt flow thicknesses and form reasonable guidelines for the flow thicknesses expected in the Hesperia Planum volcanic plains. However, due to the gravity scaling of the Bingham rheology of lava ( Hulme, 1974 ), flows on Mars would be ∼2.5 times as thick as terrestrial flows, all else being equal. In addition, the Hesperia Planum volcanic plains were emplaced upon a heavily cratered Noachian-aged highlands unit which is likely to have complicated the emplacement and accumulation of the flood basalt plains ( Head, 1982; Whitten and Head, 2013 ) relative to the terrestrial case. Modeling the volcanic flooding of heavily cratered planetary surfaces by Whitten and Head (2013) has shown that impact craters act as focal points for lava accumulation. This causes more rapid local lava flooding and an effective increase in lava flow thicknesses within crater interiors relative to the surrounding intercrater plains. As a result, a dichotomy in lava emplacement conditions between crater interiors and the intercrater plains is predicted in the Hesperia Planum region. This will result in asymmetrical emplaced lava flow thicknesses at both local and regional scales within Hesperia Planum. To address the effects of martian gravity and the predicted asymmetrical nature of individual lava flow thicknesses within the Hesperia Planum region, we test a broad range of lava flow thicknesses from 1 to 200 m (which encompasses the observed range of lava flow thicknesses in terrestrial continental large igneous provinces).\nPrevious estimates on the timescale of Hesperian ridged plains emplacement suggest a total emplacement time of ∼100 to 200 Myr ( Craddock and Greeley, 2009; Tanaka et al., 2014a ) with active eruption periods occupying only ∼0.01% of this time, giving a total cumulative eruption duration of ∼10 kyr ( Halevy and Head, 2014 ). The proportion of the total emplacement timescale occupied by active eruption periods interpreted for the Hesperian ridged plains is consistent with the terrestrial Columbia River flood basalt large igneous province which shares a similar relationship between the total emplacement timescale and cumulative eruptive duration ( Self et al., 1997; Reidel et al., 2013 ). To assess the range of possible lava accumulation timescales, we test end-member cases whereby lava emplacement is completed in a minimum of 10 kyr\nnd a maximum of 100 Myr (chosen over a 200 Myr case to reduce he required computational time).\n. Initial lava flow emplacement\nQuantitative assessment of the ice sheet lava heating and loadng mechanism begins by considering the emplacement of the iniial lava flow, which we define as a lava flow which is emplaced\nirectly upon the ice sheet surface. The emplacement of lava flows top an ice sheet can occur by two main mechanisms. Lava flows an be emplaced across the ice sheet surface by simply advancing nto the top of the ice sheet from a topographically elevated nonce covered location (as is observed to occur in some terrestrial olcanic settings; Edwards et al., 2015 ), or by dike emplacement hrough the ice sheet due to high strain rates ( Wilson and Head,\n0 02; Head and Wilson, 20 02, 20 07 ), leading to the eruption of\nava flows at the ice sheet surface.\n.1. Thermal analysis\nFollowing emplacement, the initial lava flow will begin to unergo conductive cooling, transferring heat into the underlying ice heet, and to the atmosphere above. To determine the amount f heat that is transferred to the underlying ice, we solve the ne-dimensional heat conduction equation ( ∂T ∂t = k ∂ 2 T ∂ z 2 ) following\nilson and Head (2007) . We treat the lava flow as an infinite slab considering heat transfer in only the vertical direction), and asume that the flow is emplaced instantaneously relative to the duation of heat transfer and cooling (which is the case for most ava flows; Pinkerton and Wilson, 1994 ). For the thinner lava flows 1 m and 10 m in thickness) we apply an initial sinusoidal temperture distribution throughout the lava slab to account for a lava\now structure exhibiting chilled flow margins, with temperatures\nncreasing towards the lava flow core reaching a peak value of ap-\nroximately 1350 K (as observed in the supraglacial flows of the 012–2013 Tolbachik eruption on the Kamchatka peninsula in Rusia; Edwards et al., 2015 ). For the lava flows of greater thickness 100 m and 200 m), we assume that the chilled lava flow margins\nill have little effect on the overall temperature distribution of he lava flow structure and apply a uniform temperature throughut the lava slab. For this uniform lava flow temperature we take n average of lava flow temperatures derived from geothermomeer measurements of the Columbia River Flood basalts ( Self et al., 997 ), giving a value of 1350 K. The temperature at the top of the lab in all cases is held constant at a predicted Late Noachian mean nnual surface temperature (225 K; Wordsworth et al., 2013, 2015 ) nd the temperature at the base of the slab is held constant at the\nelting point of water (assuming a continuous interface with ice t the base of the lava flow is maintained). Solution of the heat quation subject to these conditions over the thickness of the lava ow (in the z -direction on the interval 0 < z < L ) produces the folowing series:\n( z, t ) = T S + ( T B − T S ) z L\n+ n ∑\nj=1 A j sin ( jπz/L ) e\n−k j 2 π2 t/L 2 (1)\nhere:\nT ( z, t ) = temperature (K) at any depth z (m) within the flow at time t (s), T S = surface temperature (K), T B =basal temperature (K), A j =Fourier coefficient for the initial temperature distribution, L = lava flow thickness (m), k = thermal diffusivity (m 2 /s).\ne s t K o t e m L t T i e a y T t t a d t n W\nr\nc f ( H c w n t m fl\n3\ne a e i i w t a t t\nWe compute the series given by Eq. (1) to n = 50 terms at ach time value evaluated to ensure solution convergence even at mall values of time t ( ∼600 s). The heat flux into the ice beneath he lava flow is: H( W / m 2 ) = K T dT dz with the thermal conductivity T = k ̄ρc where k is the thermal diffusivity, ρ̄ is the bulk density f the lava (kg/m 3 ), c is the specific heat capacity (J/kg K), and the emperature gradient ( dT dz ) at the lava–ice interface is calculated by xtrapolating the gradient from 0.98 × z to 0.999 × z . The rate of elting of the underlying ice sheet is then R ( m / s ) = H/ρL i where i is the latent heat of fusion of ice ( ∼ 3.35 × 10 5 J/kg), and ρ is he density of the underlying ice sheet (917 kg/m 3 for solid ice). he total thickness of ice melted following lava flow emplacement s calculated by integration of the melting rates throughout the ntirety of the cooling process. We note that the melting rates nd total ice thicknesses melted that are predicted by this analsis are effected by several assumptions implicit in the analysis.\nhese include the assumption of constant thermal properties for he cooling basalt, the assumption that no heat energy is expended owards warming the water produced after melting has occurred, nd disregarding the energy released from the latent heat of fusion uring cooling while the lava flow is above the solidus temperaure. The effects of these assumptions on the thermal analysis are ot predicted to be substantial and are quantified and discussed in\nilson and Head (2007) .\nWe assume a basaltic magma composition (typical of Hespeian ridged plains volcanic materials as observed within Gusev\ni\nrater; McSween et al., 2006 ), and take typical terrestrial values or the basaltic lava density ( ∼30 0 0 kg/m 3 ), specific heat capacity ∼900 J/kg K), and thermal diffusivity (7 ×10 −7 m 2 /s) ( Wilson and ead, 2007 ). The heat transfer rates into the underlying ice are alculated throughout the entirety of the lava flow cooling period\nith the use of Eq. (1) for each of the adopted lava flow thick-\nesses discussed in Section 2 . The heat transfer rates are then inegrated throughout the cooling period of each lava flow to deter-\nine the amount of ice that is melted versus time following lava\now emplacement ( Fig. 3 ).\n.2. Initial lava flow emplacement: snow and firn layer\nIt has been assumed to this point that supraglacial lava flows mplaced atop the surface of an ice sheet will be in contact with\nsurface of pure ice. However, in many cases the surficial layrs of ice sheets are comprised of snow and firn instead of pure ce ( Cuffey and Paterson, 2010 ) (where snow is defined as water– ce having a bulk density of less than 360 kg/m 3 , firn as water–ice\nith bulk densities from 360 to 830 kg/m 3 , and ice for bulk densiies greater than 830 kg/m 3 ). The presence of a snow and firn layer t the ice sheet surface will enhance the melting rates and total hicknesses melted during supraglacial lava flow emplacement due o the reduced bulk densities of the snow and firn relative to solid ce.\nc a o ( p w i b e i\ni a h fl d H t e T p t f l n\n3\ne s a a 2 a s t w g o c\nn w d o i\nThe snow and firn layer is a result of the construction of the ice sheet from accumulating snow which transitions into ice through a firn densification process ( e.g. Cuffey and Paterson, 2010; Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ). On Earth, ice sheet firn layers are found primarily in the cold accumulation zones of ice sheets ( Cuffey and Paterson, 2010 ). This is because in the absence of accumulation, the firn continuously undergoes densification without replenishment and because in the ablation zones, temperatures above the melting point rapidly diminish the firn layer. On Mars, the low gravity and low surface temperatures favor the preservation of the firn layer; thus firn layers comparable or greater in thickness to those found in the accumulation zone of terrestrial ice sheets are predicted to exist across the surface of any ice sheets present on Mars ( Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ).\nIn the “icy highlands” scenario, ice sheet growth is predicted to be a supply-limited process ( Carr and Head, 2015; Fastook and Head, 2015 ), resulting in the termination of snow accumulation once the water–ice supply has been exhausted. Without melting and recycling of the water stored in the “icy highlands” ice sheets establishing an equilibrium state, the thickness and density state of the ice sheet snow and firn layer will vary as a function of time during the ice sheet formation process (modulated by the prevailing climate conditions) ( Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ). Under nominal “icy highlands” conditions the firn layer will be at a maximum thickness of ∼115 m immediately after the completion of ice sheet formation once the water ice supply has been exceeded ( Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ). The thickness of the firn layer will then reduce over time, reaching a thickness of ∼17 m after 1 Myr of ice sheet evolution and densification without further snow accumulation ( Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ). The presence of a firn layer has an appreciable effect on the results of the thermal analysis which we now discuss.\n3.3. Initial lava flow emplacement: results\nWe find that following emplacement, thinner lava flows contribute an initially higher heat flux to the underlying ice due to more efficient cooling. As a result of the higher heat transfer rates and the lower total heat energy that is contained within thinner lava flows, thinner lava flows cool to ambient temperatures significantly more quickly than the thicker lava flows. Therefore, despite the higher initial heat transfer rates provided by thinner lava flows, the sustained nature of heat delivery from thicker lava flows due to prolonged cooling and the increased total heat energy, ultimately results in the melting of a much greater thickness of ice ( Fig. 3 ).\nThe cooling timescales of initial lava flows calculated through the thermal analysis range from ∼7 days to ∼800 yr for the evaluated lava flow thicknesses of 1–200 m ( Fig. 3 ). Integration of the heat transfer rates throughout the cooling period for each lava flow indicates a near constant ratio between the thickness of ice melted and the thickness of the initial lava flow emplaced equal to ∼3 for the thinner lava flows (1 m and 10 m in thickness) and ∼4.5 for the thicker lava flows (100 m and 200 m in thickness) ( Fig. 3 ). The difference in this ratio between the thinner lava flows and thicker lava flows is due to the different initial temperature distributions applied within the thinner and thicker lava slabs, however, both results are in general agreement with results determined for the terrestrial case from Wilson and Head (2007) .\nThus, throughout the initial lava flow cooling process, a 1 m lava flow will transfer enough heat to melt ∼3 m of ice, while a 10 m lava flow will be able to melt ∼30 m of ice ( Fig. 3 ). For the thicker lava flows, the thermal analysis results suggest that the 10 0 m, and 20 0 m thick initial lava flows contain enough heat energy to melt through a 450 m and 900 m thick ice sheet, respectively ( Fig. 3 ). The implications of this significant top-down melting potential are discussed in more detail in later sections. In all\nThe total thicknesses of ice melted during the emplacement and ooling of each evaluated lava flow thickness are shown in Table 1 long with the total melted thickness adjusted for the presence f the end-member firn layer thicknesses. These results indicate: 1) The 1 m thick initial lava flow will not be able to melt comletely through either modeled firn layer. (2) The 10 m lava flow\nill be able to melt through only the thin firn layer. (3) The meltng totals associated with the thicker lava flows are little affected\ny the presence of the firn layer. (4) The amount of subsidence ach lava flow is predicted to undergo during the top-down meltng process is increased due to the presence of the firn layer.\nA fundamental change in the scale of predicted top-down meltng exists between the thinner initial lava flows (1 m and 10 m) nd the thicker initial lava flows (100 m and 200 m) evaluated\nere. The total melted thicknesses associated with the thinner lava ows do not account for a substantial amount of the entire preicted “icy highlands” ice sheet thicknesses (30 0–10 0 0 m; Carr and ead, 2015; Fastook and Head, 2015 ). Conversely, the total melted hicknesses predicted for the thicker lava flows approach, and even xceed, the thicknesses expected of the “icy highlands” ice sheets. herefore, a fundamentally different regime of meltwater transort and fate processes will arise during the emplacement of the hicker lava flows. We now examine in detail the transport and ate of meltwater generated through top-down melting following ava flow emplacement, considering first the cases in which thin-\ner initial lava flows are emplaced.\n.4. Top-down meltwater transport and fate: thin lava flows\nMeltwater produced at the surface of the ice sheet during the mplacement and cooling of an initial lava flow can follow one of everal pathways ( Fig. 4 ): (1) The meltwater may enter into storge within the underlying porous firn layer, whereby the firn layer cts much like a terrestrial groundwater aquifer ( Forster et al., 014 ). (2) The meltwater may drain towards the glacial margins cross the top of the ice sheet, forming channels as it follows ice heet surface topography. (3) The meltwater may drain towards he ice sheet base through cracks, crevasses, or moulins. (4) Melt-\nater may pool beneath the lava flow and at the lava flow mar-\nins, enhancing cooling and resulting in phreatomagmatic events, r refreezing after cooling has finished and temperatures have dereased.\nThe nature of the ice sheet snow and firn layer, and the thickess of the emplaced lava flow will determine which of these meltater pathways is dominant ( Fig. 4 ). Under the Late Noachian conitions of interest, there are two broad possibilities for the state f the ice sheet surface: (1) The firn layer may be relatively thick\nf lava emplacement has occurred shortly after the completion of\ni t m t p\nw a T l t s t d i t w c t\np fi\nm w\nw\nt\nce sheet formation or if some melting mechanism allows for waer recycling and continued snow deposition. (2) The firn layer\nay be relatively thin if the ice sheets have remained stable over imescales on the order of ∼ 1 Myr after formation without the inut of additional snow to replenish the firn layer.\nIn either of these scenarios, the porous snow and firn layer ill act to subdue runoff across the surface of the ice sheet by\nbsorbing meltwater, thereby eliminating this meltwater pathway. he absorption of meltwater from the melting interface with the ava flow will also reduce the likelihood of phreatomagmatic erupions by evacuating water from the lava interface and suppressing team generation. Meltwater may drain towards the ice sheet base hrough cracks, crevasses, and moulins. However, due to the pre-\nicted pervasiveness of snow and firn across the “icy highlands”\nce sheets ( Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ), the primary fate of waer produced by top-down melting is predicted to be absorption\nithin the snow and firn layer. If meltwater production rates exeed the infiltration capacity of the porous snow and firn layer, hen other interactions are possible, including localized meltwater\nonding. Thus, estimating the infiltration capacity of the snow and rn layer is important.\nTo estimate the infiltration capacity of the firn layer we impleent the following adaptation of Darcy’s law for saturated groundater flow ( Hendriks, 2010 ):\nI R = K (\nL + S f + h o L\n) (2)\nhere:\nI R = infiltration rate (m/s), K = hydraulic conductivity (m/s), L = thickness of porous medium considered (m), S f =wetting front soil suction head (m), h o =head of infiltrating water ponded at porous media interface\n(m).\nIn order to estimate a minimum infiltration rate, we conservaively assume that both the wetting front soil suction head and the\nc ( c t c\nb s i m fi t w A c o w m m a r c t e m a h m fl t w b a s\n3\nhead of ponded infiltrating water are equal to zero. This reduces the infiltration rate predicted by Eq. (2) to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the substrate. While this implementation of Darcy’s law is valid for the flow of water through an unsaturated media, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is not a constant, but is a function of the porous medium water content ( Fetter, 2001 ). The hydraulic conductivity will be at a minimum when the water content is zero, and will increase to a maximum at saturation. In practice the relation between water content and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is determined experimentally (typically varying by about an order of magnitude; Fetter, 2001 ). Here we adopt the saturated hydraulic conductivity, and note that the calculated infiltration rates will serve as upper limits.\nThe hydraulic conductivity K h (m/s) of the snow and firn can be\ncalculated from the intrinsic permeability k (m 2 ) as:\nK h = k ρw g\nμ (3)\nwhere ρw is the density of water (10 0 0 kg/m 3 ), μ is the dynamic viscosity of water ( 1 . 793 × 10 −3 Pa s at 273 K ) , and g is the gravitational acceleration in m/s 2 . Colbeck and Anderson (1982) measured the saturated permeability of melting snow, at a density of 400 kg/m 3 , to be ∼ 4 × 10 −9 m 2 . Under martian gravity this permeability gives a saturated hydraulic conductivity of ∼30 m/hr. This infiltration rate is more than two orders of magnitude greater than the highest meltwater production rate predicted from lava flow emplacement, which is ∼100 mm/hr, achieved during the initial supraglacial emplacement of a 1 m thick initial lava flow. Therefore, the infiltration capacity of the snow and firn layer is likely more than sufficient to accommodate the predicted meltwater production rates (even if a significant reduction in conductivity due to unsaturated conditions is taken into consideration). As a result, meltwater generated at the lava–ice interface will percolate downwards into the snow and firn layer, where it will be subject to eventual refreezing. When the meltwater refreezes, latent heat of fusion will be released from the melt into the surrounding ice or firn at depth which will enhance the densification of the surrounding material firn, aiding in the transition to ice.\nAny snow and firn that remains after lava flow cooling has completed will continue to undergo compaction and densification ( Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ) in response to the overburden stress of the emplaced lava flows. Firn that is compacted into ice will result in a reduction of the firn layer thickness by an amount:\nz ∗ ( 1 − ∫ z 0 ρ( z ) dz\nρi\n) (4)\nwhere z is the thickness of the firn layer compacted, ρ( z ) is the density of the firn layer as a function of depth ( z ) prior to compaction, and ρ i is the density of ice. However, this component of firn reduction is likely to be negligible because the lava flows are very effective at removing the firn layer and because the highly porous near surface firn layers most susceptible to compaction will have been removed by melting.\nAs the firn layer undergoes densification and becomes diminished through melting, compaction, and refreezing, the porosity and permeability will decrease (causing the hydraulic conductivity to decrease to ∼7 m/hr at a density of ∼550 kg/m 3 , down to zero at a density of ∼830 kg/m 3 when impermeability is reached). The reduction in firn layer thickness and porosity will also cause a decrease in the storage capacity of the affected firn layer subjacent to the lava flow by reducing the pore space that can be occupied by meltwater. Prior to melting and compaction, the thin (17 m) firn layer is able to store a ∼7 m column of meltwater per unit area, while the thick (115 m) firn layer is able to store a ∼36 m column of meltwater per unit area. Taking into consideration firn layer reduction due to melting during lava flow emplacement and\nooling, even the thinnest initial lava flow considered in this study 1 m) will produce more meltwater throughout the duration of ooling than the thin firn layer can accommodate, while a 10 m hick initial lava flow produces more water than the thick firn layer an accommodate.\nTherefore, we predict that in most cases, more meltwater will e produced during initial lava flow emplacement than can be tored within the underlying firn. In cases where the firn layer s not completely removed, but the storage capacity is exceeded,\neltwater will migrate laterally into the unaffected surrounding\nrn ( Fig. 4 ). However, if the lava flow is able to melt completely\nhrough the firn and down into the impermeable ice, meltwater\nill no longer be able to migrate downwards away from the lava. s a result, meltwater that is not able to drain through cracks, revasses, or moulins will pool beneath the lava flow. The weight f the overlying lava flow will impart hydraulic head to this melt-\nater, which will then direct the meltwater towards the lava flow argins ( Fig. 4 ). Once the lava flow margin has been reached, the eltwater may move upwards along the interface between the ice\nnd the lava flow. If meltwater is not able to infiltrate into the surounding firn layer as it rises along the lava flow margins (which ould be prevented by low permeability surrounding firn or by ice) he lava flow may become flooded and inundated. This will accelrate the cooling of the lava flow, and may trigger phreatomag-\natic events, though it will also result in less ice melting, since portion of the heat energy of the lava flow will go towards\neating the meltwater, and to production of steam. Phreatomag-\natic eruptions will result in at least local destruction of the lava\nows and firn layer, and dispersal of the lava flow material across he surrounding ice sheet surface. In addition a crater would form\nhich would serve as a collecting location for meltwater and de-\nris, which would then simply refreeze. If no eruption takes place, fter cooling has finished, the water will freeze, potentially encapulating the lava flow in ice.\n.5. Thin initial lava flow emplacement: synthesis and predictions\n• The dominant transport pathways for meltwater produced\nby top-down melting following initial lava flow emplacement are downward percolation through the porous firn layer, and drainage through any ice sheet fractures, crevasses, and\nmoulins. • Meltwater that is absorbed by the snow and firn layer will en-\nter storage within the firn where it will refreeze (though the firn layer may offer tem porary protection against refreezing; Forster et al., 2014 ). Refreezing will release latent heat of fusion energy into the surrounding ice or firn, enhancing the transition\nof firn to ice if refreezing occurs within the firn layer. • Meltwater that intersects a fracture, crevasse, or moulin will be\ntransported towards the ice sheet base, and refreeze at some depth within the ice sheet since the ice sheet will remain in a\ncold-based state ( Fastook and Head, 2015 ). • The expansion resulting from refreezing of the meltwater at\ndepth within the ice sheet may result in the formation or ex-\ntension of fractures within the ice sheet. • We predict that supraglacial lava flows will typically be em-\nplaced upon a relatively thin firn layer ( ∼17 m) because under nominal Late Noachian conditions, the firn layer at the ice sheet surface will rapidly thin over geologically short time\nscales ( ∼100 kyr; Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ). • Emplacement of even the thinnest initial lava flows considered\n( ∼1 m) will effectively remove the thin predicted firn layer. • Meltwater produced by thicker lava flows ( ∼10 m) will only en-\nter storage in the firn initially since the flow will melt completely through the firn layer and down into the solid ice. In this case meltwater will pool around the flow enhancing\n3\ns 2 m l F d n o t p c\np w t t r i m i f I t i l l s r p d s s\na t t t t i d r u 1\n3 p\n4\ns fl t fl fl a c a l W o t c ( t i d e a m i\nl f b ( fl a p a i fl a p t T q r\nM\nw l fl o u i m\ncooling and potentially resulting in phreatomagmatic events. After the lava flow has completed cooling, the meltwater will refreeze around the lava flow, possibly encapsulating the flow\nif enough melt is pooled. • The net effect of initial lava flow emplacement will be efficient\nremoval of the surficial snow and firn layer, resulting in the subsidence, deformation, and degradation of the lava flow. The final degraded initial lava flows will then construct a cap across the ice sheet surface.\n.6. Top-down meltwater transport and fate: very thick lava flows\nAssessment of heat transfer and melting rates induced by the upraglacial emplacement of very thick lava flows (100 m and 00 m) suggests that these thick lava flows contain enough heat to\nelt thicknesses of ice which approach, or exceed, likely “icy highands” ice sheet thicknesses (30 0–10 0 0 m; Carr and Head, 2015; astook and Head, 2015 ). As a result of the significant melting pre-\nicted to occur ( Fig. 3 ), the dominant meltwater pathways will ow be ( Fig. 5 ): (1) local pooling at the margins of the lava flow r ponding beneath the flow, (2) drainage to the ice sheet base hrough cracks, crevasses, or moulins, and potential lateral transort, and (3) drainage towards the glacial margins through surface hannelization following the ice sheet surface topography.\nIn the case previously examined involving the supraglacial emlacement of thin lava flows ( ∼1 to 10 m), the surficial firn layer as predicted to subdue ice sheet surface runoff through absorpion of meltwater. However, in the case we examine now, where he emplaced lava thickness is much greater, the lava flow will apidly melt down through the firn layer into the impermeable ce sheet where most of the melting will take place. As a result,\neltwater that is generated by the lava flow will not be able to nfiltrate away from the lava flow unless it intersects an ice sheet racture or moulin that allows drainage toward the ice sheet base. nstead the meltwater will be directed along the lava–ice interface oward the lava flow margins where it will ascend along the lava– ce contact under the influence of the overburden pressure of the ava flow ( Fig. 5 ). This meltwater will pool around and above the ava flow and will begin to absorb into firn that remains at the ice heet surface surrounding the lava flow ( Fig. 5 ), though the surounding firn may become overwhelmed by the quantity of water\nroduced. In topographically favorable locations, meltwater is preicted to concentrate and to begin channelization across the ice heet surface, eroding the firn layer as it drains towards the ice heet margins ( Fig. 5 ).\nAfter cooling has completed, any remaining meltwater pooled round the lava flow will refreeze in place. Similarly, meltwater hat drains towards the ice sheet base will refreeze at depth within he ice sheet since the ice sheet will remain cold-based throughout he top-down melting process ( Fig. 5 ). This is because the insulaion provided by the thick lava flows is not sufficient to raise the ce-melting isotherm to the ice sheet base, and because the top-\nown melting produced by the lava flows occurs over a much more apid timescale (several 100 to several 10 4 yr) than the bottomp cryospheric heating and melting by raising the geotherm (many 0 6 yr).\n.7. Very thick initial lava flow emplacement: synthesis and redictions\n• Predicted melting totals resulting from supraglacial emplace-\nment of very thick lava flows can approach, and exceed, the\ntotal thicknesses of the “icy highlands” ice sheets. • As a result of the significant melting, the firn layer has little\neffect on meltwater transport and fate.\n• Meltwater is predicted to pool around the flow, drain to the ice\nsheet base, or runoff across the ice sheet surface in channels\nfollowing surface topography. • Meltwater that pools around the flow or drains to the ice sheet\nbase will refreeze after lava flow cooling, while meltwater that drains to the glacial margins may form channels in the martian\nsurface after it migrates beyond the ice sheet margins. • The cryosphere underlying the ice sheet will remain intact dur-\ning and after the initial thick lava flow emplacement because the insulation provided is not sufficient to dramatically raise\nthe ice-melting isotherm. • The net result of thick initial lava flow emplacement will be\neither considerable reduction in the total ice sheet thickness or complete top-down melting of the ice sheet (over a timescale of several 100 to 10 4 yr; Fig. 3 ).\n. Subsequent lava flow emplacement\nFollowing the emplacement and cooling of the initial upraglacial lava flow, the emplacement of subsequent lava ows will contribute much less heat to the underlying ice due o the intervening cooled initial lava flow. To estimate the heat\nux delivered to the underlying ice sheet during subsequent lava ow emplacement, we perform the same thermal analysis used to ssess the heat transfer from the initial lava flow with a modifiation of Eq. (1) to account for the different initial conditions. We ssume that a subsequent flow, equal in thickness to the initial ava flow, is emplaced, thereby doubling the value of L in Eq. (1) .\ne then apply the same initial distributions of heat, but across nly the top half of the now larger modeled lava sequence (over he depth region 0 < z < L /2 where z is depth). The same boundary onditions are applied at the surface of the modeled lava sequence at z = 0) as well as the base (at z = L ), based on the assumption hat the second flow is emplaced after the cooling period of the nitial lava flow. The remainder of the analysis is performed as\nefined in Section 3.1 . The same analysis is repeated to model the mplacement of a third flow, by tripling the value of L in Eq. (1) , nd applying the initial heat distribution to the top third of the\nodeled lava sequence (over the depth region 0 < z < L /3 where z\ns depth).\nWe find that the heat transfer from subsequent lava flows folows similar relationships with respect to lava flow thickness as or the initial lava flow, such that thinner flows produce higher,\nut less sustained, heat transfer rates relative to thicker flows Fig. 3 ). However, the onset of heat transfer from subsequent lava ows to the underlying ice is delayed from the emplacement time nd reduced in magnitude relative to the initial lava flow, with eak heat flows occurring later in the cooling period ( Fig. 3 ). As\nresult, the meltwater production rates, and total thicknesses of ce melted, are substantially less than those for the initial lava\nows which are emplaced directly upon the ice. The heat transfer nalysis performed here indicates that for each successively emlaced subsequent lava flow, there is a consistent decay in the raio of the total thickness of ice melted to the lava flow thickness. he decay in the total ice thickness melted, M T (m), versus subseuent lava flow thickness can be approximated by the following elationship:\nT = M R ∗ z/ ( ( z + L ) /z ) (5) here M R is the ratio of the total thickness of ice melted to the ava flow thickness (which has a value of ∼3 for the thinner lava ows, and ∼4.5 for the very thick lava flows), z is the thickness f the subsequent lava flow (m), and L is the total thickness of\nnderlying cooled lava flows (m). Results showing the amount of\nce melted versus time following subsequent lava flow emplace-\nent for the evaluated range of lava flow thicknesses are shown\np t p m m a graphically in Fig. 3 . With respect to the subsequent emplacement of the thin lava flows, the reduction in the total thickness of ice melted, the reduction in firn layer thickness, and the presence of the previously emplaced lavas, will result in a different series of meltwater transport and fate processes. Conversely, further melting is only predicted to occur after the subsequent emlacement of thick lava flows if the underlying ice sheets are very hick ( > ∼500 m), otherwise the ice sheet will have been comletely melted by the initial lava flow. Due to the differences in elting conditions associated with subsequent lava flow emplaceent, a different suite of meltwater transport and fate processes re predicted, which we now assess.\n4\na p t f m i d t f l l\nn ∼ ∼ t\nb ( fl i t\ns o m i a f c t o i e q d\n.1. Subsequent lava flow emplacement: meltwater transport and fate\nDuring the subsequent emplacement of thinner lava flows (1 m nd 10 m thick), the potential transport pathways for meltwater roduced from subsequent lava flow emplacement are effectively he same as those for the initial lava flow. The only significant diference is that in the case of the subsequent lava flow emplace-\nent, the melting interface will exist at the base of the underlying nitial lava flow ( Fig. 6 ). This interface will now initially lie at some\nepth below the surface of the ice sheet due to the subsidence of he initial flow caused by melting. As a result, the transport and ate of the meltwater depends upon the state of the remaining firn ayer beneath the initial lava flow, and upon the thickness of the ava flows ( Fig. 6 ).\nIf the firn layer was initially thick, then a non-trivial thickess of firn might remain after initial lava flow emplacement ( e.g. 60 m will remain if a 10 m lava flow was initially emplaced upon 115 m of firn, disregarding any firn compaction that may have aken place in the intervening time). In this case, melt produced\ny the subsequent flows will be absorbed by the remaining firn Fig. 6 ) despite the diminished permeability since subsequent lava ows produce significantly lower heat fluxes, and melt much less ce ( Fig. 3 ). Following absorption, the meltwater will participate in he same processes outlined in Section 3.4 .\nIf the firn layer was initially thin it will most likely have been ignificantly reduced, or completely removed, by the emplacement f the initial lava flows. In this case, meltwater will not be able to\nove downwards due to the impermeable underlying ice and will nstead migrate toward the lava flow margins and begin to ascend long the lava–ice contact ( Fig. 6 ) if no other path is available ( e.g. ractures within the underlying ice). The meltwater can then beome absorbed by the surrounding firn if it is encountered before he water ascends to the top of the lava flow sequence ( Fig. 6 ),\nr pool above the flow, submerging the subsequent lava flow, and\nncreasing cooling rates, and the likelihood for phreatomagmatic vents. Lava flow submergence is less likely to occur during subse-\nuent flow emplacement, since much less melt is produced ( Fig. 3 ) ue to the reduced heat transfer rates, and because the total lava\nRELATIVELY THICK LAVA FLOW EMPLACEMENT\nt m e c t b q w b h s a f 1 flow sequence thickness is greater. In either case, the fate of the meltwater will be to undergo freezing within the surrounding firn, or around the margins of the lava flow itself ( Fig. 6 ) as described in previous sections. If the “icy highlands” ice sheets were sufficiently thick ( > ∼500 m), then the ice sheet may not have been completely melted during the emplacement of an initial 100 m thick lava flow (though it will have been nearly entirely removed by a lava flow 200 m in thickness). Therefore ice will remain to undergo melting during the subsequent emplacement of 100 m thick lava flows. However, continued accumulation of very thick flows will result in complete top-down melting of the predicted thicknesses of “icy highlands” ice sheets ( ∼300 to 1000 m) during the emplacement of only ∼1 to 5 successive lava flows ( Fig. 3 ). Fig. 7 depicts a synhesized illustration of the lava loading and heating process and eltwater transport and fate pathways in the case of successive mplacement and accumulation of very thick lava flows. In this ase, the meltwater transport and fate processes will be essentially he same as with the initial very thick lava flow ( Fig. 5 ). This is ecause the melting interface will lie at the base of the lava seuence in contact with impermeable ice ( Fig. 7 ) (as was the case ith the initial very thick lava flow), though less meltwater will e produced during the subsequent lava flow emplacement and eating ( Fig. 3 ). Throughout the top-down melting process the ice heet will remain in a cold-based state ( Fastook and Head, 2015 ) nd the impermeable ice-cemented cryosphere will remain unafected because the timescale of top-down melting (several 100 to 0 4 yr) is far more rapid than the timescale required for cryosphere\nr b t s e t w t f d w w a r\n4\n5\nr c i t c p ( d fl A o e a s\nt t\nc t fl l i b\ni t m i t l h t f\n5\nfl t s f i c P d s W L 2 g t g e\n5\ni a d u i i m a m v c\na ( w l l r t 2 L a M s\neduction and melting (many 10 6 yr). Due to the impermeable oundaries surrounding the lava flow sequence ( Fig. 7 ), meltwaer is predicted to pool around the flow sequence, drain to the ice heet base, or runoff across the ice sheet surface ( Fig. 7 ). Howver, since much less melt is being produced than during the iniial thick lava flow emplacement, it is less likely that surface runoff\nill occur during subsequent lava flow emplacement. The fate of he water transported by these mechanisms remains the same as or the initial thick lava flow discussed in Section 3.6 . The top-\nown melting of the ice sheet, and evacuation of the meltwater,\nill result in substantial subsidence of the superposed lava flows hich is predicted to lead to the formation of a host of subsidence\nnd collapse -related features including fracture systems, wrinkle idges, depressions, and chaos terrain ( Fig. 7 ).\n.2. Subsequent lava flow emplacement: synthesis and predictions\n• Heat transfer from the emplacement of subsequent lava flows is\ndelayed in delivery to the ice, reduced in magnitude, and more sustained in nature, relative to that from initial lava flow em-\nplacement. • Due to the reduction in heat transfer, the emplacement of sub-\nsequent lava flows will melt a smaller total thickness of ice rel-\native to the initial lava flows. • Meltwater produced by thinner subsequent lava flows ( ∼10 m\nor less) is predicted to be predominantly absorbed into the sur-\nrounding firn layer. • Top-down melting from subsequent emplacement of thinner\nlava flows is limited as successive flows are emplaced because heat delivery to the underlying ice is impeded by a thickening layer of previously emplaced chilled lava flows. Therefore, continued lava flow emplacement will result in negligible topdown melting, serving mainly to construct a thermally insulat-\ning cap of lava atop the ice sheet. • Unless the ice sheets being loaded were initially very thick\n( > ∼500 m), no ice will be left to melt from subsequent emplacement of very thick lava flows ( ∼100 m or greater). • If melting occurs from subsequent thick lava flow emplacement\n( ∼100 m or greater), meltwater is predicted to follow the same transport and fate processes outlined in Section 3.6 . • Melting of the underlying ice sheet by all thicknesses of subse-\nquent lava flows will result in continued subsidence and degradation of the lava flow sequence ( e.g. a 10 m lava flow, emplaced subsequent to an initial 10 m lava flow, will result in subsidence of the entire 20 m lava sequence on the order of\n∼15 m). • At this point in the ice sheet lava loading process, lava flows\nwill exist in a stable equilibrium condition on top of the ice sheet.\n. Continued ice sheet lava heating and loading\nWhile continued accumulation of thick lava flows will rapidly esult in complete top-down melting of the predicted ice sheets, ontinued lava loading proceeds very differently if the accumulatng lava flows are thin ( ∼10 m or less). As thin lava flows coninue to accumulate across an ice sheet surface, the portion of heat onducted down into the underlying ice is quickly reduced to the\noint that top-down melting at the ice sheet surface is negligible If a 10 m lava flow is emplaced atop 90 m of cooled lavas, the unerlying ice sheet will only undergo ∼3 m of melting. If a 1 m lava ow were emplaced, only ∼0.03 m of melting would take place). s a result of the limited top-down melting, the overall thickness f the ice sheet will not be significantly reduced, and the primary ffect of the accumulating lava flows will be the establishment of\nthermally insulating layer atop the ice sheets, insulating the ice heet and acting to raise the ice-melting isotherm. We now explore\nhe long-term effects of continued ice sheet loading of relatively hin lava flows.\nThe distance that the ice-melting isotherm at the base of the ryosphere can be raised by the lava flows is dependent upon he thickness, and the thermal properties of the accumulated lava ows as well as the buried ice sheet. If a sufficient thickness of ava is loaded atop the ice sheets, the ice-melting isotherm may ntercept the base of the ice sheet, resulting in induced ice sheet\nasal melting.\nThe lava heating and loading process and the nature of the nduced melting processes are dependent on several critical facors: (1) The mean annual surface temperatures and the geother-\nal heat flux. (2) The thickness of both the cryosphere and the ce sheet upon which lavas are emplaced. (3) The total thickness o which lavas accumulate, and the timescale over which accumuation occurs. (4) The thickness of the individual lava flows, which\nas an effect on the amount of top-down melting produced during he lava heating and loading process. We review the effect of these actors in more detail in the following subsections.\n.1. Temperatures and geothermal heat flux\nBoth the mean annual surface temperature and geothermal heat ux strongly influence the effect that the insulation provided by he lava loading process has on the cryosphere and the buried ice heet. Higher temperatures and geothermal heat flux values allow or more rapid melting, while requiring less insulation, thus requirng lower thicknesses of accumulated lava. We test end-member ases for the mean annual surface temperature in the Hesperia\nlanum region during the Late Noachian of 210 and 240 K as preicted by global climate modeling studies at atmospheric presures of 8 mbar and 1 bar, respectively ( Wordsworth et al., 2013 ).\nith respect to the geothermal heat flux, we assess a nominal ate Noachian geothermal heat flux of 55 mW/m 2 ( Solomon et al., 005; Clifford et al., 2010; Fastook et al., 2012 ), and an elevated eothermal heat flux of 100 mW/m 2 which may have been susained, at least locally, during this time in the Hesperia Planum reion due to widespread volcanic and magmatic activity ( Cassanelli t al., 2015 ).\n.2. Ice sheet and cryosphere thicknesses\nIce sheet thickness has a direct control on the bottom-up meltng processes associated with the lava heating and loading mechnism in terms of the amount of ice available for melting, and in\netermining the thickness of loaded lava needed to cause bottomp melting. This is because at greater ice sheet thicknesses more\nnsulation is provided for the ice sheet base, and less additional nsulation from accumulated lava is required to initiate bottom-up\nelting. The thickness of the cryosphere is determined by the balnce between the mean annual surface temperature, the geother-\nal heat flux, and the thickness of the overlying ice sheet. Larger alues of each of these parameters will reduce the thickness of the ryosphere.\nThe thickness of the regional ice sheets predicted to form cross the highlands of Mars during the Late Noachian period Wordsworth et al., 2013 ) depends on the total available surface\nater reservoir of Mars at this time ( Carr and Head, 2015 ). It is ikely that the Late Noachian available surface water reservoir was arger than the currently observed surface water inventory, curently ∼34 m thick global equivalent layer (GEL) contained within he polar caps, and surface and shallow ground ice ( Carr and Head,\n015 ). However, the precise quantity of water contained within the ate Noachian inventory depends on uncertain estimates of the mount of water lost to space ( Greeley, 1987; Jakosky et al., 1994;\nellon and Jakosky, 1995; Greenwood et al., 2008 ), and to other inks ( e.g. to the deep groundwater system; Carr and Head, 2015 )\n5\nc a d s t\nw W t ( c E r t c t m u\na i a t i o 1\nthrough time. To account for this, we assess a range of water inventory size scenarios. We test a surface water inventory equal to the current ( ∼34 m GEL), and a water inventory 10X greater. Spread evenly across Mars above the predicted +1 km “icy highlands” equilibrium line altitude ( Wordsworth et al., 2013 ), these surface water inventories produce average ice sheet thicknesses of 300 m and 1000 m, respectively ( Fastook and Head, 2015 ).\nIn order to model the cryosphere we adopt the Clifford (1993) crustal porosity ( ϕ) structure which decays exponentially with depth ( z ) expressed as:\nϕ ( z ) = ϕ o ∗exp ( −z/D ) (6) where ϕ o is the surface porosity, and D is a scaling factor for the decay of porosity with depth (estimated to be ∼2.82 km for Mars; Clifford, 1993; Clifford et al., 2010 ). Suggested martian surface porosities range generally from ∼0.15 to 0.35 ( Clifford, 1993; Hanna and Phillips, 2005; Clifford et al., 2010 ), with some estimates as high as 0.5 ( Clifford, 1993 ). Here we adopt a relatively conservative surface porosity value of 0.2. While water–ice is stable within the frozen martian crust that comprises the cryosphere between the martian surface and the depth of the ice-melting isotherm, ice does not necessarily exist within the pore space of the subsurface. However, it is possible for ice to have accumulated within the pore-space of the Late Noachian cryosphere through diffusive transport of water from a deeper groundwater system ( e.g. Clifford, 1991 ), or for ice to have formed in situ by freezing of a saturated groundwater aquifer from an earlier “warm and wet” period ( e.g. Craddock and Howard, 2002 ). In each model scenario tested, we assume the presence of an ice-cemented cryosphere (with ice completely occupying the available pore space), because it is likely for water to have been present at depth in the early Mars crust which would have contributed to, or been consumed in the establishment of a cryosphere by these processes. Under the variable temperature, geothermal heat flux, and initial ice sheet thickness conditions we explore, the ice-melting isotherm will lie between 0 to 2.5 km below the ice sheet base prior to lava heating and loading.\n5.3. Lava thicknesses and accumulation timescales\nWe adopt an individual lava flow thickness of 10 m, which is an average lava flow thickness observed in the Columbia River Flood basalt province ( Self et al., 1997 ). We assess the range of total accumulated lava thicknesses (500 and 20 0 0 m) and lava accumulation timescales (10 kyr and 100 Myr) determined to be representative of the Hesperia Planum volcanic plains in Section 2 . To simulate lava accumulation, each emplacement timescale is divided into a number of time intervals equal to the total lava accumulation thickness (50 0–20 0 0 m) divided by the incremental lava flow thickness (10 m) , with a lava increment added at each time interval.\n5.4. Lava heating and loading: top-down melting\nWe account for ice sheet top-down melting induced by supraglacial lava flow emplacement and cooling by implementing the parameterization derived in Section 4 ( Eq. (5 )) and setting the value of M R to 3, corresponding to the 10 m thick lava flow case. Throughout the model simulation we assume that the top-down melting due to lava flow emplacement occurs instantaneously. This assumption is made because in the early stages of lava heating and loading the top-down melting induced by incremental lava flow emplacement occurs over a time-scale that is approximately equal to the time step of the model. As subsequent flows accumulate, the induced melting begins to take place over a time greater than the model time-step, however at this point the melting is negligible, and the assumption of instantaneous melting is maintained.\n.5. Thermal model\nWe assess the thermal evolution of the ice sheet, and subjacent ryosphere, in response to insulation from supraglacial lava heating nd loading through the implementation of a fully explicit finite ifference numerical scheme ( e.g. Hu and Argyropoulos, 1996 ) to olve the one-dimensional heat conduction equation, expressed in erms of enthalpy as:\n∂H ∂t = ∂ ∂z\n( k ( z ) ∂T\n∂z\n) (7)\nhere H is enthalpy (in J/m 3 ), k is thermal conductivity (in /m K), T is temperature (in K), and z is distance (in m). This equaion is a reformulation of the standard heat conduction equation e.g. Hu and Argyropoulos, 1996 ) which allows for modeling phase hange problems by taking into account the latent heat of fusion. ach component of the system (lava, ice sheet, and cryosphere) is epresented as a length within the one-dimensional model domain, he size of which corresponds to the thickness of the associated omponent. The lengths of the individual components are allowed o evolve with time in response to lava heating and loading and ice\nelting. A conceptual representation of the thermal model config-\nration is shown in Fig. 8.\nIn each model run, the temperature at the upper model boundry ( z = 0) is held constant, while a constant geothermal heat flux s applied at the lower model boundary ( z = L ), the values of which re varied according to the model run scenario ( Fig. 8 ). The enhalpy is then calculated at each depth in the model domain usng Eq. (7) and this is used to derive the local melt fraction based\nn a sharp melting front assumption ( e.g. Alexiades and Solomon, 992 ). The temperature at each point is then calculated from the\na t a i i i t t s t c\n5\nt c (\nK\nw p n\nK\nw l m n a 1 3 o\nh t p\nK\nC\nρ\nw c\n5\nt a w N e s\nw\nt d e\n6\nt a w\no d W S W i v r c l t i a h n l t l l t l i w l p r F\nm c n s n r f c\ns i t t i H t i i\nd fl t i a I t m a l l “\nssociated enthalpy based on the phase state of the material as deermined by the melt fraction (since the phase state of the material t any point in the model can change with time as a result of meltng. e.g. consider a particular depth point in the model correspondng to the ice sheet, if the local melt fraction is zero, then no meltng has yet occurred and the material is considered pure ice, and he enthalpy is converted to temperature accordingly). Throughout he modeling we maintain a spatial step size of 10 m (the largest patial step that can be chosen while resolving the required feaures), and a time step of 0.5 yr (the largest time step that can be hosen while maintaining numerical stability).\n.6. Thermal properties\nOver the range of temperatures involved in this analysis, the hermal conductivity of ice can vary appreciably. Therefore, we acount for the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of ice in W/m K) by the following ( Alexiades and Solomon, 1992 ):\nT, ice ( T ) = 2 . 24 + 5 . 97510 −3 ( 273 − T ) 1 . 156 (8) here T is temperature (in K). In addition, we account for the temerature dependent thermal conductivity of the basaltic compoent of the porous substrate ( Clifford et al., 2010 ) as: T,sub ( T ) = 4 88 . 19 /T + 0 . 46 85 (9) here T is temperature (in K). For the lava flow material accumu-\nating at the top of the ice sheet, we adopt an average of ther-\nal conductivities measured from Hawaiian basalt flows and lu-\nar basalt samples ( ∼1.5 W/m K; Fujii and Osako, 1973; Robertson nd Peck, 1974; Horai and Winkler, 1980; Warren and Rasmussen, 987 ). We adopt typical density values of 917 kg/m 3 for ice and 0 0 0 kg/m 3 for rock/lava, as well as specific heat capacity values f 20 0 0 J/kg K for ice and 850 J/kg K for rock/lava.\nIn the porous cryosphere, the thermal conductivity, specific eat capacity, and density are averaged by volume fraction beween the pore ice and basalt substrate in accordance with the orosity ( ϕ) such that: T,cry ( z ) = ϕ ( z ) ∗K T,ice + ( 1 − ϕ ( z ) ) ∗K T,rock (10) P,cry ( z ) = ϕ ( z ) ∗C P,ice + ( 1 − ϕ ( z ) ) ∗C P,rock (11) cry ( z ) = ϕ ( z ) ∗ρice + ( 1 − ϕ ( z ) ) ∗ρrock (12) here the subscript cry denotes parameters associated with the ryosphere, and all other parameters are as previously defined.\n.7. Initial conditions\nBefore any lava accumulation occurs, the temperature profile hrough the ice sheet and the substrate will be in a steady-state nd nearly linear since the relatively thin ice sheets (30 0–10 0 0 m)\nill not flow rapidly ( ∼12 to 431 mm/yr) under the cold Late oachian conditions ( Fastook and Head, 2015 ) of interest. The linar temperature versus depth gradient can be calculated using the teady-state solution of the one-dimensional heat equation:\ndT dz = G ∫ z\n0 K T (13 )\nhere\nz = depth (m), G = geothermal heat flux (W/m 2 ), z ∫ 0\nK T = integral of the thermal conductivity from the top of the ice sheet to depth z (W/m K).\nThe temperature profile generated with this steady-state relaion (subject to the same boundary conditions, and thermal conuctivity parameterizations) is used to set the initial conditions for ach model run.\n. Results\nTo explore the parameter space outlined in the previous subsecions we perform a total of 32 individual thermal model runs. The rray of model runs performed is shown schematically in Fig. 9 ,\nith corresponding model run results compiled in Table 2.\nIn order to assess our findings, we define nominal cases from ur range of modeled scenarios. We first take nominally preicted values for the mean annual surface temperature (210 K;\nordsworth et al., 2013 ), and geothermal heat flux (55 mW/m 2 ; olomon et al., 2005; Clifford et al., 2010; Fastook et al., 2012 ).\nith respect to the remaining parameters, two nominal scenaros are anticipated due to the predicted dichotomy in Hesperian olcanic plains emplacement conditions. In the Hesperia Planum egion, the topographically low craters would have acted as conentrating points for both ice ( Fastook and Head, 2014, 2015 ) and ava ( Whitten and Head, 2013 ). As a result, within a crater interior, he lava heating and loading process is predicted to be characterzed by greater ice and lava thicknesses as well as more rapid lava ccumulation rates. Therefore, in the nominal crater interior lava\neating and loading scenario we assume an initial ice sheet thickess of 1 km, a total accumulated lava thickness of 2 km, and a\nava accumulation timescale of 10 kyr. The final parameter required o define the nominal scenario is the thickness of the individual ava flows being accumulated, for which two possibilities exist. The ava flows accumulating in the crater may be relatively thin ( ∼10 m hick) or thick ( ∼100 m thick). The case in which the accumulating ava flows are relatively thick is described in Section 4 in assessng the successive emplacement of very thick lava flows. Therefore,\ne now examine the case in which the individual accumulating ava flows are relatively thin (10 m thick). The thermal model out-\nut results for this defined nominal crater interior scenario (repesented by model run 11; Fig. 9 ) are displayed graphically in ig. 10.\nConversely, in the intercrater plains, ice thicknesses and accuulated lava thicknesses are predicted to be smaller, with lava acumulation taking place over a longer timescale. Therefore, in the ominal intercrater plain lava heating and loading scenario, we asume an initial ice thickness of 300 m, an accumulated lava thickess of 500 m, and a lava accumulation timescale of 100 Myr (repesented by model run 5; Fig. 9 ). The thermal model output results or the nominal intercrater plains scenario are displayed graphially in Fig. 11.\nIn the nominal model run scenarios, as well as in all modeled cenarios, we find that as lava accumulates, the initial reduction n ice sheet thickness due to top-down melting defers the initiaion of cryosphere bottom-up melting ( e.g. Fig. 10 ) (melting delay imes are equivalent to the cryosphere melt initiation times listed n Table 2 ) by causing an initial decrease in the total insulation.\nowever, as top-down melting of the ice sheet becomes negligible,\nhe insulating effect of the accumulating lava flows becomes domnant, and the ice-melting isotherm begins to ascend towards the ce sheet base.\nIn the nominal crater interior scenario, we find that the aditional insulation provided by the 2 km thick supraglacial lava ow sequence is sufficient to raise the ice-melting isotherm to he base of the superposed lava flows. As a result, the underlyng ice sheet and cryosphere are rendered thermally unstable, and re subjected to melting as the ice-melting isotherm rises ( Fig. 10 ). n this case, the lava sequence is accumulated more rapidly than he ice-melting isotherm can rise, and thus the rate of bottom-up\nelting is limited by the geothermal heat flux input. Rapid lava ccumulation and geothermally -limited bottom-up melting can alow ice sheet basal melting to continue, and even begin, after ava accumulation has completed, we refer to this phenomenon as deferred melting” ( Fig. 10 ). At the geothermally -limited melting\nt s p fl h n l ( l l i g\nf d f t ∼ ( d i p j l c ( b v r i\nrates, melting of the initially ∼1.9 km cryosphere takes place over a timescale of ∼470 kyr, while melting of the ∼830 m ice sheet (the amount that remains after top-down melting has completed) takes place over ∼750 kyr. In the nominal intercrater plains scenario, we find that the insulation provided by the 500 m thick supraglacial lava flow sequence is insufficient to raise the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the ice sheet, thus no ice sheet basal melting takes place. The additional insulation is only sufficient to raise the ice-melting isotherm from an initial depth of 2.5 km, to a depth of 1.8 km resulting in cryospheric melting over the same depth range ( Fig. 11 ). In this case, melting takes place over a timescale of ∼82 Myr because the rate at which the ice-melting isotherm can rise is limited by the rate at which insulation is provided from lava accumulation (which now occurs over a 100 Myr timescale). This is because after each increment of lava is emplaced, the resultant elevation of the ice-melting isotherm and associated ice melting occurs before the next increment of lava is added. As a result, bottom-up melting occurs in steps ( Fig. 11 ), with short periods of more rapid geothermally-limited melting just after an increment of lava is added, followed by a period of no melting until more insulation is provided by the emplacement of the next lava flow. As a result of this limitation, over the course of lava accumulation (100 Myr), the long-term averaged bottom-up melting rate of the cryosphere is equal to the lava accumulation rate.\nThe effects of variable surface temperatures, geothermal heat flux, and lava heating and loading conditions are explored in the remaining model run scenarios ( Fig. 9; Table 2 ). In general, we find that at the predicted intercrater plain ice sheet thickness of 300 m, basal melting is only possible with the addition of the 2 km\nhick lava flow sequence, except in cases with both a very high urface temperature (240 K, predicted to occur at an atmospheric ressure of 1 bar; Wordsworth et al., 2013 ) and geothermal heat ux (100 mW/m 2 , reflective of a regionally enhanced geothermal eat flux; Cassanelli et al., 2015 ). Conversely, at an ice sheet thickess of 10 0 0 m, basal melting is predicted in all lava heating and oading scenarios except those with a lower surface temperature 210 K), lower geothermal heat flux (55 mW/m 2 ), and thin 500 m ayer of superposed lava ( Table 2 ). This is in contrast to the iceoading alone case ( Cassanelli et al., 2015 ) in which no basal meltng is predicted to occur, even with plausible regionally elevated eothermal heat fluxes.\nWe find that geothermally-limited rates of bottom-up meltingront advance in the cryosphere and ice sheet are on the orer of ∼5 mm/yr and ∼2 mm/yr, respectively. When accounting or porosity and density effects, these melting front advance rates ranslate into long-term bottom-up meltwater production rates of\n0.5 mm/yr in the cryosphere and ∼1.8 mm/yr in the ice sheet typical basal melting rates for terrestrial glaciers are on the orer of several millimeters per year, though melting can be signifcantly enhanced in volcanically active regions, and has been reorted to be as high as ∼5 m/yr in some portions of the Vatnaökull ice cap in Iceland; Cuffey and Paterson, 2010 ). Long-term ava accumulation-limited rates of melting front advance in the ryosphere and ice sheet are both on the order of ∼0.02 mm/yr since both are limited by the rate at which insulation is provided\ny lava accumulation). These long-term averaged melting front adance rates translate to long-term averaged meltwater production ates of ∼0.002 mm/yr in the cryosphere, and ∼0.018 mm/yr in the ce sheet.\ni r r i t b g\n6\nw t l i o w o t a t c t t t f G\nc o c t d c e i o\n2 w m m t g t b p t I ∼ n m m s m i\nThe maximum bottom-up melting front advance rates predicted n this study are ∼15 mm/yr in the cryosphere (achieved in model un 20; Fig. 9 ) and ∼6 mm/yr in the ice sheet (achieved in model un 28; Fig. 9 ). These rates are achieved in scenarios where a large ncrease in ice sheet insulation is provided by rapid accumulaion (10 kyr) of 2 km of lava atop the ice sheet, with subsequent\nottom-up melting proceeding at a rate governed by the highest eothermal heat flux evaluated in this study (100 mW/m 2 ).\n.1. Bottom-up induced melting: cryosphere contribution\nIn the nominal crater interior lava heating and loading scenario e explore ( Fig. 10 ), the cryosphere underlying the ice sheet iniially extended to a depth of ∼1.9 km. After the insulating lavas are oaded atop the surficial ice sheet, the equilibrium thermal state is nterrupted, and the ice-melting isotherm which defines the extent\nf the cryosphere, advances towards the surface. If the cryosphere\nere ice-cemented this would result in melting and the liberation\nf meltwater to the underlying substrate. In this scenario, the enire 1.9 km thick cryosphere is completely removed due to the large mount of insulation provided. Under the assumed porosity strucure ( Section 5.2 ), and assuming the cryosphere was initially iceemented, melting of the 1.9 km thick cryosphere would result in he release of ∼250 m column of meltwater per unit area. Within he Hesperia Planum region, the largest observable craters are on he order of ∼80 km in diameter ( Tanaka et al., 2014b ), melting rom this process, in a crater of this scale, would release ∼0.03 m EL of water to the subsurface in each crater of this size.\nIn the nominal intercrater plains scenario ( Fig. 11 ), the ryosphere underlying the ice sheet initially extended to a depth f ∼2.5 km due to the reduced insulation from the thinner surfiial ice sheet. Following the lava heating and loading predicted in his scenario, the cryosphere is thinned to a depth of ∼1.8 km. Uner the assumed porosity structure ( Section 5.2 ), and assuming the ryosphere was initially ice-cemented, this would result in the libration of ∼60 m column of meltwater per unit area. If this meltng occurred over the entire Hesperia Planum region, a ∼1 m GEL f water would be released to the subsurface.\nUnder the full range of conditions explored here ( Fig. 9; Table ), prior to any ice sheet lava heating and loading, the cryosphere\nill extend from ∼0 to 2.5 km below the surface. We find that odel runs 3 and 7 produced the greatest extent of cryosphere elting ( Table 2 ). In these scenarios, the cryosphere was iniially 2.5 km thick (due to the low mean surface temperature, low eothermal heat flux, and thin ice sheet). Subsequent accumulaion of a thick sequence of lava flows (2 km), resulted in complete ottom-up melting of the cryosphere. Given the assumed crustal orosity structure, if the cryosphere were initially ice-saturated his would release a ∼331 m column of meltwater per unit area. f this melting occurred over the entire Hesperia Planum region, a\n4.5 m GEL of water would be released to the substrate. In the scearios with a high mean annual surface temperature, high geother-\nal heat flux, and thick ice sheets ( e.g. model run 26), the iceelting isotherm is predicted to lie at the base of the ice sheet uch that no cryosphere is predicted to exist. Therefore, in these\nodel runs, no meltwater is generated through cryospheric melt-\nng.\n6\nt u p s t n l l ( d b d o l t t a m I t o i r o G\nb i\nGiven that cryospheric ice melting would occur at depth within the martian subsurface, any meltwater produced by bottom-up melting of an ice-cemented cryosphere would drain further into the subsurface (if the underlying material is permeable) ( Fig. 12 ). Thus, the fate of this meltwater will be dependent upon the presence, or absence, of a more extensive groundwater system deeper within the martian crust. If a groundwater system does exist at depth, then it must be at diffusive equilibrium with the ice-cemented cryosphere above, such that the cryosphere is ice-cemented to the depth of the ice-melting isotherm ( e.g. Clifford, 1991; Mellon et al., 1997 ). If this was not the case, then any groundwater present would have undergone vapor diffusion ( Clifford, 1991 ) and have become sequestered within the ice-cemented cryosphere (thereby thickening the ice-cemented cryosphere and bringing the ice saturation line closer to the depth of the ice-melting isotherm). Therefore, if a groundwater system is present at greater depth, then the meltwater from melting of the ice-cemented cryosphere will simply provide groundwater recharge for that system and enter storage within the aquifers. Alternatively, if an extensive groundwater system does not exist, then this water would move down until the subsurface became impermeable at which point it would begin to migrate laterally, initiating aquifer formation. Once enough water infiltrates, the aquifer will spread beyond the bounds of the surficial lava flows where the cryosphere will again be stable to great depth. Here, the cryosphere may not be ice-cemented to the depth of the ice-melting isotherm, in which case water from the newly formed aquifer system would undergo diffusive loss until either the groundwater is depleted or the ice cementation line reaches the ice-melting isotherm depth, establishing vapor diffusive equilibrium ( Clifford, 1991 ).\n.2. Bottom-up melting: ice sheet meltwater transport and fate\nIn the two nominal scenarios we explore (crater interior and inercrater plains lava heating and loading; Figs. 10 and 11 ), bottomp ice sheet melting as a result of lava heating and loading is redicted to occur predominantly within crater interiors (since ice heet and lava thicknesses we adopt in the intercrater plains are oo low to provide sufficient insulation for basalt melting). In the ominal crater interior scenario, the thick (2 km) accumulation of ava causes the ice-melting isotherm to ascend to the base of the ava flows, leading to complete melting of the underlying ice sheet of the 1 km thick ice sheet 170 m is removed through initial top-\nown melting, with the remaining 830 m melt through bottom-up asal melting). As a result, a ∼760 m column of melt water is prouced per unit area of melting which would produce a ∼0.1 m GEL f water within an 80 km diameter crater. While lava heating and\noading induced basal melting is not predicted in the nominal inercrater plains scenario, it is possible for basal melting to have aken place if a greater thickness of lava (2 km) were accumulated top the ice sheets, or if the surface temperature and geother-\nal heat flux were considerably higher (240 K, and 100 mW/m 2 ). f basal melting in the intercrater plains occurred as a result of hese conditions, top-down melting would remove ∼130 to 170 m f the ice sheets, leaving also 130–170 m to undergo basal meltng. Complete basal melting of these ice sheet thicknesses would elease ∼120 to 155 m column of meltwater per unit area which ver the area of Hesperia Planum would release a ∼1.6 to 2.1 m EL of meltwater.\nBroadly, there are two possible fates for meltwater released y ice sheet basal melting: (1) meltwater may infiltrate down\nnto the porous substrate ( Fig. 12 ), or (2) meltwater may become\n(a.)

Since basal melting nitiated by the lava heating and loading process occurs through ottom-up heating, the cryosphere is predicted to complete meltng before ice sheet basal melting can occur since the ice-melting sotherm cannot rise beyond the melting front. Therefore, the meltater produced by ice sheet melting will not encounter an impereable ice-cemented cryosphere, although it is possible for other mpermeable layers to exist beneath the ice sheet ( e.g. a clay layer r competent bedrock; Fig. 12 ). The rate at which the meltwater generated at the base of the ce sheet can infiltrate into the subsurface is governed by the inltration capacity of the substrate material. To estimate the infilration rate, we apply the adaptation of Darcy’s law for saturated roundwater flow described by Eq. (2) in Section 3.4 subject to he same assumptions. These assumptions again reduce Eq. (2) to ive the saturated hydraulic conductivity as the infiltration rate. As oted before, the saturated hydraulic conductivity will be an overstimate if the substrate beneath the ice sheet is in a desiccated tate. However, in this case, melting of an ice-cemented cryosphere rior to ice sheet basal melting would result in conditions closer o the saturation point, thus the hydraulic conductivity may be loser to, or even at the saturated value. To estimate the hydraulic onductivity of the martian substrate we adopt the Clifford and arker (2001) permeability structure and apply the relationship or intrinsic permeability and hydraulic conductivity detailed in ection 3.4 . From this process, we find hydraulic conductivity vales of ∼75 mm/hr at the surface, decreasing to ∼0.007 mm/hr at\nfl t c t t p 3 i t s i a e\nb s d p l n t s s l f f w p a m u t o w l s b\nc d t ( 2 a t d w\nr p b l ( n t w t q g r\n6\nt b\n2 km depth after which point the hydraulic conductivity remains nearly constant to the self-compaction depth at ∼10 km ( Hanna and Phillips, 2005 ). As the substrate saturates, the infiltration will become limited by the hydraulic conductivities of the material at greater depth, such that the conductivity at the surface is not representative of the actual infiltration rate. For comparison the infiltration rates of terrestrial volcanic terrains with a similar permeability structure has been measured at ∼ 0.1 mm/hr ( Hurwitz et al., 2003 ). However, since the infiltration rate is proportional to gravity, this infiltration rate should be closer to 0.1 mm/hr ∗( g Mars / g Earth ) or ∼ 0.03 mm/hr on Mars.\nThese infiltration rates are more than sufficient to accommodate the maximum ice sheet basal melting rates predicted in the most extreme melting scenario modeled (model run 28), which are ∼7 ×10 −4 mm/hr. Only if infiltration becomes limited to the lowest permeability ( ∼10 −15 m 2 ) material at great depth in the martian mega-regolith (which is not predicted to occur since the exceedingly low melting rates will not be able to saturate the substrate to these depths) will the saturated hydraulic conductivity ( ∼7 ×10 −6 mm/hr) be below the highest predicted melting rates ( ∼7 ×10 −4 mm/hr). Therefore, we predict that the meltwater produced by ice sheet basal melting during the lava heating and loading process will percolate into the martian substrate providing groundwater recharge ( Fig. 12 ).\nMeltwater will continue to percolate downwards until it joins a deeper groundwater system or encounters an impermeable layer at which point it will begin to establish an aquifer. If the available pore space in the substrate does not extend laterally beyond the bounds of the melting zone, it is possible for the meltwater to exceed the storage capacity of the substrate. Given our assumed porosity structure, we estimate that a ∼10 km column (to the self-compaction depth; Hanna and Phillips, 2005 ) of substrate material can accommodate meltwater produced from a ∼600 m column of ice. Therefore, unless the meltwater is able join an aquifer system whose bounds extend laterally beyond the zone of melting, the storage capacity of the aquifer would be exceeded prior to complete ice sheet melting in the nominal crater interior scenario. As a result, additional meltwater would then pool at the base of the melting ice sheet. This will be compounded if the cryosphere were ice-cemented to the depth of the ice-melting isotherm ( ∼1.9 km), which would reduce the storage capacity to accommodate a ∼320 m column of ice. If the groundwater at depth beneath the global cryosphere is able to flow out past the ice sheet margins then additional melt can be accommodated by the aquifer. Even if the meltwater is able to flow out to a more extensive groundwater system beyond the zone of melting, it must do so at depth beneath the cryosphere where the permeability is relatively low ( ∼10 −14 to 10 −16 m 2 ). At these permeabilities the hydraulic conductivity can be as low as 0.0065 m/yr which is still sufficient to accommodate the basal melting rates predicted in the nominal crater interior scenario ( ∼9 ×10 −4 m/yr), as well as the maximum melting rates predicted in the most extreme bottom-up melting scenario assessed ( ∼0.006 m/yr). Therefore, the pooling of meltwater beneath the lava-loaded “icy highlands” is not predicted given the nominal subsurface permeability structure.\nWhile the ice sheet basal melting rates are not predicted to exceed the infiltration capacities associated with the nominal permeability structure, the presence of low permeability, or impermeable layer within the substrate could impede meltwater infiltration ( Fig. 12 ). If this is the case, meltwater will pool beneath the ice sheet and will not be able to escape because the margins of the ice sheet will remain frozen to the base. Water that pools beneath the ice sheet will be under a large confining pressure due to the overburden stress of the ice and lava flows above. If a sufficient pressure is built up the ice sheet may fracture at the margins where the ice is thin, resulting in a flooding event ( Fig. 12 ). A\nood event produced in this way would release a substantial quanity of water at very significant pressures. Considering the nominal rater interior lava heating and loading scenario, a 10 m meltwaer lens within an 80 km crater would contain ∼200 km 3 of waer, and beneath 2 km of lava and ∼820 m of ice, would be under ressures of ∼25 MPa (which is on the order of the tensile, ∼0.7 to .1 MPa, and compressive, ∼5 to 25 MPa, strength of ice under simlar temperature regimes; Petrovic, 2003 ). A flood event produced hrough this mechanism would form outflow channels near the ice heet margin ( Fig. 12 ) and would leave a large void space at the ce sheet base which could cause collapse of the superposed ice nd lavas leading to the formation of collapse features ( e.g. Zegers t al., 2010 ).\nRegardless of whether the meltwater produced from ice sheet asal melting is evacuated by episodic flooding, or by gradual suburface infiltration, the superposed lava flows will undergo subsience as a result ( Fig. 12 ). However, the subsidence of the superosed lava flows will be affected by the timescale of lava accumuation and melting. For example, in the nominal crater interior sce-\nario, the entire lava sequence is predicted to accumulate prior to he initiation of bottom-up ice sheet melting. As a result, the entire equence of flows will undergo subsidence of ∼830 m, as the ice heet remaining after top-down melting is removed. Conversely, if avas are added slowly, bottom-up melting will occur in increments ollowing the addition of each lava increment, and completing beore the addition of the next lava increment. Therefore, subsidence\nill occur in the same incremental nature, such that different\nortions of the total lava sequence will be processed by different mounts of subsidence. The incremental nature of subsidence\neans that flows emplaced early in the lava loading process will\nndergo more total subsidence than flows emplaced at the end of he process, when little ice is left to melt. Therefore, if lava loading ccurred slowly, the remaining lava flows observed at the surface\nill not have been highly processed by subsidence. However, if ava loading occurred rapidly and completed before bottom-up ice heet melting could take place, then the surficial lava flows would\ne highly processed as a result of large subsidence.\nSubsurface mass loss from the buried ice sheet, and the assoiated subsidence of the superposed lava flows could lead to the evelopment of a range of associated subsidence and collapse feaures expressed at the surface of the superposed lava sequence Fig. 12 ). These features include chaos terrain ( e.g. Zegers et al., 010 ), fracture systems, pit crater chains ( e.g. Wyrick et al., 2004 ), nd linear and irregularly shaped folding, buckling, and faulting of he lava flow surfaces ( e.g. wrinkle ridges, arches, normal faults, eformation rings). Potential examples of these features, found\nithin the Hesperia Planum region, are documented in Fig. 13.\nAfter bottom-up melting has completed, the cryosphere will be eestablished through vapor diffusion. In the nominal cases exlored, the reestablished cryosphere will extend ∼1.7 to 2.3 km elow the surface. Since the fractured lava flows from the lava oading process now occupy the upper 50 0–20 0 0 m of the surface Figs. 7 and 12 ), an equivalent thickness of the cryosphere will\now be reestablished within this material which will have effecively formed a fractured rock aquifer. This fractured rock material\nill replace the mega-regolith material which initially contained he cryosphere causing a net decrease in the amount of water reuired to re-establish the cryosphere since fractured rock aquifers enerally contain less available pore space than comparable megaegolith aquifers ( Hanna and Phillips, 2005 ).\n.3.

Characteristic processes predicted to occur, and geological features predicted to form, as a result of the ice sheet lava heating and loading process as a function of individual lava flow thickness (thick lava flows ∼100 m or greater, and thin lava flows ∼10 m or less), total accumulated lava flow thickness (low total accumulated lava thickness of ∼0.5 km, and a large total accumulated lava thickness of ∼2 km), and lava accumulation timescale (gradual lava accumulation over ∼100 Myr, and rapid lava accumulation over ∼10 kyr). Potential examples of each of the predicted geological features within the Hesperia Planum region are documented in Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) global daytime infrared imagery ( Christensen et al., 2004 ) and shaded Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data ( Smith et al., 2001 ). Features include: (1) wrinkle ridges, (2) fracture systems, (3) pit crater chains, (4) broad depressions, and (5) chaos terrain, and fluvial channels. While the geological features contained in panel 5 are noted in the predictions of the lava heating and loading scenarios with thin individual lava flows ( ∼10 m or less) and a high total accumulated lava thickness ( ∼2 km), fluvial channels are only predicted to form if the substrate underlying the buried ice sheet is impermeable. In this case meltwater can pool below the ice sheet and rupture confining materials near the glacial margins causing flooding events and channel formation. Otherwise, if the underlying material is permeable, the meltwater produced in these two scenarios is generated to slowly to exceed the infiltration capacity of the Mars crustal materials and is predicted to infiltrate into the subsurface to provide groundwater recharge.\nl s w i t p w t t b r t t m i p t t t w m p b g a t d\ne c\n6\nt t i T p c c t t p r n m\nw s d a ( l\nava can reduce the melting point of the ice at the base of the ice heet to as low as ∼271 K (at a pressure of ∼25 MPa in the case here 2 km of lava are superposed upon 1 km of ice). Limitations n the numerical model prevent direct consideration of this effect; herefore we briefly discuss the implications of pressure melting\noint reduction. While the overburden pressure produced by the eight of the lava sequence and ice sheet reduces the melting emperature at the base of the ice sheet, this effect is not predicted o propagate to the ice contained in the pores of the substrate, ecause the substrate matrix supports the overburden load. As a esult, a discontinuity in melting temperatures will exist at the inerface between the ice sheet and the substrate, with the ice at he base of the ice sheet requiring a lower temperature to initiate\nelting. This allows the ice sheet to begin bottom-up basal meltng, before melting of the underlying cryospheric pore ice has com-\nleted. As a result the substrate would remain impermeable during he initial stages of bottom-up ice sheet melting, causing meltwaer produced from ice sheet basal melting to pool at the base of he ice sheet, forming a melt lens. Given the geothermal gradients\ne test here (55 mW/m 2 and 100 mW/m 2 ), this effect can allow a elt lens ranging from ∼45 to 80 m thick to form prior to comlete cryosphere removal. The development of a melt lens at the ase of the ice sheet would result in the initiation of wet-based laciation, leading to enhanced ice sheet flow and basal erosion. In ddition, flooding events could be triggered by the release of waer contained in the melt lens, potentially resulting in large-scale eformation and collapse of the superposed lavas due to the rapid\nc\nxcavation of underlying material and the creation of a subsurface avity.\n.4. Effect of ice impurities\nIn the analyses performed here, we make the assumption that he ice involved is free of impurities. In reality it is probable hat the pore ice in the cryosphere, and the ice comprising the ce sheets, would have contained some component of impurities.\nhese are likely to include volcanic ash, dust, and potent freezing oint depressing salts (such as perchlorates, sodium chloride, and alcium chloride; Clifford et al., 2010 ). The precise composition and oncentrations of impurities within the ice are unclear and due to his uncertainty, we do not directly account for impurities within he numerical model applied here. While the incorporation of imurities within the ice is not predicted to significantly alter the esults of the lava heating and loading process, there will be mior effects with respect to the associated top-down and bottom-up\nelting processes which we now discuss.\nTop-down melting: Incorporation of impurities into the ice sheet ill have two main effects on top-down melting associated with upraglacial lava flow emplacement. The impurities will (1) reuce the melting temperature of ice, allowing for more melting, nd (2) will diminish the thickness of the ice sheet firn layer Cassanelli and Head, 2015 ). As a result, firn absorption may no onger be a major pathway available for meltwater produced from onductive heating during supraglacial lava flow emplacement and\ni ( i s s s o m a t b T w S\nv a t c t i d i\n6\nN\ncooling. Instead meltwater will primarily be collected/transported by: (1) Drainage down through the ice sheet ( e.g. through fractures). (2) Runoff across the ice sheet surface, following ice sheet topography. This will result in channelization across the ice sheet surface, and possibly in the formation of fluvial channels at the ice sheet margin when the melt drains off the ice sheet. (3) Pool around the emplaced lava flow, enhancing cooling rates and the likelihood of pseudo-crater formation. Regardless of these effects, top-down melting will still become rapidly diminished as lava accumulation continues, and the end result of the process will still be the construction of a thermal blanket atop the ice sheet.\nBottom-up melting: The inclusion of impurities into cryospheric ice and into the ice sheet will serve to enhance the effect of bottom-up melting induced by the lava heating and loading process by depressing the melting point of the ice. This reduction in the melting temperature will allow for melting to initiate at a lower thickness of insulating lava flows, and will enhance the rate of melting front advance. If impurity concentrations are higher within the ice sheet than in the cryospheric ice, it may also add to the pressure melting point reduction effect, enhancing the ability of the ice sheet to undergo basal melting prior to complete cryospheric melting. This would lengthen the window of time during which an entirely impermeable ice-cemented substrate would exist beneath the melting ice sheet, causing more pooling of meltwater at the ice sheet base.\n6.5. Effect of coeval ice and lava accumulation\nThroughout this assessment it has been assumed that ice sheet formation was completed prior to lava flow emplacement. However, ice and lava may have instead accumulated synchronously, resulting in interspersed deposits of ice and lava. This may even have occurred as a direct consequence of the ice sheet lava heating and loading process. If melt liberated from the highlands ice sheets was transported to the lowlands it could have been recycled back to the highlands by evaporation and re-deposition as described in the “icy highlands” climate scenario prior to the cessation of lava emplacement. Interspersed deposition of ice and lava resulting from coeval accumulation would influence the heat delivery and melting mechanisms explored in the ice sheet lava heating and loading model and would be dependent upon the balance between the rate of ice and lava accumulation. Given that ice deposition is predicted to occur at an average rate of ∼10 mm/yr under “icy highlands” climate conditions ( Forget et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2013; Fastook and Head, 2015 ), the influence of coeval accumulation would be governed by the rate of lava accumulation.\nIn general, three cases are possible. (1) Lava flows undergo rapid accumulation over a period of ∼10 kyr (as discussed in Section 2 ). In this scenario, the introduction of snow at a rate of ∼10 mm/yr would only allow ice deposits on the order of ∼1 m thick to accumulate in between lava flow emplacement events. As a result, the deposited snow and ice would not accumulate to a substantial thickness and would undergo melting and evaporation without having a significant effect on the cooling processes of the lava flows. Therefore, the processes and morphology predicted by the ice sheet lava heating and loading model would not occur, although phreatomagmatic interactions would be possible. (2) Lava flows undergo gradual accumulation over a period of ∼100 Myr (as discussed in Section 2 ). In this case, much larger periods of time would exist in between lava flow emplacement events, allowing snow and ice to accumulate to greater thicknesses. The average time in between lava flow emplacement events in the gradual accumulation scenario could be as much as ∼2 Myr (in the intercrater plains where 500 m of lava is accumulated from 10 m lava flows over 100 Myr). In this period of time, snow deposition at an average rate of 10 mm/yr would readily deplete even the max-\nmum plausible Late Noachian/Hesperian surface water reservoir ∼10 × the present, or ∼340 m GEL; Carr and Head, 2015 ) resultng in complete supply-limited ice sheet formation. Therefore, subequently emplaced lava flows would encounter a fully-formed ice heet as is treated in our analyses, resulting in the previously decribed ice sheet lava heating and loading processes and morphol-\ngy. (3) Accumulation rates of lava and snow/ice are comparable in\nagnitude. In this case each emplaced lava flow would encounter layer of snow or ice that is on the same order of thickness as he lava flow itself. Under these conditions each lava flow would e an initial lava flow, in accordance with our previous definition. herefore, the interaction of each sequentially emplaced lava flow\nith the snow and ice deposits would proceed as described in\nection 3 , resulting in the generation of the predicted morphology.\nWe find that the processes of heat delivery and melting inolved in a scenario of coeval accumulation of snow/ice and lava re effectively described by the processes and conditions we have reated. However, interspersed deposition of snow/ice and lava ould lead to an enhancement in aqueous/thermal mineralogic aleration of the basaltic lavas relative to the nominal case (in which ce sheet formation predates lava flow emplacement) due to more\nirect interaction between each freshly emplaced lava flow with\nce and water.\n.6. Lava heating and loading: synthesis and predictions\n• Due to the highly cratered nature of the topography onto which\nthe Hesperian Planum volcanic plains were emplaced, a dichotomy in lava emplacement conditions is predicted between crater interiors and intercrater plains.\nominal crater interior lava heating and loading • Crater interiors are predicted to act as concentrating locations\nfor both ice and lava. As a result the lava heating and loading process within crater interiors will be characterized by greater thicknesses of ice and lava, and by more rapid accumulation of\nlava. • The greater thickness of lava accumulated within crater in-\nteriors provides sufficient insulation to lift the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the lava flows superposed on the ice sheet. This results in complete thermal instability of the cryosphere and ice sheet, and eventual melting governed by the geothermal heat flux. This process can produce ∼0.1 m GEL of water within an 80 km crater. • Due to the rapid nature of lava accumulation within crater in-\nteriors, bottom-up ice sheet melting can continue, or even begin, after lava accumulation has completed, leading to “deferred\nmelting” occurring as much as 871 kyr later. • The maximum predicted bottom-up melting rates are far below\nthe infiltration rates calculated for the martian substrate, and\nthus meltwater is predicted to percolate into the subsurface. • Subsurface mass loss from bottom-up ice sheet melting will\ncause the superposed lava flows to undergo a great deal of subsidence on the order of several hundred meters. This is predicted to cause extensive fracturing of the superposed lavas and to give rise to a host of associated deformation and collapse features including chaos terrain, fracture systems, wrinkle\nridges, pit crater chains, and depressions. • If an impermeable layer of material ( e.g. clay or competent\nbedrock) underlies the area of bottom-up melting, meltwater may become sequestered at the ice sheet base. Melt sequestered at the ice sheet base could be confined by very large overburden pressures from the superposed lava sequence. This water could be released through ice sheet fracturing near the ice sheet margins resulting in large-volume episodic flooding events.\nN\n7\nl a P ( d F R e fi A n w i R i i c\no p a y t a j 1 m\n( h s t g a n\np t a m ∼ fl 1 t o a a c t ( i fl t\n• A flood event produced through this mechanism could form\noutflow channels which would emerge from the lava plains near the ice sheet margin. In addition this process could form a large void space at the ice sheet base which would cause collapse of the superposed ice and lavas leading to surface deformation and the formation of collapse features in the source re-\ngion of the meltwater. • Pressure melting point reduction, and the inclusion of impuri-\nties, could allow the ice sheet to undergo basal melting prior to complete melting of the underlying cryosphere. In this case the cryosphere would then act as an impermeable barrier, preventing the downward infiltration of melt from the ice sheet, having the same effect as other impermeable formations.\nominal intercrater plains lava heating and loading • Lava heating and loading in the intercrater plains is nominally\npredicted to be characterized by thinner accumulations of ice\nand lava, and by more gradual lava accumulation. • Due to the reduced thicknesses of ice and lava predicted, insuf-\nficient insulation is provided in the intercrater plains to raise the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the ice sheet . As a re-\nsult, only limited cryosphere melting is predicted. • Given that none or minimal ice sheet basal melting or subsur-\nface mass loss is predicted in the nominal intercrater plains, minimal subsidence or collapse -related features are predicted\nto form. • Basal melting in the intercrater plains is possible, even at the\nthin predicted ice sheet thicknesses, if greater thicknesses of lava were accumulated (2 km), or if the mean annual surface temperature and geothermal heat flux were considerably higher\n(240 K, and 100 mW/m 2 , respectively). • Subsurface mass loss from buried ice sheet basal melting in the\nintercrater plains will result in the formation of the same suite of subsidence and collapse features as predicted for the crater interior scenario.\n. Example case\nIn order to test a physical application of the lava heating and oading concept, we apply the lava heating and loading model to\nsmall study area located in the northern portion of the Hesperia\nlanum region centered approximately at 106.496 °E and 6.205 °S Fig. 14 ). Within this region lie two impact craters, ∼27 km in iameter (Crater A; Fig. 14 ), and ∼22 km in diameter (Crater B; ig. 14 ), which are flooded and mapped as part of the Hesperian idged plains unit ( Tanaka et al., 2014b ). The filling unit within ach impact structure shows evidence for post-depositional modication in the form of wrinkle ridges and fracture systems ( Fig. 14 ).\nbroad ( ∼3 km wide) channel emerges from the rim along the orthwestern portion of the northwestern crater (crater A; Fig. 14 )\nhich contains tear-drop shaped islands. Due to the range of evdence suggesting post-depositional modification of the Hesperian\nidged plains filling unit within the two impact craters contained\nn the study region, we assess this area in the framework of the ce sheet lava heating and loading model to determine if the model an explain the presence of the observed features.\nTo perform this assessment we first assume that the filling unit f each impact crater is comprised entirely of Hesperian Ridged lains volcanic material. Maximum accumulated lava thicknesses re then calculated by the same manner described in Section 2 , ielding maximum lava thicknesses of ∼1.5 to 1.75 km. We coninue by assuming that these impact crater structures would have cted to concentrate both ice and lava deposits based on the same ustifications provided in Section 6 . We therefore assume that a\nkm thick ice deposit existed in the crater before lava emplaceent, and that lava emplacement occurred over a rapid timescale\n10 kyr). With these assumptions, we now outline two possible lava eating and loading scenarios for the study area. (1) In the first cenario, lava accumulation is assumed to have occurred through he emplacement of a few very thick lava flows ( ∼100 m thick or reater) ( Fig. 7 ). (2) In the second scenario, lava accumulation is ssumed to have occurred through the emplacement of a greater umber of thinner lava flows ( ∼10 m) ( Fig. 12 ). In scenario (1), complete melting of the 1 km thick ice sheets is redicted to occur by top-down melting through conductive heat ransfer from the emplaced lava flows ( Fig. 3 ). If the lava fill were ccumulated from individual 100 m thick lava flows, then complete\nelting of the ice sheet would occur within the emplacement of 5 flows, while if the individual lava flows were 200 m thick, one ow is predicted to transfer enough heat to melt nearly the entire km thick ice sheet ( Fig. 3 ). In either case, complete melting of he ice sheet would occur over rapid time scales, on the order f several 100 to 10 4 yr. Due to the rapid nature of heat transfer nd melting in this scenario, there will not be sufficient time to llow for thinning and removal of the underlying ∼1.9 km thick ryosphere. As a result, the subsurface will remain impermeable hroughout the lava heating and loading and melting processes Fig. 7 ). Since the meltwater cannot percolate into the subsurface t is predicted to pool at the base and margins of the emplaced\now, which could overtop or rupture the confining ice leading\no large episodic meltwater flooding events at the volcanically\nd t\n( s ( e a t k a n t e s i t s o t f o i e t t\n8\na N\n8\nm d m g m i a i m W d a i p fl a t s s\ni d h a t i s i t\nflooded crater margins ( Fig. 7 ). Melting and removal of the buried ice sheet would result in subsidence of the superposed lava flows on the order of ∼1 km gradually over the course of the melting period (several 100 to 10 4 yr). However, more rapid subsidence events could result from episodic release of confined meltwater, potentially generating deformation in the source region of the water. Therefore in this scenario the generation of several characteristic features are predicted to result from the lava heating and loading process ( Figs. 7 and 13 ): (1) fractures and cracks within the superposed lavas due to subsidence, (2) collapse features including depressions, chaos terrain, or pit craters associated with subsurface mass loss, and (3) fluvial channels emerging from the lava flow margins associated with episodic meltwater release in flooding events.\nScenario (2) is effectively represented by the nominal crater interior lava heating and loading scenario outlined in Section 6 . In this case, top-down melting is limited due to the inefficient transfer of heat resulting from successive emplacement of the relatively thin 10 m thick lava flows. As a result, only ∼170 m of total top-down ice sheet melting occurs during the emplacement of the 2 km thick lava sequence. The insulation provided by the 2 km thick lavas is predicted to lift the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the lava flows. Therefore, following lava emplacement and cooling, the initially 1.9 km thick cryosphere underlying the ice sheets will undergo melting over ∼0.5 Myr, followed by complete “deferred melting” of the remaining ∼830 m buried ice sheets over a time scale of ∼0.75 Myr ( Fig. 12 ). The maximum bottom-up melting rates predicted ( ∼1 mm/yr) in this lava heating and loading scenario fall far below the predicted infiltration capacity of the nominal substrate (although the permeability of the crater floor materials relative to the nominal mega-regolith is unclear because heavy fracturing associated with the impact process would increase the predicted permeability and infiltration rates, but the presence of a solidified impact melt sheet could serve to reduce them). Therefore, in this scenario we predict rapid accumulation of lavas resulting in a limited amount of concurrent top-down melting, followed by complete bottom-up melting of the cryosphere and ice sheet limited by the rate at which heat is delivered from the geothermal gradient ( Fig. 10 ). Meltwater resulting from bottom-up melting in this scenario is predicted to infiltrate into the subsurface to provide groundwater recharge ( Fig. 12 ). However, the overburden pressure from the loaded lavas may have initially allowed ice sheet basal melting to begin prior to cryospheric melting due to the pressure melting point reduction effect discussed in Section 6.3 . This could have allowed for the accumulation of a melt lens at the ice sheet base which if released through rupturing of the confining material, would have caused a flooding event. However, a flooding event produced in this way would occur only during the onset of bottom-up ice sheet melting, since after the flooding event, the ice-melting isotherm would have ascended into the ice sheet, thus removing the impermeable cryosphere. Features predicted to result from this second lava heating and loading scenario include ( Figs. 12 and 13 ): (1) Primarily fractures and cracks within the superposed lavas due to gradual subsidence from long term subsurface ice mass loss and meltwater infiltration. (2) Collapse features including depressions, chaos terrain, or pit craters are possible due to early events of more rapid subsurface mass loss from flooding events facilitated by pressure melting point reduction effect. However, these features could only form during a brief window of time at the onset of ice sheet basal melting. Therefore, these features are not predicted to be dominant, and would additionally show evidence for further subsidence resulting from subsequent gradual subsurface mass loss from ice sheet basal melting and melt infiltration. (3) Fluvial channels emerging from the lava flow margins associated with flooding events. Fluvial channels in this scenario would be pre-\nicted to be generally small in scale due to the limited nature of he conditions which could produce flooding.\nExamination of the features observed within the study region Fig. 14 ) indicates the presence of: (1) large cracks and fracture ystems within the volcanic crater fill units ( Fig. 14 ), (2) a large ∼3 km wide) channel emanating from the rim of the Northwestrn crater (crater A), which we interpret to be fluvial in origin s suggested by the presence of tear-drop shaped islands within he main channel ( Fig. 14 ). The cracks, fracture systems, and wrinle ridges observed within the volcanic filling unit in each crater re generally consistent with either lava heating and loading sceario and in this example do not allow clear distinction between he models. However, the large scale of the channel observed to merge from the rim of the crater is suggestive of more rapid and ignificant discharge of water which is predicted to result predomnantly from the conditions outlined in the first scenario in which he emplacement of very thick lava flows ( ∼100 m or greater) reult in significant and rapid top-down melting. The observed ge-\nlogical evidence ( Fig. 14 ) is generally consistent with the predicions made by lava heating and loading scenario (1) ( Fig. 7 ). Thereore we predict that lava heating and loading of the study area ccurred in the context of the conditions outlined in scenario (1) n which very thick lava flows were rapidly emplaced atop a prexisting ∼1 km thick ice sheet, accumulating to a thickness of ∼1.5 o 1.75 km and causing rapid (several 100 to 10 4 yr) and complete op-down melting of the underlying ice sheet.\n. Conclusions\nHere we outline the major findings and predictions from our nalysis of lava heating and loading of ice sheets in the Late oachian – Early Hesperian history of Mars.\n.1. Initial lava flow emplacement\nIce sheet lava heating and loading begins with the emplaceent of an initial lava flow. We find that the melting rates in-\nuced by supraglacial lava flow emplacement and heating are\nuch higher for thinner lava flows, but are sustained for much reater periods of time for thicker lava flows resulting in the\nelting of much more ice. The meltwater that is produced durng the heating process is predicted to infiltrate into the snow nd firn layer at the ice sheet surface because the predicted nfiltration capacity of this material exceeds even the highest\nelting rates induced by lava flow emplacement and heating. hile the firn layer is predicted to absorb the meltwater pro-\nuced during initial lava flow emplacement, the surficial snow nd firn layer will be very rapidly removed by the heating, meltng, refreezing, and compaction associated with lava flow em-\nlacement. Due to these factors the net effect of initial lava ow emplacement will be efficient removal of the surficial snow nd firn layer, resulting in the subsidence and degradation of he lava flow. The final degraded initial lava flows will then erve to construct a thermally insulating cap across the ice sheet urface.\nIf the initial lava flow that is emplaced at the ice sheet surface s very thick ( ∼100 m or greater) then significant, or complete, topown melting of ice sheets spanning the plausible range of “icy\nighlands” ice sheet thicknesses ( ∼300 to 1000 m) is predicted. As result of this significant melting, the firn layer has little effect on he meltwater transport and fate since it is removed very quickly n the early stages of lava emplacement and ice sheet heating. Intead, very thick initial lava flows will melt rapidly down into the mpermeable ice. In addition, since melting will occur over rapid imescales (several 100 to 10 0 0 yr), there will not be sufficient\nt s l p t f t f f\n8\ne l i l a p r s p t w o s f i o w w i\no t p l p t s fl s\n8\nn d i f w c a T l t n D t i t i l m c w\nm i i c c m b i b l a w t l t\ni u t m n G i c p s i m c\nm b e t T a m g o m q o q i e\n8\nt s t t t i m\n8\no s s a m b\nime for bottom-up melting of the cryosphere, and thus the suburface will remain impermeable throughout the lava heating and oading and top-down melting processes. As a result meltwater is\nredicted to pool around the flow, where it may then: (1) drain to he ice sheet base forming meltwater reservoirs (since the subsurace will be impermeable) which may source flooding events when he confining ice is ruptured, or (2) drain across the ice sheet surace (if the melt is able to overtop the surrounding ice) in channels ollowing surface topography.\n.2. Subsequent lava flow emplacement\nFollowing the emplacement of the initial lava flow, heat delivry to the underlying ice during the emplacement of subsequent ava flows is delayed after emplacement and significantly reduced n magnitude due to the intervening layers of previously emplaced ava flows. As a result of the reduction in heat delivery, considerbly less meltwater is produced throughout the lava flow cooling\neriod. Since the ice sheet surface firn layer is likely to have been emoved during initial lava flow emplacement, melting induced by ubsequent lava flow emplacement will take place within the imermeable ice. Therefore, meltwater is predicted to pool around he lava flow (possibly inundating the lava flow if enough melt-\nater is produced) enhancing lava flow cooling and the likelihood\nf phreatomagmatic events. This meltwater will then either be aborbed by the surrounding unaffected firn layer, or will simply rereeze around the lava flow possibly encapsulating the lava flow in ce. As subsequent lava flows continue to accumulate, the amount\nf top-down melting induced by heat delivery to the underlying ice\nill become negligible, and continued accumulation of lava flows ill serve chiefly to construct a thermally insulating cap across the\nce sheet surface.\nIf the series of accumulating lava flows are very thick ( ∼100 m r greater), the ice sheet will undergo relatively rapid (several 100 o 10 4 yr), complete top-down melting during the successive emlacement of only ∼1 to 5 individual lava flows. Therefore very ittle or no ice sheet may remain to melt during subsequent em-\nlacement. If ice remains, melting will occur at the base of the iniial lava flow in the impermeable ice and meltwater will follow the ame transport and fate processes as during the initial thick lava ow emplacement (drainage to ice sheet base, or runoff across ice heet surface).\n.3. Continued lava heating and loading\nIf the lava flows accumulating at the ice sheet surface are ot very thick ( ∼10 m thick or less), the top-down melting inuced by direct heat transfer will become negligible as the grow-\nng sequence of chilled lava flows prevents downward heat transer. The sequence of lava flows loaded atop the ice sheet surface\nill then serve primarily as a thermally insulating layer that will ause the ice-melting isotherm, which would have initially existed t depth below the ice sheet base, to ascend towards the surface. he bottom-up melting processes that result from lava heating and oading in this way can vary depending upon the thicknesses of he individual lava flows being accumulated, the total lava thick-\ness loaded, and the timescale over which lava is accumulated. ue to the highly cratered nature of the topography onto which he Hesperian Planum volcanic plains were emplaced, a dichotomy n lava emplacement conditions is predicted with more rapid and hicker lava accumulations occurring in crater interiors than in the ntercrater plains areas. The greater total thicknesses of accumuated lava ( ∼2 km) reached in the crater interiors can allow the iceelting isotherm to reach the base of the superposed lava flows ausing complete thermal instability of the underlying ice sheet,\nhich will then be subject to eventual bottom-up melting. The\nore rapid lava accumulation (on the order of 10 kyr), will result n bottom-up melting that is limited by the rate of geothermal heat nput from below allowing bottom-up melting of the ice sheet and ryosphere to continue, or even begin, after lava accumulation has ompleted, leading to “deferred melting.” Conversely, If lava accu-\nulation were to occur gradually (on the order of 100 Myr), then\nottom-up melting will be limited by the rate at which insulation\ns provided by lava accumulation, such that the long-term averaged\nottom-up melting rates of the cryosphere and ice sheet will be\nimited to the rate of lava accumulation. In either case, melting nd removal of the ice sheet following lava heating and loading\nill cause substantial subsidence of the emplaced lava flows. Feaures predicted to form as a result of this subsidence include: colapse features, depressions, chaos terrain, wrinkle ridges, and fracure systems.\nIn the intercrater plains, which are predicted to be characterzed by thinner accumulations of ice and lava, and by more grad-\nal lava accumulation, insufficient insulation is provided by the hinner total accumulation of lava ( ∼500 m) to allow for the iceelting isotherm to reach the base of the ice sheet. As a result, o or minimal ice sheet basal melting is predicted in these areas.\niven that minimal ice sheet basal melting or subsurface mass loss s predicted in the nominal intercrater plains, few subsidence or ollapse -related features are predicted to form within the super-\nosed lavas. However, basal melting in the intercrater plains is pos-\nible, even at the thinner nominal ice sheet thicknesses ( ∼300 m), f greater thicknesses of lava were accumulated (2 km), or if the\nean annual surface temperature and geothermal heat flux were\nonsiderably higher (240 K, and 100 mW/m 2 , respectively).\nWhether bottom-up melting is limited by the rate of geotheral heat input, or insulation provided by lava accumulation, the\nottom-up melting rates of the ice sheets even at the highst geothermal heat fluxes (100 mW/m 2 ) are considerably below he infiltration rates predicted for the nominal martian substrate. herefore, unless there is an extensive layer of very low permebility, or impermeable material, underlying the melting ice sheet,\neltwater is predicted to infiltrate into the subsurface to provide roundwater recharge. If a layer of impermeable material ( e.g. clay r competent bedrock) underlies the area of bottom-up melting,\neltwater may become sequestered at the ice sheet base. Melt se-\nuestered at the ice sheet base would be confined by very large verburden pressures from the superposed ice sheet and lava seuence. This water could be released through ice sheet fracturng near the ice sheet margins resulting in large episodic flooding vents.\n.4. Cryosphere implications\nIf the cryosphere underlying the ice sheet contains ice, meltwaer produced from raising of the ice-melting isotherm during ice heet lava heating and loading will percolate down into the marian mega-regolith and crust to join any deeper groundwater sysem. Bottom-up melting of cryospheric ice is nominally predicted o be complete before ice sheet basal melting can initiate. Thus an ce-cemented cryosphere is not predicted to prevent infiltration of\neltwater produced at the base of the buried ice sheet.\n.5. Effect of pressure melting point reduction and ice impurities\nThe analyses we present here have assumed that the ice is free f impurities and that the melting temperature of the ice is contant at 273 K. However, pressure melting point reduction from ice heet lava heating and loading, and the inclusion of impurities, can llow the ice sheet to undergo basal melting prior to complete\nelting of the underlying cryosphere by allowing the ice sheet to\negin melting at lower temperatures. In this case the cryosphere\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\nC C\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nC\nE\nF\nwould temporarily act as an impermeable barrier, preventing the downward infiltration of melt from the ice sheet, having the same effect as other impermeable formations.\n8.6. Example case in Hesperia Planum\nGeological features observed within the study area include fracturing of volcanic crater fill, and a broad ( ∼3 km) fluvial channel, emerging from a volcanically filled crater rim. These features are consistent with predictions made from a lava heating and loading scenario in which the crater was rapidly flooded with very thick lava flows (on the order of 100 m or more), and thus suggest the presence of regional snow and ice deposits in Hesperia Planum during the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian period.\n8.7. Model applications\nA wide variety of potential applications exist for the model results and predictions outlined in this study. These include regional mapping to identify locations which may have undergone ice sheet lava heating and loading in order to: (1) Determine to what extent ice sheet lava heating and loading processes may have contributed to the global population of valley networks and outflow channels following the general process outlined in Section 7 . (2) Constrain the regional distribution of Late Noachian and Hesperian ice and lava thicknesses through use of the predicted minimum thicknesses required to generate observable ice sheet lava heating and loading morphology. (3) Infer Noachian topography by identifying locations exhibiting the predicted lava-loading subsidence/collapse morphology which are not associated with an obvious impact structure. This may be possible because melting and subsidence are predicted to be minor in intercrater regions, therefore the observation of lava loading morphology in these locations may indicate the presence of pre-existing underlying topographic depressions which could be reflective of the Noachian surface topography. This would require accurate constraints on Late Noachian and Hesperian snow deposition patterns in order to remove the influence of asymmetrical snow accumulation and ice sheet thicknesses. (4) Constrain Hesperian magma production rates by identifying regional morphological signatures consistent with rapid or gradual lava emplacement.\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge comments from two anonymous reviewers which have helped to improve the quality of the manuscript.

  "abstractText": "Recent modeling studies of the early Mars climate predict a predominantly cold climate, characterized by the formation of regional ice sheets across the highland areas of Mars. Formation of the predicted “icy highlands” ice sheets is coincident with a peak in the volcanic flux of Mars involving the emplacement of the Late Noachian – Early Hesperian ridged plains unit. We explore the relationship between the predicted early Mars “icy highlands” ice sheets, and the extensive early flood volcanism to gain insight into the surface conditions prevalent during the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian transition period. Using Hesperia Planum as a type area, we develop an ice sheet lava heating and loading model. We quantitatively assess the thermal and melting processes involved in the lava heating and loading process following the chronological sequence of lava emplacement. We test a broad range of parameters to thoroughly constrain the lava heating and loading process and outline predictions for the formation of resulting geological features. We apply the theoretical model to a study area within the Hesperia Planum region and assess the observed geology against predictions derived from the ice sheet lava heating and loading model. Due to the highly cratered nature of the Noachian highlands terrain onto which the volcanic plains were emplaced, we predict highly asymmetrical lava loading conditions. Crater interiors are predicted to accumulate greater thicknesses of lava over more rapid timescales, while in the intercrater plains, lava accumulation occurs over longer timescales and does not reach great thicknesses. We find that top-down melting due to conductive heat transfer from supraglacial lava flows is generally limited when the emplaced lava flows are less than ∼10 m thick, but is very significant at lava flow thicknesses of ∼100 m or greater. We find that bottom-up cryosphere and ice sheet melting is most likely to occur within crater interiors where lavas accumulate to a sufficient thickness to raise the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the superposed lavas. In these locations, if lava accumulation occurs rapidly, bottom-up melting of the ice sheet can continue, or begin, after lava accumulation has completed in a process we term “deferred melting”. Subsurface mass loss through melting of the buried ice sheets is predicted to cause substantial subsidence in the superposed lavas, leading to the formation of associated collapse features including fracture systems, depressions, surface faulting and folding, wrinkle-ridge formation, and chaos terrain. In addition, if meltwater generated from the lava heating and loading process becomes trapped at the lava flow margins due to the presence of impermeable confining units, large highly pressurized episodic flooding events could occur. Examination of the study area reveals geological features which are generally consistent with those predicted to form as a result of the ice sheet lava heating and loading process, suggesting the presence of surface snow and ice during the Late Noachian to Early",
