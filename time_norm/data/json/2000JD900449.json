  "abstractText": "For the first ime, annually resolved accumulation rates have been determined in central Antarctica by means ofcounting seasonal signals ofammonium, calcium, and sodium. All records, obtained from three intermediate depth ice cores from Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, show rather constant accumulation rates throughout thelast 9 centuries with mean values of 63, 61, and 44 mm H20 yr -â€¢ and a typical year-to-year variation of about 30%. For the last few decades, no trend was detected accounting for the high natural variability of all records. A significant weak intersite correlation is apparent o ly between two cores when the high-frequency part with periods less than 30 years is removed. By analyzing therecords in the frequency domain, nopersistent periods were found. This suggests that the snow accumulation in this area is mainly influenced by local deposition patterns and may be additionally masked byredistribution of s ow due to wind. By comparing accumulation rates over the last 2 millennia a distinct hange in the layer thickness inone of the three cores was found, which might be attributed either to an area upstream of the drilling site with lower accumulation rates, or to deposition processes influenced by surface undulations. Themissing of a clear correlation between the accumulation rate histories atthe three locations i also important for the interpretation f small, short time variations of past precipitation records obtained from deep ice cores."
