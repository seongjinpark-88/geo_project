Palaeogeogr., Palaeoclimatol., Palaeoecol., 32: 89--97. Changes in the tectonism induced by great earthquakes in Japan during the past 2000 years are described, and compared with volcanic, climatic, and palaeo<)ceanographic data from Japan, and glaciation in other parts of the world. In general, the changes in the tectonism precede changes in volcanic activity, climate, and palaeo-oceanography by 50--100 years. This shows that the tectonism induced by great earthquakes is an effective trigger of various geological events on time scales of centuries.",
