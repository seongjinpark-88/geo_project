    "text": "Ceraunius Tholus, a Hesperian-aged volcano in the Tharsis region, is characterized by small radial valleys on its flanks, and several larger valleys originating near its summit caldera. All of these large valleys drain from near the lowest present portion of the caldera rim and down the flanks of the volcano. The largest valley debauches into Rahe Crater (an oblique impact crater), forming a depositional fan. Recent study of climate change on Mars suggests that many low-latitude regions (especially large volcanic edifices) were periodically the sites of snow accumulation, likely triggered by variations in spin orbital parameters. We apply a conductive heat flow model to Ceraunius Tholus that suggests that following magmatic intrusion, sufficient heating would be available to cause basal melting of any accumulated summit snowpack and produce sufficient meltwater to cause the radial valleys. The geometry of the volcano summit caldera suggests that meltwater would also accumulate in a volumetrically significant caldera lake. Analysis of the morphology and volumes of the largest valley, as well as depositional features at its base, suggest that fluvial erosion due to drainage of this summit caldera lake formed the large valleys, in a manner analogous to how valleys were formed catastrophically from a lake in Aniakchak caldera in Alaska. Moreover, the event which carved the largest valley on Ceraunius Tholus appears to have led to the formation of a temporary lake within Rahe Crater, at its base. The more abundant, small valleys on the flanks are interpreted to form by radial drainage of melted ice or snow from the outside of the caldera rim. Comparison of Ceraunius Tholus with the volcano-capping Icelandic ice sheet Myrdalsjokull provides insight into the detailed mechanisms of summit heating, ice-cap accumulation and melting, and meltwater drainage. These observations further underline the importance of a combination of circumstances (i.e., climate change to produce summit snowpack and an active period of magmatism to produce melting) to form the valley systems on some martian volcanoes and not on others. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

    "text": "Valley networks on Mars are integrated, branching valley systems that occur primarily in the highlands and are interpreted as predominantly Noachian in age (e.g., Carr, 1995). The characteristics of valley networks have been interpreted to mean that they were formed by processes requiring atmospheric temperatures and pressures sufficient to produce a “warmer and wetter” climate (e.g., Baker, 2001; Craddock and Howard,\n* Corresponding author. Fax: +1 401 863 3978. E-mail address: james_head_III@brown.edu (J.W. Head III).\n0019-1035/$ – see front matter © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2006.12.021\n2002). Younger, Hesperian-aged valley networks have been observed on some martian volcanoes, but not others, and these younger features have also been interpreted to have formed by surface water runoff and sapping (e.g., Gulick and Baker, 1990; Gulick et al., 1997; Gulick, 1998, 2001). If these valleys formed well after the earlier, Noachian-aged period of postulated warmer, wetter climate, two questions are raised: (1) does this later period of valley formation represent a return to warmer, wetter conditions, and (2) why did the valleys form on some surfaces and volcanoes and not others? The presence of the valleys on these younger edifices could be explained by one or more of the following scenarios: (1) ‘warm, wet’ conditions recurred subsequent to the Noachian, perhaps in an\nepisodic manner (e.g., Gulick et al., 1997), (2) the younger valleys formed by a mechanism different than those formed earlier (e.g., Baker, 2001; Gulick et al., 1997), and/or (3) the earlier, Noachian networks may not require a “warmer, wetter” period of climate history.\nTo address these important questions, we previously analyzed one of the examples of younger, Hesperian-aged, valley systems interpreted to have formed by surface water runoff and sapping (Gulick and Baker, 1990) on the martian volcano Hecates Tholus (Fig. 1). We tested the hypothesis that these radially arrayed valleys which extend from high on the volcano down the flanks to the base could have formed by melting and drainage of summit snowpack (Fassett and Head, 2006; see also Gulick et al., 1997; Gulick, 1998, 2001). This is motivated in part by recent analyses that indicate many low-to-mid latitude areas have been the site of accumulation of abundant snow and ice in the past history of Mars (e.g., Head et al., 2005, 2006a, 2006b); the climatic forcing that causes deposition of ice at low-to-mid latitudes is thought to be triggered by variations in spin orbital parameters (e.g., Laskar et al., 2004; Forget et al., 2006). Furthermore, low-latitude mountain glaciers have been observed on the flanks of the Tharsis Montes (e.g., Head and Marchant, 2003; Shean et al., 2005) and climate models have shown that periods of enhanced obliquity and the presence of topographic prominences (the volcanoes) cause adiabatic upwelling and cooling of water-rich air, enhancing snow deposition (e.g., Forget et al., 2006). In the case of some of these other Tharsis volcanoes, signatures of past glaciation are observed at elevations above the maximum elevation of Hecates and Ceraunius Tholi (e.g., Shean et al., 2007). These findings support the idea that volcanic edifices were likely sites for snow deposition during specific climatic periods related to spin orbital excursions; indeed Hecates Tholus shows evidence of such deposits emplaced on its low flanks in the Amazonian (Hauber et al., 2005).\nWe next assessed whether such snow and ice accumulation could undergo melting under current environmental conditions at Hecates Tholus. On the basis of the extremely cold, hyperarid conditions typical of the current Mars environment, topdown melting of snowpack is unlikely, and bottom-up melting due to the existing average planetary thermal gradient is also unlikely unless snowpack thicknesses exceed several kilometers (e.g., Carr and Head, 2003). On the other hand, Hecates Tholus must have experienced periods of magmatic activity to form the edifice, which could locally increase the thermal flux and near-surface temperatures to cause basal melting of the snowpack. We modeled a series of magma reservoir geometries within the volcano and found that intrusions would lead to sufficient heat flux (consistent with terrestrial experience) to cause basal melting of summit snowpack (Fassett and Head, 2006).\nUsing patterns of meltwater production and drainage associated with snowpack and glaciers in the Mars-like Antarctic Dry Valleys, we further concluded that the distinctive radial channel patterns on the flanks of Hecates Tholus could result from drainage of melting summit snowpack during periods when the volcano was magmatically active. This is a plausible scenario\nfor explaining why valley networks are found only on some volcanoes since it involves a combination of two time-dependent circumstances, (1) climatic conditions allowing deposition of snow and ice on the volcano summit, and (2) sufficient magmatic activity to produce enhanced heat flow at the summit and to trigger melting.\nTo test this hypothesis further, in this paper we examine Ceraunius Tholus (Figs. 1 and 2), another of the locations cited by Gulick and Baker (1990) where valleys are found on a young volcanic surface. We first compare the similarities and differences between Hecates and Ceraunius Tholi, and then assess whether the observed features at Ceraunius could be explained by the same mechanism as that proposed for Hecates Tholus (Fassett and Head, 2006). We find that both volcanoes share generally similar characteristics in terms of radial valleys and their characteristics and distribution.\nDifferences include the much larger and asymmetric summit caldera on Ceraunius, and the presence of several large valleys that emanate from the low point in its caldera rim, and terminate in fan features at the base of the volcano. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that like Hecates Tholus, Ceraunius Tholus was the site of snow and ice accumulation, and that during one or more of these periods basal melting was triggered by local enhancement of the geothermal heat flux (caused either by intrusive or extrusive volcanic activity and/or hydrothermalism). This melting in the summit region led to the formation of the small radial valleys, as we believe was also the case at Hecates. Unlike Hecates, however, basal melting filled the caldera and formed a substantial lake, which was overtopped and drained, forming the large canyons that emanate from the lowest part of the caldera rim. These large drainages from a caldera-filling lake are similar to the current situation at Myrdalsjokull, an Icelandic subglacial volcano, which we explore as a potential analog."

    "text": "Ceraunius Tholus is a member of the Uranius group of volcanoes located at the northeast edge of Tharsis (Fig. 1). The edifice is smaller and more elongate than Hecates Tholus (∼180 km diameter), with an elliptical plan-form of 130 km (E– W) by 95 km (N–S), and rises ∼6.5 km above the surrounding plains, with the summit reaching ∼8.7 km in elevation, compared to a height of ∼8 km and a summit elevation of ∼4.5 km for Hecates. A broad, flat-floored caldera ∼25 km in diameter tops the edifice, compared to ∼12 km diameter for the Hecates caldera. The rim of the Ceraunius caldera is very asymmetrical (Crumpler et al., 1996), with the eastern portion of the rim lying more than 2 km below the western rim (Figs. 2 and 4). The edifice has no directly superposed impact craters greater than 7 km in diameter, but the ejecta of one large, elongate crater formed by oblique impact (Rahe Crater; ∼35 × 18 km) occurs along its northern base (Figs. 2 and 3A). A new crater count gives a surface age for Ceraunius of mid–late Hesperian [∼3.5 Gyr in the Hartmann (2005) isochron system, Fig. 5]. This is broadly consistent with the suggestion that it is late Hesperian in age based on the interpretation that it formed coeval with Uranius\nPatera (Plescia, 2000). Lava plains with an early Amazonian surface age (At4) flood the surrounding region and embay its base (Scott and Tanaka, 1986).\nAs described by Crumpler et al. (1996), Ceraunius Tholus (Figs. 2–4) is characterized by a simple caldera and a distinctive sector structure; the western margin of the circular ∼25 km diameter caldera flares outward onto a portion of the flank that is both lower and lower-sloped (∼5◦) than the rest of the radially channeled flanks, which have an average slope of 7◦ to 8◦ (Figs. 2 and 4). The caldera wall is steep-sloped (∼25◦; Fig. 2F) and its maximum elevation (∼8700 m) occurs on its eastern rim crest (Figs. 2C and 6). A small sector of an earlier caldera occurs on the northern rim (Crumpler et al., 1996). The highly variable nature of the rim crest elevation (Fig. 6) shows some specific trends: starting at the high point (∼8700 m) on the eastern rim, the rim crest descends smoothly to both the north and south (to ∼7600 m), below which the rim crest changes significantly in character. The western part of the rim is characterized by an irregular, terrace-like profile (with terrace segments at approximately 6800, 7150, 7200, and 7500 m) (Fig. 6). The lowest\nof these (∼6800 m elevation) is 8 km wide and contains a large sinuous valley that extends westward downslope to the base of the edifice.\nThe floor of the caldera is very smooth, with slopes less than ∼0.5◦ at a ∼500-m baseline (Fig. 2F), but it shows some morphological diversity. Much of the floor is smooth-textured, but large segments in the north central part are rough-textured at the small scale, suggesting coalesced lava flows. Several pits or secondary-crater clusters occur on the floor. Characteristics similar to the caldera floor (including its low slope and smoothness) are also observed within the region immediately to the west of the caldera and on individual terraced areas of the caldera rim (Fig. 2F).\nCrumpler et al. (1996) describe the history of Ceraunius Tholus caldera as follows: (1) formation of an early, relatively small diameter caldera(s); (2) sector-like collapse of the western summit to produce the observed amphitheater-shaped structure; (3) deposition of smooth materials on the western flank; and (4) final collapse or subsidence of the central floor region. The new data are broadly consistent with this sequence; on the\nbasis of the observations of the multiple levels of the western rim, and the smooth, lava-flow-like deposits there, step 3 (deposition of smooth materials on the western flank) may have taken place in several stages downward erosion and resurfacing of the caldera rim (Figs. 2 and 6)."

    "heading": "3. Thermal environment and snow melt",
    "text": "In a manner similar to our treatment of Hecates Tholus (Fassett and Head, 2006), we have examined how the volcanic environment of Ceraunius Tholus can alter the heat flux envi-\nronment at the surface during or following periods of magmatic activity. In particular, we have calculated how magmatic intrusions of plausible volume, depth, and temperature would affect the surface environment by solving the conductive heat flow equation. We utilize the forward-time, centered space finite difference method on a three-dimensional grid derived for Ceraunius, with a surface defined by MOLA (with horizontal grid size of 1 km × 1 km and vertical resolution of 100 m). We have followed the conventions of Fassett and Head (2006) for defining initial conditions, boundary conditions, and thermophysical parameters. These are summarized in Table 1.\nA first-order estimate of the plausible scale for an intrusion can be derived from the caldera size (∼25 km diameter). This is somewhat larger than the caldera on the summit of Hecates Tholus, so if all else remains equal, we would expect a higher heat flux in the intrusive cooling scenario for Ceraunius Tholus than for an analogous scenario at Hecates Tholus. In Figs. 7 and 8, we see that this is indeed the case.\nThe peak heat flux that is achieved in the nominal case (for parameters in Table 1) is ∼170 mW/m2, though a range of 130– 220 mW/m2 is plausible and might occur with slight changes in the choice of parameters. In particular, as discussed in Fassett and Head (2006), the peak heat flux is strongly dependent on the chosen intrusion depth (Fig. 8), and somewhat dependent on the aspect ratio/volume of the intrusion. If we rely on the estimate of Carr and Head (2003) for the thickness of snow needed to cause melting for a given heat flux, our nominal case would require ∼100–200 m of snow thickness for melting to occur.\nWe can also follow the energy balance calculations of Fassett and Head (2006), which suggest that sufficient energy is likely transferred to the snowpack in this scenario to overcome the latent heat of melting and cause significant meltwater production.\nAs can be observed in Figs. 7 and 8, melting and meltwater production may become most viable long after the peak of a given volcanic episode for the deep sort of intrusion that we model (peak surface heat flow takes more than ∼100 kyr to be reached). In reality, volcanic activity and peak surface heat flow may be more closely coupled. Melting becomes significantly easier if much of the heat transport to the near surface is advective—either because of hydrothermal or volcanic activity near to the surface (Harrison and Grimm, 2002; Gulick, 1998). Even transient, relatively minor volcanic activity can be thermally important if it is close to or at the surface. Thus, advection is typically an important or even dominant mechanism for heat transport in terrestrial volcanic or hydrothermal areas (e.g., Manning and Ingebritsen, 1999), as we discuss for the Icelandic analog below. Nonetheless, it is useful to consider conduction because it is conservative—conductive heat transfer will occur regardless of whether advective heat transfer is ongoing, and any advective activity will only increase the peak heat flux at the surface. In summary, in the circumstances we consider, more than enough heating is present to allow snowmelt to occur. This supports the hypothesis that basal melting of snowpack is a viable mechanism for forming the observed valleys."

    "text": "The valleys on Ceraunius Tholus were divided into four groups by Gulick and Baker (1990): (i) relatively small, pristine valleys with steep walls, (ii) small degraded valleys with eroded walls, (iii) linear chains of connected pits, and (iv) the large valleys or canyons (mainly on the north flank of Ceraunius). Here we use new Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), Mars Orbiter\nLaser Altimeter (MOLA), Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS), and High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) data to describe these valley types and their formation processes."

    "heading": "4.1. Small valleys",
    "text": "Small valleys incise much of the surface of Ceraunius Tholus (Fig. 2B), although they are less dense on the western flank,\nfrom Hartmann (2005). Error bars are from\n√\nN . The results suggest a mid to late Hesperian age for the edifice.\nlikely as a result of later volcanic resurfacing. Most of these small valleys originate just below the summit rim (Figs. 3B and 9) and extend down the flanks in an approximately subparallel manner, with few tributaries and small junction angles (Figs. 3A, 3B, and 9). Typical widths are about 200–600 m although the larger valleys in this class can be ∼1 km wide. Widths of individual valleys appear to remain fairly constant. The depth of valley incision appears to be somewhat more variable than the width for a given valley, and typical depths are on the order of tens of meters. Thus, the majority of the small valleys are smaller than those measured by Williams and Phillips (2001) for typical valley networks on Mars. This difference could be a function of (1) differences in sampling [Williams and Phillips considered only MOLA crossings of valleys in the Carr (1995) database, which by virtue of its reliance on lower-\nresolution Viking data is somewhat biased to large valleys], and/or (2) a fundamental difference in the nature or duration of the geological processes that resulted in smaller valleys on the flanks of Ceraunius Tholus than in the highlands. Most valleys extend to the base of the edifice and some valleys have small fan-shaped deposits along the break in slope at the base of the volcano (Figs. 2B and 9). Subsequent plains volcanism (Scott and Tanaka, 1986) has obscured some portions of the base of the edifice so valleys are hard to trace beyond the steep flanks.\nOn the basis of Viking data, Gulick and Baker (1990) suggest that some valleys on Ceraunius Tholus appear to be pristine and others degraded, which they argue implies that some valleys were reactivated by late-stage activity that they attribute to groundwater sapping. On the basis of the new data, especially the available THEMIS VIS and HRSC images, this proposed sequence is less apparent. Many of the valleys that look degraded in Viking images appear to do so because they are smaller and harder to resolve than those mapped as pristine. Although there is certainly a range of valley degradation states across the volcano, the distinction between pristine and degraded valleys is not striking in the new data. We do not observe distinctive differences in morphology that would suggest a transition from runoff to sapping. In general, however, the description of the morphology and morphometry of the small valleys on Ceraunius Tholus by Gulick and Baker (1990) remains apt in light of the new data. The radial symmetry of the valleys (excepting the western flank), as well as the disappearance of valleys in the near-summit region, remains strong evidence that fluvial processes (most likely surface runoff) played a significant role in valley formation, as Gulick and Baker proposed."

The new images indicate that instead of individual pits, the valley is connected and unusually sinuous near the summit (Fig. 10). Down-flank it transitions into a style quite similar to other (relatively large) valleys and near the base\nof the volcano, it divides into two valleys, the deeper of which truncates the shallower, and each of which has a fan-shaped deposit at its base (Fig. 10). Since this highly sinuous valley cuts across and erodes the resurfaced flank to the west of the summit, and extends almost to the caldera rim, it is interpreted to be younger than most of the other valleys observed on Ceraunius Tholus. We believe its origin is likely similar to the other large valleys discussed below."

    "heading": "4.3. Large valleys",
    "text": "Three large canyon-like valleys lie on the northwest flank of Ceraunius Tholus (Figs. 2 and 3). These large valleys are up to 2.5 km wide and 300 m deep. The biggest of these three north-trending valleys is the westernmost, which also appears to be the youngest based on cross-cutting relationships evident near the summit of the volcano (Fig. 11). This valley is deepest and most V-shaped near the summit of Ceraunius (Fig. 11), and becomes more U-shaped near its base (Fig. 13A), below which lies a substantial fan just inside the rim of the oblong crater Rahe (Fig. 12). There is a clear areal association of the valley and the fan; furthermore new data reveal an inner channel in parts of this valley (Fig. 13) that can be seen exiting the valley at its distal end, crossing the fan (just to the east of a 1 km diameter crater in Fig. 13C), and extending down the distal slope of the fan onto the floor of Rahe Crater. The valley and fan appear to have a well-graded profile, with a near constant slope in MOLA track data (Fig. 4, profile F–F′).\nRahe Crater is 35 × 18 km in diameter and up to 1 km deep (Fig. 4), and it has been interpreted to have formed as a highly oblique impact on the basis of its highly elongated shape and unusual “butterfly” ejecta deposit (Nyquist, 1983; Gault and Wedekind, 1978). Rahe has been cited as a candidate for the impact event thought to have launched the SNC meteorites from Mars (Mouginis-Mark et al., 1992; Nyquist, 1983), although there continues to be debate about their exact provenance. On the basis of superposition relationships (the eastern\nvalley modifies the ejecta deposit, and the western valley cuts the crater rim deposit and the fan is emplaced in the crater interior) the crater predates the formation of at least two of the large valleys on the northern flank of Ceraunius Tholus.\nAs seen in the perspective view in Fig. 12A, Rahe ejecta has been emplaced up onto the lower flanks of the edifice, and the easternmost of the large valleys has interacted with the edge of the ejecta deposit, breached it, and deposited material in a small fan (Figs. 12B and 12D). On this small fan, small channels and erosional scarps are also observed (Fig. 12B, middle), and there is some evidence for channel migration on the fan surface but exact stratigraphic relationships are unclear at this resolution.\nThe third, central, valley is apparently the oldest of the three. Near the base of Ceraunius, it becomes degraded and its stratigraphic relationship with Rahe’s ejecta is difficult to determine (Fig. 12A); indeed, it could be older than Rahe Crater, with the sediments at the channel end underlying the distal ejecta rampart. The eastern and western of these large, north-trending valleys unequivocally cut Rahe ejecta (Figs. 12A–12E), and because the westernmost valley is the largest and best exposed of these valleys, our analysis explores it in detail (Section 5.2). On the basis of their proximity, morphology, and stratigraphy, it is likely that the other two valleys formed in a comparable manner. For the reasons discussed below, we believe these large canyons formed as a result of the drainage of water from a summit caldera lake."

    "text": "Other workers have made a compelling case that the small valleys on Ceraunius Tholus (like those on Hecates Tholus) were likely formed as a result of the action of water (e.g., Gulick and Baker, 1990), so this will not be reviewed in detail here. Instead, only a few comments based on the new observations are made here.\nThe relationships of valleys and small craters on the flanks aid in constraining valley formation mechanisms and timing. A number of small craters appear to have been temporarily filled with water and then breached on the downslope rim (e.g., Fig. 9, at right). The fact that these craters have no evidence of lava deposition supports the idea that the valleys formed fluvially and not via lava erosion, because lava erosion is primarily a constructional process (e.g., Carr, 1974) and could not\nbreach the downslope rim of these craters without first filling them with lava. Another apparently unique relationship is seen in Fig. 9 (center-left), where the relationship of valleys with a crater and its ejecta suggest that valleys were active both before and after the impact event (the ejecta appears to be dissected on the crater’s east and west edges but looks to be superposed on the valleys north and south of the crater, closer to its central axis). These relationships are consistent with the small valleys\nforming in multiple episodes or over an extended period of time.\nWe assessed more generally the relationship of the valleys and craters to constrain their ages. For the 21 craters on Ceraunius Tholus having a diameter >1 km, it was possible to infer with confidence the relative stratigraphic position (before or after the period of valley formation) of 14 craters. Nine craters clearly post-date the period of valley formation, four pre-date the valleys, and one example (Fig. 9) appears to have poten-\ntially formed after valley activity began but before it ended. The observation that ∼70% (9 out of 13) of the craters post-date valley activity suggests a late Hesperian age [∼3.2 Gyr in the Hartmann (2005) isochron system] for valley formation. However, the ambiguous stratigraphic relationship of seven craters with the valleys implies that valley formation could be much closer to the surface age of the volcano as a whole (if the ambiguous craters all post-date valley activity, formation of the valleys may have ceased by ∼3.4 Gyr ago). Alternatively, val-\nley formation may have taken place as recently as ∼3.0 Gyr (earliest Amazonian; if all the ambiguous craters pre-date valley activity).\nGulick and Baker (1990) argue for a sequence of valley formation by runoff followed by groundwater sapping, based upon the idea that some valleys appeared especially pristine and others more degraded. As we discuss above, this contrast is not as striking in the new data, and in light of other observations that suggest surface runoff (such as the relationships of valleys and craters, e.g., Fig. 9) we believe the range of observations can be explained by surface runoff alone. The small valleys on Ceraunius Tholus, like those on Hecates Tholus, share a variety of characteristics with small valleys formed by surface runoff from snowmelt on similarly steep slopes in the Antarctic Dry Valleys (Fassett and Head, 2006). The common characteristics include an abrupt beginning in the summit region, a near-constant width and depth on the steep flanks, and subparallel, immature drainage patterns. This abrupt sourcing of the small valleys in the near-summit region is consistent with channelization at the margin of a melting snowpack, though this is not the only possible interpretation.\nFormation of these small valleys via snowmelt requires that at least two conditions are met: snow or ice needs to be present on the surface (see Section 1), and sufficient enough energy needs to be transferred into this snowpack to drive melting (see Section 3). One scenario that meets these conditions is the scenario we suggest: basal-melting of snowpack driven by heat flux enhanced by volcanic activity. However, this is not the only plausible scenario for melting snow on Mars (see, e.g., Clow, 1987). Further work is needed to establish what range of environments might trigger valley formation via this mechanism, as well as whether we can further constrain the environment from the observational record."

    "heading": "5.2. Origin of the largest valley and its associated fan deposit",
    "text": "There has been much speculation regarding the origin of the large, westernmost north-trending valley and the nature of its\nassociated fan. Candidate models include: (1) fluvial action, (2) volcanic density flows (e.g., Reimers and Komar, 1979), (3) lava flow with the valley being a lava channel (e.g., Carr, 1974), (4) collapse (e.g., Caplinger, 2001), or (5) some combination of these processes.\nNew observations shed light on distinguishing among these possible modes of origin. As described above, detailed examination of the topographic relationships of the valley and the rim of the crater Rahe (Figs. 2, 4, and 12) shows that the valley completely cuts the rim of the crater and extends into the crater, forming a fan-shaped feature where it enters the crater. The nature of the fan-shaped feature provides potential evidence for its origin. The fan is composed of three distinctive parts. The first, uppermost section (Fig. 12C) begins at the mouth of the valley and its boundaries extend laterally along the interior walls of Rahe Crater for distances of 5 km (west) and 7 km (east). The western boundary then turns north and forms a steep slightly sinuous scarp that extends for about 5 km down onto the floor of Rahe, where it turns ESE and extends for about 11 km to the base of the crater wall. The morphology of the upper part of this scarp varies, with the western segment appearing sharp, and the eastern segment appearing serrated (Fig. 12C). The surface of this portion of the fan is cratered, but appears generally smooth (Figs. 12A and 12B); detailed examination (Fig. 12C) shows that the eastern portion (east of the 1 km crater in the center) is characterized by subtle linear scarps that appear to be related to some of the serrations along the northern scarp. Indeed, the westernmost of these scarps (adjacent to the crater) is channellike and appears to emerge from the valley, extend across the fan, and then extend down the slope. The surface of this portion of the fan, although relatively smooth, is not flat, and slopes down from the mouth of the fan to the scarp at ∼4◦ (Fig. 2C; Fig. 4, profile F–F′), only slightly shallower than the distal portions of the inside of the valley. The mouth of the channel (top of the fan) lies at an elevation of about 2100 m, and the edge of the top portion of the fan (the scarp) lies at about 1600 m elevation (Fig. 14).\nThe second section of the fan is an outward-facing scarp (up to about 200 m high), and extends from the scarp lip 0.5 to 3 km out onto the crater floor. Along its western half, the scarp is at its steepest, with peak slopes of ∼13◦ (Figs. 2D, 11C, and 14), but along its eastern half it is less steep (peak slopes ∼10◦) and shows linear to sinuous small scarps extending down slope and often correlated with the serrations in the scarp lip. The third section of the fan deposit is formed of smooth plains that fill parts of the floor of Rahe Crater (Fig. 12C). The distal portions of these deposits are clearly seen to extend 5–6 km out onto the crater floor from the bottom of the scarp, but they then tend to merge imperceptibly with the crater floor (Fig. 12C). Some small lobe-like features are seen in this part of the deposit (Fig. 12C, lower middle), but the surface is otherwise hummocky and relatively featureless besides superposed small, clustered craters (presumably secondaries).\nIn summary, the three-part fan clearly begins at the mouth of the large valley, and consists of an upper sloping partly channeled surface, a medial scarp with a partly serrated crest, and a distal flatter deposit, all superposed on the crater interior. The characteristics of this fan differ considerably from many of the other recently described fans where highland valley networks debauched into preexisting impact craters (Malin and Edgett, 2003; Moore et al., 2003; Fassett and Head, 2005; Irwin et al., 2005 and references therein). Missing are the sinuous, looping channel deposits, and the multiple distributary lobes. Those types of features likely represented the channelized flow of water and deposition of sediment on a delta undergoing significant channel-switching (avulsion). These differences could imply that the Rahe fan was not deposited by aqueous processes, but might instead be related to lava or pyroclastic erosion/deposition processes. On the other hand, the features we describe in the Rahe Crater fan are quite similar to fans formed by intermittent aqueous activity with a heavy concentration of sediment, or fans building out into a standing body of water, where the smoother portion of the fan is largely above water, and the scarp and distal smooth portion of the deposits are subaqueous.\nSedimentary fans and deltas form in a variety of environments, ranging from generally dry talus cones to pure, deep submarine deltas. A common theme in most features involving water is the aqueous transport of sediment in confined channels until some significant transition in stream power is reached, such as: (1) alluvial fans, where channels open into a much broader area, at which point the aqueous medium is more widely dispersed and the sediment load is dropped to form the fan, or (2) deltas: where the channel reaches a standing body of water, the flow velocity decreases, and the sediment load is largely deposited. Terrestrial deltas are characterized by both constructional (depositional) and destructional (wave and tidal erosion) processes and environments, and typically consist of a delta plain (an upper predominantly subaerial surface), a delta front (submarine, where course grained sediments are deposited), and a pro-delta plain (a lower submarine plain where sediments are largely deposited from suspension). The range of delta morphologies generally reflects the relationships between depositional-dominated (constructive) and erosional-\ndominated (destructive) types. In many cases channels avulse to create various overlapping channels and lobes; similar features have been recognized on Mars (Malin and Edgett, 2003; Moore et al., 2003; Fassett and Head, 2005). In some deltas known as Gilbert-type, relatively high outflow velocities, combined with a relatively steep drop at the channel mouth, cause dominance by inertial forces in which the effluent spreads and diffuses in the manner of a turbulent jet (e.g., Wright, 1977, 1985). These conditions are common where high gradient streams enter deep bodies of water.\nThe feature seen on the floor of Rahe has a broad fan shape (rather than the multiple birds-foot morphology typical of avulsion-dominated deltas) and has three segments broadly similar to the subaerial delta plain, delta front, and pro-delta plain. It is also very similar in morphology to deltas that can be produced experimentally on laboratory stream tables under specific conditions (Fig. 15). In these experimental cases, a stream channel with a constant-flux of sediment-laden effluent produces a fan-shaped deposit built out into a standing body of water. The final configuration is a Gilbert-type delta characterized by a relatively steep delta front. The similarities between this experimental configuration and the Rahe Crater fan are striking (compare Figs. 14 and 15).\nAnother approach to assess the origin of this valley is to compare the volume of the deposit and the volume of the valley itself. If the valley were formed by lava thermal erosion processes (a process that requires very significant amounts of lava to thermally erode the substrate to create the valley), then the volume of the material in Rahe Crater should greatly exceed the volume of the valley (Reimers and Komar, 1979; Carr, 1974). Modeling by Li and Robinson (2002) suggested that erosion of the largest canyon on the north flank of Ceraunius might require eruption of ∼420 km3 of magma, which is much greater than the volume (20×) than the volume of the observed fan on Rahe’s floor. If formed by pyroclastic flows, the deposit volume should also be much greater than the channel.\nIf formed solely by aqueous erosion, the volumes of the fan and the channel should be comparable.\nUsing MOLA gridded data (1/128◦) and individual MOLA profiles we measured the volume of the fan deposited at the base of this valley in Rahe Crater to be 21.7 km3 and the volume of the valley itself to be 20.9 km3 (assuming a rectangular cross section and an average depth of 220 m) or 20.6 km3 (using a cross-sectional area from MOLA orbit 17623 as representative and multiplying by the total valley length). Each of these volume estimates is uncertain at a level of ∼20%; the volume of the valley is particular difficult to ascertain since there is a 12 km gap in MOLA orbit crossings. However, the very close correspondence of these two measurements (erosional valley and depositional fan) is consistent with the derivation of the fan sediments entirely from the valley.\nFurther support for the idea that fluvial erosion formed the large valleys comes from the lack of evidence for extensive lava flooding, ponding, and buildup on the floor of Rahe Crater itself, as would be expected if the valley formed by lava thermal erosion or if lava had subsequently utilized a valley created by other processes. Ash flows also appear unlikely to be the dominant process in carving the channel and forming the fan because this process, as with lava thermal erosion, would require many multiples of the eroded channel volume to actually eroded the substrate, and this volume is not observed in Rahe Crater. Finally, the existence of a small channel observed on the valley floor and fan surface (Fig. 13) supports the idea that fluvial erosion formed the valley and fan. Thus, on the basis of these observations and calculations, we pursue the interpretation that the valley and the fan were formed by related aqueous erosional and depositional processes, to produce a Gilbert-type delta at the mouth of the valley in Rahe Crater. Other depositional fans on Mars that may be Gilbert-type deltas have been studied in detail (Mangold and Ansan, 2006; Ori et al., 2000). The delta deposit in SW Thaumasia shares many of the characteristics of the fan we observe here, including a relatively shallow surface slope (2◦), a steep front (∼11◦), and a comparable total volume (15 km3) (Mangold and Ansan, 2006).\nThe geomorphological evidence strongly suggests that the channel and the delta formed in a standing body of water. We can assess what contour level the water in this lake reached. In other crater lakes, water commonly appears to have breached the rim at a low point to create an exit channel (e.g., Fig. 9; see also Irwin et al., 2005 and references therein). Examination of the Viking, THEMIS, HRSC, and MOC images of Ceraunius, the delta, and the interior of Rahe Crater, combined with topography derived from MOLA, shows that the lowest point on the rim of Rahe is at its northeast end, where the exterior ejecta is missing due to the bilaterally symmetrical ejecta pattern typical of very low angle impacts (Fig. 2, Fig. 4, profile C–C′, and Fig. 14). At this elevation (∼2100 m), no prominent erosional feature is present in the rim crest in the present data, suggesting that water did not fill it to a level that would cause a lake in Rahe Crater to overflow. Volume comparisons support this interpretation. The total enclosed volume of the Rahe Crater is ∼233 km3 (below the 2100-m contour) and the volume of the\nNote. The best estimate is that when the fan was deposited, Rahe was filled to between the 1600- and 1700-m contours, implying water volumes of ∼35 to 70 km3, both of which are less than the present enclosed volume of the Ceraunius caldera.\na Upper limit volume of flood from the present Ceraunius caldera: ∼75 km3.\ncurrent summit caldera is ∼75 km3 (below the current breach elevation). On the basis of these comparative volumes, even if the completely flooded caldera was to flood Rahe Crater, it still would not have filled it sufficiently to breach the rim crest at its lowest point. Indeed, the summit caldera volume would flood Rahe Crater to approximately the 1700-m contour, on the upper portion of the delta (Table 2).\nA final relevant piece of evidence for the lake level reached in Rahe is the elevation of the marginal scarp in the delta: from terrestrial field and laboratory analogs, it is likely that the water level inside Rahe Crater was in the vicinity of (or higher than) this elevation when the fan was emplaced. Examination of a MOLA topographic map of the interior of Rahe (Fig. 14) shows that this elevation is consistently ∼1600 m (about 500 m below the lowest point in the Rahe Crater rim). Therefore, our best estimate is that Rahe Crater flooded to approximately the 1600 or 1700-m contour during the formation of the valley and delta; we informally refer to this as Lake Rahe. The water volume at various possible lake levels (contours) is given in Table 2.\nOn the basis of these observations, we outline the following scenario for the formation of the large valleys, the delta, and Lake Rahe. All three of the large canyons on the north flank of Ceraunius Tholus have their source near the low point of the summit caldera (Figs. 2–4 and 8). We interpret this to mean that the summit caldera was the site of a lake that filled with water from time to time related to the melting of summit snowpack via conductive and advective heating, as outlined above. As the caldera filled with water, drainage occurred from the low point in the caldera rim crest (Figs. 6 and 11). This mechanism is directly analogous to the caldera-breaching event that triggered a large flood at the volcano Aniakchak in Alaska (Waythomas et al., 1996), with peak discharges (∼106 m3/s) comparable or larger than those inferred at Ceraunius Tholus (see Table 1). Initial drainage events formed the central and eastern of the three large valleys, and at least for the eastern valley, deposition took place at the base of the edifice interacting with the ejecta of Rahe Crater. There is no evidence that the rim crest of Rahe was breached in these first two events. The third and largest of the valleys formed in a similar manner, cross-cutting the previously formed canyons (Fig. 11) and descending down the flanks of the edifice to the edge of Rahe Crater, where the rim of Rahe\nwas breached and sediment-laden water entered the crater itself (Fig. 12). The flooding of Rahe was characterized by the deposition of a fan-shaped deposit at the mouth of the channel as water flowed into the crater and filled to a contour level of ∼1600–1700 m.\nIf we assume that the fan volume of ∼20 km3 transported into Rahe was brought in a single large event, we can estimate a range of sediment concentrations that this would imply. Flooding to the 1600- and 1700-m contours would presently require ∼40 or ∼70 km3 of water, respectively. These would imply sediment to water ratios (by volume) of 1:2 or 1:3.5, respectively. For basaltic sediment, a ratio of ∼1:3 (by volume) is near the upper limit of what is typically suggested for sediment transport scenarios in flood events on Mars (Komar, 1980; but see also Kleinhans, 2005). Achieving these high sediment concentrations might be favored for the large valleys on Ceraunius Tholus due to their steep slopes (∼5◦–8◦) compared to those of the outflow channels (Komar, 1980). Thus, we anticipate two possible scenarios: either (1) the fan in Rahe was built in a single hyper-concentrated, very high discharge event (perhaps with peak fluid flux of order 105 m3/s), or (2) it was built in multiple flood events with lower sediment concentration (still with a substantial peak flux, perhaps Q ∼ 104 m3/s) (see Table 3 for flux estimates). Even in this second scenario, the average sediment to water ratio was likely 1:12 or greater (by volume), since Rahe could not have filled beyond the 2100-m contour (V ∼ 233 km3) without breaching its northeast rim.\nFollowing this initial filling of Lake Rahe and deposition of the majority of the fan, flow waned and the ∼200-m wide channel observed in the lower portion of the valley and on the fan surface was carved (Fig. 13). Eventually, caldera lake drainage and erosion ceased, Lake Rahe became input-starved, and eventually disappeared by evaporation, freezing and sublimation, and/or subsurface drainage. The canyon source area (the low point in the summit region) was then resurfaced by volcanic deposits (see the smooth nature of this area in the slope maps, Figs. 2C–2F) and the immediate channel source depressions in the lip of the caldera were embayed (Fig. 11). Further summit activity locally lowered the caldera rim crest in a ∼7 km wide segment in the caldera rim (Fig. 6). The final highly sinuous valley was then focused by this breach and formed west of the caldera, incising the volcano’s western flank of the edifice and\ndepositing small fans of material at its the base (Figs. 2, 3, and 10). Unlike the example to the north in Rahe Crater, the effluent from this valley was not confined by a crater to form a lake, and was dispersed into the surrounding plains, depositing its sediment at the break in slope.\nGiven this scenario for the formation of the large valleys, it is worth asking the following question: why did these large canyons form on Ceraunius Tholus but not on Hecates Tholus? A primary difference between Hecates and Ceraunius is the difference in the edifices’ summit calderas. The Ceraunius caldera encloses a volume of ∼75 km3 with a depth from its floor to the peak of its rim of 2 km (which has probably been decreased somewhat by late stage resurfacing). The Hecates caldera is much less disrupted, and only encloses a volume of ∼18.5 km3, with a depth from the caldera floor to rim of ∼500 m. Thus, the deep, wide caldera at Ceraunius could trap a substantially greater volume of material (ice and/or water) than the small nested caldera at Hecates. Moreover, at the time that the largest canyons on the north flank of Ceraunius formed, the western rim of the caldera was potentially more intact, and the caldera was less resurfaced, so it might easily have enclosed a much greater volume (perhaps up to a factor of two more).\nThis difference in “trapping ability” might have helped not only create conditions for large floods on Ceraunius Tholus compared to Hecates Tholus, but may also have helped in the accumulation of ice in the summit regions in the first place. The steep eastern caldera rim wall on Ceraunius Tholus (Fig. 4, profile A–A′) is an excellent potential focal point for accumulation of ice. It is similar in both relief and elevation to the ∼2 km-high, west-facing scarp of a graben on the western flank of Arsia Mons, where abundant ice-related features are observed (Shean et al., 2007). On Ceraunius Tholus, it appears that accumulated snow or ice was melted, trapped in a summit caldera lake, and then escaped down the north flank in several canyon-carving events. Further insight into the nature of this process can be derived from an examination of the formation and evolution of terrestrial caldera lakes formed by melting of summit snowpack. In the following section we examine a welldocumented example from Iceland."

    "text": "Numerous areas of high topography in Iceland contain summit snowpack and many of these highs are active or recently active volcanic edifices. The largest of these also contain summit calderas and sufficient snowpack to form glaciers. For example, the Myrdalsjokull ice cap (Fig. 16), the fourth largest in Iceland (area of 600 km2), rises 1300–1500 m above the surrounding lowlands, and is characterized by heavy winter snowfall, high rates of summer melting, and is drained by numerous rivers (Björnsson et al., 2000). The ice cap is underlain by an active volcano with a large central caldera, which is part of the Katla volcanic system (Jakobsson, 1979; Johannesson et al., 1990). Eruptions beneath the ice have recently averaged two per century, and each eruption rapidly melts large volumes of ice leading to enormous jökulhaups from the margins of the ice cap. These flooding events typi-\ncally follow one major drainage direction related to the summit caldera topography, and often result in hyperconcentrated flow over the adjacent outwash plains with velocities of 5–15 m/s, peak discharges of 100,000–300,000 m3/s, and total volumes of 1–8 km3 (Björnsson et al., 2000). Björnsson et al. (2000) have recently reported on an analysis of the surface and bedrock topography of the icecap, and the implied structure and morphology of the sub-ice caldera. They show that the caldera is ∼9×13 km in diameter, covers ∼200 km2, is 600–750 m deep, and is characterized by significant floor structure and morphology, with several smaller recently active floor cauldrons which are the location of lakes and the sources of the jökulhaups.\nBottom-up melting of the ice is due to general geothermal flux aided by hydrothermal circulation and direct contact with eruption products. Top-down melting is due to enhanced summer solar insolation, and this meltwater reaches the substrate through moulins, crevasses and veins and joins with basal meltwater produced predominantly by geothermal sources. Sub-\nglacial migration of meltwater causes coalescence into streams that leave the edge of the ice through portals, forming a set of radially arrayed streams around the edifice (Fig. 16). In the caldera interior, migration paths and subglacial water-divide locations are dictated by ice thickness and ice overburden pressure, and local gradients in ice overburden pressure drive water out of the caldera through the deep passes in the caldera rim (Björnsson et al., 2000).\nIs there any evidence for jökulhaup-like catastrophic drainage of the summit caldera lake on Ceraunius Tholus, as seen in the Icelandic examples? Discharge estimates for the largest valley on Ceraunius Tholus are comparable (or greater) than those in jökulhaup events that occur at Myrdalsjokull. The enclosed volume of the summit calderas at Myrdalsjokull (∼40 km3) and Ceraunius (∼75 km3), the inferred peak discharges (104–105 m3/s) and the total volume in flood events observed at Myrdalsjokull (∼1–8 km3) and inferred at Ceraunius (∼40 to ∼70 km3) are all comparable (within an order of magnitude). Based on these similarities, it seems plausible that\nthe process which carved this valley is the rapid draining of a caldera lake, as for the jökulhaups in the Icelandic examples.\nWe have interpreted the source of water for the small radial valleys on Hecates Tholus (Fassett and Head, 2006) and Ceraunius Tholus to melting of summit snowpack by geothermal heat and drainage of meltwater down the sides of the edifice. This melting of snowpack at the Ceraunius Tholus summit would likely cause substantial volumes of water to be trapped in the caldera. Although any ice in the caldera would be expected to exert overburden pressure and influence the drainage of sub-ice meltwater, the pronounced asymmetry of the edifice summit area and caldera (Fig. 4, profile A–A′; Fig. 6) strongly suggests that any meltwater residing in the summit caldera would nonetheless drain through the low part of the rim to the west, where the major valleys are located.\nThe characteristics of snow and ice-capped active Icelandic volcanoes such as Myrdalsjokull thus help bolster our understanding of the origin of the valleys around Ceraunius Tholus. A primary difference of Ceraunius and Myrdalsjokull is the lack of distinctive features on the flanks of Ceraunius (and Hecates) related to wet-based glaciation (drumlins, scour, moraines, etc.). This suggests that either snow and ice cover was too thin for significant glacial flow to occur, or that resurfacing of the summit destroyed any evidence that might once have existed. If melting occurred in relatively thin deposits of snow or ice, the heat flux that led to melting may have been higher than the conservative values calculated in Section 3."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "Two major types of valleys are radially arrayed on the Hesperian-aged flanks of Ceraunius Tholus, a volcanic edifice in the Tharsis region. Small valleys are common on the flanks of the volcano, form below the summit, and extend downslope to the base with little branching or intersection, often ending in small fans. These are quite similar to radial valleys on the flanks of Hecates Tholus, another volcano with a Hesperian surface age. Unlike Hecates, several larger valleys appear to emanate from near the low point of the summit caldera rim. These larger valleys extend down the flanks and formed large sedimentary fans. The largest of the valleys breached the ejecta of Rahe Crater at the base of the edifice and flowed into the crater interior, likely forming a temporary lake and depositing a ∼22 km3 delta. The morphology of both the small and large valleys on Ceraunius, their geological setting, and terrestrial and laboratory analogs, all point to their erosion by water. The distribution and characteristic of these valleys leads to the interpretation that they formed by melting of summit snowpack.\nOn the basis of these observations, we conclude that like Hecates Tholus, Ceraunius Tholus was the site of snow and ice accumulation during climatic excursions, and that enhanced heat flux led to basal melting of snowpack to form the observed features. These observations underline the importance of a combination of circumstances (climate change to produce summit snowpack and an active phase of magmatism in the edifice to produce melting) to form the radial valley systems on some volcanoes and not on others. If this interpretation is correct,\nthen other valley networks such as the apparently young valleys observed in the region of Valles Marineris by Mangold et al. (2004) may have formed by a similar mechanism (bottomup geothermal melting of snowpack) rather than during a period of “warm and wet” climate; this mechanism may apply to some Noachian valley networks as well (Carr and Head, 2003; Clow, 1987). Ceraunius Tholus provides a basis for the further analysis of this process and comparison to the array of valley network morphologies and settings.\nFinally, the stratigraphy, geological history, and superimposed impact crater population on the floor of Rahe Crater suggests that it formed before the major canyons on Ceraunius, likely in the Hesperian (or early Amazonian at the latest), and is thus not a good candidate for the impact that ejected the SNC meteorites, since their ejection ages are likely late Amazonian (e.g., Nyquist et al., 2001)."

  "abstractText": "Ceraunius Tholus, a Hesperian-aged volcano in the Tharsis region, is characterized by small radial valleys on its flanks, and several larger valleys originating near its summit caldera. All of these large valleys drain from near the lowest present portion of the caldera rim and down the flanks of the volcano. The largest valley debauches into Rahe Crater (an oblique impact crater), forming a depositional fan. Recent study of climate change on Mars suggests that many low-latitude regions (especially large volcanic edifices) were periodically the sites of snow accumulation, likely triggered by variations in spin orbital parameters. We apply a conductive heat flow model to Ceraunius Tholus that suggests that following magmatic intrusion, sufficient heating would be available to cause basal melting of any accumulated summit snowpack and produce sufficient meltwater to cause the radial valleys. The geometry of the volcano summit caldera suggests that meltwater would also accumulate in a volumetrically significant caldera lake. Analysis of the morphology and volumes of the largest valley, as well as depositional features at its base, suggest that fluvial erosion due to drainage of this summit caldera lake formed the large valleys, in a manner analogous to how valleys were formed catastrophically from a lake in Aniakchak caldera in Alaska. Moreover, the event which carved the largest valley on Ceraunius Tholus appears to have led to the formation of a temporary lake within Rahe Crater, at its base. The more abundant, small valleys on the flanks are interpreted to form by radial drainage of melted ice or snow from the outside of the caldera rim. Comparison of Ceraunius Tholus with the volcano-capping Icelandic ice sheet Myrdalsjokull provides insight into the detailed mechanisms of summit heating, ice-cap accumulation and melting, and meltwater drainage. These observations further underline the importance of a combination of circumstances (i.e., climate change to produce summit snowpack and an active period of magmatism to produce melting) to form the valley systems on some martian volcanoes and not on others. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.
