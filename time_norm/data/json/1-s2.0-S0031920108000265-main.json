Volcanoes of the World. . . ttp://www.volcano.si.edu/gvp/world/], and the “ice core volcanic index” (IVI) sequence, based on the volcanic eruption record as acid layers n big glaciers (Robock, A., Free, M.P., 1996. The volcanic record in ice cores for the past 2000 years. In: Jones, P.D., Bradley, R.S., Jouzel, J. Eds.), Climatic Variations and Forcing Mechanisms of the Last 2000 Years. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 533–546). To perform the statistical nalysis in a meaningful way, data subsets were extracted from the original data, with size thresholds and time intervals carefully selected to make hese subsets nearly homogeneous. The analysis has revealed, generally, the tendency to clustering, manifested in the following three forms: (1) he event rate is not uniform in time: event dates form active episodes (“common” clusters). (2) In the time-ordered, sequential list of sizes of ruptions, larger events do not appear purely randomly; instead, they form tight groups (“order clusters”). (3) The volcanic products discharge rate s significantly non-uniform, and shows episodic (intermittent or bursty) behavior. It was also found that for the volcanic sequences analyzed, the wo types of clustering behavior mentioned in (1) and (2) are positively correlated: larger events are concentrated at the periods of higher event ate. Such a relationship is best demonstrated by the fact that there is clear negative correlation between the following two time series: (1) of the xponent b of the power law size–frequency distribution (the analog of b-value of the Gutenberg–Richter law for earthquakes) and (2) of the current vent rate. Power spectra of the analyzed sequences mostly follow power laws, with negative exponent β. Thus, these sequences can be qualified as ulse flicker noises. In other words, they are fractal sequences with correlation dimension Dc =β + 1 < 1, and both their clustering and episodicity re of self-similar character. The revealed peculiarities of the global volcanic sequence suggest that some global-scale mechanism exists that is esponsible for their origin. They are also or primary importance for understanding the impact of volcanism on climate.\n2008 Elsevier B.V.

In a numer of studies it has been noted that that the temporal structure of olcanism is non-uniform, episodic in time for such processes s ocean ridge volcanism, hot spot volcanism, explosive volcansm in island arcs and trap volcanism (Kennett et al., 1977; Rea nd Scheidegger, 1979; Makarenko, 1982; Cambray and Cadet, 996; Sigurdsson, 2000; Prueher and Rea, 2001). However, these tudies analyzed episodicity only in qualitative terms; no formal escription for the episodic temporal structure of these volcanic rocesses was proposed. The described studies did not show pecific time scales for episode durations. This may suggest that ctive episodes arise in time in a statistically self-similar maner. For historic timescales, statistically self-similar or fractal ehavior of volcanic eruption sequences has been revealed by\n2 Plan\nD d m\na W e u a P fl a P b t n t c d C t d W n 7 u y\nb d l s d c c\nh m s c “ g w t O a a w t o s r A\nt c t\nl o i s t d b s\nk i r s t d ( o s e h d p ( e e q v p t T r c\nn p i a M c fi s b a s a R i m u o o\ne\n04 A.A. Gusev / Physics of the Earth and\nubois and Cheminee (1988, 1991), and Telesca et al. (2002). A etailed study of fractal space–time structure of intrusions was ade by Pelletier (1999). There are, however, other viewpoints and approaches in the nalysis of volcanic eruption sequences. Some studies (e.g., ickman, 1966; Ho et al., 1991; De la Cruz-Reina, 1991; Jones t al., 1999) either assume or prove that eruptions of a particlar volcanic center or of an area behave purely randomly, as Poisson process. There are also models of non-homogeneous oisson processes, with variable (deterministic or random) event ux density (e.g., Ho, 1991; Connor and Hill, 1995; Jaquet nd Carniel, 2001). Bebbington and Lai (1996) found that the oission model is valid for one of the two volcanoes studied, ut was rejected for another one that showed short-term erupion clustering (or, equivalently, correlation between events); either of the two manifested long-term memory (and thus fracal behavior). Similarly, Godano and Civetta (1996) found that orrelation of Vesuvius eruptions, although observable at short elays, practically disappears at long delays; and Jaquet and arniel (2001), analyzing seismic activity at Stromboli, found hat only short-term memory/correlation is present. Also, tenencies to periodicity of eruptions have been revealed, e.g., by ickman (1966) who noted cyclic behavior of individual volca-\noes, by Ammann and Naveau (2003) who found an expressed 6-year cycle in volcanic activity in tropical zone since 1400 sing ice core data, and by Mason et al. (2004) who found a early cycle of eruptive activity.\nGenerally, the multi-scaled clustered behavior is common ut not universal tendency, and its presence for any particular ata set needs separate analysis. In such an analysis, the probem of data completeness is specifically important. Although ome approaches has been proposed for treatment of incomplete ata (Guttorp and Thompson, 1991), really convincing results an only be obtained if one is provided with a homogeneous, onsistent initial data set.\nA few kinds of temporal structure of volcanic event sequences ave been mentioned above. To discuss them, more accurate terinology is needed. Consider first the approach when the event ize information is ignored. For such cases, we shall further all the tendency of event rate/density to form episodic maxima common clustering”. This term is needed in order to distinuish this kind of behavior from another mode of clustering that e call “order clustering”. To observe this second kind of clusering, event sizes should be analyzed along with event times. bserving a sequence of events of various sizes, one can note tendency of large eruptions to appear in clusters (Gusev et l., 2003). These clusters are seen in the time-ordered event list, ith accurate event times ignored. It is important to realize that his “order clustering” phenomenon is completely independent f common clustering, when sizes of events are ignored, and hould not be confused with the latter. Order clustering was first evealed in global and regional earthquake catalogs (Ogata and be, 1991; see also Gusev, 2005).\nBoth common and order clustering may be limited to short ime/number delays (short-term clustering, with a certain limited orrelation time), or to be manifested simultaneously for many ime scales, including the longest among those observed. In this\nt a c t\netary Interiors 166 (2008) 203–218\natter case we speak of long-term clustering, or long-term memry. In the simplest case, clustering behavior can be organized n a similar way on all analyzed time scales; then we speak of elf-similar or fractal behavior (Mandelbrot, 1982). Sometimes, he analyzed range of scales can be divided into sub-ranges with ifferent fractal behavior in each (Dubois and Cheminee, 1993); ut data sets studied here are limited in volume and do not permit uch a fine analysis.\nGenerally speaking, clusters of each of the two described inds may arise independently. Alternatively, they can occur n some organized fashion, e.g., positively or negatively corelated. The actual mode of behavior is unknown, and its tudy might shed some light on the mechanisms that conrol the evolution of volcanism. It is difficult, however, to evelop this line of study with data sets of the actual size 100–300 events). Therefore, an indirect approach was develped, based on the following observation. During the time egment occupied by an “order cluster”, the fraction of large vents (among all events) can be expected to be unusually igh. This fact suggests that order clusters can affect the size istribution of events. For many kinds of natural (and social) henomena, the event size distribution is near to power law Pareto law), and this kind of distribution was also noted for ruption sizes (Turcotte, 1992; Simkin, 1993) as well as for arthquake energies/seismic moments. With respect to earthuake sequences, it is common to monitor size distribution ariations through the study of the exponent of the mentioned ower law, commonly denoted “the b-value”. One can expect hat this approach can be applied to volcanic sequences as well. his is done in the following, with an unexpectedly definite esult: common clusters and order clusters show clear positive orrelation.\nSpeaking abstractly, there is a multitude of modes of possible on-uniform behavior of a volcanic sequence. One of the simlest and often observed forms of such a multi-scaled behavior s the scale-invariant or self-similar behavior. Such processes re called fractal time sequences, or flicker noises (see e.g. andelbrot, 1999). The fractal behavior of natural and artifiial phenomena attracted very wide attention recently in many elds of science; a number of studies were listed above that uggest that the formation of fractally organized clusters may e considered to be a reasonable initial hypothesis in the study volcanic sequence. For this reason, in the following analyis the fractally clustered or intermittent behavior is considered s a main alternative to the uniform, non-clustered behavior. ecently, updated versions of two important data sets representng global volcanic activity has been kindly made available for e by their authors. In the following, these global data sets are\nsed to achieve better understanding of the temporal behavior f global volcanism over time scales from months to hundreds f years.\nWhen event dates and sizes are combined in a catalog of vents, they define the temporal structure of the output of erupion products, further called volcanic discharge. Through the ccumulation of volcanic material and thus formation of volanic rock sequences, this output determines, to a large degree, he geological effect of volcanism. Its analysis is critical for\nPlan\np e\np i T s t s b p\ng f t a p r a a p a\n2 s\no d y a ( v c c i c s o b v a h t o t s s\nt v p s b r s A\nt o p p e t d m\no l a t ( i (\nn\nN\nw t w o s a s n i\nw c t p m c p f s v d i a a b\ne a t T p o d\nA.A. Gusev / Physics of the Earth and\nossible comparison to geological history because individual ruptions rarely can be identified in the geological record.\nGenerally speaking, the rate of accumulation of eruption roducts may be uniform or demonstrate some specific behavor, e.g., to be periodic or, oppositely, an episodic/clustered one. he above-mentioned studies based on volcanic rock succesions often demonstrate the episodic behavior of volcanism in ime. It is interesting to find out whether this behavior can be een in the dated volcanic event sequences. Therefore, possile fractal structure of volcanic discharge shall be analyzed in arallel with the study of clustering.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. It begins with eneral discussion of temporal properties that can be expected or eruption sequences. Initial data and their preprocessing are hen described, and three data subsets are specified. Further, for ll these subsets, event rate variations, order clustering, volcanic roduct discharge rate and b-value variations are analyzed. The eality of all these modes of behavior shall be shown for all or t least for two of the three analyzed sequences. Each of these nalyses is prefaced by discussion of the particular processing rocedure. Lastly, joint analysis of results is given, over various nalyzed features and over data sets.\n. Known and possible peculiarities of temporal tructure of volcanic event sequences\nBefore considering possible features of temporal behavior f volcanic event sequences, data selection criteria must be iscussed. One can note that data selection standards have not et been settled in this field. The studies of seismicity can make model in this respect. In seismology, both historical and recent\ninstrumentally studied) events are quantified by magnitude alue. To guarantee that data subsets are uniform, the total atalog duration is divided into subperiods of approximately onstant degree of completeness. A certain magnitude threshold s selected for each subperiod so that events above this threshold an be considered as nearly complete. Such an approach makes eismicity data acceptable for statistical analysis. In the case f volcanic eruption data, their homogeneity can be violated y gaps in reporting, inaccurate event size quantification, timeariable data selection criterion, etc. If, by measures exemplified bove, a volcanological data set under analysis is not made omogeneous, one can easily encounter temporal peculiarities hat are no more than artifacts emulating properties of natural rigin. An additional requirement, specific for volcanology, is hat the history of volcanic activity should be representable as a equence of dated individual events of negligible duration; this hall be assumed for the data sets under study.\nTo fulfill the listed requirements, first a certain size parameer must be ascribed to each eruption event. We assume that this ery important step has already been performed by data comilers. Second, a certain lower threshold must be set for event ize, to provide data completeness. Both these requirements can e fulfilled only approximately with real data, because the accuacy of size estimates of eruptions is limited, and because the maller is an event, the larger are chances for it to be unreported. lthough selecting a high threshold for size might minimize\na c\nl\netary Interiors 166 (2008) 203–218 205\nhe probability of gaps in data, it also minimizes data volume, ften making statistical analysis impossible. Thus, some comromise is needed when selecting the threshold. One important ractical requirement is that the threshold must be stable for ntire time span of the analysis. With indefinite, uncertain and/or ime-dependent threshold for data selection, any quantitative ata analysis may become (and sometimes do become) mostly eaningless. To verify at least approximate homogeneity of a data set, ne can use the following two tests. The first one, that folows the practice of seismicity studies (cf. also Gusev et l., 2003), is based on the assumption that the size distribuion (size–frequency law) for eruptions follows the power law Turcotte, 1992; Simkin, 1993) This law can be written either n a differential form (for histogram n(·)), or in an integral form for cumulative sum N(·)): (10−0.5V < V ′ < 100.5V ) = ad − b log10(V ) (1a) (V ′ > V ) = ac − b log10(V ) (1b) here V is a certain measure of the amount of eruption products hat quantifies the eruption size. In the following this measure ill be called “volume”; generally, other measures, like mass r energy may be more adequate, but this point is outside the cope of this paper. The observed value of the exponent b in (1a) nd (1b) is mostly in the range 0.6–1. Of course, this law is not trict; but when for a certain data set it is clearly violated (e.g., (V) does not decrease monotonically), this strongly suggests ncompleteness of this data set.\nAnother way to verify the completeness of data is to check hether the event rate is approximately uniform. In the quite\nommon case when the event rate systematically increases as ime approaches to the present moment, one can strongly susect a drifting (decreasing) lower threshold of event size or, ore or less equivalently, a gradual increase in the degree of ompleteness of smaller-size events. It must be noted that both roposed data checks are informal: natural data may deviate rom the ideal size–frequency law (1); also the constancy of the mall-event rate can be no more than approximate (its natural ariations form just the above-discussed clusters). Only when a ata set can pass the mentioned checks, one can try to analyze ts temporal structure. With real data, this practically means that n approximately uniform subset of data must be selected for nalysis, with a certain time window and with a certain lower ound on event size.\nThe best-known sort of temporal structure is a non-uniform vent rate, manifested, e.g., as a systematic drift of the averge event rate. In other cases, there is no evident trend, whereas he deviations from purely random timing of events are present. hese deviations may have various forms as, e.g., a tendency to eriodicity, or a tendency to the clustered or burst-like behavior, r expressed as stochastically varying event density. The tenency of event dates to form tight groups/clusters on the time xis, or, equivalently, for event rate to form clear maxima, is alled “common clustering” in the following.\nAnother, less-known tendency may appear in a sequential ist of event sizes, when one takes into account only the order of\n2 Plan\no f s o s a c o ( a f t p g o t\np h s c p b p c w p a v i o m e\ns L m o t a l e c V l\ns i w p m a V r e p a\n3 h\n3\no S k t\nc v F c o e o T s e m t d d r h ( a a a H a s i w b d\na i i o t c c c\nm n s i o\n06 A.A. Gusev / Physics of the Earth and\nccurrence and ignores accurate dates. In this list, events of diferent sizes can be distributed completely randomly, or show ome structure. (A fully artificial example is the occurrence f events in the order of their sizes: the smallest, the second mallest, etc.) A kind of structure that was found to be actully present in volcanic (and earthquake) sequences is “order lustering”, or the inherent tendency of the largest events to ccur “too often” as close neighbors in the time-ordered list. “Too often” means “significantly more often than expected for randomly shuffled event list”.) Accurate timing is irrelevant or order clustering, in contrast to “common” clustering when he rate of events, whose size is now inessential, varies in time, roducing in particular event rate maxima, or equivalently tight roups or clusters. See Gusev et al. (2003) for an example of rder clustering of eruptions and for the detailed discussion of his phenomenon.\nThe order clustering behavior has much in common with temoral variation of b-value. Indeed, a time segment with unusually igh number of large events must have unusually flat graph of ize–frequency distribution, that is, unusually low b-value. The lose connection between order clustering and b-value variation rovides a convenient way to study the temporal relationships etween common and order clustering (avoiding the awkward roblem of identification of individual clusters). When both ommon and order clustering are present in data, one can ask hether their time variations match (are in phase), or “antihased”, or show no simple correlation. To perform such an nalysis, one usually coverts a data set into a sequence of interals; then he must apply a tool that can ascribe to each window ts degree of common and order clustering. The natural measure f common clustering is the local estimate of event rate. And to easure the degree of order clustering one can use just the local stimate of b-value. A significant aspect of the time structure of volcanic equences is the character of the discharge of volcanic products. ike event rate, volcanic discharge rate (VDR) can be uniform, onotonously or randomly drifting, etc. Speaking of episodic r intermittent behavior of VDR, one should clearly distinguish hree factors that control its irregularity: (1) short eruption events s opposed to inactive background (may become disputable for ong-duration eruptions); (2) heavy-tailed size distribution of ruption sizes (Eqs. (1a) and (1b)), resulting in the dominant ontribution of the largest events into the long-term-averaged DR; and at last (3) episodic temporal behavior proper. It is the atter factor that is under study in this paper. The listed features of the temporal structure of volcanic equences are not independent. For example, both the episodicty of event rate and order clustering, each operating separately, ould result in the episodicity of VDR. If both factors are resent, the outcome is less definite. When order clusters match axima of the event rate, the two phenomena shall amplify one nother, resulting in the enhanced expression of episodicity of DR. Oppositely, when order clusters match minima of event ate (the case of anti-correlation of the two types of clustering), pisodicity of VDR shall be reduced or even completely supressed. Thus, all parameters of the temporal structure must be nalyzed jointly.\ni r o a\netary Interiors 166 (2008) 203–218\n. Initial data sets and extraction of nearly omogeneous subsets from them\n.1. Initial data sets\nThe first data set analyzed is the well-known global catalog f volcanic eruptions of the Smithsonian Institution (Siebert and imkin, 2002; see also Simkin and Siebert, 1994). Lee Siebert indly provided its recent version (as of 2004), labeled SMI in he following.\nAnother data set to be considered here is the record of volanic activity of the last centuries as fixed in of the ice core olcanic index (IVI) proposed and compiled by Robock and ree (1996; see also Robock, 2000). Alan Robock (personal ommunication, 2004) kindly provided the most recent version f this data set. Determination of IVI uses dated annual layrs of the ice extracted from boreholes in big glaciers. Some f these layers contain H2SO4 of presumably volcanic origin. he IVI list was produced by critical compilation of acid layer equences found in a number of locations in Northern and Southrn hemispheres. The acid layers are formed by the following echanism: an explosive eruption forms an eruption column hat penetrates the stratosphere and there injects SO2 that is oxiized to SO3 forming finally H2SO4 droplets; this aerosol is ispersed, by stratospheric winds, not quite uniformly, over the espective hemisphere and, in smaller amounts, over the opposite emisphere; aerosol slowly settles making local precipitation snow) marked by greatly increased H2SO4 content; the snow ccumulates and is buried to form a layer in a glacier. The charcteristic times are weeks to months for aerosol dispersion and bout 1 year for aerosol settling. Many factors prevent the local 2SO4 content to be a completely reliable indicator of volcanic ctivity. The main two of these factors are an unstable relationhip between the size of eruption and the amount of H2SO4 njected into the stratosphere and the non-uniformity of globalide aerosol dispersion and accumulation. The last factor has een partly overcome by matching records from geographically istant glaciers.\nAs for the physical meaning of IVI, it is the estimate of verage optical extinction length of the atmosphere (measurng light absorption related to suspended volcanic aerosol). For deal conditions, IVI values must be proportional to the amount f optically active aerosol. An important feature of the IVI data is hat they are completely independent of the SMI data. Despite a ertainly limited accuracy in representing global explosive volanism, IVI is its important and valuable indicator; thus it is hosen as one of the objects of the present study.\nIt must be noted that neither VEI nor IVI are the perfect easures of eruption size. In particular, IVI in principle cannot\not reflect even large lava eruptions: they produce no or low tratospheric aerosol. Also, definition of “explosivity” included n the determination of VEI may be an imperfect indication f the total amount of products of a particular eruption. Even n the better-documented cases, the choice still is not finally esolved between size definitions based on mass or volume f products. Still, the data sets we use are the best availble.\nA.A.

Preparing quasi-uniform subsets of the SMI data set\nThe SMI data set includes the eruption date (of variable accuacy) and the eruption size parameter VEI (“volcanic explosivity ndex”). VEI reflects the amount of erupted products. VEI is n approximately logarithmic measure of the size if eruption. o form numeric representation of size, we use size paramter V = 10VEI. To represent numerically the cases when VEI ata were given as “4+” or “5+”, the size parameter was douled. Events with no month indicated were ascribed to July . On Fig. 1a and b one can see the present level of comleteness of global volcanic data. Visual inspection suggests electing the following approximately complete data subsets: EI ≥ 3 since 1960 (event number N = 226, further denoted MI3), and VEI ≥ 4 since 1820. In order to have independent ata sets, the data set of VEI ≥ 4 events was limited by time pan 1820–1960; it consists of N = 72 events and further denoted MI4. Size–frequency distributions for the periods 1960–2002 nd 1850–1960 (Fig. 2) are sufficiently near to power laws and upport these selections.\n.3. Preprocessing IVI data set\nThe original version of the IVI data set consisted of two lists f yearly IVI values for 1400–1986 for each hemisphere, further enoted as IVINH and IVISH. To obtain the global data set, these wo lists were merged. For years with non-zero records for both emispheres (related either to a single eruption affecting both\nemispheres, or to synchronized eruptions in each of them), ne must combine the two values in some way. Two evident ays to do this are to take the maximum of the two values, or\no add them. The first way seems to produce underestimates;\nm s t y\nI, data shown from 1900 with VEI ≥ 3, the selected period is 1960–2003; (c)\nnd another may produce overestimates. As a trade-off solution, he following global index (having no physical meaning, but erving the limited aim of reasonable combination of two singleemisphere data sets) is further used:\nVIGL = (IVINH2 + IVISH2)0.5 (2)\nFig. 1c represents IVIGL values in time. The lack of temoral uniformity of data can be easily seen as the paucity f points in the lower-left part of the plot. Fig. 2 gives the ize–frequency distribution in the forms of a histogram and f a cumulative plot. One can see that Eqs. (1a) and (1b) are pproximately valid within the IVIGL range from the largest alues down to IVIGL = 0.03–0.04, and then a clear tendency to aturation is seen, indicating that the original IVI record tends o become incomplete here. In the following, the subset of the VIGL sequence with IVIGL ≥ 0.033 is analyzed, further denoted erely IVI. It contains N = 146 non-zero yearly IVI records. As n event size measure V, the value of IVI was used directly. n reality, more than one eruption could contribute to a sinle IVI value; this kind of distortion was inevitable with these ata.\nMany of the yearly IVI records form continuous chains xtending for two or more years. Some of them must be related o the slow settling of aerosol, while others, and especially hose with the length of 3 years and more, seem to reflect real equences of eruptions in successive years. To be on the safe\nits one to accurately cut off the contribution to clustering over hort time intervals. A particular value of the shortest delay hat is permitted to have effect on our results is selected as 3 ears.\n208 A.A.

Event rate variation and common clustering\n.1. Procedures of analysis\nThere are many ways to reveal multi-scaled event rate ariations, e.g., variogram analysis (Jaquet and Carniel, 2001) r multifractal analysis (Godano and Civetta, 1996), but we eeded one that would permit us to go around the problem of hort time intervals, that complicates the analysis of IVI data set. he presence of correlation at small time intervals is a result of nite aerosol settling time; this signal must be screened. For this eason, spectral analysis of a data sequence was applied, so that robably biased spectral components could be simply filtered ut. The sequence of event dates was represented as a function\nt i n D\nnumber (related to complementary cumulative distribution function), see Eq. s. The vertical dash line shows the cutoff value of IVI, equal to 0.033. Only the of b-value. Note an acceptable fit of distributions by the law (1).\nf time consisting of identical spikes (delta-like pulses) of unit mplitude. This data representation is denoted symbolically s 1(t). In the case of uniform event rate (purely random or oisson process), mean power spectrum P(f) of a 1(t) function s constant (“white”). In the case of periodicity, spectral spikes ppear. In the case of self-similar bursts of event rate, P(f) is ower law or hyperbolic one (P(f) ∝ f−α, with α values typically etween 0 and 1.5. This case is known as “pulse flicker noise” ith “pink” power spectrum (“pink” because of enhanced ow frequencies). In a multifractal context, 1 −α is equal to he correlation dimension Dc = D2. To detect a pink spectrum n real data, one must test the hypothesis “α> 0” against the ull hypothesis “α= 0”, that corresponds to flat (“white”) P(f), c = 1 and the lack of fractal clustering.

This pproach, however, performs badly at lowermost frequencies here important information regarding scaling of the spectrum s located. An alternative approach (Pisarenko and Pisarenko, 991) is to integrate Po(fi) numerically, obtaining the integrated ower spectrum IPo(fi). In the case of power law spectrum, IP(f) ehaves as f−α+1 = f−α′ . When analyzing scaling behavior of he spectrum, it is useful to equalize the relative contributions to he result of different frequency bands that cover the logarithmic requency axis. A typical example of this approach is to use ctave bands. We need denser grid, and actually use three points er octave, or ten points per decade. Ideally, we would like to stimate the integrated spectrum IPo(f) at points fj that form a eometric progression fj+1 = afj, with the ratio a = 1.259 = 100.1. his aim cannot be realized literally however because our raw pectral estimates Po(fi) are located at certain frequency points i that are separated by a fixed frequency step 1/T, and form rithmetical progression. Thus, out of the set of points fi we must elect a subset fj that is near to geometric progression. Then, inear regression is performed with pairs {log fj, log IP(fj)}. The ctual set of frequency points used can be written as fj = (1/T) 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32. . .}. Regression delivers he estimate of α′ =α− 1 and therefore of α. It should be noted hat in empirical discrete IP(fj) functions, the accuracy of the rst one to two points is inevitably very low; thus even marked eviations of these points from the straight regression line are olerable, and cast no doubt on the validity of linear regression.\nThe estimate of α must be accompanied by error bounds (or, etter, by distribution density) that would permit one to formally est the hypothesis “α> 0”. To produce these error bounds anaytically is not straightforward even in the asymptotic case of a ery large data set; in the case of a real small data set it is a diffiult task. To overcome this problem (relevant not only for the α arameter), Monte-Carlo estimates of distributions of analyzed arameters for the case of null hypothesis are systematically sed in the following. To obtain these, the actual temporal strucure of events is substituted by many copies of a randomized one. ets of artificial event dates (“surrogate data”) are generated as ealizations of Poissonian sequence, and each surrogate data set s processed using the same procedure as one applied to real ata. Empirical distribution function of α estimates determined n the basis of 1000–10,000 realizations of a data sequence with rue α= 0 approximates the α distribution for the case of the null ypothesis. To determine the significance level of the hypothsis α> 0, the value αob obtained from observed data is used s a boundary value, and the empirical distribution function is ntegrated from αob to infinity, resulting in the estimate of proba-\nility of realization of the event α>αob on the condition that the ull hypothesis is true; by definition this is the significance level for the hypothesis in question (“α> 0”). Traditionally, round ritical significance values for Q are selected like 1%, 2.5%, etc;\ni f c o\netary Interiors 166 (2008) 203–218 209\nn our case a value of Q is the output of our procedure and does ot take any preferred values. Additional use of Monte-Carlo imulation is the determination of bias in numerical estimation f α caused by small sample sizes (it could reach 0.07–0.09 for he case SMI4 with only 74 events), the resulting estimates of α ere adjusted to compensate for this bias. See Gusev (2005) for ore detail. Generally, spectral analysis of data is a standard tool to reveal\neriodicity. A clear 76-year cycle was detected by Ammann and aveau (2003) after special preprocessing was applied to the ame data sets (IVINH and IVISH) as studied here. The present nalysis did not reveal any marked periodicity.\nAfter this introduction let us consider individual data sets.\n.2. SMI3 data set\nOn the size-time graph of this data (Fig. 3a), one can see, n particular, the sequence of event dates. These dates look to e distributed somewhat non-uniformly, but it is not clear how mprobable is to obtain a sequence of similar appearance by urely random dispersion of points along the time axis. For pectral analysis applied to possible common clustering, a disrete fine time scale was used with a small arbitrary time step of /2048, and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was performed on 048 points. On Fig. 4a one sees the integrated spectrum IP(f) hat can be approximated by a straight line with the slope 0.92. n corresponds to slightly pink noise, indicating some tendency o clustering of event dates. The estimate of α equals to 0.08. he significance check was performed for the frequency range .25–10 year−1 (period range 40–0.1 years, the shortest period elected according to the typical time accuracy of SMI3).\nThe formal significance level Q for the hypothesis “α> 0” as derived from the Monte-Carlo simulation explained above. See Table 1 for significance values related to all kinds of specral analysis.) Among 5000 surrogate data sets, as many as 86 produced α> 0.071; thus the average significance level is pproximately Q = 686/5000 ≈ 14%. Thus, although the event ate shows some clustering tendency, its significance is marginal.\n.3. SMI4 data set\nOn the time–size graph Fig. 3c, one can notice groups of oints, but formal analysis based on Fig. 4d, indicates that he clustering tendency is actually not definite. The basis for election of the upper frequency equal to 0.1 year−1 (period 10 ears) is discussed below. For the hypothesis “α> 0” Q = 27% is btained, so the hypothesis cannot be accepted reliably. Qualiatively, estimated α= 0.16 agrees with the idea of clustering.\n.4. IVI data set\nOn the time–size graph (Fig. 3e) one notices rather clear on-uniformity of event dates. On Fig. 4g the regression line\ns seen for the integrated spectrum, plotted and analyzed only or frequencies below 0.333 year−1.

One can see that integrated pectrum corresponds to slightly pink noise, with the estimate f α equal to 0.13. Monte-Carlo estimate for the formal sigificance level Q for the hypothesis “α> 0” equals 10% again ndicating a noticeable tendency to “common” clustering.\n. Order clustering\n.1. Procedure of analysis\nAs was explained above, “order clustering” is the clustering endency as observed in the time-ordered list of event sizes. This ist is treated as a discrete function of sequential event number, his function is denoted symbolically as V(i). Again, spectral nalysis is applied to this function. To make frequency scales on he spectral plots approximately comparable, the integer “dates”, enoted i above, are multiplied by the value of an artificial time tep, equal to the average inter-event interval. (This modification s irrelevant for the formal analysis of significance.) The resultng time scale is denoted as t*. The argument of the Fourier ransform of V(t*) is denoted f*. Now consider the function V(i) or V(t*)). When the sequence of sizes is random, V(t*) is a\nd p\nl event number (b, d and f), for data sets: SMI3 (a and b), SMI4 (c and d) and\nhite (non-Gaussian) noise, whereas when the order clustering s present, V(t*) is intermittent. Moreover, when clusters have o preferred scale on the t* axis (what is highly probable), V(t*) ay be a pink noise. To reveal its presence, the approach develped above with respect to the event rate analysis can be applied, ith the following minor modifications. The first change, a techical one, is that when analyzing V(i) a DFT on N points is used. he analytical technique described for the case of P(f) is then pplied: the V(f*) spectrum is integrated obtaining IV(f*); then, he value of α in the relationship IV(f*) ∝ f−α+1 is estimated by inear regression of log IV(f*) versus log f*. As a final step, the ignificance level for the hypothesis “α> 0” is checked by a\nonte-Carlo approach with surrogate data. In this case, in order o generate surrogate data sets with no temporal structure, it is seless to perturb times of events (they are fixed); instead, the ime-ordered list of event sizes is randomly shuffled many times.\n.2. SMI3 data set\nTo determine the significance of order clustering, the just escribed procedure is performed, see Fig. 3b for size–number lot and Fig. 4b, for the log IV(f*) versus log f* graph.

Units on vertical scales are arbitrary.\nf the integrated spectrum is well described by a straight line, nd its slope of 0.78 < 1 indicates a clear tendency to clusterng. Deviations of the first two points can safely be ignored, s was mentioned above. For numerical results see Table 1. he obtained significance level is Q = 2.1%, suggesting that the ypothesis of multi-scaled order clustering agrees with the data easonably well.\nIt must be noted, however, that to obtain this seemingly conincing significance level, it was important that the 1991 doublet ruptions (Pinatubo and Cerro Leon) are specified as having EI = 5+, not 5, and ascribed, correspondingly, an increased alue of “size” V. If the components of this close group (repesenting the only two VEI = 5+ eruptions of 1960–2002) were onsidered as having VEI = 5 (making all five largest eruptions f 1960–2002 equal to one another), the significance level would hange to much less impressive 17%, still indicating that this or arger degree of order clustering can appear purely randomly nly once in six cases.\n.3. SMI4 data set\nThe V(i) graph (Fig. 3d) shows one clear but relatively ong 1883–1907–1912 cluster (Krakatau, Santa-Maria, Katmai) nd no compact clusters.

At higher “frequencies”, the spectrum is hite, and the general spectral shape is curved. Therefore, nly the presence of clustering can be checked in this case; ut the assumption of self-similar clustering behavior is not upported by these data. To test the hypothesis of clustering, he analysis was limited only by “frequencies” f* < 0.2 year−1. or this frequency band, α= 0.43 with very low accuracy, and = 11%; thus, order clustering is expressed, but only modertely.\n.4. IVI data set\nOn Fig. 3f one sees the V(i) graph that shows evident bursts uggesting the presence of order clustering. The log IV(f*) verus log f* graph of Fig. 4h is analyzed for “frequencies” below * = 0.33 year−1; in this way possible bias related to small time ntervals is suppressed. Over this band (in fact, in a wider and), the spectral shape is well approximated by a straight ine (of slope 0.84), making the assumption of self-similarity f clustering reasonable in this case. Based on the obtained sigificance level Q = 9%, one can conclude that the hypothesis of elf-similar ordered clustering is reasonably supported by the ata.\n. Burst-like discharge of volcanic products\n.1. Procedure of analysis\nTo study VDR, the data sequence was represented as a time unction consisting of spikes (delta-like pulses), in the same anner as with common clustering, with the evident change hat a spike has now the amplitude equal to event size, instead of nity. The result is denoted as V(t). To destroy temporal structure hen generating surrogate data, both mentioned randomizaions are now made: actual dates are substituted by a Poisson equence, and the time-ordered event list is randomly shuffled. ll other steps are as before.\n.2. SMI3 data\nSee Fig. 3a for original data over time axis and Fig. 4c for he spectral shape and regression line of log IV(f) versus log f ependence. The observed spectrum is well fit by a straight line, hose slope indicates pink noise with α= 0.08. The Q value is %, suggesting that self-similar episodic behavior of VDR is robable for SMI3 data.\n.3. SMI4 data\nFor this data set (Fig. 3c), similarly to the case of the analsis of V(i), the episodic behavior for VDR is suggested by he spectral shape (Fig. 4f) only for sufficiently low frequenies (periods longer than 5 years). The significance level is not onvincingly low (only 16%), making the conclusion regarding pisodic behavior not fully reliable in this case.\nv d t b t\netary Interiors 166 (2008) 203–218\n.4. IVI data\nSee Fig. 3e for original time structure of data. The observed pectrum Fig. 4i is well fit by a straight line, whose slope indiates pink noise with α= 0.19. The Q value is below 2%, thus, he reality of episodic behavior of VDR is well supported by the ata in this case.\n. Correlation in time between common and order lusters\n.1. General approach\nIt was noted above that the relationship between degrees of xpression of common clustering (=event rate variations), order lustering and VDR variations suggests that the two first pheomena may act cooperatively to enhance the third one. It was lso noted that this idea of “cooperation” can be checked considring the relationship between event rate variations and b-value ariations. In particular, event rate maxima, or common clusters, ust coincide in this case with groups of larger-sized events, and uch groups must cause the local b-value to be low. Therefore, he hypothesis of “cooperation” predicts negative correlation in ime between event rate and b-value.\nTo implement the described idea, the following technique of ata processing is used. The time-ordered list of N events is cut nto a sequence of K packets, each containing the same fixed umber M of events. (A few events in the end of the list that o not form a complete packet are dropped.) The duration of th packet equals dti, i = 1, 2, . . ., K. For ith packet, the local vent rate estimate is evidently λi = M/dti, and the local b-value stimate by maximum likelihood (Aki, 1965) is\ni = log10 e [ (Σi logVi) M − logV0) ]−1\n= log10 e[m̄− logV0)]−1 = (3)\nhere Vi denotes the size of ith event, V0 is the lower threshold sed in Vi selection, and m̄ is the average logarithm of event ize in the data subset, further called “average magnitude”. In he analysis of correlation between λi and bi, one meets with the radeoff between the accuracy of λi and bi that requires large M and thus small K), and the accuracy of correlation coefficient\nthat requires the opposite. In this situation, the near-optimal hoice is to select both K and M of the order of N0.5.\nWith very scarce data available, the results of such an analsis are prone to large statistical fluctuations. To reduce their ffect, two modifications are introduced. First, the number of i and bi estimates is doubled, by using 50%-overlapping of ackets. (That is, with e.g., M = 8, successive packets include vents with i = (1, 2, . . ., 8),(5, 6, . . ., 12,)(9, . . ., 16), (13, . . ., 0) and so on.) Second, the analysis is repeated with several ariants of M value. Additionally, it was found that with small ata sets, it is preferable to directly use the m̄ statistic and not o convert it to b-value. Negative correlation between λi and i means positive correlation between λi and m̄i. (Intuitively his is transparent: high event density is correlated to high aver-\nPlan\na s W n g s l\ni w e w a a o T a e t\ne w d t t h\n7\np t t n i\nF ( i\nA.A.

Then, correlation is analyzed between time eries λi and m̄i, both visually and through statistical testing. e expected that ρ > 0, and tested this hypothesis against the ull one “ρ= 0”. Again, a Monte-Carlo technique with surroate data sequences (made of uniformly distributed points with huffled size order) was applied to determine the significance evel.\nAlthough this mode of data analysis is straightforward and ntuitively attractive, its detection power appeared to be poor ith the actual volumes of the data sets. Another, less transparnt but more susceptible technique was also applied: b-values ere determined for two specially selected subsets of events nd then intercompared. The first subset included events that re located in densely populated intervals of time axis; another, ppositely, includes events from sparsely populated intervals. o sort events according to the population type of their interval, n estimate of density is associated with each event. For the ith vent, this density is estimated as the inverse of the time interval i+2–ti−2 between the two next nearest events. In this way, all\nn d c l\nig. 5.

The critical parameter is the ifference between b-values of the two subsets. A Monte-Carlo echnique was applied again to test the hypothesis that among wo b-value estimates, the one that is related to denser intervals as the lower of two b-values.\n.2.

Visually, some positive correlation can be oticed, and the estimate of ρ is positive (Table 2); still, it s insignificantly different from zero.

SMI 4 data set\nThe results of correlation analysis are shown in Fig. 5b, nd Table 2. Although a marginal significance level was indeed ttained for the presented case with M = 4, this result is unstale at other M and must be considered unreliable. The test with ense/sparse population comparison (Fig. 6b) has no adjustable arameters, so the similar value of significance level obtained n this case can be considered meaningful, and the presence of orrelation can be considered as being marginally supported by he SMI4 data set.\n.4.

One can ee that the inequality ρ < 0 takes place in a wide range of M alues, making the reality of this hypothesis rather probable. till, the values of Q vary markedly. However, by comparng b-values for dense and sparse populations (Fig. 6c), this esult is confirmed rather reliably, at as low a Q value as 0.03% Table 3).\n. Comparative review of results obtained by various ethods\nLet us now consider the results of various ways of data analsis. Let us begin with three modes of spectral analysis applied o three data sets, as seen in Fig. 4 and Table 1, viewed as\nwhole. One evident observation is that the results for the MI4 data set are, generally, the least convincing. This could e expected: this data set is the smallest in volume, and, conaining older data, more prone to problems of calibration and ompleteness. Thus, one can give less weight to results obtained rom this source. Now let us pass to more interesting generalzations.\nThe first point to note is the difference in the degree of expresion of common and order clustering. The expression of common lustering is the weakest: it is observed (at significance levels 4% and 7%) only in two cases out of three, and theα value (here enoted αCCl for this case) averaged over three cases, equals .09. (Averaging of α values is performed with weights based n standard deviations σ(α) of Table 1; an additional weight actor 0.25 was used with SMI4 data obtained over a narrow requency band.) Order clustering is the most prominent: it is learly expressed in each of three cases (at significance levels .1%, 11% and 9%), and the α value (denoted αOCl) averaged ver three cases, equals 0.20. As for episodicity of VDR, this eature is expressed approximately as well as order clustering, t significance levels of 6%, 16% and 1.7% and with average\nVDR = 0.11.\nGenerally speaking, each of the two kinds of clustering may lone cause significant episodicity of the VDR.

This is probably the result of tatistical fluctuations in our small data sets; with sufficient data, ne can seemingly expect that generally, αCCl <αOCl <αVDR.\nThe tendency of negative correlation between b-value and vent rate, when analyzed in terms of correlation coeffiient between “average magnitude” and event rate time series, resents difficulties of detection: it is seen clearly in only one of he three cases studied (Table 2, Fig. 5). The specially designed tatistical technique of comparing b-values of dense and the parse populations (Table 3) performs much better, showing he presence of correlation at significance levels of 6%, 14% nd 0.03%. These consistent results obtained from indepenent data sets seem to support the idea of correlation between ime histories of common and order clustering. This correlation trongly suggests that common and order clusters are controlled y one and the same factor, causing them to be positively corelated.\n. Discussion\n.1. Fractal episodicity versus alternative models\nThe results listed above suggest that random fractal clustering s present for global volcanic sequences, most clearly as order lustering and bursty VDR, and less prominently as clustering f event rate. Event rate is the most advanced field of study, ith many alternative models proposed; see discussion in the ntroduction. One can treat the observed variations of event rate s a manifestation of a point process with time-dependent event ate (deterministic or random). For the cases when random corelated temporal structure is assumed, also various assumptions an be made. Above, the variogram of the analyzed process was mplicitly assumed to be the power law one; other variogram\nodels are also possible. Alternatively, one might show that ime delays between events are power law or Weibull law disributed. On the whole, there are many modes to analyze the same ata, and their non-trivial temporal structure can be expressed n a number of ways. How unique is the way of data descripion proposed here, and why is the actually employed approach referable?\nThe discrimination between various alternative models can e very difficult, and essentially hopeless in the cases under tudy, with data sets of the size 100–300 events. Thus, there s no hope to obtain a unique model; and to select a particular\nodel for the data sets studied here is, to a substantial degree, a atter of conceptual preference. To justify the actual choice of he model it can be noted that it is based on the very general fracal concept, and has only one adjustable parameter (namely, α). nd in terms of this single parameter (with different values) one an describe not only the event rate model (“1(t)”) but also two ore models—for the volume list (“V(i)”), and for VDR funcion (“V(t)”). It must be understood that nothing like a proof is ossible to substantiate our particular choice. However, successul data description by means of the selected model gives it a ertain support.\nm s o K\netary Interiors 166 (2008) 203–218 215\n.2. Lack of general understanding of fractal/flicker noise henomena\nBefore discussing the possible volcanological meaning of esults, some general preliminary notes should be given. Despite he fact that fractal objects, and particularly fractal temporal ehavior, was a field of very intensive study in the last 20 years, ractically all this study was aimed at description of observaions; only limited and not very fruitful efforts were directed to xplanations of such behavior. The same comment is true with espect to the field of flicker noise. Among attempts to explain hese phenomena, the one seemingly most publicized is the conept of self-organized criticality (SOC) and its incarnation in the opular “sand-pile model” (Bak et al., 1987; Bak, 1997). Unforunately, the initial hope that a mathematical sand pile generates valanches that represent a pulsed flicker noise happened to be remature: spectral representation of the output of a “simple” and-pile is white noise (Milotti, 2002). Of course, in the genral field of SOC and fractals, there are models that do generate icker noise, but these models typically either include special ssumptions that insert some memory in the system, or they find icker noise in the evolution of intrinsic parameters and not in he output of the system. The origin of flicker noise in the output f a natural system continues to be a first-class enigma in modern hysics. And it would be unusually lucky to find a good explaation of presumed fractal clustering/flicker noise behavior in he specific field of volcanic phenomena.\n.3. “Global magma plumbing system”: its existence and ierarchy\nSigurdsson (2000) notes that episodicity of VDR (over geoogical time scale) is a significant fact but do not propose any xplanation. As seen from the previous paragraph, experience rom other fields of science is also not encouraging. Nevertheess, some speculations seem to be warranted. The revealed facts an be discussed in terms of properties of a hypothetical “global agma plumbing system” (GMPS), considering it as a certain aterial supply system. It has an output, in the form of erupions, and it has much less transparent input, that must include ubduction-related fluid injection, and/or the inflow of silicate iquid from deep interior, etc. The assumption suggested by the resented results is that despite the fact that the GMPS consists of any spatially distant and seemingly completely hydraulically solated subsystems, it is capable of synchronizing the operaion of these subsystems. If this is so, there are two very general ossibilities: either the synchronism is a manifestation of a comon “central” controlling factor or a single unifying mechanism; r it is a distributed feature that is related to a certain positive nteraction between volcanic regions/subsystems. Any of these wo variants may result in seemingly “cooperative” (“epidemic”)\node of behavior. Within the fractal conceptual framework, one can expect to\neet a down-scaled version of this global system at the regional cale, to be manifested in a region-wide “cooperative” behavior f volcanic activity of individual volcanic centers. Recently, the amchatka region was shown to be a particularly good example\n2 Plan\no b o t y a P v c h\nc i u e c s a n f F a\nΛ\nw W b w\na n l a t f i l c v p f o\nc h n f n o t s d f r s n\n9 u\nb a o k a a o f t a r w T l f l t c\nt d t\nF t o d\n16 A.A. Gusev / Physics of the Earth and\nf such an influence (Gusev et al., 2003). All three modes of ehavior discussed here for global data, namely, common and rder clustering and episodicity of VDR have been found for he catalog of explosive eruptions on Kamchatka over a 10,000 ears time span. Moreover, for these data, order clustering was gain much more clearly expressed than common clustering. elletier (1999) proposed some mechanisms, acting at “roots of olcanoes”, that might result in space–time clustering of volanism at a local to regional scale. However, these models are ardly applicable for the case of global activity.\nAn alternative statistical model can be imagined that ascribes lustering property of global event sequences to summation of ndependent but intrinsically clustered sequences from individal volcanoes. This explanation is formally correct, e.g., for vent sequence represented as non-homogeneous Poisson proess with random event rate Λ(t). Indeed, assume Λ(t) to be a um of many independent components λi(t), each of them being n independent flicker noise of a certain exponent α. Each such oise can be considered as white noise passed through the filter −α/2. Consider a long time segment T max(1/λi(t)). Let us ourier-transformΛ(t) and λi(t) over T, to result in spectraΛ(f) nd λi(f). Then\n(f ) = ∑ λi(f ) = ∑ fα/2wi(f ) = fα/2 ∑ wi(f )\n= fα/2W(f ) here wi(f ) and W(f) are Fourier transforms of white noises. e see thatΛ(t) is a flicker noise again. Models of this kind can\ne imagined also for order clustering and clustering of VDR, as ell as for correlated behavior of order and common clustering. It must be understood that through the discussed model, an\nttempt is made to explain by coincidences a very clear pheomenon. For example, during only 5 months in 1991, the two argest, VEI = 5+, eruptions of 1960–2002 took place (Pinatubo nd Cerro Leon), separated by a single VEI = 3 event, making he local b-value estimate very low. Attempting to explain this act by random coincidence of maxima in two unobservable ndependent b(t) functions for these distant volcanoes does not ook reasonable. Similarly, to explain global correlation between ommon and order clustering one needs to introduce correlated ariations of λi(t) and bi(t) for each volcano. Although this surrising tendency seems to exist globally, it is highly doubtful or an individual volcano: it means that the larger are eruptions f a volcano, the more frequent they are. On the whole, the\nt s a i\nig. 7.

This however is a matter of opinion. A more sigificant counterargument can be based on the well-established acts that clustering behavior is not merely a temporal pheomenon, it is actually a spatio-temporal one, demonstrated ver spatial scales from tens to several thousands of kilomeers (Condit and Connor, 1996; Pelletier, 1999). The observed pace–time correlation definitely contradicts the idea of indepenent event fluxes that predicts no correlation between time series or non-intersecting sub-areas. Hence, explanations of obtained esults based on random coincidence of intrinsically clustered ingle-volcano sequences are not considered plausible and are ot discussed more.\n.4. “Global magma plumbing system”: what we nderstood about its properties\nNow let us consider some primitive variants of possible ehavior of the GMPS. Imagine a hypothetic GMPS whose verage input rate is a certain continuous, constant or weakly scillating function of time. As for the output of GMPS, we now that it consists of short pulses or eruption events. Assume lso that the total volume of the GMPS is limited. Then, the averge throughput of the system (in the assumed stationary mode f operation) must be weakly varying as well. Now assume that, or some reason, the mean output event rate varies in time (thus, he common clustering is assumed). To fulfill the constraint of constant throughput, during the intervals of maxima of event ate the average event size must be relatively low. Conversely, hen events are infrequent, their size must be relatively large. his is schematically shown on Fig. 7 as Case A. In such a case, arge events do not occur in random order but (1) inevitably orm groups, and (2) these groups coincide with periods of ow event rate. Therefore, order clusters arise automatically in his case, but they arise in antiphase with respect to common lusters.\nFor the alternative ideal model (Fig. 7, Case B), assume that he input to the GMPS (still with limited volume) is in itself a eeply non-stationary, “bursty”, but still continuous time funcion. The near-surface volcanic conduits must let pass through hese bursts, converting them into individual pulses. Generally peaking, these conduits can use the following strategies to pass n arriving burst of material: (1) to increase eruption rate, keepng mean eruption size constant; (2) to increase mean eruption\nlumbing system. (Top) The case of modestly varying input material rate and frequent when they are small, and rarified when they become larger; negative mited volume of the plumbing system proper. In agreement with observations, arises.\nPlan\ns a c j n s\nv t G H “ n v p\ni i f\ns i T u e c\n9\nα o a i m O r p o m 1\n9\nt a v t a m c m t e\nv\nc t V o l C o r a o\n1\ns s o l a b ( o\nb s a a −\na t e e r a c s\nc t p s\nd l s b m\nAcknowledgements\nA.A. Gusev / Physics of the Earth and\nize, keeping eruption rate constant; (3) to combine strategies (1) nd (2). Strategy 3 looks the most probable, making common lusters and order clusters likely to arrive in phase. And this is ust what we observe in volcanic event catalogs: “average magitude” is positively correlated with event rate. This speculation uggests the real GMPS may be fed in an intermittent manner.\nOne can also imagine that the GMPS is of effectively infinite olume, and also is capable to convert the approximately staionary (constant rate) input into episodic, intermittent output. enerally, this reasoning is as acceptable as the previous one, owever, it does not give us anything essentially new: such a big” GMPS can be logically separated into the first, volumious and burst-generating stage, and the second stage of limited olume that is equivalent to the entire GMPS considered in the revious paragraph.\nOf course, this speculation does not take us too far; but two nteresting deductions still follow. First an important conclusion s that the GMPS seems to exist, a conclusion that is very far rom being evident.\nThe second corollary is that the complete system that conists of the GMPS and its inputs as a whole has an inherently ntermittent behavior, and its volume is seems to be unlimited. his formal deduction should not be understood literally: an pper limit of volume of the GMPS must exist (see e.g., Mason t al., 2004). When cluster size approaches this upper limit, the lustering behavior must disappear.\n.5. On long-term memory\nOften, flicker noise behavior, or pink power spectra, with > 0, are considered as long-range dependent or long memry processes (Beran, 1994), because correlation persists for rbitrary long delays. In other words, clusters of any (includng very long) duration are present. (Often, processes with long\nemory are characterized by the Hurst parameter H = (1 +α)/2.) ver the time scales analyzed here, of 1–500 years, the above esults indeed can be interpreted in this way: global volcanic rocesses do have long memory. Combining the results with ther published data, this conclusion can be generalized for uch longer time scales (e.g., up 108 years following Pelletier, 999).\n.6. Possible applications\nThe obtained results are highly significant for understanding he impact of volcanism on climate. The simplest approach in nalyzing this impact is to assume that individual eruptions of ariable size arrive as a Poissonian sequence, or maybe as a clusered sequence with a finite, limited correlation time. Taking into ccount fractal clustering, with long memory, can significantly odify the estimates. An important point is that the easily pereptible phenomenon of common clustering (clustering of dates) ay be of less relevance to climatic change than order clusering (clustering of sizes) that seems to be more prominently xpressed.\nThe phenomenon of fractal clustering is significant also for olcanic hazard assessment. Assume that for a certain volcanic\nM n\netary Interiors 166 (2008) 203–218 217\nenter, fractal clustering behavior can be expected. On a qualitaive level, this assumption means that the observed event rate or DR, even when it is based on apparently sufficient volume f data (statistics of events, etc.), cannot be safely extrapoated to future and used as a reliable estimate for future activity. hanges of the current activity level, both to significantly lower r to significantly higher levels, must always be considered as ealistic alternative scenarios. With some efforts, quantitative pproaches for such “non-stationary” scenarios can be develped.\n0. Conclusions\nFrom three independent approximately homogeneous data ets, three kinds of volcanic eruption time sequences were contructed: (1) of events as unit-mass points on the time axis, (2) f event volume versus sequential number in the time-ordered ist, and (3) of variable size events as massive points on the time xis. Sequences of all tree kinds show indications of clustering ehavior, denoted in these three cases as (1) common clustering, 2) order clustering and (3) clustering of volcanic discharge rate, r VDR.\nFor two data sets out of three, the clustering behavior can e considered to be self-similar (fractal). Spectral analysis has hown that sequences from these two data sets can be considered s flicker noises. For the three listed kinds of sequences, the verage values of power spectral exponent are equal to −0.09, 0.19 and −0.11, respectively. The hypothesis of positive correlation in time for common nd order clustering was checked by testing negative correlaion between time series of event rate and of b-value, or the xponent in the power law for size–frequency distribution of ruptions. Two techniques of statistical analysis of this corelation were applied. The first of them was intuitively more ttractive but less efficient as a statistical tool; another showed lear manifestations of the named correlation in all three data ets analyzed.\nComparing the present work with earlier results, one can onclude that order clustering, episodic/intermittent VDR, and, o a less degree, common clustering may be characteristic roperties of volcanic process, both on global and regional cales.\nThe obtained results give a reasonable description of data, but o not give clear clues regarding causes of the revealed pecuiarities. One relatively certain conclusion, vague in details but till quite radical, is that to provide the revealed coordinated ehavior of volcanic time series over entire Earth, some global echanism or mechanisms must exist.\nI am grateful to Vera Ponomareva, David Pyle and Steve cNutt for valuable criticism and many suggestions that sig-\nificantly improved the manuscript.\n2 Plan\nR\nA\nA\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\nC\nD\nD\nD\nG\nG\nG\nG\nH\nH\nJ\nJ\nK\nM\nM\nM\nM\nM\nO\nP\nP\nP\nR\nR R\nS\nS\nS\nS\nT\n18 A.A.

Volcanoes of the World. . . ttp://www.volcano.si.edu/gvp/world/], and the “ice core volcanic index” (IVI) sequence, based on the volcanic eruption record as acid layers n big glaciers (Robock, A., Free, M.P., 1996.

Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 533–546). To perform the statistical nalysis in a meaningful way, data subsets were extracted from the original data, with size thresholds and time intervals carefully selected to make hese subsets nearly homogeneous. The analysis has revealed, generally, the tendency to clustering, manifested in the following three forms: (1) he event rate is not uniform in time: event dates form active episodes (“common” clusters). (2) In the time-ordered, sequential list of sizes of ruptions, larger events do not appear purely randomly; instead, they form tight groups (“order clusters”). (3) The volcanic products discharge rate s significantly non-uniform, and shows episodic (intermittent or bursty) behavior. It was also found that for the volcanic sequences analyzed, the wo types of clustering behavior mentioned in (1) and (2) are positively correlated: larger events are concentrated at the periods of higher event ate. Such a relationship is best demonstrated by the fact that there is clear negative correlation between the following two time series: (1) of the xponent b of the power law size–frequency distribution (the analog of b-value of the Gutenberg–Richter law for earthquakes) and (2) of the current vent rate. Power spectra of the analyzed sequences mostly follow power laws, with negative exponent β. Thus, these sequences can be qualified as ulse flicker noises. In other words, they are fractal sequences with correlation dimension Dc =β + 1 < 1, and both their clustering and episodicity re of self-similar character. The revealed peculiarities of the global volcanic sequence suggest that some global-scale mechanism exists that is esponsible for their origin. They are also or primary importance for understanding the impact of volcanism on climate. 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
