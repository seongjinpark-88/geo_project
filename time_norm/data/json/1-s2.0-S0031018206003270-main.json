    "text": "New outcrops of Late Neogene sedimentary deposits discovered on James Ross and Vega islands, northern Antarctic Peninsula, are fossiliferous and contain mainly fragmented pectinids amongst other as yet unstudied biota. The sedimentary deposits are interbedded with fresh volcanic units, thus providing the unusual opportunity to investigate the ages of the sedimentary rocks using two independent isotopic systems (40Ar/39Ar and 87Sr/86Sr). The fossils record past periods of warmer conditions (interglacials) like today. However, our results demonstrate unequivocally that some of the macrofossils present in the sedimentary rocks are reworked and the host sediments are, in these cases, much younger than the ages of their included fossils would suggest. Nevertheless, the Sr ages date these records of interglacial events in the region independently of the age of the strata in which they occur. Conversely, the volcanic rocks show abundant field evidences that they are coeval with the underlying sedimentary deposits, and hence their Ar ages reliably date the timing of their deposition. Our results indicate that at least three generally warmer periods are represented in the James Ross Island region: at 6.5–5.9, 5.03–4.22 and<0.88 Ma, although our data do not have the resolution for identifying Milankovitch-scale cyclicity. However, the Early Pliocene warm period is particularly well represented and the James Ross Island data may well be capturing a higher proportion of the longer-lasting interglacials that characterised that period. We also present evidence for an interglacial in the Late Pliocene (at 2.54+0.86/− 0.36 Ma). Our data suggest that both Antarctic Peninsula and the East Antarctic ice sheets responded in a similar way to long-term regional shifts in climate, but the Antarctic Peninsula is more sensitive to short-term warming, as occurs today. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The Antarctic Peninsula also receives the highest precipitation in Antarctica, typically three to four times that of any other\npart of the continent (van Lipzig et al., 2004). Because of the combination of topography and climate, the APIS is particularly sensitive to climate change (Smellie et al., 2006). Measured temperatures have risen rapidly during the 20th century (Vaughan et al., 2001) and the region is showing signs of change, particularly the disintegration of flanking ice shelves and accelerated glacier flow (e.g. Vaughan andDoake, 1996; Cooper, 1997; DeAngelis and Skvarca, 2003). The APIS is therefore likely to have been a sensitive indicator of former climatic instability and to have changed size during past warmer periods. The Neogene period includes the so-called Warm Pliocene, when global temperatures may have been several degrees C higher than today (Haywood and Valdes, 2004). Some authors have speculated that the Antarctic Ice Sheet may have undergone a spectacular decay, possibly by as much as 60% (e.g. Denton et al., 1991;Miller andMabin, 1998). With such a large reduction in ice sheet volume, it is highly likely that the APIS would have been substantially modified, particularly in relatively low-latitude, low-elevation peripheral areas such as northern Antarctic Peninsula where the impact would have been strongest.\nOur purpose here is to present new palaeoenvironmental information for interglacial periods derived from volcanic and sedimentary formations on James Ross Island, situated in northern Antarctic Peninsula. The particular importance of the James Ross Island succession lies in the unique information it contains on the history of the northernmost part of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Individually, the different stratigraphical units give us snapshots of the environmental conditions. The occurrence of coeval interbedded volcanic and fossiliferous sedimentary rocks in the field area also presents the uncommon opportunity for determining the ages of the sedimentary outcrops by two independent isotopic dating methods. Thus, we present a significantly updated chronology of events based on 87Sr/86Sr determinations on new fossil material and 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained on the fresh volcanic rocks."

    "text": "Our overall knowledge of Late Neogene ice sheet dynamics is relatively poor, but ODP Leg 178, situated offshore of the west coast of Graham Land, was drilled to understand the past 10 m.y. of the glacial history of the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). The most proximal sediments recovered, on the continental shelf, suffered from extremely poor core recovery and a very patchy low age-resolution record, whereas there was much better recovery of betterdated, distal, fine-grained, upper continental rise sedi-\nments. The record of biogenic opal accumulation showed a moderately warm Late Miocene, a warm Early Pliocene (5–3 Ma) and cooling from Late Pliocene time to present (Hillenbrand and Futterer, 2002). From the distribution of ice-rafted detritus (IRD) and interpretation of variations in clay mineral assemblages, an APIS may have existed for the entire period sampled by drilling (ca. 9 Ma), with no clear evidence for prolonged deglaciation, even during the warm Early Pliocene (Hillenbrand and Ehrmann, 2002; Pudsey, 2002). Regular grounding line migration to the shelf edge probably occurred during glacials, but during interglacials the grounding line retreated to close inshore. IRD variations in sediments younger than 3.1 Ma show a well-defined 40 to 100 ka glacial/interglacial cyclicity (Cowan, 2001) and, more speculatively, similar cyclicity may also have occurred back to the Late Miocene (LauerLeredde et al., 2002).\nSeveral Late Neogene outcrops are present onshore (Fig. 1). They are commonly small and widely separated, and most contain a relatively coarse-resolution record. They comprise: (1) glaciomarine strata of ill-defined Neogene age in the Seal Islands (South Shetland Islands; Trouw et al., 1991); (2) Pleistocene glaciovolcanic rocks on Brabant and Anvers islands (Smellie et al., 2006); (3) glaciovolcanic rocks in Alexander Island and Seal Nunataks (mainly Pliocene and Pleistocene, respectively; Smellie et al., 1993; Smellie and Hole, 1997; Smellie, 1999); and (4) Late Miocene and younger volcanic and interbedded sedimentary rocks in the James Ross Island region (James Ross Island Volcanic Group (JRIVG); e.g. Nelson, 1975; Pirrie et al., 1997; Jonkers et al., 2002). In contrast to the other terrestrial outcrops, the JRIVG is geographically extensive and accessible. It is highly amenable to detailed stratigraphical studies, and it is the subject of this paper. The volcanic units in the James Ross area are relatively well known (Nelson, 1975; Smellie, 1999, 2006), but fewer than 10 sedimentary outcrops have been described (Bibby, 1966; Nelson, 1975; Pirrie et al., 1997, Jonkers, 1998; Jonkers et al., 2002; GaŸdzicki et al., 2004; Pirrie et al., press; Hambrey and Smellie, in press). The sedimentary strata contain a sparse palynology and a few have Neogene macrofossils. Recently, however, very manymore outcrops have been discovered (e.g. Hambrey and Smellie, in press), several of which are fossiliferous (e.g. Pirrie et al., in press)."

    "text": "Ice is not normally preserved in the pre-Quaternary geological record, and multiple criteria are used in the\nrecognition of glacial conditions from examination of terrestrial rock successions (e.g. Hambrey, 1994; Barrett, 1996; Benn and Evans, 1998). They include: a general history of glaciation(s) known or inferred from offshore investigations in the same region (e.g. ODP drilling); absence of fossils in sedimentary rocks, possibly signifying non-marine or severe climatic conditions; presence of glacial sedimentary deposits such as diamicts (tillites), striated clasts, dropstones, ice-wedge casts, and striated and ice-moulded surfaces. It is less well appreciated that volcanoes that interacted with a glacial cover also retain palaeoenvironmental information, and criteria indicative of glacial conditions coeval with eruption have been described by Smellie (2000, 2006) (see also Lescinsky and Fink, 2000). They\ninclude: lithofacies dominated by products of subaqueous volcanism such as pillow lavas, tephra mainly emplaced as turbidites and abundant hyaloclastites; lavafed deltas emplaced in glacial meltwater lakes and associated evidence for a dynamic lake surface elevation caused by the local glacier hydraulics (see Section 5.1 below); absence of a palaeotopography that might have confined the meltwater lake, which was therefore confined by ice; absence of strongly abraded clasts or erosion surfaces characteristic of high-energy shallow marine or river environments (volcano-induced meltwater lakes are relatively protected, low-energy depocentres); presence of distinctive ice-contact features (mainly joint patterns) in lavas indicative of rapid cooling by (melt)water or ice; and tuff cones with tephra beds back-\ntilted toward source, caused by banking against former ice cliffs now removed by melting.\nConversely, non-glacial conditions can be inferred for volcanic and/or sedimentary successions by an absence of these features. In addition, subaqueously deposited tephra formed during tuff cone eruptions in a marine or nonglacial lake environment will be expected to extend laterally much further from the vent than in a glacial meltwater lake, because of the absence of the confining effects of the enclosing ice walls (e.g. Werner and Schmincke, 1999 and see Section 5.2 below). Ice confinement is also expected to cause the volcanic edifices to have higher aspect ratios (i.e. ratio of edifice height to width) than those erupted in non-glacial settings (Smellie, in press), although this distinction is not likely to be easily judged for other than pristine Quaternary edifices."

    "heading": "4. Late Neogene sedimentary outcrops on James",
    "text": "Ross Island\nFig. 2 shows the distribution of all known exposures of Late Neogene sedimentary rocks in the JRIVG. Most were discovered since 2001. The sedimentary deposits are dominated by diamict and conglomerate with minor sandstone. They were first described by Bibby (1966) and Nelson (1975). MRA Thomson discovered several additional outcrops, mainly around Rum Cove, and he made the first important interpretation that they were a glacial association (British Antarctic Survey, 1983). Sykes (1989) described additional localities, but the only sedimentological discussions are by Pirrie et al. (1997, Hamilton and Rabot Points), Jonkers (1998, Cockburn Island) and Jonkers et al. (2002, Fjordo Belén and Cape Gage). Summary information based on all the outcrops is presented here for the first time.\nTwo formations are defined: the glacial Hobbs Glacier Formation, formed mainly of diamict (Pirrie et al., 1997), and the sandstone-conglomerate-dominated interglacial Cockburn Island Formation (Jonkers, 1998). The Hobbs Glacier Formation is divided into two members. The upper member consists of subaqueously deposited volcanic tuffs composed mainly of glass fragments, for which a periglacial, epiclastic delta front setting was inferred (marine or non-marine), away from a direct glacial influence. Our fieldwork at Hamilton Point and elsewhere on James Ross Island indicates that deposits that could be ascribed to the upper member are very uncommon. They are mainly delta bottomset beds, composed of far-travelled relatively fine-grained glassy detritus sourced in the breccia foresets of the overlying lava-fed deltas. As such, they are genetically unrelated to the underlying diamict-dominated lower member. The\ntuffs are also apparently unfossiliferous and do not inform the debate about glacial or interglacial conditions. They are excluded from further discussion here.\nThe sedimentary outcrops are discontinuous. About half of the deposits are just 1 to a few metres thick, with almost all of the remainder >10 m; a few exceed 20 m in thickness, and two reach 150 m. They are dominated by silt-rich diamictite or less often diamicton, but some deposits include sandy conglomerate (Fig. 3A). The general term diamict is used here to describe both diamictite and diamicton (after Hambrey, 1994). Many diamicts look massive in outcrop, but crude bedding is not uncommon and a few beds are faintly planar stratified and include thin sandy lenses (Fig. 3B). The most spectacular outcrops are 64–150 m thick and mainly comprise interbedded sandy conglomerate and silty diamict. The beds in those outcrops have comparatively steep homoclinal dips and they are also draped by diamict (Fig. 3C). They have a whaleback morphology in dip and strike sections and extend a few to several hundred metres laterally. A small number of outcrops consist of well-stratified conglomerate, sandstone and diamict (Fig. 3D; Jonkers, 1998; Jonkers et al., 2002 and unpublished information of the authors).\nClasts are mainly abraded (subrounded-subangular), facetting is common, and striated clasts are usually present but rare. JRIVG lavas and less common hyaloclastite breccia dominate the pebble to boulder population; gravel-size clasts are mainly volcanic glass. Non-volcanic clasts are present in most of the outcrops (Fig. 3A) but they typically form only about 1% of the clasts. They include (in decreasing order of abundance): green and dark grey quartz-veined phyllites and indurated quartzose sandstones (derived from the metasedimentary Trinity Peninsula Group; cf. Aitkenhead, 1975), various granitoids (granodiorite (some foliated), granite, alkali granite, diorite, gabbro; Antarctic Peninsula batholith; cf. Leat et al., 1995), felsitic dacite(?) porphyries and altered intermediate(?) lavas (Antarctic Peninsula Volcanic Group; cf. Hamer, 1982), strongly indurated pebble conglomerates (Botany Bay Group?; cf. Farquharson, 1984), and relatively friable green sandstones and siltstones (James Ross Island Cretaceous strata; cf. Bibby, 1966; Crame et al., 1991; Pirrie et al., 1991). Many of these clast types also occur as strikingly well rounded pebbles, which are probably recycled from Cretaceous polymict conglomerates that crop out on James Ross Island. Pectinids, rare clam fragments, and clast-encrusting tubeworms and bryozoans are present and locally abundant at several localities but the fossil content of most of the outcrops has not yet been subjected to a systematic study.\nWhere the diamicts overlie Cretaceous “basement”, a sizeable pre-volcanic relief up to several tens of metres is evident. The Cretaceous bedrock is also rarely brecciated within 1–2 dm of the contact. For sedimentary units within the volcanic succession, the lower contacts are typically sharp and uneven on a centimetre to metre\nscale, and underlying lava surfaces are striated. By contrast, overlying lava is sometimes injected down into the diamict. Hyaloclastite breccia is also commonly loaded into diamict, and conspicuous squeeze-up structures of diamict are commonly back-injected up into the hyaloclastite (Hambrey and Smellie, in press).\nDiamict and hyaloclastite are also commonly pervasively intermixed in the basal few metres of the overlying hyaloclastite. Closely spaced, shallow-dipping fissile joints, some of which cut across indurated rock clasts are rarely present in diamict.\nThe presence of facetted and striated clasts indicates a glacial environment, as does the association with striated and ice-moulded surfaces. The common occurrence of soft-sediment deformation comprising diamict backinjecting volcanic breccia, lava and breccia intruding diamict, and diamict and volcanic breccia intimately\nmixed, indicates that most of the sedimentary and volcanic units were contemporaneous. The ubiquitous abrasion of the clasts is characteristic of glacier bedload rather than supraglacial debris. The massive-looking diamicts are probably basal tills but the common occurrence of crudely bedded diamicts suggests emplacement as mass flows, possibly in a glaciomarine environment (cf. Pirrie et al., 1997; but see later). The local brecciation of Cretaceous bedrock and presence of fissile jointing in some diamict suggest glaciotectonism and formation as local lodgement till. Conglomeratic beds\nand sandy lenses suggest abundant flowing water, and the association with tills and glacially striated surfaces suggests wet-based glaciations (i.e. glacier not frozen to bed). The biofacies indicate a marine environment (Pirrie et al., 1997; Jonkers, 1998; Jonkers et al., 2002) but in most outcrops the occurrence of the fossils as abraded and intensely fragmented clasts in diamict and also in the better stratified units indicates reworking rather than a biocoenosis, and the possibility of mixing together fossils of different ages needs to be considered. The rock fragments were overwhelmingly derived from erosion of lava-fed delta units in the JRIVG, whilst the exotic clasts are of northern Antarctic Peninsula provenance (cf. Pirrie et al., 1997). Hambrey and Smellie (in press) also noted that some diamicts only contain clasts with a local (i.e. James Ross Island) provenance, and suggested that they are related to glaciation from a local ice cap sourced on the volcano itself.\nInterpretation of five exposures of the same basal stratum in the Hamilton Point–Rabot Point area suggested a glaciomarine setting close to the grounding line of a floating ice shelf or grounded tidewater glacier (Pirrie et al., 1997; Hambrey and Smellie, in press). A similar ice-proximal glaciomarine environment was also suggested for fossiliferous outcrops at Fjordo Belén and Cape Gage (Jonkers et al., 2002). Conversely, the sandstone-conglomerate succession at Cockburn Island, which is also fossiliferous, was ascribed to an interglacial, ice-free, fully marine setting (Jonkers, 1998; Jonkers and Kelley, 1998). Additional features of the newly discovered sedimentary outcrops include the thick moundy deposits of multi-storey conglomerate, diamict and minor sandstone, which resemble till deltas or subaqueous morainic banks (cf. Hambrey, 1994; Benn and Evans, 1998), and a boulder pavement on Vega Island described by Hambrey and Smellie (in press). The latter is evidence for sliding at the base of a glacier. The rare occurrences of sheared and jointed diamictite are also likely to be lodgement deposits formed in the basal sliding zone. We further suggest that an ice-contact glacial setting is likely for most of the deposits formed solely of a single unit of massive diamict. The diamict probably represents glacier bedload material and they form the majority of the outcrops.\nSome caveats have to be placed on these interpretations. Although many of the deposits resemble glaciomarine lithofacies (i.e. crudely bedded diamict and the less common interstratified diamict, sandy conglomerate and sandstone, some with marine biofacies), the volcanodriven mode of exhumation of the glacial beds on James Ross Island is unusual and is likely to have strongly influenced the method of deposition. During rapid melt-\nback of an ice sheet ahead of advancing lava-fed deltas, the glacier bedload may be released and redeposited from debris flows (Hambrey and Smellie, in press). Thus, the presence of crudely bedded diamicts, sandstones and conglomerates need not be an indication of glaciomarine conditions, notwithstanding the presence of a marine biofacies. From the fragmented and abraded nature ofmost of the fossils, they probably reflect glacial scouring and reworking of pre-existing fossiliferous glaciomarine sediments. Moreover, during eruptions in wet-based ice sheets, basal meltwater discharge is extensive (e.g. Gudmundsson et al., 1997; Smellie, 2006) and will also cause reworking of basal debris and subglacial deposition of stratified fluvial gravels and sands ahead of any advancing volcanic deltas (Smellie, 2001). Interpretation of the depositional environment of the James Ross Island sedimentary outcrops is at an early stage. It will clearly require considerable care and consideration in context."

    "heading": "5.1. Lava-fed deltas",
    "text": "The JRIVG is dominated by a distinctive genetic association of flat-lying, subaerial, compound pahoehoe lavas and steep-dipping, homoclinal, coarse-grained hyaloclastite breccias, which together comprise multiple superimposed lava-fed deltas (Nelson, 1975; Smellie, 1999, 2006). The individual lava-fed deltas are typically about 200–250 m thick, rarely ranging up to 600 m. Lavas and breccias in each delta unit are separated by a planar surface called a passage zone, which represents a fossil water level (i.e. sea level or lake surface) coeval with the eruption (Jones, 1969). In most examples in the James Ross Island region, the passage zones have highly variable elevations in each of the deltas. Faulting and tectonic effects, other than diffuse regional uplift, are absent and the variable passage zone elevations reflect water levels that changed during each effusive episode. By contrast, the main delta at Lachman Crags (northern Ulu Peninsula; Fig. 2) has a passage zone that is horizontal over a distance of 9 km (the outcrop extent).\nMost of the lava-fed deltas show conspicuous unambiguous evidence for effusion in a glacial (ice sheet) setting. For example, variable passage zone elevations within a single delta are diagnostic of emplacement in an ice sheet since sea or (non-glacial) lake levels are unlikely to vary by tens of metres, up as well as down, during an effusive eruption (Smellie, 2006). Conversely, during eruptions in an ice sheet, the surface elevation of any ponded meltwater will vary because meltwater discharge is intrinsically unstable.\nThis is a consequence of (1) variable dimensions of subglacial meltwater drainage tunnels caused by intermittent blockages and thermal erosion affecting water flow, and (2) rapid downcutting of ice spillways in an overflowing system (Smellie, 2006). The elevation of the resultant meltwater-related passage zone is thus a dynamic feature and it is unlikely to remain horizontal for several km of distance. By converse reasoning, a laterally extensive horizontal passage zone in a lava-fed delta represents a highly stable water surface that can probably only form in a marine environment (i.e. it represents the coeval sea level). On the basis of its laterally extensive horizontal passage zone, the Lachman Crags delta is the only marine-emplaced delta identified in the JRIVG so far. In the present context, a marine setting corresponds to a relatively warm period of reduced-ice conditions, i.e. an interglacial.\nOur isotopic dating of the numerous glacially emplaced lava-fed deltas is still incomplete and the chronology of the glacial periods will be presented elsewhere. Our focus here is on describing the evidence for the interglacial periods and establishing their chronology. However, the deltas provide an age for the deposition of their underlying fossiliferous sedimentary units. Several deltas have been dated and their ages are discussed in Section 7."

    "heading": "5.2. Tuff cone successions",
    "text": "Numerous tuff cone deposits are also present in the JRIVG but published information is scarce. The largest edifice is at Terrapin Hill, which is about 610 m high and up to 6 km in diameter. The outcrops are dominated by pale-coloured fine lapillistones and lapilli tuffs formed of variably vesicular cuspate to blocky glass fragments that are pervasively palagonite altered.Most of the deposits are crudely planar stratified, with ill-defined beds a few cm or dm thick containing uncommon dispersed blocks to 10 cm, which also sometimes occur as short blocky lenses. Other, thinner sections (few metres to 10 or 20 m thick) are formed of even planar beds that are laterally continuous on an exposure scale (usually few tens of metres). In these, a thin layer of dark brown fine-tuff mudrock often caps the individual beds. Beds are typically 5–25 cm thick, ranging to 35 cm, and many show planar stratification. Most are normally graded, passing up into planar laminated tuff or, less commonly, ripple cross lamination; the preservation of fine details of sedimentary structures in these rocks is often extremely good (e.g. Pirrie and Sykes, 1987). Scattered outsize blocks (10– 20 cm in diameter) are present within the stratification (i.e. lacking impact structures). Bed bases in the tuffs are typically sharp and some beds are amalgamated. By\ncontrast, bed surfaces are less well defined for the coarser units, but some show narrow basal reverse grading. Slump sheets and load structures are present in many of the sections, particularly those with interbedded mudrocks, and the Bibby Point tuff cone outcrop shows spectacular syn-sedimentary deformation (meso-scale folding, rip-up clasts and large collapse blocks). Small-scale (erosional) and larger broad shallow channels (likely slump-scars) are common in most outcrops.\nThe variable vesicularity, grain shapes and alteration of the abundant glass fragments are characteristic of magma interaction with surface or groundwater and indicate that the rocks formed during explosive phreatomagmatic eruptions (cf. White, 1991; Werner and Schmincke, 1999; Smellie, 2001). The absence of basement-derived clasts indicates that the explosions occurred at a high structural level, essentially in the upper vent area. This precludes interaction with groundwater and is typical for volcanoes of Surtseyan type, in which the vents were flooded either by lake water (glacial or non-glacial) or the sea (Kokelaar, 1983). The sedimentary structures of the tuffs indicate rapid deposition from sediment gravity flows, mainly as proximal sandy turbidites (Ta, Tab, Tbc, Ta–c), many of which are amalgamated. Moreover, the distal parts of some outcrops consist of thin-bedded fine sand–mud– grade couplets in spectacular, continuous sequences with no evidence for a wave influence. The finer beds also locally show abundant evidence for de-watering (Pirrie and Sykes, 1987).\nIn many cases, the eruptive environment (glacial or marine) of the tuff cones is uncertain. However, a marine setting can be inferred for several, as follows:\n1. Asterozoan impressions indicative of marine conditions are preserved in a tuff cone succession at Patalamon Mesa, west of Hidden Lake (Bibby, 1966; Williams et al., 2006). 2. The TerrapinHill tuff cone is very young (<880 ka; see below) and well preserved. It has flanks that slope at just 8°, approximately the same as bedding, signifying that the edifice is little modified by erosion. Such lowgradient flanks are probably indicative of unconfined marine or (non-glacial) lake settings since tuff cones erupted in a confined glacial vault/lake are likely to be relatively tall compared with those formed in nonglacial lakes. This is because of a combination of effects, including (1) buttressing of tephra by the confining ice walls (illustrated by Smellie, 2000, Fig. 5), (2) rapid early diagenesis and lithification of the warm wet tephra pile, which may be buffered at several tens of degrees C for a substantial period\n(Gudmundsson et al., 2004), and (3) glacial erosion and oversteepening of the indurated volcano flanks once activity has ceased (Smellie, in press). Similar reasoning can be applied to the smaller tuff cone at Cape Gage. There, the tephra beds dip at <8° to horizontal radially away from thewell-preserved crater and crop out continuously for at least 1.5 m, with no evidence for ice confinement. 3. Fine-grained turbidite-dominated outliers of the Terrapin Hill centre extend well beyond the tuff cone edifice, 4.5 km to the NNE and southeast of the summit. Sediments in the southeast outlier also occur on the far side of a broad valley and beyond a prominent topographical barrier (Förster Cliffs) where they are only likely to have been deposited as airfall ash settling through a water column and transforming to vertical density currents (Manville and Wilson, 2004). Those flows could not have reached such a\ndistal location had the topography been covered by an ice sheet during eruptions (Fig. 4). 4. At least three large overlapping and probably coeruptive centres are present between San FernandoHill and Seacatch Nunataks. Distal beds derived from one of those centres intervene between lava-fed deltas at StickleRidge, at least 4 kmdistant from the nearest tuff cone outcrop (at Seacatch Nunataks). By similar reasoning to that used for Terrapin Hill, an unconfined marine or non-glacial lake setting is inferred for the San Fernando–Seacatch Nunataks tuff cone deposits (cf. Werner and Schmincke, 1999). A marine setting is preferred as there is no evidence for a former topography that would have confined a non-glacial lake (cf. Smellie, 2000). This is further supported by field mapping and 40Ar/39Ar dating (see later), which suggest that these tuff cones occur at the same stratigraphical position as the Patalamon Mesa tuff\ng possible eruptive environments <880 ka ago. In (A), an ice sheet is etched. The thermal energy would have been focused in the central parts e tephra pile would likely have prevented the melting of a significantly e impinged on the growth of the edifice by buttressing effects of the ice ich is not the case. In (B), a marine setting is shown and is our favoured s at a higher elevation than the nearest tuff cone strata and is situated itially by airfall of ash into the sea followed by suspension settling and/ water (see inset).\ncone that contains asterozoan fossils (Williams et al., 2006)."

    "text": "Published strontium isotope results for Late Neogene sedimentary outcrops on James Ross and Cockburn islands are summarized in Table 1. The uncertainties on derived numerical ages are high because 87Sr/86Sr ratios in seawater do not change much between 3 and 5 Ma (McArthur and Howarth, 2004). Published ages range from 9.9±0.97 to 1.9+0.6/− 0.4 Ma. They have been interpreted as depositional ages obtained on in situ or near in situ faunas. All but one of the ages was obtained on the large pectinid bivalve Austrochlamys (formerly Zygochlamys) anderssoni, which was postulated to have lived in waters warmer than are found in the James Ross Island region today (Jonkers, 1998). It is thus generally considered to be representative of ice-poor interludes when the climate was warmer and, as a consequence, the ages have usually been interpreted to date interglacial periods. However, Jonkers et al. (2002) noted the occurrence of A. anderssoni in massive diamict, interpreted as a glaciomarine unit, and they also drew attention to the striking similarities in biofacies between glacial and interglacial deposits on James Ross Island, suggesting that A. anderssoni thrived in a wide range of conditions, including those of glacial periods. Further work is required to define the reliability of climatic influence on the distribution of A. anderssoni. The new information we present here is suggestive, but no more, that A. anderssoni was indeed indicative of warmer climates than found today in the Antarctic Peninsula, and that it grew locally only during ice-poor periods of marine inundation, i.e. interglacials. We further propose that many of the fossils were simply reworked by glaciers advancing during subsequent glacials. Finally, the interpretation of some of the fossiliferous diamicts as\nglaciomarine deposits may require further substantiation because of the unusual relationship to lava-fed delta emplacement and consequences for the depositional characteristics of those sediments (see above).\nThe field relations of the youngest unit dated (said to be near sea level at Fjordo Belén) are unpublished but the published age (Jonkers et al., 2002) conflicts with new 40Ar/39Ar and 87Sr/86Sr data from the same locality (see below). Dating the Cockburn Island Formation has also proven to be controversial (Jonkers and Kelley, 1998; McArthur et al., in press). A 40Ar/39Ar age of 4.7–4.9 Ma (±0.2–0.4 Ma) was obtained on two lavas from the upper of the two underlying volcanic units on the island, whilst two samples from the lower lava unit gave highly disturbed spectra; one of the latter yielded a very poorly defined age of 2.9±0.4 Ma, but a total gas age of 4.7 Ma. The younger age was rejected by Jonkers and Kelley (op. cit.) on stratigraphical grounds, as were K–Ar isotopic ages of 3.65±0.3 and 2.781±0.032Ma published byWeb and Andreasen (1986) and Lawver et al. (1995). Conversely, Sr isotopic dating of A. anderssoni from the Cockburn Island Formation yielded an age of 4.7+0.6/ − 1.2 Ma (Dingle et al., 1997), which is indistinguishable from the preferred age of the underlying lavas, despite the presence of an intervening angular erosional unconformity (cf. Jonkers, 1998). This Sr age has recently been revised to 4.66–0.24/+0.17 Ma on the basis of 28 measurements on 8 different specimens (McArthur et al., in press). A palaeontological age of 2.8–2.0 Ma was interpreted from diatoms present in the Cockburn Island Formation (Harwood, 1986), whereas a slightly older age (3– 2.8 Ma) was favoured based mainly on a recalibration of the diatom age ranges (Jonkers and Kelley, 1998; see discussion by McArthur et al., in press)."

Reported 40Ar/39Ar ages were calculated either by the weighted mean of 4 to 8 individual heating analyses or by the inverse isochron method. For many samples, the spectrum weighted mean age is statistically equivalent to the inverse isochron age. In these cases, the weighted mean age is reported. For some samples, the age spectrum is disturbed to an extent where a flat portion (i.e. weighted mean) is not definable or the inverse isochron results are indicative of small amounts of excess argon contamination. In these cases, the inverse isochron age is reported. The overall quality of results from this study varied widely, on the basis of the shape\nof the age spectrum and the precision of the weightedmean age for each step-heating analysis. This is reflected here in a letter notation system (Table 3), as follows (see also Fig. 5):\n(i) Group A: flat spectra, errors <0.1 Ma. These weighted-mean ages are considered most accurate and precise.\n(ii) Group B: flat spectra, errors >0.1 Ma. The weighted-mean ages are considered accurate although less precise than in group A.\n(iii) Group C: moderately disturbed spectra. These weighted-mean ages may be somewhat inaccurate.\n(iv) Group D: low precision spectra with imprecise weighted-mean ages.\n(v) Group E: highly disturbed spectra, for which no weighted-mean ages were calculated. Only one sample yielded such a highly disturbed spectrum. It is excluded from the results in Table 3.\nSpecimens were selected mainly from the coarsegrained subaerial caprocks of lava-fed deltas overlying the fossiliferous sedimentary units. Thus, they provide minimum ages for the latter. The LachmanCrags (marine) delta is dated as 5.04±0.04Ma (Table 3, Fig. 5). The new 40Ar/39Ar isotopic ages also show that, with possibly one\nexception, lavas overlying fossiliferous sedimentary deposits are significantly younger than the Sr isotopic ages obtained on shelly fossils (cf. Tables 2 and 3; Fig. 6). The age disparity varies from 2.03 to 4.3 m.y. Most of the sedimentary units show mingled and/or loaded contacts with overlying breccias, suggesting that the volcanic and sedimentary rocks were contemporary. Therefore, the dated fossils were reworked, and the Ar ages obtained on the volcanic rocks are our best estimates for the depositional ages of the sedimentary beds. There is only one apparent exception, the sedimentary deposit at southwest Croft Bay, which is at least 2.54 Ma, based on 87Sr/86Sr isotopic dating of its shelly fossils (Table 2,\nutcrops in the James Ross Island region.

The deposit is overlain by at least three superimposed deltas that extend north toward Dreadnought Point, each with its subaerial lava caprock removed by erosion but with steep-dipping homoclinal delta foreset beds well preserved. The depositional environment of these delta remnants is unknown. Only samples of fine-grained pillow lava were available from those deltas and they gave conflicting, low-quality results; similar problems with dating lava pillows in hyaloclastite were also experienced elsewhere in the JRIVG during this study (unpublished information of the authors). The dated lava pillows gave two distinctive ages: 5.65–5.82 and 2.39–2.82 Ma, each with large uncertainties. Since the Sr isotopic age on underlying shell material yielded an age of 2.54+0.86/− 0.36 Ma, we suggest that a Late Pliocene age is the best that can be inferred both for the deposit and for the deltas. Perhaps significantly, the Croft Bay sedimentary deposit includes numerous large unfragmented specimens of Austrochlamys sp., which contrasts with the highly fragmented shells characteristic of most of the other outcrops. Jonkers (1998) used a similar argument when interpreting the Cockburn Island Formation biota as in situ.\nThe new 40Ar/39Ar ages also successfully date the age of marine-erupted tuff cones in the JRIVG (Table 3). The tuff cone at Terrapin Hill is a very young centre. The error on its age is high, but it formed at less than 880 ka (mid-Pleistocene; Fig. 5). The new ages also confirm the stratigraphical relationships, which suggest that a group of tuff cones at Rum Cove, Patalamon Mesa and between San Fernando Hill and Seacatch Nunataks were coeval and formed at 5.9–6.0 Ma. Although one of the ages obtained from the tuff cone group, at Seacatch Nunataks, is apparently younger (5.36±0.28 Ma), we suggest that the moderately disturbed 40Ar/36Ar spectrum for that sample is, in that case, unreliable. We emphasise the field relationships that suggest strongly that the Seacatch Nunataks tuff cone is the same age as the other dated samples, from Rink Point and Patalamon Mesa (5.90±0.17 Ma and 6.02±0.12 Ma, respectively). Lastly, the small marine-erupted tuff cone at Cape Gage did not yield dateable material. However, it is sandwiched between two lava-fed deltas with 40Ar/39Ar ages of 3.08±0.15 and 2.23±0.05 Ma and a Late Pliocene age is undoubted (Table 3)."

    "heading": "8. Discussion",
    "text": "The James Ross Island region hosts a large proportion of the known outcrops of Neogene rocks in Antarctica, and they occur at multiple stratigraphical levels. Moreover, unlike interpretations of the age of the\nNeogene Sirius Group in the Transantarctic Mountains, which have been dogged with controversy (e.g. Sugden, 1996; Miller and Mabin, 1998), the chronological context of the JRIVG is clear because it is supported by the results of two isotopic dating systems and clear field relationships. Although it has previously been assumed that many of the shelly samples obtained from the James Ross Island area are in situ, our results prove that this is not always true. It is demonstrated particularly clearly for the Förster Cliffs sedimentary stratum, which has yielded shelly material with a wide range of ages consistent with reworking. We further propose that suggestions that A. anderssoni may have had a wide environmental tolerance (glacial as well as interglacial) were unduly pessimistic and based on a misunderstanding of the sedimentary context in which the fossils were found. In particular, interpretations of some of the pectinid-bearing sedimentary units as glaciomarine deposits, and that A. anderssoni thus tolerated glacial conditions (Jonkers et al., 2002), may be premature. The lithofacies characteristics of at least some of those sediments were acquired due to the unusual association with overriding lava-fed deltas. The deltas removed any coeval glacier by melting and may have caused the redeposited glacial debris to acquire misleading glaciomarine characteristics (Hambrey and Smellie, in press). Alternatively, the deposits are indeed glaciomarine but, like today, the interglacial periods were not ice free but ice poor (cf. Hillenbrand and Ehrmann, 2002; Pudsey, 2002). Thus, although we need to understand better the volcano-sedimentary relationships and the climatic tolerance of A. anderssoni, we conclude that A. anderssoni probably required generally warmer climates in order to grow than are found now in Antarctica, and that their 87Sr/86Sr ages indicate when interglacial periods occurred in the region.\nFig. 6 summarises the chronology of interglacial events based on all of the data from the James Ross Island region. A Late Miocene age from Rabot Point by Dingle and Lavelle (1998, 9.9 Ma) is the oldest Neogene age obtained on James Ross Island so far. As the use of barnacle-carbonate has not been validated for Srisotopic dating, the age of this specimen may or may not accurately date an interglacial period; it is included for completeness. The new data also reveal that ice-poor interglacial conditions occurred between 6 and 7 Ma, and included an important episode of tuff cone eruption in a marine setting. Mapped outcrops of the tuff cones extend over a horizontal distance of at least 28 km between Rum Cove, Stickle Ridge and Rink Point, and they occupy area of about 440 km2 on Ulu Peninsula. This corresponds to a large part of western James Ross\nIsland and it indicates that a substantial area was affected by marine conditions in latest Miocene time.\nMost of the samples dated by their 87Sr/86Sr ratios cluster conspicuously in the Early Pliocene, between 4.22 and 4.93 Ma, and it is possible that the marine conditions implied by the lava-fed delta at Lachman Crags (5.03 Ma) also belong to that period. The period also included deposition of the Cockburn Island Formation (at 4.66 Ma; McArthur et al., in press), which shows the strongest evidence for sedimentation in an ice-poor marine setting (Jonkers, 1998), and reworked (?) Austrochlamys sp. obtained in a glaciomarine deposit at Cape Gage (4.74+0.32/− 0.63 Ma; Jonkers et al., 2002). The high frequency of ages clustering in the Early Pliocene, obtained on samples from geographically widespread localities, suggests that it was either a period of frequent marine inundations (e.g. caused by several interglacials) or a single relatively long-lived event. It is not possible to distinguish between these options because of the poor resolution of the ages.\nThere are fewer younger interglacials represented in our data set. A possible Late Pliocene event is dated at 2.54+0.86/− 0.36 Ma by a single 87Sr/86Sr age from southwest Croft Bay. The age is slightly older, and with larger errors, than the 40Ar/39Ar result obtained on the volcanic delta at Förster Cliffs, which shows clear evidence, including variable passage zone elevations within the delta, that it was emplaced in a thicker ice sheet than occurs on James Ross Island today (i.e. during a glacial period) at 2.50 Ma. However, support for a Late Pliocene interglacial(s) also comes from the age of the small marine-erupted tuff cone at Cape Gage, which lies between 3.08 and 2.23 Ma. The youngest interglacial dated by our study comprises formation of the marine-erupted Terrapin Hill tuff cone, which occurred at <880 ka. Both of the Quaternary Sr-isotopic ages obtained so far (1.18 and 1.9 Ma) are older than the Terrapin Hill tuff cone and were obtained on strata that we interpret to be coeval with overlying lava units that yielded 40Ar/39Ar ages of 3.08 and 2.50 Ma, respectively. This discrepancy has yet to be resolved.\nMilankovitch-scale glacial/interglacial cyclicity is known to characterize the Neogene based on the deepsea δO18 isotope record. Continuous 100 ka cycles back to ca. 0.8 Ma and 40 ka cycles beyond that are well established (Shackleton, 1995). Because of the poor resolution of the dating methods, in which the analytical uncertainty on the ages extends over many glacial/ interglacial cycles, a close comparison with the record of interglacial periods on James Ross Island is not yet possible. However, the Early Pliocene has a particular\nprominence in our dataset. Between ca. 2.8 and 5 Ma, measured δO18 values are relatively low (almost all <3.5), and the individual δO18 cycles themselves are dominated by clusters of warm interglacials tens to about a hundred thousand years in duration punctuated by much shorter glacials (cf. Shackleton, 1995, Figs. 17.2 and 17.3). Evidence for generally warmer conditions influencing the Antarctic Peninsula was also obtained during ODP Leg 178 (Hillenbrand and Futterer, 2002). Thus, it is possible that the James Ross Island record may well be capturing a higher proportion of the longer-lasting warm interglacial periods that characterised the Early Pliocene.\nOn a broader scale, three of the warm periods identified in this paper (6.5–5.9, 5.03–4.23 and <0.88 Ma) are remarkably similar in age to periods identified by Joseph et al. (2002) (at 6.4–5.9, 4.9–4.6 and 1.1–0.8 Ma). They tentatively identified those periods as times of warmer climates at high southern latitudes when the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) may have been less stable (more active) than it has been historically (Fig. 6). Joseph et al. (2002) also stated that the EAIS probably stabilised at ca. 4 Ma, during the middle of the Pliocene warm interval (∼ 4.8–3.2 Ma). Based on their discussion, this implies a meltwater production and glacial sediment erosion regime in East Antarctica after ca. 4 Ma broadly similar to the present. However, our data for the APIS indicate another warm period (which could be one or several interglacials) at around 2.54+86/− 0.36 Ma, overlapping the midPliocene warm interval. We suggest that our data and those of Joseph et al. (2002) suggest that both the APIS and the EAIS may respond in a similar way to longerterm regional shifts in climate, whereas they are far enough apart for that to be not necessarily so for short periods, as is the case today. Thus, the similarity in age for three out of four warm periods identified for the APIS compared with the EAIS over the last 6 million years might well be a consequence of longer-term climate changes, whilst the presence of a possible warm interglacial on James Ross Island at 2.54 Ma (with large errors), which is not represented in the data of Joseph et al. (2002), may relate to the generally greater sensitivity of the APIS to short-term warming."

    "heading": "9. Conclusions",
    "text": "Our investigation of Late Neogene palaeoenvironments preserved in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region combined the use of stratigraphical relationships, sedimentological and volcanological interpretation, 87Sr/86Sr ratios of A. anderssoni shelly material in\nsedimentary beds and 40Ar/39Ar ages of associated volcanic units. At many localities, the field relationships of the volcanic and sedimentary deposits indicate that they are coeval. The sedimentary deposits are overlain mainly by lava-fed deltas, most of which preserve unambiguous evidence for a glacial (ice sheet) eruptive environment. Therefore, the Ar ages provide our best estimate for the depositional ages of the sediments and for periods of glacial conditions. By contrast, we believe that A. anderssoni is representative of ice-poor interludes when the climate was generally warmer, and ages obtained on the shelly material accurately date interglacial periods. Our study has also demonstrated clearly that the fossil material is commonly reworked. It is therefore unwise to regard any fossils from the JRIVG as in situ without independent supporting evidence.\nOur results suggest that at least three warm periods are represented in the James Ross Island region. The oldest occurred between ca. 6.5 and 5.9 Ma and includes evidence preserved in multiple tuff cones for a geographically widespread area affected by marine conditions, which covered much of western James Ross Island (at least). The most commonly represented warm period occurred during the Early Pliocene (between ca. 5.03 and 4.23 Ma), a period in which generally warm conditions prevailed. Our data cannot be resolved in terms of Milankovich-scale cyclicity. However, it was a period of generally warmer conditions dominated by long-lived clusters of interglacials and much shorter-duration glacials, which may have increased the probability of preservation of evidence for the warm conditions. The youngest warm period reliably identified by our data took place in theQuaternary at <880 ka (TerrapinHill). There is also tentative evidence for a further ice-poor period in the Late Pliocene, imprecisely dated at 2.54 Ma (+0.86/− 0.36) but supported by the presence of a marine tuff cone whose age falls between 3.08 and 2.23 Ma. However, glacial conditions involving the formation of an extensive ice sheet also occurred on James Ross Island at 2.50± 0.07 Ma. Finally, we suggest that, over the past 6 million years, the APIS and EAIS may have responded similarly to long-term regional shifts in climate. The APIS was also sensitive to short-term warming, but the EAIS less so."

  "abstractText": "New outcrops of Late Neogene sedimentary deposits discovered on James Ross and Vega islands, northern Antarctic Peninsula, are fossiliferous and contain mainly fragmented pectinids amongst other as yet unstudied biota. The sedimentary deposits are interbedded with fresh volcanic units, thus providing the unusual opportunity to investigate the ages of the sedimentary rocks using two independent isotopic systems (Ar/Ar and Sr/Sr). The fossils record past periods of warmer conditions (interglacials) like today. However, our results demonstrate unequivocally that some of the macrofossils present in the sedimentary rocks are reworked and the host sediments are, in these cases, much younger than the ages of their included fossils would suggest. Nevertheless, the Sr ages date these records of interglacial events in the region independently of the age of the strata in which they occur. Conversely, the volcanic rocks show abundant field evidences that they are coeval with the underlying sedimentary deposits, and hence their Ar ages reliably date the timing of their deposition. Our results indicate that at least three generally warmer periods are represented in the James Ross Island region: at 6.5–5.9, 5.03–4.22 and<0.88 Ma, although our data do not have the resolution for identifying Milankovitch-scale cyclicity. However, the Early Pliocene warm period is particularly well represented and the James Ross Island data may well be capturing a higher proportion of the longer-lasting interglacials that characterised that period. We also present evidence for an interglacial in the Late Pliocene (at 2.54+0.86/− 0.36 Ma). Our data suggest that both Antarctic Peninsula and the East Antarctic ice sheets responded in a similar way to long-term regional shifts in climate, but the Antarctic Peninsula is more sensitive to short-term warming, as occurs today. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
