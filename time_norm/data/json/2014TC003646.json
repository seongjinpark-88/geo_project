    "text": "Deformation associated with strike-slip fault systems is often controlled by a combination of fault geometry, the orientation of subsidiary structures, the presence of different lithologies, and the obliquity of the relative motion [e.g., Sylvester, 1988]. Strain partitioning on obliquely convergent strike-slip systems is typically expressed as thrust motion on faults subparallel to the main fault that may link kinematically directly into the strike-slip system or may be some distance from it. In either case, this partitioning of strain may result in slip rate decreases along the master strands of strike-slip faults as deformation on local structures increases the complexity of the fault system. Thrust faults accommodate convergence along parts of many strike-slip systems, including the San Andreas Fault [e.g., Buscher and Spotila, 2007], the Alpine Fault of New Zealand [e.g., Norris and Cooper, 1995], and the Karakoram Fault [e.g., Searle et al., 1998]. Reconstructing the history of deformation along strike-slip fault systems from the rock record is also complicated by the fact that as slip occurs along the fault, focused deformation may be transient in time and space as crustal material is moved through regions of geometric complexity [Wakabayashi et al., 2004; Spotila and Dorsey, 2012].\nThe Denali Fault (Figure 1a) is a continental scale, intraplate dextral strike-slip fault system that forms an arcuate path across southcentral Alaska from northwestern Canada to the Bering Sea [St Amand, 1957]. The Alaska Range follows the trace of the Denali Fault and formed as a far-field response to plate boundary processes to the south at the Pacific-North American plate margin as well as collision of the Yakutat microplate [e.g., Plafker et al., 1978; Lahr and Plafker, 1980; Fitzgerald et al., 1993, 1995, 2014; Haeussler, 2008; Benowitz et al., 2011, 2012, 2013]. Pleistocene slip rate along the Denali Fault decreases to the west [Matmon et al., 2006; Mériaux et al., 2009] and in conjunction with fault geometry, topography, and mapped (or inferred faults),\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014.

Mapped thrusts to the south tend to intersect the Denali Fault at an acute angle, whereas thrusts to the north have more east-west near-fault parallel trends and deformation there is more distributed [e.g., Haeussler, 2008; Bemis, 2010; Koehler et al., 2012; Vallage et al., 2014]. The Denali Fault offers the opportunity to examine how the style and rate of deformation varies with time as a crustal block is translated along a structurally complex fault system.\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2196\nThe Denali Fault is active, evidenced by the 2002M7.9 DF earthquake (Figure 1b) that initially ruptured on the previously unknown Susitna Glacier Thrust Fault (SGTF), propagating east along the Denali Fault, before continuing on the Totschunda Fault, rupturing a total of ~340 km [Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2003; Ozacar et al., 2003; Crone et al., 2004; Haeussler et al., 2004; Haeussler, 2009]. The SGTF lies south of the Denali Fault in the eastern Alaska Range, on the concave side of the broad restraining bend (the Hayes restraining bend) [Fitzgerald et al., 2014]. The SGTF is a NE trending, SE vergent structure that intersects the Denali Fault at an acute angle, uplifting the northwest side hanging wall between the thrust and the Denali Fault [Crone et al., 2004]. The SGTF and possibly the Broxson Gulch Fault have been suggested as the southerly thrusts defining the eastern Alaska Range as a large positive flower structure bound to the north by the Hines Creek Fault and other thrusts between that and the Denali Fault [Brocher et al., 2004; Crone et al., 2004; Fisher et al., 2004, 2007; Fuis et al., 2008]. It is likely that other active but not yet discovered thrust faults, similar in nature and orientation to the SGTF (with respect to the master strike-slip Denali Fault) exist in the eastern Alaska Range as well as in other parts of the Alaska Range [Crone et al., 2004], an observation we incorporate below into interpretation of the thermochronology data.\nU-Pb dating on zircon and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology on K-feldspar and mica was undertaken on select samples to better constrain the higher-temperature thermal history of the region. In addition, low-temperature thermochronologic methods, apatite fission track (AFT) and apatite (U-Th)/He dating (AHe), were applied to samples collected across the SGTF, as well as north of the Denali Fault in order to (1) determine the patterns of cooling ages in the SGTF hangingwall and footwall as well as across theDenali Fault, (2) place constraints on the timing of regional exhumation andmotion on the SGTF, (3) assess the role of the SGTF in the uplift/exhumation of topography south of the Denali Fault in the eastern Alaska Range, and (4) summarize the tectonothermal history of the region based on these multiple thermochronologic techniques."

    "text": "Alaska lies at the northern end of a long strike-slip/convergent margin that runs up the North American west coast. Southern Alaska was formed by the translation, collision, and accretion of a series of tectonostratigraphic (fault-bounded, lithologically distinct) terranes along the coastal fault system [e.g., Coney et al., 1980]. Terranes may have escaped west toward the free face of the Bering Sea [e.g., Redfield et al., 2007] or be actively escaping on a local scale, as a result of ongoing Yakutat microplate collision [Elliott et al., 2013]. Amalgamated terranes (including the Wrangellia, Peninsular, and Alexander Terranes) of the Wrangellia composite terrane are referred to as the southern Alaska block [e.g. Nokleberg et al., 1994; Haeussler, 2008], having a northern boundary along the Denali Fault and southern boundary along the Pacific plate - North American plate subduction zone. The southern Alaska block is converging northward to northwestward as evidenced by geodynamic modeling of sparse GPS data, and low levels of seismicity that suggest movement as a relatively coherent crustal block [e.g., Freymueller et al., 2008]. The most recent and currently active terrane accretion is between the Yakutat microplate and North America. The Yakutat is thought to mainly be an oceanic plateau overlain by up to ~10 km of glacially derived sediment eroded from the ChugachMountains [Worthington et al., 2012]. It has been subducting under southern Alaska since probably the late Oligocene [e.g. Enkelmann et al., 2010] with its leading edge detected in seismic reflection and broadband data under southcentral Alaska, ~500 km inland [Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2006]. Much of the late Oligocene to present deformation in southcentral Alaska is attributed to the low-angle (flat-slab) subduction of the buoyant slab and plate interface coupling of the overthickened trailing end of the Yakutat microplate at Alaska’s southern plate margin [e.g., Ferris et al., 2003; Worthington et al., 2012; Arkle et al., 2013; Benowitz et al., 2013; Jadamec et al., 2013]. The Yakutat microplate convergence is accommodated by underthrusting and complex contraction of the upper plate from a series of stacked thrust sheets within the Pamplona Zone south of the Chugach Mountains [e.g., Plafker, 1987; Wallace, 2008; Berger et al., 2008] to partitioned strikeslip and convergence in the Denali Fault system [e.g., Plafker et al., 1992]. Convergence of the Pacific Plate, oblique collision of the Yakutat microplate and its coupling to the overriding North American margin and counterclockwise rotation of the southern Alaska block result in strain being transferred inboard of the active margin. This results in slip being partitioned into strike-slip and thrust components along major faults such as the Denali fault system [e.g., Plafker et al., 1992; Redfield and Fitzgerald, 1993; Fitzgerald et al., 1995, 2014; Haeussler, 2008; Spotila and Berger, 2012; Benowitz et al., 2013; Vallage et al., 2014].\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014.

    "heading": "2.2. Alaska Range and the Susitna Glacier Thrust Fault",
    "text": "The Alaska Range, located within a former suture zone between the Wrangellia composite terrane to the south and the Yukon-Tanana composite terrane to the north [e.g., Ridgway et al., 2002; Fisher et al., 2007; Brennan et al., 2011] includes plutonic rocks ranging in age from Cretaceous through Eocene [e.g., Trop and Ridgway, 2007]. Within this suture zone, the Alaska Range formed along the Denali Fault (Figure 1a), likely active since Late Cretaceous times [Miller et al., 2002]. The central segment of the Denali Fault has the greatest dextral strike-slip velocities, ~12–13mm/yr, which decrease to the west to ~7mm/yr [Matmon et al., 2006; Mériaux et al., 2009]. A series of thrust faults aligned SW-NE splay south off the Denali Fault and is a likely mechanism by which much of the deformation is accommodated and tectonic shortening forms high topography [e.g., Plafker et al., 1992; Haeussler, 2008].\nIn this paper we refer to the eastern Alaska Range as the area of high topography between the Nenana and Delta Rivers, both of which flow to the north through valleys across the Alaska Range (Figure 1b). High and extremely rugged mountains in the eastern Alaska Range occur dominantly north of the Denali Fault, within suture zone rocks between the Denali Fault and the Hines Creek Fault. There the Hines Creek Fault defines the southern edge of the Yukon-Tanana composite terrane. There is a contrast between topography north and south of the Denali Fault, as to the south the topography, while still rugged, is not as high, nor as extensive. There is also a contrast in exhumation, as the greatest exhumation (and rock uplift) in the eastern Alaska Range, with up to ~14 km of exhumation since the late Oligocene (~25Ma) is proximal to the north side of the Denali Fault [Benowitz et al., 2011, 2013; Roeske et al., 2011]. South of the Denali Fault there is significantly less exhumation, as based on a number of different thermochronologic techniques [Armstrong et al., 2007; Perry et al., 2010; Benowitz et al., 2011, 2013]. As mentioned above, thrust faults south of the Denali Fault tend to intersect at an acute angle, whereas to the north thrust faults are near-parallel and deformation may be more distributed [Bemis, 2010; Vallage et al., 2014]. Thus, our study of the SGTF as a type example for the role of thrusting in the eastern Alaska Range mainly applies to those faults south of the Denali Fault.\nThe 2002M7.9 Denali Fault earthquake was triggered by rupture on a previously unmapped fault in the Susitna glacial valley, subsequently named the SGTF [Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2003; Crone et al., 2004]. The focal mechanism indicates dextral slightly oblique thrusting on a 48° north-dipping plane [Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2003]. Surface dip measurements of 10° and 25° [Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2003] and 19° [Crone et al., 2004], are much less than the nodal plane of the focal mechanism of 35–48° at depth [Crone et al., 2004]. This suggests fault dip decreases toward the surface, common for thrusts associated with strike-slip fault systems [e.g., Sylvester, 1988]. The SGTF had a rupture length of 48 km. There was one main rupture, with multiple subparallel strands up to 1100m apart also documented, which in one area form a network of secondary back thrusts [Crone et al., 2004].\nThe rugged terrain of the Susitna Glacier region combined with the large magnitude M7.9 Denali Fault earthquake is in conflict with the presumed long-term slower exhumation of the region south of the Denali Fault. The SGTF may simply have been periodically reactivated at long intervals, or the SGTF is a relatively recent structure. If the reactivation of an older structure is the case, the periods of activity may be dependent upon the translation of the SGTF block along the Denali Fault, in and out of geometric complexities and a changing partition of strain components. If a younger structure, then the SGTF may be activated in the late Miocene, a time when there was major uplift and exhumation in the central Alaska Range [e.g., Fitzgerald et al., 1995]. The broad range of thermochronology techniques applied to bedrock samples is designed to investigate these scenarios, similar to other studies undertaken in comparative strike-slip/transpressional settings such as along the Alpine fault [e.g., Batt et al., 2004]."

    "text": "The objectives of this study are to constrain the time temperature of rocks on either side of the SGTF, primarily using low-temperature methods (AFT thermochronology and AHe dating) to understand its tectonic evolution. Ultimately, we seek to better understand the role of thrust faulting with respect to strike-slip movement along the Denali Fault, and the processes responsible for the formation of the Alaska Range, in both a temporal and spatial framework.\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2198\nThe sampling strategy included samples north and south of the Denali Fault, on either side of the SGTF, and also in a reconnaissance-style sampling across other suspected thrust faults (East Fork of the Susitna Glacier). We also undertook selected U-Pb zircon dating to constrain the age of pluton emplacement and 40Ar/39Ar analyses to constrain the higher-temperature part of the cooling curves. Sample lithologies (Table S1 in the supporting information) range from syenogranite to granodiorite with few signs of metamorphic fabric and little or no alteration of original composition, with the exception of sample EAR 10-05 that was foliated in hand specimen. Our sampling strategy for the SGTF is similar to some previous studies undertaken in other regions where thrusting is dominant, such as the Pyrenean orogeny [e.g., Metcalf et al., 2009]. There, samples analyzed using multiple methods were collected over significant relief, close to the fault, cognizant that thrusting does not exhume rocks and may partially or completely reset the thermochronologic system in footwall samples and that the resultant erosion provides the cooling signal. Samples in the SGTF footwall and hangingwall vertical profiles were collectedwith ~100m vertical separation over short-wavelength topography with a minimal horizontal component. In this case we classify short-wavelength topography as that that will not overly deflect closure temperature isotherms [e.g., Braun, 2002; Reiners et al., 2003] for the methods used. As the wavelength of topography across the Susitna Glacier is<5 km the correction on exhumation rates derived from AHe age-elevation profiles collected on the valley walls are<10%, and less than that for AFTage-elevation profiles. Six samples were taken in the footwall of the SGTF, from elevations of 1544 to 1178m and five samples in the hanging wall from 1800 to 1354m (Figure 2). Three samples from the hanging wall (EAR 10-26, 10-27, and 10-28), were collected from the eastern ends of ridges defining the westernwall of the Susitna glacial valley, whereas the five samples of the hanging wall vertical profile were from an internal drainage. The vertical transects span relatively limited relief but still provide good insight especially when AHe and AFT data are interpreted together. With respect to reconnaissance-style sampling across suspected thrust faults south of the Denali fault, only sample EAR 10-10 (east of the East Fork of the Susitna Glacier) yielded sufficient apatite."

    "text": "All samples were crushed using a jaw crusher, milled in a Bico disc mill, sieved, and then underwent standard heavy liquid and magnetic separation. U/Pb dating on two zircon separates was undertaken commercially by Apatite to Zircon, with LA-ICP-MS analyses at the Geoanalytical Laboratory, Washington State University, Pullman, WA. There, individual zircon grains were targeted using a NewWave yttrium/aluminum/garnet 213nm solid-state laser ablation system. Approximately 50 analyses were done for each of these two samples (Figure 3 and Table S2). 40Ar/39Ar analyses were undertaken at the University of Alaska Fairbanks geochronology facility. Muscovite, biotite, and K-feldspar were analyzed from sample 51SUS from the hanging wall. Biotite and K-feldspar were analyzed from sample EAR 10-16 from the footwall. Ideally, the sample from the hanging wall for which we obtained a U-Pb zircon age (EAR10-24) would have also been analyzed for 40Ar/39Ar. However 40Ar/39Ar data for sample 51SUS already existed and this was the same lithology as other hanging wall samples. Samples were degassed using an argon laser (Figures 3 and S1–S5 and Tables S3–S5). Benowitz et al. [2012, 2013] provide further details of the 40Ar/39Ar methods used.\nK-feldspar age spectra are interpreted using multidomain diffusion modeling [e.g., Lovera et al., 2002] to constrain thermal histories. However, instead of a furnace diffusion experiment, we look at the time span between closure of the high-temperature (K-feldsparmax; ~350°C) and low-temperature (K-feldsparmin; ~150°C) domains for K-feldspar using information obtained using the laser [Copeland and Harrison, 1990;McDougall and Harrison, 1999; Ridgway et al., 2007; Benowitz et al., 2011, 2012, 2013]."

Information on the rate of cooling and the time-temperature history can be obtained from confined track length distributions [e.g., Green et al., 1986], such that long tracks indicate rapid cooling and shorter tracks indicate partial annealing and typically a more complex thermal history. Rocks may reside in the partial annealing zone (PAZ; approximately 60–120°C) during exhumation during which time the length of a track is reduced with the final length being indicative of the maximum temperature reached. At temperatures greater than the base of the PAZ tracks are effectively annealed instantaneously over geologic time.

Because of the documented loss and generally homogenous radiogenic release of the plateau age determination steps no isochron age determination was possible. Based on the general sequential closure of mineral phases from high to low nominal closure temperatures we infer the biotite 40Ar/39Ar plateau age determination is not affected by excess 40Ar. The 40Ar/39Ar analyses for the footwall K-feldspar sample (EAR 10-16) produced a plateau age of 48.5 ± 0.3Ma with a flat age spectra (Figures 2b, 3c, and S2 and Tables S3 and S4). The isochron age determination is within error of the plateau age determination and did not demonstrate the presence of excess 40Ar and is indicative of rapid cooling between ~350°C and ~150°C.\nHanging Wall of the SGTF. The 40Ar/39Ar analyses for the hanging wall muscovite sample (51SUS) produced a plateau age of 52.2 ± 0.3Ma with a flat age spectra (Figures 2b, 3b, and S3 and Tables S3 and S5). The isochron age determination is within error of the plateau age determination and did not demonstrate the presence of excess 40Ar. The 40Ar/39Ar analyses for the hanging wall biotite sample (51SUS) produced a plateau age of 51.0 ± 0.4Ma with the stepping-up age spectra showing evidence of possible minor loss (~1%) (Figures 2b, 3b, and S4 and Table S3 and S5). As for the footwall samples, because of the documented loss and generally homogenous radiogenic release of the plateau age determination steps no isochron age determination was possible, and based on the general sequential closure of mineral phases from high to low nominal closure temperatures, we infer the biotite 40Ar/39Ar plateau age determination is not affected by excess 40Ar. The 40Ar/39Ar analyses for the hanging wall K-feldspar sample (51SUS) produced a bimodal age spectra with the release constituting two different components. The K-feldsparmax average weighted age was 49.2 ± 0.4Ma (54% of 39Ar release) (Figures 3b and S5 and Tables S3 and S5). No isochron age determination was possible because only one step is used for the weighted average age determination. The K-feldsparmin average weighted age was 45.5 ± 0.6Ma (40% of 39Ar release) (Figures 3b and S5 and Tables S3 and S5). Due to the homogenous radiogenic release of the weighted average age determination steps no isochron age determination was possible."

    "text": "AFT ages north of the Denali Fault were ~8 to 9Ma (Figure 2b and Table 1). Low uranium concentrations and relatively young age meant very few measurable confined track lengths. The AFT ages agree with previous studies suggesting ages are younger north of the Denali Fault (compared to older ages to the south) due to greater exhumation [Armstrong et al., 2007]. Samples were collected on the north side of the West Fork Glacier, relatively close to the active fault trace under the glacier, so the effects of shear heating and elevated isotherms, as is often observed along large active faults may also play a role in the young age [e.g., Norris and Toy, 2014]. Care must therefore be taken when using such ages very close to faults to estimate amounts of exhumation.\nSouth of the Denali Fault AFT ages are significantly older, ranging from ~42 to ~28Ma in the hanging wall of the SGTF and ~43 to ~33Ma in the footwall of the SGTF, with 1σ errors of ~2 to ~ 4Ma (Figures 2b and 4 and\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2205\nthat were not detected during picking, resulting in these older apparent ages [e.g., Farley, 2002; Ehlers and Farley, 2003]. These anomalously old ages of 64 and 66Ma (>34Myr older than any other age) were not considered further.\nThe two samples from north of the Denali Fault have AHe single grain ages from ~1.7 to ~ 2.9Ma (Figure 2b and Table 2) with the narrow spread of single grain ages indicative of rapid cooling through the apatite PRZ. We interpret these samples, lying close to the active strand of the Denali Fault, as indicative of rapid cooling in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene.\nFootwall of the SGTF. In the footwall vertical profile, single grain AHe ages range from ~31 to ~22Ma, strongly clustering around ~28–25Ma with single grain analytical 1σ errors of ~2Ma and relatively little single grain AHe age variation (Figure 2b and Table 2). As is shown by plots of AHe age versus [eU] and also age versus grain size (Figures S6 and S7), variable [eU] and individual grain sizes play only a minor role in the observed single grain AHe age variation. For the vertical profile samples, the relatively steep AHe age-elevation relationship and small variation in single grain ages suggest relatively rapid cooling of the footwall circa 30–25Ma.\nSample EAR 10-08 from just east of the footwall vertical profile (Figure 2b) plots with those samples indicating a similar history. In contrast, sample EAR 10-10 fromeast of the East Fork Glacier is definitely younger (circa 17Ma), as is the AFT age for this same sample in comparison to other footwall ages. This indicates this sample cooled later than the vertical profile samples and that the East Fork Glacier region likely had a different cooling history, perhaps similar to the hanging wall of the SGTF. Overall, the steep apparent slope and lack of single grain age variation indicates rapid cooling of the footwall of the SGTF in late Oligocene (circa 30–25Ma).\nHanging wall of the SGTF (vertical profile). AHe single grain ages range from ~24 to ~6.5Ma, clustering around ~17 to ~14Ma with single grain analytical 1σ errors of ~1Ma. There is a slight relationship between single grain AHe ages and [eU] for a few samples (see Figure S6 in the supporting information). The apparent slope of the vertical profile is not as steep as the footwall samples but does decrease with decreasing elevation from ~20 to ~12Ma (for the weighted mean ages).

The slower overall cooling rate in the hanging wall data (as compared to more rapid cooling in the footwall) is possibly reflected in the slightly greater single grain age variation, because samples that reside for longer periods in the PRZ (in effect taking longer to cool through the PRZ) develop larger single grain age variation [Fitzgerald et al., 2006]. In addition, the lowermost sample in the hangingwall vertical profile has the youngest single grain age at 6.4Ma (±0.5Ma, 1σ), and suggests (as discussed below in section 5.1) that late Miocene cooling may be recorded by this youngest single grain age in this lowermost hanging wall sample.\nHanging wall of the SGTF (west wall of the Susitna Valley). Interestingly, the three samples (EAR 10-26, 10-27, and 10-28) from the hangingwall that were not considered part of the vertical profile (Figure 2a) have ages that are significantly older than the hanging wall vertical profile samples (Figure 5). These three samples were collected on the eastern facets of the hanging wall ridge systems on the west wall of the main Susitna glacial valley, west of the 2002 SGTF rupture, but east of a subsidiary fault zone we identified on a ridge southeast of the vertical profile samples. Marked by zones of alteration and fault gouge in a number of locations each a few meters wide on top of the ridge, this subsidiary fault zone strikes ~080 with a steep dip, possibly to the SSE. Smaller faults with similar strikes were also found between a few of the hanging wall vertical profile samples, but there is no discernible offset in those ages. The sense of fault offset across this subsidiary fault zone between the three samples with older ages and the vertical profile (determined by the offset in the AHe ages) is down to the east, ~500m. Asmentioned above, Crone et al. [2004] observed, in addition to the main SGTF 2002 rupture that varies from a single strand to multiple subparallel strands up to 1100m apart, large back thrusts in the hanging wall. Our proposed sense of motion on this subsidiary fault zone is opposite to thosemapped back thrusts. As such, the subsidiary fault zone may represent a later gravitational collapse structure (normal fault) formed following early tomiddleMiocene deformation on themain SGTF. Alternatively the dip near the surface (steeply dipping to the SSE) may not represent the dip at depth or the subsidiary faults may have been backtilted to steeper dips by later fault movement (on the SGTF) and thus these subsidiary faults may represent earlier thrust or reverse faulting.\nHanging wall of the SGTF (AHe summary). Overall for the vertical profile samples, the age-elevation trend, the weak correlation of hanging wall mean AHe ages versus grain size, and the lack of correlation of single grain age versus [eU] suggest cooling of the hanging wall in the early to middle Miocene (circa 20–10Ma) at relatively slow rates. For the three samples that were collected from the ridge facets that define the west wall of the Susitna glacial valley (EAR 10-26, 10-27, and 10-28) and which lie east of the subsidiary fault and west of the SGTF itself, the ages are more similar to those samples from the footwall than the hanging wall vertical profile. This implies a number of fault scenarios and has implications for the tectonic history of the SGTF, and will be discussed below in section 5.1."

    "text": "There are a number of cooling events recorded in the vertical profile age-elevation profiles: (1) relatively rapid (and possibly with some residence in a PAZ) cooling in the late Eocene to early Oligocene (circa 40–30Ma) in the footwall and hanging wall as determined from AFT data, (2) rapid cooling in the early tomiddle Oligocene (circa 30–25Ma) as determined from the footwall AHe results, and (3) relatively slow cooling in the early to middle Miocene (circa 20–12Ma) as determined from the AHe hanging wall results. This is a reasonably complex history and as such, HeFTy models may be slightly ambiguous or cooling events poorly delineated, as is often found for thermal histories with multiple, relatively minor with respect to the long-term history, cooling, or thermal events. However, a combination of qualitative interpretation of samples, especially if collected as vertical profiles, and thermal modeling often constrain well the likely time-temperature paths.\nInverse thermal modeling (Figure 6) reveals a similar thermal history to what we have summarized above. (1) All samples in the footwall and the hanging wall vertical profiles indicate faster cooling (~5–10°C/Myr) in the Eocene followed by residence within the PAZ. Most samples indicate slightly earlier cooling (circa 50–40Ma, e.g., EAR 10-21, hanging wall) but a few indicate slightly later cooling (circa. 40–30Ma, EAR 10-22 hanging wall). This Eocene cooling event, notably for the samples that record ~50–40Ma cooling, is consistent with the highertemperature 40Ar/39Ar data that indicates rapid cooling at circa 53Ma, which must have then slowed. (2) Footwall HeFTy models indicate dominantly Oligocene cooling (~5–10°C/Myr from ~30–20Ma), less prominent in the lower most modeled samples (EAR 10-19 and 10-20), then getting more prominent (EAR 10-17) and most evident\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014.

    "text": "The significantly different U-Pb zircon crystallization ages from granitoids on either side of the SGTF (hanging wall: ~98Ma and footwall: ~57Ma) was surprising because of the similarity of lithology and in the field they appear to be from the same pluton. Emplacement age differences across the SGTF suggest the regional intrusion history is complex and longer lived, encompassing multiple magmatic events, which have been partially documented by regional mapping [Csejtey et al., 1992; Nokleberg et al., 1992].\nThe 40Ar/39Ar ages on a variety of minerals imply that the rocks cooled from ~400°C to ~150°C [McDougall and Harrison, 1999; Harrison et al., 2009] in a relatively short period of time (~54 to ~45Ma). Based on the ~57Ma U-Pb footwall age compared to the 40Ar/39Ar footwall biotite age of ~54Ma, we infer that either exhumation closely followed pluton emplacement or the biotite may be reflecting post emplacement thermal relaxation or was fully reset during a regional thermal event that is arguably concentrated along the suture zone between Wrangellia composite terrane and North America [Erdmer and Mortensen, 1993]. Plate tectonic reasons for the “regional thermal event” are likely related to the southern and southeastern margin of Alaska being a zone of active subduction in the Cretaceous through early-middle Eocene leading to subduction related plutonism, deformation and metamorphism. According to some authors, this culminated in the prolonged and progressive subduction of the Kula-Farallon or Kula-Resurrection ridge system leading\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2209\nto slab-window magmatism inland of this margin [e.g., Erdmer and Mortensen, 1993; Trop and Ridgway, 2007; Benowitz et al., 2012;McCrory and Wilson, 2013]. The last major plutonic event in eastern Alaska Range region was ~38–40Ma, as shown by zircon U-Pb ages from plutons further east and south of the Susitna Glacier region [Nokleberg et al., 1994; Roeske et al., 2012].\nIn the hanging wall, the ~98Ma U-Pb age compared to the 40Ar/39Ar hanging wall muscovite age of ~52Ma and biotite age of ~51Ma are compatible with a variety of thermal histories. The 98Ma pluton never cooled below circa 400°C and hence the ~51Ma biotite age is exhumation related cooling, or the 40Ar/39Ar ages were fully reset during the “regional thermal event” mentioned above. In this case, intrusion of circa 57Ma magma into the footwall (and other magmatism in the region) likely increased the geothermal gradient, resetting the 40Ar/39Ar muscovite, biotite, and K-feldspar ages. Taking into account the possibility that ~38–40Ma magmatism has also affected the region, the major rapid cooling seen in the 40Ar/39Ar data (and picked up by the footwall and hanging wall AFT data) is likely a combination of thermal relaxation and exhumation related cooling.\nFrom ~43 to ~30Ma, AFT ages across the Susitna Glacier region record the tail end of the rapid cooling revealed by the 40Ar/39Ar data, followed by slow cooling through, or residence within the PAZ. This thermal history reflects either the thermal relaxation following regional magmatism manifested by the 57Ma intrusion age of the footwall pluton and/or exhumation (with decreasing relief ), as discussed above in section 4.3. It seems likely that exhumation in the region was coeval with local Eocene magmatism as inferred byNokleberg et al. [1994]. The similar AFTages for the hanging wall and footwall across the SGTF indicates this thrust fault was not active at this time (i.e., no significant pre-Oligocene displacement).\nSlow cooling after ~30Ma continued for the hanging wall, but a period of rapid cooling in the footwall occurred during the late Oligocene (~30–25Ma), as the samples were exhumed through the apatite helium PRZ. The AHe data for the footwall vertical profile samples shows little single grain age variation within each sample and little variation between grains in the weighted mean ages for the footwall, suggesting that the samples were rapidly uplifted and exhumed, cooling as one block. We suggest that this relatively rapid Oligocene cooling is due to erosion following slip and uplift on an unidentified thrust fault below these samples. Such a fault would lie to the east of the footwall samples, possibly in the region of the East Fork of the Susitna Glacier (Figures 2 and 8). We develop this general model further below, namely, that slip on thrust faults south of the Denali Fault has resulted in uplift and exhumation of rock in the hanging wall, but that this effect is on a relatively local scale. We also note that the AFT age for sample EAR 10-10 that lies east of the SGTF footwall samples, and east of the East Fork Glacier has an AFTage of 28Ma (±2Ma) and amean length of 14μm indicating rapid cooling of that sample at about this same time. This implies, tentatively, that this unidentified fault may lie east of the East Fork Glacier, if EAR 10-10 lay in the hanging wall of a fault with a similar expression to the modern day SGTF, and it was exhumed by erosion following thrusting.\nThe rate of cooling in the hanging wall vertical profile samples increased in the early to middle Miocene (20-15Ma). We base this observation on the AHe age versus elevation data, as well as some of the HeFTy models. For the hanging wall AHe data, the greater spread in single grain ages compared to late Oligocene footwall AHe cooling ages is suggestive of relatively slower cooling. Thus, although the rate of cooling increased at circa 20–15Ma for the hanging wall samples, it was not as rapid as footwall cooling during the late Oligocene (30–25Ma). These disparate thermal histories indicate that since the early to middle Miocene (circa 15Ma) the hanging wall vertical profile samples were likely moving independently (with respect to the footwall), cooling relatively quickly due to uplift and exhumation associated with thrusting on faults that strike along the Susitna Glacier.\nOur conclusion is therefore that thrust faulting, as marked by the difference in AHe ages from vertical profiles collected on either side of the present day SGTF was initiated in the Miocene ~20–15Ma. That is the firstorder observation, but further examination of the data raises the question: which fault or fault system initiated at that time, the SGTF as mapped today or the subsidiary faults? As noted above in section 4.4, AHe ages from hanging wall samples collected on ridge facets on the west wall of the Susitna glacial valley have similar ages to samples from the footwall of the SGTF. These west wall samples lie just west of the active trace of the SGTF (i.e., in the hanging wall of the SGTF), but lying east of subsidiary faults, that occur between these samples and the hanging wall vertical profile samples. The AHe age disparity between these two sets of hanging wall samples is compatible with a number of tectonic scenarios:\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2210\n1. West wall samples were originally higher in elevation and subsequently down faulted ~500m to their present position. This implies the subsidiary faults are normal faults, down to the east. Hence, the subsidiary faults are younger than the SGTF, and it was the SGTF that was initiated in the Miocene (~20–15Ma). 2. Samples from the west wall of the Susitna Glacier valley collected just west of the SGTF with similar thermal histories as the SGTF footwall vertical profile samples were not down faulted to their presented location. This implies the subsidiary faults were activated in the Miocene (~20–15Ma) to exhume the hanging wall vertical profile samples, and the SGTF fault must have been activated after this time. If so, subsidiary faults likely initiated as a reverse or thrust faults and have since been tilted (or back tilted) by the later thrusting on the SGTF. Thus, the subsidiary faults were initiated in the middle Miocene and then SGTF ruptured at a later time. As an aside, we note that erosion to cool samples within the hanging wall must have been synchronous with thrusting, as we see no reheating or partial overprint in footwall samples. If this scenario 2 is correct, then thrusting on the Susitna thrusts (subsidiary faults plus SGTF) was either continuous since the middle Miocene or there has been later activation on the SGTF, the timing of\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2211\nwhich is unconstrained with this data, although some speculation may be permissible. The youngest AHe grain age (6Ma) from the hanging wall raises the possibility we have recorded late Miocene cooling. Late Miocene cooling is a very significant event elsewhere in the Alaska Range and is when the majority of the exhumation in the central Alaska Range occurred, as documented in a 4 km age-elevation profile from Denali [Fitzgerald et al., 1993, 1995]. Uplift to form the majority of the present day central Alaska Range most likely occurred on thrust faults there, oriented with a similar oblique trend with respect to the Denali Fault, similar to the geometric relationship of the SGTF. Thus, this postulated late Miocene cooling may represent later activation of the SGTF and if so, then the later activation of the SGTF was synchronous with initiation of rapid cooling at Denali in the late Miocene, and for similar reasons.\nRegardless of which faults initiated first, the Susitna Glacier faults (subsidiary or the SGTF) have been active since the middle Miocene. Activity (slip) on the Susitna faults must have been episodic, or the recurrence interval of seismic activity fairly infrequent because of the “relatively old” low-temperature thermochronologic ages preserved. How infrequent on a seismic scale is not a metric that can be determined from thermochronology data, only that movement on the SGTF has likely been episodic since ~15Ma and is of relatively low total magnitude in order to preserve these AFT and AHe ages in comparison to much younger ages north of the Denali Fault.\nA number of authors have also proposed that erosion inmountainous terrains increases, on a global scale as a result of climate change [e.g., Molnar and England, 1990; Zhang et al., 2001; Herman et al., 2013]. There is regional and worldwide surface cooling during the late Cenozoic, which in Alaska is estimated as a cooling trend of ~1°C/Myr from circa 18 to 10Ma [White et al., 1997]. However, we do not consider that the middle Miocene cooling recorded in the data and interpreted as exhumation as being due to climate change. For example, themodeled rate of cooling (~5°C/Myr) in the uppermost sample from the hanging wall (EAR 10-21) exceeds the rate suggested by climate change cooling (~1°C/Myr). Overall, our conclusion is that the cooling observed is related to erosion associated with uplifted topography due to thrusting related to strain partitioning along the Denali Fault, deformation that is being driven by plate boundary processes on the southern Alaskan margin."

    "text": "The Denali Fault is the major structure in the region with the highest topography between it and the Hines Creek Fault, yet there are few discrete faults that might be linked to uplift to form the high and rugged topography. South of the Denali Fault, mapped thrust faults are rare, but most, such as the SGTF, the McCallum, and the Broxson Gulch, are oriented oblique to the Denali Fault [Weber and Turner, 1977; Koehler et al., 2012]. As introduced in section 2.2 thermochronology data north of the Denali Fault indicate more exhumation, at faster rates as compared to south of the fault. As slip occurs along the Denali fault system, focused deformation, especially on the southern side may be transient in time and space [Redfield and Fitzgerald, 1993; Benowitz et al., 2013; Fitzgerald et al., 2014] as documented in other geometrically complex strike-slip fault systems (e.g., San Andreas) [Spotila and Dorsey, 2012]. Thus, thrust faults likely accommodate deformation and strain according to changing paleostress orientations, also considering preexisting structures, different lithologies and rheologies, terrane boundaries, and the geometry of the Denali Fault including location of restraining bends [Fitzgerald et al., 2014].\nSome of our thermochronology data pertains to the ongoing debate regarding the slip history along the Denali Fault. There are few unique piercing points of Late Cretaceous to Miocene age units along the Denali Fault [e.g., Roeske et al., 2012], and although the fault system has been active since the Late Cretaceous [e.g., Miller et al., 2002; Trop and Ridgway, 2007] total displacement and details of the slip history are poorly constrained. Estimates of ~400 km of right-lateral displacement are suggested since the Late Cretaceous, largely based on the offset of the possibly correlative Maclaren Terrane and the Kluane schist of the Yukon, Canada [Eisbacher, 1976; Nokleberg et al., 1985; Lowey, 1998]. Our geochronology data add further support to this interpretation. We obtained an U-Pb zircon age of 57Ma from the East Susitna batholith, which intrudes the Maclaren metamorphic unit. The Ruby batholith intrudes the Kluane schist and has a U-Pb age of ~57Ma [Israel et al., 2011]. In addition, the Kluane schist has a dominant population of ~98Ma zircons [Israel et al., 2011] similar in age to the SGTF hanging wall pluton of ~98Ma. K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar mica cooling ages (~52Ma) are also similar between these two possibly correlative regions [Erdmer and Mortensen, 1993].\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2212\nOur preferred interpretation (Figure 8) for the thermochronology data in both the footwall and the hanging wall of the SGTF is that episodes of more rapid cooling are associated with thrust faulting that results in uplifted topography with subsequent erosion. For the footwall of the SGTF, rapid cooling in the late Oligocene (circa 30–25Ma) is likely due to an unknown underlying thrust fault, perhaps resident under the East Fork of the Susitna Glacier. Thrusting in the Susitna Glacier region began circa 20–15Ma, based on disparate AHe ages in the hanging wall and footwall vertical profiles. As discussed above, whether deformation was accommodated first on the subsidiary fault or the SGTF is unknown, but a number of scenarios are possible. If the subsidiary faults ruptured first in the middle Miocene, they were later back tilted by later thrusting (perhaps in the late Miocene) on the SGTF. If the SGTF ruptured first, that occurred in the middle Miocene and the subsidiary faults represent normal faults. While these second-order details are intriguing and merit further study, the first-order conclusion remains the same, thrusting was initiated in the Susitna Glacier region during the middle Miocene.\nDue to dextral slip along the Denali Fault, the Susitna Glacier region has been translated west-northwest with respect to the north side of the fault. In our conceptual model (Figure 8) we chart themovement of the south side of the fault based on simple assumptions (averaged slip at 8mm/yr, no shortening due to thrusting) along with the location of thrust faults, unknown until the present, and when those thrust faults may have been active. This simple model, using thermochronology to constrain periods of cooling related to thrusting, does not take into account many other variables that effect deformation along strike-slip faults. Factors such as obliquity of strain, different lithologies and crustal rheologies across strike-slip faults, and the geometry of the faults themselves are known to be important in such examples as the San Andreas fault system and the Hope Fault in New Zealand [e.g., Wood et al., 1994; Tikoff and Teyssier, 1994; Spotila et al., 2007; Fuis et al., 2012; Niemi et al., 2013]. Along the Denali Fault, such parameters are also very likely to be important, but because the slip history along the Denali Fault is not well constrained, it is not known whether thrust faults are progressively and sequentially triggered as rocks on the south side of the Denali Fault arrive at (i) a restraining bend (if these bends are fixed), or (ii) where the dip of the fault changes for example, and/or (iii) if the paleostress orientation changes due to plate motion change or greater coupling between the colliding Yakutat microplate and overriding North America.\nThere is also societal importance for understanding these thrust faults and when and why they rupture. For example, initial rupture on “unmapped” thrusts south of the Denali Fault may trigger much larger earthquakes in much the same way as initial slip on the SGTF triggered the 2002M7.9 Denali Fault earthquake [Crone et al., 2004]."

    "text": "The tectonic history of southern Alaska, like much of the northeastern Pacific margin, is punctuated by a series of terrane accretions and right-lateral translation along major strike-slip faults [e.g., Plafker et al., 1994]. Our thermochronology data of the Susitna Glacier region shows local faulting controlling episodes of exhumation, but ultimately, it is the large-scale plate interactions that are the driving force for these episodes.\nGranitic rocks in the Susitna Glacier region form part of the Susitna Batholith. The hanging wall plutonic rocks (U-Pb age of ~98Ma) were likely intruded during the collision of the Wrangellia Composite Terrane with the Yukon Composite Terrane of North America [Trop and Ridgway, 2007]. Eocenemagmatism from ~60–55Ma in the Alaska Range is associated with the remnant mantle wedge from earlier arc magmatism [Trop and Ridgway, 2007] and is probably the source of the ~57Ma intruded pluton recorded in the footwall sample. There is no chemical data to determine if our sample came from a depleted magma source, but the timing and location of themagmatism could explain the intrusionwe sampled. Late-Eocene-Oligocene 40Ar/39Ar data suggest exhumation following pluton emplacement and/or by possible reheating during a metamorphic event [Erdmer and Mortensen, 1993]. The AFT results may also reflect thermal effects in addition to exhumation, due to ~38–40Ma plutonic activity through the Susitna Glacier region south of the Denali Fault [Roeske et al., 2012].\nDuring the late Oligocene (circa 25Ma) the SGTF footwall samples are rapidly exhumed, possibly by an unmapped thrust fault to the east of our study area, located near the trace of the modern East Fork of the Susitna Glacier. At the same time as our samples were being exhumed the initial subduction of the Yakutat microplate is suggested to have begun [e.g. Benowitz et al., 2013]. This event likely transferred strain inland to the southern Alaska block and along the Denali Fault system, leading to a change in partitioning of strain along the Denali Fault and hence uplift and exhumation along suitably oriented structural features. These local structures may be responsible for accommodating the increased transpression, such as the\nRICCIO ET AL. ©2014. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. 2213\ninferred thrust to the east of our study area or other faults such as the McCallum and the Broxson Gulch, although the role of these other faults is still unresolved.\nThe contrast in AHe ages across the SGTF (or the subsidiary faults) indicate the initiation of slip on one or other of these fault systems in the Susitna Glacier (see above for discussion) in the middle Miocene (circa 15Ma). The timing of initiation of slip on Susitna Glacier faults may be correlated with plate boundaries processes at the southern Alaska margin. Namely, a change in relative plate motions between the Pacific and North American plates in the middle Miocene [Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2006] and/or a change in the coupling between the plates, including the ongoing collision of the Yakutat microplate.\nAlthough evidence for late Miocene cooling in the hanging wall of the SGTF is minimal, this rapid cooling event (~6Ma) is well documented across southern Alaska, being largely responsible for the uplift and formation of the central Alaska Range [Fitzgerald et al., 1993, 1995], exhumation in the Tordrillo Mountains part of the western Alaska Range [Haeussler et al., 2008] and in parts of the eastern Alaska Range [Perry et al., 2010]. This late Miocene rapid cooling event has been correlated with plate motion change, namely, a change in orientation (to a more northerly azimuth) and an increase in velocity of the Pacific Plate relative to North America [Fitzgerald et al., 1995]. The plate motion change likely also resulted in increased coupling of the colliding Yakutat microplate and transference of strain inland along the Denali Fault, changing the partition of strain along the activating thrust faults and causing uplift."

    "text": "U-Pb zircon ages indicate intrusion of plutons in the footwall (~57Ma) and hanging wall (~98Ma) of the SGTF. U-Pb zircon ages from the Susitna Glacier region (within the Maclaren Terrane) correlate with U-Pb data from the Ruby Batholith/Kluane Terrane that lies ~400km east along the Denali Fault. This supports geologic correlations between these two terranes and hence constraints on long-term slip rates of the Denali Fault. 40Ar/39Ar footwall biotite (~54Ma) and K-feldspar (~49Ma) and hanging wall muscovite (~52Ma), biotite (~51Ma), and K-feldspar (~46Ma) ages reflect cooling following magmatism and/or regional Eocene metamorphism perhaps related to ridge subduction. Thus, geochronology and thermochronology in the Susitna Glacier region documents episodic cooling in the Eocene (circa 55–40Ma), in the Oligocene (circa 30–25Ma) and in the middle Miocene (circa 15Ma). Episodic cooling and exhumation events are controlled by local faults but these local faults are affected by the larger regional strain patterns, created by the geometry of major structures and plate interactions along Alaska’s southern margin. We infer that the Susitna Glacier region during the Eocene was cooling as one coherent block along the southern edge of the Denali Fault. As flat-slab subduction of the Yakutat microplate began along Alaska’s southern margin during the late Oligocene (~25Ma), deformation and strain were transferred inland to the southern Alaska block and along the Denali fault system. Local thrust faults began to form to accommodate the increased transpressional nature of the region and this series of SW splaying thrusts intersecting the Denali fault provided the mechanism for uplift and subsequent exhumation of rocks of the Susitna Glacier region. The thermal history of samples collected across the SGTF suggests initiation of slip on the SGTF (or the subsidiary faults) in themiddle Miocene (~15Ma) with activity continuing until today as demonstrated by the 2002M7.9 Denali Fault earthquake. Overall the Susitna Glacier region has lower topography, less relief, and less overall Neogene exhumation compared with the rapid exhumation and high topography north of the Denali Fault in the eastern Alaska Range. The episodic slip history of the SGTF and other blind thrust faults pose a significant seismic hazard. The “hidden” nature of these types of faults makes seismic hazard determination more difficult along strike-slip fault systems such as the San Andreas and the Denali Faults."

  "abstractText": "Horizontal-slip along restraining bends of strike-slip faults is often partitioned into a vertical component via splay faults. The active Susitna Glacier Thrust Fault (SGTF), as shown by its initiation of the 2002M7.9 Denali Fault earthquake, lies south of, and intersects the dextral strike-slip Denali Fault. Geochronology and thermochronology data from samples across the SGTF constrain the region’s tectonic history and the role of thrusting in the formation of the eastern Alaska Range south of the Denali fault. U-Pb zircon ages indicate intrusion of plutons in the footwall (~57Ma) and hanging wall (~98Ma). These U-Pb zircon ages correlate to those from the Ruby Batholith/Kluane Terrane ~400km east along the Denali Fault, supporting geologic correlations and hence constraints on long-term slip rates. Ar/Ar mica and K-feldspar data from footwall and hanging wall samples (~54 to ~46Ma) reflect cooling following magmatism and/or regional Eocene metamorphism related to ridge subduction. Combined with apatite fission track data (ages 43–28Ma) and thermal models, both sides of the SGTF acted as a coherent block during the Eocene and early Oligocene. Contrasting apatite (U-Th)/He ages across the Susitna Glacier (~25Ma footwall, ~15Ma hanging wall) suggest initiation of faulting during the middle Miocene. Episodic cooling and exhumation is related to thrusting on known or hypothesized faults that progressively activate due to varying partition of strain along the Denali Fault associated with changing kinematics and plate interaction (Yakutat microplate collision, flat-slab subduction and relative plate motion change) at the southern Alaskan plate margin.",
