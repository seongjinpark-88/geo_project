The zircon grains were recovered from tonstein layers interbedded with fine-grained and carbonaceous lithologies in the middle portion of the Rio Bonito Formation. In both samples, the dominant population is interpreted as generated by explosive volcanism, as having formed immediately before the eruption. Based on 238U/206Pb, the selected zircon grains from the dominant population have weighted mean ages of 290.6 ± 2.8 Ma and 281.7 ± 3.2 Ma, corresponding to the Sakmarian and Kungurian ages in the Cisuralian epoch, respectively. These ages constrain the time of the deposition of the tonstein horizons and have important stratigraphic implications for the Late Paleozoic evolution of both the Paran a Basin and the southwestern region of Gondwana. The results presented here and the radiometric data already published suggest that deposition of the post-glacial coal-bearing deposits of the Rio Bonito Formation was probably initiated before the Early Permian. Thus, we infer that the climate had already ameliorated by this period in order to allow for the formation and accumulation of peat in this region of Gondwana.\n© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

    "text": "The CarboniferousePermian deposits of southern Gondwana record an important shift from glacial to arid climatic conditions, passing through intermediate moist and seasonal stages (Gulbranson et al., 2010). Although Gondwana glaciations were initiated from multiple ice centers and lasted short discrete intervals (Frank et al., 2008), a global compilation of climatic data suggests that the onset of widespread glaciations seems to have occurred in South America and eastern Australia during the Late Mississippian (Serpukhovian, Fielding et al., 2008). In Antarctica, Carboniferous glaciation would have been less extensive than previous reconstructions show according Isbell et al. (2003a).\nVarious lines of evidence suggest that the earth's climate warmed during the Late Pennsylvanian although ice centers\nnisinos.br (J. Cagliari).\npersisted in Gondwana (Fielding et al., 2008). Paleosols and coalbearing intervals of Middle to Late Moscovian in the Paganzo Group (Argentina) record a shift in precipitation, suggesting a sub-humid to humid climate (Gulbranson et al., 2010). Coalbearing intervals are also recorded in the Guat a Group, Paran a Basin (Lavina and Lopes, 1987; Holz et al., 2000, 2008), and are interpreted to be Permian in age based on palynomorphs (Daemon and Quadros, 1970; Souza and Marques-Toigo, 2005; Souza, 2006) and absolute dating (Rocha-Campos et al., 2006; Guerra-Sommer et al., 2006, 2008a,b,c; Mori et al., 2012; Simas et al., 2012). The change from humid to arid climatic conditions is recorded in the latest Moscovian and earliest Kasimovian deposits in the Paganzo Group (northwest Argentina, Gulbranson et al., 2010). In the Paran a Basin, continental deposits predominate from the Guadalupian (Rio do Rasto Formation) and evidence of dry climatic conditions is present in the Corumbataí Formation deposits in S~ao Paulo, which are equivalent to the Serra Alta and Teresina formations in the southern part of the basin (Tavares and Rohn, 2009).\nFielding et al. (2008) suggested that the major glacial events occurred synchronously across Gondwana while minor events may have been diachronous. The lack of index fossils in southern hemisphere CarboniferousePermian successions has resulted in endemic plant and palynomorph fossils being used as the main tools for stratigraphic correlation between many south Gondwana sedimentary basins. Furthermore, the scarcity of radiometric age data from the Paran a Basin Supersequence Gondwana I (Milani et al., 2007) makes correlation with other basins difficult.\nUePb analysis of volcanic zircons grains contained within ash fall beds in the Early Permian sedimentary succession of the Paran a Basin has constrained the timing of their deposition (Matos et al., 2001; Rocha-Campos et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2006; GuerraSommer et al., 2008a,b,c; Mori et al., 2012; Simas et al., 2012). In addition, ages have been obtained from ash fall beds of the Karoo Basin in South Africa (Bangert et al., 1999; Stollhofen et al., 2000,\n2008) and the Paganzo Basin in northwest Argentina (Gulbranson et al., 2010), with these volcanic deposits providing CarboniferousePermian ages for the rocks in which they are interbedded.\nIn this paper we present new radiometric ages based on UePb analyses of zircon crystals from two tonstein layers from the southeastern edge of the Paran a Basin. The stratigraphic significance of these ages is analyzed with reference to the evolution of the Paran a Basin, and we discuss the implications of these data on the correlation of CarboniferousePermian deposits across the southwestern region of Gondwana.\n2. Geological setting\nThe Paran a Basin is an intracratonic basin covering approximately 1,500,000 km2 of central-southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northern Argentina (Z alan et al., 1990; Milani et al.,\nt units and the distributions of the Supersequences described in the text (after Milani,\n2007) (Fig. 1). The basin infill reaches a maximum thickness of 8000 m in its depocenter (Z alan et al., 1990) and consists mainly of Late Ordovician to Late Cretaceous sedimentary andminor volcanic rocks (Milani et al., 2007). The tectonic and depositional evolution of the Paran a Basin consisted of uplift and subsidence cycles that coincided with the major orogenic phases in the history of southwestern Gondwana. These events resulted in the formation of several regional unconformities that delimit six depositional second order sequences or supersequences after Milani et al. (2007), comprising the lowermost Rio Ivaí (OrdovicianeSilurian), the Paran a (Devonian), the Gondwana I (Carboniferous to Early Triassic), the Gondwana II (Triassic), the Gondwana III (JurassiceCretaceous), and the uppermost Bauru (Cretaceous).\nThe Gondwana I Supersequence contains the Itarar e, Guat a (Rio Bonito and Palermo formations) and Passa Dois Groups (Irati, Serra Alta, Teresina, and Rio do Rasto formations), and the Piramb oia and Sanga do Cabral formations (Fig. 2) (Milani et al., 2007). Gondwana I units record a constant change in the paleoenvironmental conditions of deposition in the basin, from glacial-influenced deposits in the Itarar e Group to arid conditions in the Piramb oia and Sanga do Cabral formations (Faccini et al., 2003; Faccini, 2007). Palynomorphs derived from the Itarar e, Guat a, and Passa Dois groups (Daemon and Quadros, 1970; Souza and Marques-Toigo, 2005; Souza, 2006; Neregato et al., 2008), vertebrates and invertebrates from the Rio do Rasto Formation (Cisneros et al., 2005; FerreiraOliveira and Rohn, 2010), and radiometric dating (Matos et al., 2001; Rocha-Campos et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2006; GuerraSommer et al., 2008a,b,c; Mori et al., 2012; Simas et al., 2012) have constrained the Gondwana I succession to be between Middle Pennsylvanian (Carboniferous) and Induan (Lower Triassic) in age.\nSeveral ash fall beds interbedded within the coal-bearing succession provide evidence of Early Permian explosive volcanic activity. Similar palynofloras found in units below and above these ash fall beds suggest that there was no variation in the paleoecological conditions during coal formation (Guerra-Sommer et al., 2008c) and supports the interpretation that these ash fall beds were deposited over a short period of time. Evidence of volcanic activity during the PermianeTriassic is also recorded in South\nFig. 2. Stratigraphic overview of the Carboniferous to Permian Gondwana I Supersequence 1997). The black rectangle marks the Rio Bonito Formation succession, where several as equivalent in age to the Serra Alta and Teresina formations.\nAfrica and Namibia (Bangert et al., 1999; Stollhofen et al., 2000), with possible sources related to the magmatic arcs in the Sierras Pampeanas, Argentina (Bangert et al., 1999), and in the Choiyoi Province, from western Argentina to eastern Chile (Milani and Ramos, 1988; Llambías et al., 2003; Santos et al., 2006; Kleiman and Japas, 2009).\nThe Rio Bonito Formation comprises post-glacial conglomerates, very fine to very coarse-grained sandstones, siltstones, claystones, and coal seams. The paleoenvironment of deposition is noted as changing from fluvial settings to tide-dominated estuarine and wave-dominated shoreface settings (Lavina et al., 1985; Lavina and Lopes, 1987; Lopes and Lavina, 2001; Lopes et al., 2003a,b,c; Buatois et al., 2007; Gandini et al., 2010; Netto et al., 2012). The Rio Bonito and Palermo formations are part of the transgressive portion of the entire transgressiveeregressive cycle of the PermianeCarboniferous succession (Lopes, 1995; Lopes and Lavina, 2001; Holz, 2003). The lower boundary represents an erosional surface separating the underlying Itarar e Group from the Rio Bonito Formation. The contact between the Rio Bonito and Palermo formations was interpreted by Lopes et al. (2003b) as being transitional and erosional, and Holz et al. (2006) suggested that it was generated by ravinement processes. The Permian transgression culminated with the development of a maximum flooding surface in either the Palermo Formation (Milani, 1997) or the Irati Formation (Lopes, 1995).\nAsh fall beds (tonsteins) interbedded with fine-grained sediments and coal seams occur in most of the coalfields of the Paran a Basin, such as at the Candiota, Faxinal, and Le~ao-Buti amines as well as in the oil shale bed of the Irati Formation. Some of these tonstein levels have been sampled and analyzed by previous workers (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Absolute ages for those from Candiota were obtained by Rocha-Campos et al. (2006), Guerra-Sommer et al. (2008a,b), and Mori et al. (2012). These ages range from 281.4 ± 3.4 Ma in the upper portion (Mori et al., 2012) to 296.0 ± 4.2 Ma in the lower portion (Guerra-Sommer et al., 2008b) of the Rio Bonito Formation. Similar ages of 290.15 þ 2.45/ 0.85 Ma (Guerra-Sommer et al., 2008a) and 285.4 ± 8.6 Ma (Guerra-Sommer et al., 2008c) were obtained from Faxinal, an age of 291 ± 1.2 Ma (Simas et al., 2012)\nshowing the stratigraphic surfaces of second order sequences (adapted from Milani, h fall beds occur within the coal-bearing succession. *CB e Corumbataí Formation,\nwas obtained from the Le~ao-Buti a coalfield, and ages of 279.9 ± 4.8 Ma (Rocha-Campos et al., 2006) and 278.4 ± 2.2 Ma (Santos et al., 2006) were obtained from volcaniclastic horizons from the Irati Formation."

    "text": "Two tonstein samples were collected in the Rio Bonito Formation deposits at the Barrocada outcrop located in Cachoeira do Sul, southern Brazil (Fig. 3). This outcrop is a 300 m wide and\n40 m high cliff that exposes successions belonging to the middle and upper parts of the Rio Bonito Formation (Fig. 4b). It contains a coal seam associated with fine-grained units at its base, which are overlain by arkosic and quartzose sandstones at higher stratigraphic levels (Fig. 4a). Lopes et al. (2003a) interpreted the coal seam and fine-grained rocks to have been deposited in a back barrier system, whereas the overlying sandstones were interpreted to represent tidal-influenced bars and channels in a coastal barrier setting. Hummocky and trough cross-stratified sandstones occur above tidal sandstones in the surrounding areas, which were interpreted by the same authors as shoreface deposits that formed in a shallow marine environment.\nSample Tonstein-1 was collected from along a farm road located ~100 m away from the Barrocada cliff, and sample Tonstein-2 was collected at the base of the cliff (Fig. 4c,d). Tonstein-2 was collected from a stratigraphic position 5 m above that of Tonstein-1 (Fig. 4a). Both tonstein occur as thin (2e4 cm) and discontinuous layers of whitish-colored claystone interbedded with siltstones (Tonstein-1, Fig. 4d) and coal seam (Tonstein-2, Fig. 4c). Approximately 0.3 kg of each sample was crushed, pulverized, and sieved for zircon separation. Zircon grains were concentrated by conventional magnetic heavy liquid techniques, after which more than 300 grains were handpicked and mounted in epoxy resin. The mounts were polished using different granulometric diamond pastes in order to expose internal surfaces. The grains used for zircon dating were imaged with backscattered electrons and cathodoluminescence to determine their internal structures and crystallization phases. Only zircon grains free of imperfections, fractures, and mineral inclusions were selected for isotopic analysis. All UePb isotopic analyses were performed at the Geochronological Research Center of\nthe Geoscience Institute, University of S~ao Paulo (USP), using a NEPTUNE inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) and an excimer laser ablation (LA) system.\nTable 2 provides the cup and ICP-MS configuration, and the laser setup parameters that were used during analysis. UePb analysis measured materials in the following order: two blanks, two NIST glasses, three external standards, 13 unknown samples, two external standards, and two blanks. Each run consisted of 40 cycles with 1 s/cycle. The 204Hg interference on 204Pb was corrected by using 202Hg, where 204Hg/202Hg ¼ 4.2. Both NIST and the external standards utilized the 207Pb/206Pb ratio for their normalization procedures, whereas the 206Pb/238U ratio was used for normalization by the external standard. The zircon analyses used the standard GJ (602 ± 4.4 Ma; Elhlou et al., 2006) and Temora 2 (Black et al., 2004). Zircon typically contains low concentrations of common Pb, thus, the reliability of the measured 207Pb/206Pb and 206Pb/238U ratios is critically dependent on accurate assessment of the common Pb component. The residual common Pb was\nThe uncertainty introduced by laser-induced fractionation of elements and mass instrumental discrimination were corrected using a reference standard of zircon (GJ-1) (Jackson et al., 2004). The isotope ratios and inter-element fractionation of data obtained by the ICP-MS instrument were evaluated by interspersing the GJ-1 zircon standard in every set of thirteen zircon samples (spots). The GJ-1 standard meets the requirements for the methods used in our laboratory, and the ratios of 206Pb*/238U, 207Pb*/206Pb*, and 232Th/238U were homogeneous throughout the application of the bracket technique. External errors were calculated using error propagation of the individual measurements of the standard GJ-1 and measurements of the individual zircon samples (spots). Ages calculations were made using Isoplot version 4 based mainly on 238U/206Pb (Ludwig, 2008). Chemale et al. (2011) detailed the analytical methods and data treatment.\n3.2. Results\nMore than 300 crystals were separated from both tonstein samples and the grains selected for isotopic analysis were in the size range 70e500 mm. Two populations with different morphological characteristics were identified in both samples. Population A comprised prismatic, euhedral, and elongate crystals that had length-to-width ratios from 2:1 to 14:1 (with an average of 5:1), pinacoid terminations, and sector zoning (Fig. 5). Population B comprised sub-euhedral and sub-rounded crystals with pyramidal terminations and well-defined oscillatory zonation. Length-towidth ratios in grains from population B range from 1:1 to 4.8:1, with an average of 2.4:1. Grains with characteristics of population A were dominant in both Tonstein-1 and in Tonstein-2 samples. However, although UePb isotopic analysis of population B grains was performed for Tonstein-1, this was not the case for Tonstein-2.\nElongate and needle-shaped zircon grains in population A record rapid crystallization, whereas each internal zone in grains from population B reflects a particular period of crystal growth. Low length-to-width ratios such as those exhibited by equant grains in population B are characteristic of formation in deepseated, slowly cooled intrusions (Corfu et al., 2003). These morphological features suggest that zircon grains from population A were formed via explosive volcanic activity and those from population B were derived from magmatic rocks.\nIn Tonstein-1, 52 zircon grains were analyzed in which 38 grains are from population A, 11 are from population B and 3 are inherited grains. UePb isotopic data and calculated ages are given in Table 3, and are shown on weighted mean ages based on 206Pb/238U in the Fig. 6. In the population A we found two different groups of ages, a younger set of 6 and an older set of 32 zircon grains. The mean 206Pb/238U crystallization age of the younger set of grains of population A is 290.6 ± 2.8 Ma (at the 95% confidence level, MSWD¼ 1.16). The older zircon grains ages range between 299 and 316 Ma with the mean age based on 206Pb/238U of 303 ± 2.2 Ma (at the 95% confidence level, MSWD ¼ 3.9). The depositional age considered here is the younger, 290.6 ± 2.8 Ma, which corresponds to the Sakmarian (Cisuralian). The crystallization age of population B is 354 ± 16 Ma (at the 95% confidence level, MSWD ¼ 6.9) which corresponds to the Tournaisian, Lower Mississippian. In addition,\nA (a) and Tonstein-2 population A (b) showing the location of spot points and the e samples and are interpreted as having been produced by explosive volcanic activity.\nthree zircon grains with older 206Pb/238U ages of 630, 801, and 1025 Ma (Table 3) are interpreted as detrital grains and are thus unrelated to this volcanic event.\nIn Tonstein-2, only grains with morphological characteristics of population A underwent UePb isotopic analysis. Furthermore, of these 39 dated grains, only 27 were considered for age determination (Table 4 and Fig. 7), with the remaining grains with larger uncertainties and/or higher common Pb content discarded. These data produced a crystallization age of 288.7 ± 2.3 Ma (at the 95% confidence level, MSWD ¼ 1.4) based on 206Pb/238U weighted\nmean. Inside the population A, a younger set of 11 grains were identified and the calculated age based on 206Pb/238U average is 281.7 ± 3.2 Ma (at the 95% confidence level, MSWD ¼ 0.27). The depositional age considered here is the younger, 281.7 ± 3.2 Ma corresponding to the Kungurian (Cisuralian)."

    "text": "The age data obtained in this study indicate that deposition of the Rio Bonito Formation occurred between Sakmarian and\nof six grains in bold.\nKungurian corresponding to the Cisuralian, Early Permian. The tonstein are stratigraphically positioned between the coal-bearing succession of the Capan e and the Iruí Coal Mines (Fig. 8), implying a Permian age for these Rio Bonito Formation coal seams\nwhile most of the economic coal deposits worldwide are considered Carfoniferous in age.\nConsidering the ages uncertainties, our new data alongside previously published radiometric ages (Guerra-Sommer et al.,\nset of eleven grains in bold.\n2008a,c; Simas et al., 2012) suggest that the Capan e Coal Mine contains deposits older than the Le~ao, Faxinal, and Candiota coalfields (Fig. 3). Hence, the results presented here agree with the model proposed by Lavina and Lopes (1987), which states that the Rio Bonito and Palermo transgression occurred from the northwestern to eastern regions of central Rio Grande do Sul. In turn, this implies that deposits should become successively younger towards the east.\nAn uppermost (youngest) age of 281.4 ± 3.4 Ma (Mori et al., 2012) and a lowermost (oldest) age of 298.5 ± 2.6 Ma (Rocha Campos et al., 2006) for the Rio Bonito Formation recorded in the\nsouth of the Rio Grande do Sul show that deposition lasted 17.1 Ma (from 11.1 to 23.1 Ma considering the uncertainties), between the Asselian and Kungurian (Permian). In the central area, the radiometric ages range from 285.4 ± 8.6 Ma (Guerra-Sommer et al., 2008a) to 291 ± 1.2 Ma (Simas et al., 2012) corresponding to 5.6 Ma (from 1.8 to 15.4 Ma considering the uncertainties) of deposition interval time. In reality, the deposition probably took longer given that the Rio Bonito Formation extends below the levels dated in the Simas et al. (2012) study. More than 90 m of Rio Bonito occur below the tonstein layers in the DU-008-RS borehole (Fig. 4). The intervals of time estimated by radiometric dating conflicts with\nboreholes located in the Capan e and Iruí Coal Mines. The tonstein levels sampled in this ey of Brazil and National Department of Mineral Production.\nthe estimations based on cyclicity analysis that produced shorter durations of 4 Ma (Della F avera et al., 1992) and 2.4 Ma (Chaves, 2000) for the Rio Bonito Formation successions in the Candiota and Iruí Coal Mine areas, respectively.\nThe age difference between Tonstein-1 and Tonstein-2 is 8.9 ± 6.0 Ma, with this age gap represented in the sedimentary succession by approximately 5 m of fine-grained lithologies (Fig. 4). This time interval is probably related to the presence of depositional hiatuses resulted from erosional processes or sediment bypass. The occurrence of hiatuses in the Rio Bonito Formation is in agreement with the transgressive context of coastal and shallow marine systems.\nConsidering that deposition of the Rio Bonito Formation began in the Asselian or Ghzelian (CarboniferousePermian boundary) according to the older radiometric data published by Rocha-Campos et al. (2006) (Table 1), it is reasonable to conclude that the stratigraphic gap between the Itarar e Group and the Rio Bonito Formation in the southern Paran a Basin occurred between the Middle and the Upper Pennsylvanian, instead of at the CarboniferousePermian boundary (Guerra-Sommer et al., 2008b) or during the Early Permian (Souza, 2006; Holz et al., 2010). Consequently, the change from glacio-continental and glaciomarine facies in the Itarar e Group to fluvial and shallow marine in the Rio Bonito Formation suggests that the climate conditions had already changed during the Pennsylvanian. Coalbearing formations related to the CarboniferousePermian ages indicate that the climate had ameliorated. Warmer conditions during deposition of the Rio Bonito Formation are also identified by a higher floral diversity (Glossopteris-Brasilodendron Flora, Iannuzzi, 2010). These features conform with Gondwanan proxy isotopic records suggesting that the glaciers retreated and the climate warmed slightly in the late Pennsylvanian with warming peak having occurred in the KasimovianeGhzelian (Frank et al., 2008), interval between glacials II and III of Isbell et al. (2003b). Climatic warming is further supported by the absence of MoscovianeKasimovian glacial deposits in western and northern South America and eastern Australia (Isbell et al., 2003b; Limarino et al., 2013).\nAssuming that deposition of the Rio Bonito Formation occurred between the late Pennsylvanian and Cisuralian, deposition of the Itarar e Group probably occurred during the Early Pennsylvanian (Fig. 9). Fossil insects found in Itarar e Group deposits in the Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina have been attributed to the Carboniferous (Pinto, 1990, 1995, 2000; Pinto and Sedor, 2000). From palynologic zonation, the Itarar e Group is positioned between the Early Pennsylvanian and Early Cisuralian, corresponding to the Ahrensisporites cristatus (AcZ) Interval Zone to the Protohaploxypinus goraiensis Subzone of the Vittatina costabilis Interval Zone (VcZ) (Souza and Marques-Toigo, 2005; Souza, 2006). The lowermost units of the Itarar e Group are included in the AcZ, which are of Bashkirian to Kasimovian in age, and the uppermost units in the northeastern Paran a Basin is included in the VcZ interval zone, which is attributed to the Early Permian (Souza, 2006). The VcZ is the same Interval Zone identified in the Rio Bonito Formation records by Souza andMarques-Toigo (2005) andMori et al. (2012). No radiometric age data are available for units of the Itarar e Group, which makes it difficult to date this unit accurately. Therefore, based on our new data, we suggest that the Itarar e Group corresponds to the glacial II interval of Isbell et al. (2003b) and C1eC4 intervals of Fielding et al. (2008). Thus, our designation of the Itarar e Group does not agreewith Isbell et al. (2003b), who ascribed this unit to the glacial III interval.\nThe Palermo Formation is temporally constrained between the Sakmarian and the Kungurian stages of the Permian period, given that the documented marine transgression occurred from the\nnorthwest to the southeast of the central part of Rio Grande do Sul, and from south to north in the southern part. Two UePb radiometric ages obtained from lithostratigraphic units below and above these units were used to delimit the age of deposition of the Palermo Formation. The base of the Palermo Formation is constrained by an age of 281.4 ± 3.4 Ma (Mori et al., 2012), which corresponds to the uppermost deposits of the Rio Bonito Formation in the Candiota Coal Mine area. An age of 278.4 ± 2.2 Ma (Santos et al., 2006) obtained from middle deposits of the Irati Formation in Paran a was used to limit the topmost of the Palermo Formation. Other units of the Passa Dois Group were given approximate positions according to biostratigraphic data (Neregato et al., 2008).\nA comparative chart of the CarboniferousePermian deposits of southern Gondwana (Fig. 9) shows that the Rio Bonito Formation is temporally related to the Dwyka Group (Karoo Basin, South Africa) and the Patquia Formation (Paganzo Group, northwest Argentina), despite them having been deposited in different paleoenvironmental settings. The Patquia Formation records a monsoonal semi-arid regional climate (Gulbranson et al., 2010) whereas the Dwyka Group consists of four deglaciation sequences (Bangert et al., 1999). In addition, the ice sheet covered west Australia from Gzhelian to mid-Sakmarian (Mory et al., 2008). One possible reason for that is the different paleolatitudes of these basins (Fig. 10). For example, the Karoo Basin was likely located at the highest paleolatitude (near to the paleo South Pole), which accounts for the deglaciation sequences; conversely, the Paran a Basin was located at intermediate latitudes, and the Paganzo Group units likely formed in semi-arid conditions at the lowest latitudes.\nThe older radiometric age data obtained here (290.6 ± 2.8 Ma) are similar to those presented by Guerra-Sommer et al. (2006; 2008a,c) suggesting that the same volcanic event was the source of these ash fall beds. In the sameway, the younger radiometric age (281.7 ± 3.2 Ma) is similar to that published by Mori et al. (2012). According to L opez-Gamundi (2006), Santos et al. (2006), GuerraSommer et al. (2008a,b,c) and Mori et al. (2012), the ash fall beds occurring in the Paran a Basin succession are likely related to the Choiyoi volcanic province that was emplaced at the southwest margin of Gondwana. However, Rocha-Campos et al. (2011) analyzed the contemporaneity between the Choiyoi succession and the Late Paleozoic deposits of the Paran a Basin in terms of the available geochemical data and the thickness and granulometry of ash fall beds, and concluded that only the upper Permian deposits are related to Choiyoi province magmatism. UePb ages for the Choiyoi succession in the San Rafael block, western Argentina, indicate that igneous activity lasted at least 30 Ma from 281.4 to 251.9 Ma, which is also representative of the entire igneous province (Rocha-Campos et al., 2011). Before this period (during the Carboniferous) the magmatic arc was active to the west along the Paleo-Pacific margin (L opez-Gamundi et al., 1995; Kleiman and Japas, 2009)."

    "text": "New LA-ICP-MS UePb zircon age data presented in this study show that deposition of the Rio Bonito Formation occurred between the Sakmarian and Kungurian ages, implying a Permian age for the coal-bearing succession in the Capan e Coal Mine. Thus, radiometric ages already published indicate that the deposition had been initiated by the Ghzelian/Asselian (CarboniferousePermian boundary). This suggests that the conditions required to accumulate and preserve peat deposits were maintained, and that a climatic amelioration in the southern Paran a Basin had occurred in the Late Pennsylvanian, which agrees with proxy isotopic and sedimentological studies. The duration for deposition of the Rio Bonito Formation has been estimated to be at least 17.1 ± 6 Ma in\nthe southern and 5.6 þ 9.8/ 3.8 Ma in the central part of Rio Grande do Sul based on radiometric dating of zircon. Our age data also record depositional hiatuses between both ash fall beds, which can be explained by either erosion or non-deposition before peat accumulation. From our results, we can state that the Rio Bonito Formation comprises depositional sequences bounded by depositional hiatuses, thus resulting in low preservation rates for these units. Finally, the absolute chronostratigraphy presented here conflicts with biostratigraphic relative dating based on palynomorphs and plant fossils, but is consistent with relative dating based on insect wing morphologies. Radiometric ages obtained by LA-ICP-MS present higher uncertainties influencing in the stratigraphic interpretations. To obtain results with better precision the same samples will be analyzed using the methods of TIMS dating of zircon."

  "abstractText": "Two ash fall beds (tonstein) sampled from the post-glacial Permian deposits of the Paran a Basin have provided new UePb radiometric age constraints for this stratigraphic interval. The zircon grains were recovered from tonstein layers interbedded with fine-grained and carbonaceous lithologies in the middle portion of the Rio Bonito Formation. In both samples, the dominant population is interpreted as generated by explosive volcanism, as having formed immediately before the eruption. Based on 238U/206Pb, the selected zircon grains from the dominant population have weighted mean ages of 290.6 ± 2.8 Ma and 281.7 ± 3.2 Ma, corresponding to the Sakmarian and Kungurian ages in the Cisuralian epoch, respectively. These ages constrain the time of the deposition of the tonstein horizons and have important stratigraphic implications for the Late Paleozoic evolution of both the Paran a Basin and the southwestern region of Gondwana. The results presented here and the radiometric data already published suggest that deposition of the post-glacial coal-bearing deposits of the Rio Bonito Formation was probably initiated before the Early Permian. Thus, we infer that the climate had already ameliorated by this period in order to allow for the formation and accumulation of peat in this region of Gondwana. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
