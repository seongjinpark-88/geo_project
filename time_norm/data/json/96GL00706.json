  "abstractText": "An ~6-year long period of volcanic sulfate recorded in the GISP2 ice core about 71,100 + 5000 years ago may provide detailed information on the atmospheric and climatic impact of the Toba mega-eruption. Deposition of these aerosols occur at the beginning of an ~1000-year long stadial event, but not immediately before the longer glacial period beginning ~67,500 years ago. Total stratospheric loading estimates over this ~6-year period range from 2200 to 4400 Mt of H2SO4 aerosols. The range in values is given to compensate for uncertainties in aerosol transport. Magnitude and longevity of the atmospheric loading may have l•.d directly to enhanced cooling during the initial two centurie• of this ~1000-year cooling event.",
