    "text": "Plain Language Summary Submarine volcanism and associated hydrothermal systems are relevant processes for the evolution of the ocean basins, due their impact on the geochemistry of the oceans, their potential to form significant ore deposits, and their implications for global climate change, considering the heat transport, maturation of organic matter and the release of carbon-rich fluids associated to these systems. Hydrothermal vent complexes have been found all over the world in the fossil record related to large igneous provinces as those found in the North Atlantic margins. Nevertheless, studies focused on modern deep water magmatic hydrothermal systems are generally confined to ocean spreading centers, while scarce works address their study in deep oceanic intraplate basins. This study reports and documents for the first time the discovery of a recent deep water system of magmatic-induced hydrothermal vents at 4800–5200 m depth in an unexplored area of the Canary Basin (eastern central Atlantic), located about 500 km west of the Canary Islands. The analysis and interpretation of the newly acquired data set has shown that the study area is characterized by the presence of a huge magmatic complex of sills that intrudes the sedimentary sequence and exceptionally deep volcanoes so far unknown."

Nevertheless, there is little information about the occurrence of such magmatic-hydrothermal systems in the deep oceanic domain, as only ca. 10–15% of the deep ocean floor has presently been explored [Copley, 2014], and this almost exclusively at the mid-oceanic ridges.\nDeep water exploration of North Atlantic margins has revealed extensive buried intrusive complexes accompanying volcanic and hydrothermal activity during continental rifting and breakup in Mesozoic to Eocene times [Hansen and Cartwright, 2006; Magee et al., 2016], i.e., the Vøring and Møre basins in Norway [Berndt et al., 2001; Planke et al., 2005; Gay et al., 2012], Greenland [Larsen and Marcussen, 1992], the Faroe Islands [Gibb and Kanaris-Sotirou, 1988; Smallwood and Maresh, 2002], and the Rockall Trough [Thomson and Hutton, 2004; Thomson, 2007]. Most of these studies on the Atlantic margins result from petroleum exploration activity and have revealed a voluminous production of intrusive igneous bodies during the breakup process. Even though 3-D seismic data have provided significant information on continental margins, the deep oceanic basins remain quite unknown. Emplacement of these intrusions in sedimentary basins caused strong thermal perturbations and extensive hydrothermal activity forming striking hydrothermal vent complexes related to overpressured fluids. The hydrothermal complexes associated with these magmatic events have attracted the attention of petroleum explorationists due to their influence on heat transport and enhanced maturation of organic matter and fluid migration among others and the development of hydrocarbon traps [Hansen and Cartwright, 2006]. Magmatic intrusions can also have important implications for global climate, as has been postulated by Svensen et al. [2004] and recently by Berndt et al. [2016] and Reynolds et al. [2017]. They act as a heat source that promotes organic matter maturation in their host rock and can trigger CH4 and CO2-rich fluid production, releasing large amounts of carbon into the water column and the atmosphere through vent complexes [Iyer et al., 2013]. This has been used to support the hypothesis that the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, about 55 Ma, was caused by widespread magmatic systems in the North Atlantic, which triggered a massive release of carbon-rich fluids to the surface and to the atmosphere [Dickens, 2004; Svensen et al., 2004; Jourdan et al., 2008]. Similar volcanic and metamorphic processes may explain climate events associated with other large igneous provinces such as the Siberian Traps (ca. 250 Ma) and the Karoo Igneous Province (ca. 183 Ma) [Svensen et al., 2004].\nWe present here the results of new deep water exploration in the Canary Basin (eastern central Atlantic) which reveals the occurrence of a so far unknown volcanic-hydrothermal system related to massive intrusions of sills, forming recent seabed morphologies such as mounds, depressions, domes, and volcanic cones at water depths between 4800 and 5200 m (Figure 1). Multibeam echo sounder data, parametric echo sounder profiles, multichannel seismic data, dredges, and core samples were obtained between 2010 and 2013 during five oceanographic cruises carried out in the framework of the project for the Extension of the Continental Shelf of Spain west to the Canary Islands, according the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This data set covers an intraplate region between the mid-Atlantic ridge and the Canary Volcanic Province, which has never been explored so far (Figures 1a and 1b). The aim of this paper is to report, characterize, and map these magmatic-hydrothermal systems on the basis of this extensive data set. In addition, the genesis and development and timing of intraplate magmatism is analyzed in the framework of a Quaternary volcanic-hydrothermal episode in the Canary Basin."

    "heading": "2. Geological Background",
    "text": "The study area is located 500 km west of the Canary Islands, in the central part of the Canary Basin (eastern central Atlantic), which is bounded by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the west, the Madeira-Tore Rise in the northeast, and the Cape Verde Rise in the south. This basin includes the Canary Islands and the Madeira Island and a 1500 km stretch of the northwestern African continental margin (Figure 1a), where the lower segment of the continental slope, 0.18 steep, gives way to the abyssal plain that deepens westward, dropping down to 5400 m water depth [Palomino et al., 2016].\nThe Canary Basin is formed from Mesozoic oceanic crust created at slow spreading rates [Ranero et al., 1997]. A general decrease in the rate has been reported from Jurassic to Cretaceous times. Seafloor spreading rates fell during the Jurassic from 17 mm yr21 (magnetic anomalies M25-M21) to 10 mm yr21 (M21M16), a process that continued into Cretaceous times, when rates fell once more to 7–8 mm yr21 (M16-M5).\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3139\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3140\nThe survey area is located over Lower Cretaceous (Aptian) oceanic crust (120 Ma, magnetic anomaly M0) [Ranero et al., 1997]. The sea floor spreading fabric of this part of the central Atlantic has been studied by Klitgord and Schouten [1986] and Roest et al. [1992] and it is characterized by WNW-ESE trending fracture zones. The trace of these fracture zones is outlined by offsets in the magnetic anomalies and marked depressions in the oceanic basement draped by up to 2000 ms Two Way Travel Time (TWTT) of sediments [Ranero et al., 1997].\nDSDP Sites 137 and 138 [Hayes et al., 1972] located to the SW of the study area, on the flank of the Cretaceous Mid-Atlantic Ridge at about 5300 m water depth (Figure 1a), drilled an approximately 400 m thick sequence of Upper Cretaceous to Recent, pelagic to hemipelagic sediments, overlying serpentinized basalts with numerous calcite veins. Sediments on seismic profiles are well layered and only slightly disturbed, with highly continuous reflections that can be traced over large distances (Site 138) or are represented by fewer internal reflections (Site 137), suggesting a predominance of pelagic sediments. About 200–250 m of Tertiary to Quaternary clay, silt, and sand rest on 190–240 m of Cretaceous (late Albian to Maastrichtian) black shales, calcareous clays and marls. The black shales are of marine origin and are potentially excellent oil source rocks. The age of the lower and upper boundaries of the sequence in the eastern Atlantic can be established as Barremian-Aptian and Cenomanian to Campanian, respectively, with the most frequent age being Turonian. The Cretaceous black shale unit is composed of highly carbonaceous black and dark gray bituminous shales and marls which alternate with thin laminae of clay and marl [Jansa et al., 1978]. A mafic sill of lava flow with alkaline affinity was drilled at Site 138 at the base of the Upper Cretaceous sequence [Hayes et al., 1972]. Northward of the study area, a twofold subdivision was established by combining seismic and borehole data from the Ocean Drilling Program Sites 950–952 (Figure 1a) on the Madeira Abyssal Plain: a middle-upper Miocene to Holocene unit dominated by turbidites overlying a Coniacian to middle Eocene unit of pelagic clays [Rothwell et al., 1998].\nTo the east of the study area, the Canary Island Volcanic Province comprises numerous seamounts and volcanic edifices and seven major islands. The Canary Islands are located on Jurassic lithosphere but the emergence of the islands is Neogene in age. They are characterized by long-lasting volcanism which roughly progressed from east to west, from about 15–23 Ma for the eastern islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura [Coello et al., 1992; Ancochea et al., 1996; van den Boogard, 2013] to about 15 Ma for Gran Canaria [Schmincke, 1982], 8 Ma for Tenerife [Ancochea et al., 1990] and 1.1 Ma for the westernmost islands of La Palma and El Hierro [Staudigel et al., 1986; Guillou et al., 1996]. Several hypotheses have been put forward to account for their origin, but at present it is widely thought that the Canary Islands constitute a volcanic chain generated as the African plate moved over a mantle hotspot [e.g., Geldmacher et al., 2005; Carracedo et al., 2001]. Two alignments of seamounts have been found to the NE and SW of the Canary Islands that do not follow a clear age progression, but rather a random age distribution. Northeastward, a chain of seamounts predates the Canary Islands (Figure 1a). These seamounts are dated between 68 Ma (Lars Seamount) and >17 Ma in the Concepcion Bank [Geldmacher et al., 2005]. In contrast, the southwestern seamounts show ages varying from 142 Ma (Las Hijas seamounts) to 91 Ma (The Paps Seamount). Therefore, considering the lack of age progression and the distribution of these seamounts (Figures 1a and 1b), it has been proposed that they are not related to the volcanism that produced the Canary Islands [Zaczek et al., 2015]. In this sense, van den Boogard [2013] concluded that shallow mantle upwelling off the NW African continental lithosphere produced recurrent melting anomalies over time, giving rise to different seamount generations from Late Jurassic to Recent times.\nIn our study area, the only existing information is a recent preliminary analysis of the multibeam data set acquired during the GAROE-2010, GAIRE-2011, AMULEY-2012, and MAEC-SUBVENT1–2013 cruises, which revealed the occurrence of 39 isolated edifices and clustered mounds. These features have circular to elongated shapes with diameters of 2–24 km and heights of 10–250 m, showing flank slopes ranging from 2 to 508 [S anchez Guillam on et al., 2015]."

    "heading": "3. Data and Methods",
    "text": "This study is based on a data set (multibeam bathymetry, parametric echo sounder profiles, multichannel seismic data, dredges, and core samples) obtained over five oceanographic surveys carried out between\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3141\n2010 and 2013: GAROE-2010, GAIRE-2011, ZEEE-2011, AMULEY-ZEEE-2012, and MAEC-SUBVENT1–2013 on board the Spanish research vessels ‘‘Hesp erides’’ and ‘‘Sarmiento de Gamboa.’’\nThe data set comprises multibeam bathymetry collected using a hull mounted Simrad EM120 echo sounder during the ZEE-2011, GAROE-2010, AMULEY-ZEEE-2012, and MAEC-SUBVENT-2013 cruises, and an Atlas Hydrosweep DS echo sounder during the GAIRE-2011 survey (supporting information Figure S1). These systems operated at a frequency of 12–16 kHz with a vertical resolution of 10 m at 5000 m depth. Multibeam bathymetric data were processed with CARIS HIPS and SIPS software and were merged and gridded (150 m and 35 and 40 m for detailed images) with ArcGIS software, resulting in an almost 100% coverage. Highresolution seismic data were acquired simultaneously by means of a TOPAS PS 018 and ATLAS PS35 parametric echo sounders (1.5–5 kHz chirp pulse).\nThis study also utilizes 4.896 km of time-migrated 2-D seismic reflection profiles covering an area of 247,000 km2 in the Canary Basin (Figure 1a). Multichannel seismic profiles were acquired in 2011 during the GAIRE-2011 cruise aboard the ‘‘Sarmiento de Gamboa’’ research vessel in order to support the proposal for the Extension of the Spanish Continental Shelf west of the Canary Islands. The multichannel seismic system consisted of two arrays of air-guns with a total capacity of 6600 cubic inches and a 280 channel Sentinel digital streamer, 3500 m in length. The shooting interval was 50 m and the recording length was 15 s. Seismic data were poststacked time-migrated. An average resolution of 24 m has been calculated. Interval seismic velocities have been determined to depth-convert the sediment thickness. These velocities are in accordance with those reported in DSDP Sites 137–139 [Hayes et al., 1972]. The average compressional wave velocity for the sedimentary section is 2 km/s and is slightly lower (1.7 km/s) for the shallowest sediments. In order to complement the multichannel seismic data, one of the three 300–350 km long seismic profiles acquired in 1988 by the Instituto Geogr afico Nacional during the Canary-88 cruise was also used (supporting information Figure S1).\nWe have used different criteria to identified sill reflections on seismic profiles. A seismic event has been interpreted as a sill reflection considering the following criteria: high amplitude due to the impedance contrast with the host rocks, restricted lateral continuity and abrupt terminations, saucer shapes, and local transgressions [Planke et al., 2005; Magee et al., 2016]. All the seabed-related structures displayed on seismic profiles and bathymetric maps have been identified with a number in order to facilitate the location in all the figures and a color according to their classification (Figure 1).\nSamples were collected between 4200 and 5480 m depth with a rectangular rock dredge (2 3 0.8 m) and a 5 m long gravity corer during the MAEC-SUBVENT1–2013 cruise. A suite of 16 representative rock and sediment samples was selected for this work (supporting information Table S1). Petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical analyses were performed at the Laboratories of the Geological Survey of Spain (IGME), the Electron Microscopy National Center, and the Department of Petrology and Geochemistry of the Complutense University of Madrid. Mineralogical and petrographic analyses were carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron microprobe analysis (EPMA). Whole rock major, minor, and trace element contents including Rare Earth Elements plus Yttrium (REY) were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICPMS), and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Finally, dating of volcanic rocks was determined by the K-Ar method, where potassium and radiogenic 40Ar were measured by XRF and noble gas mass spectrometry, respectively, at the University of Tokyo [Sumino et al., 2001; Tani et al., 2002; Orihashi et al., 2004]. Detailed information about petrological, geochemical, and dating techniques can be found in the supporting information Text S1 and S2 and Tables S2 and S3)."

These morphologies are concentrated in a region of 30,000 km2 about 350 km west of El Hierro Island, named the ‘‘Subvent Area’’ after the research project during which this area was explored.

To our knowledge, no structures similar to those identified in this work have been previously recognized on seismic data within the Canary Basin."

    "heading": "4.1. Stratigraphic Setting",
    "text": "All the above mentioned structures have developed within a well layered sedimentary succession of 1–2 s (TWTT) in thickness, which drapes the Cretaceous oceanic basement (Figure 2), formed at the Mid-Atlantic spreading center. Sediment thickness closely correlates with the topography of this underlying oceanic basement. The top of the basement is not neatly defined due to the presence of numerous high-amplitude overlying reflections, which caused a poor seismic imaging of this horizon. Four major distinct seismic units (UK, LK-E, M, and LM-Q are observed (Figure 2). The lower UK unit fills the basement reliefs and contains slightly undulated reflections of low to very low seismic reflectivity. Its top is marked by a prominent unconformity. The distribution of this unit, reaching up to 800 ms (TWTT), is irregular, as it is only found in the deepest parts of the basin. The LK-E unit is characterized by parallel continuous reflections of low to medium amplitude and conspicuous high-amplitude reflections at the top. It shows a quite constant thickness of 600 ms (TWTT). The M unit has a thickness of 200–300 ms (TWTT) and is made up of continuous parallel reflections of medium amplitude. Finally, the LM-Q unit also displays parallel and continuous reflections and a thickness of 300–600 ms (TWTT). It is remarkable that its lower half is affected by numerous closely spaced vertical normal faults with small offsets in the vicinity of the structures piercing the sedimentary cover. Some erosional unconformities can be identified within this unit, sometimes related to chaotic facies.\nThe seismic sections cannot be tied to any available exploration well, as there are no boreholes drilled in the study region (Figure 1a). Nevertheless, a tentative correlation between seismic sections and DSDP Sites 137–140 [Hayes et al., 1972] and ODP Sites 950–952 [Rothwell et al., 1998] and 958 [Firth et al., 1996] located in the Madeira Abyssal Plain and south of the Canary Basin allows us to make a proposal for the age of the seismic units. UK and LK-E units would be dated as late Albian to early Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) and late Cretaceous-Eocene (Campanian to middle Eocene), respectively, whereas a Miocene age is attributed to the M unit and a late Miocene to Recent age to the LM-Q unit (Figure 2)."

    "heading": "4.2. Sill Complexes",
    "text": "Numerous prominent seismic events representing sills can be clearly identified in the Canary Basin seismic lines, in the Subvent Area (Figure 1b), showing characteristic high amplitudes and abrupt terminations\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3143\n(Figure 3). The intrusions, which we have named as the Subvent Sill Complex, are predominantly emplaced close to the top of the basement (900–1600 mbsf), intruding the upper Cretaceous to Eocene sedimentary succession (Figure 3), and only in some cases at higher stratigraphic levels in the early Miocene (Figure 3a). Sills are estimated to be found between 900 and 1600 m below seafloor (bsf). In general, as the oceanic basement becomes higher, the sills intrude at shallower levels. The petrography and age of these intrusions is unknown as they have not been drilled by any borehole so far.\nReflections related to sills (Figure 3) are predominantly layer parallel, and inclined or planar transgressive, crosscutting stratal reflections, although they also display saucer shapes [e.g., Planke et al., 2005; Magee et al., 2015]. Subhorizontal parallel sills can extend along up 3 km (Figures 3a and 3b), probably favored by layering and do not show a preferential distribution in depth. Figure 3a displays a set of this kind of sills of about 33– 36 m thick (assuming a sill velocity of 5.5 km/s after Thomson and Hutton [2004] and Planke et al. [2005]), located between 7.2 and 7.5 s (TWTT). Saucer-shaped sills (Figures 3c and 3d) consist of a roughly flat inner base connected to an inclined outer rim by an inclined sheet and sometimes appear superposed [Planke et al., 2005]. These sills also show lengths of up to 2.5 km and are emplaced at depths of 1000–1400 m below seafloor, considering an average velocity of 2 km/s for the sedimentary succession). The average thickness of\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3144\nthis type of sills can reach 38–44 m. Inclined sills display lengths of up to 2.5 km and sometimes show a stepping pattern (Figures 3e and 3f). Stacked sills or merged sills of different geometries are frequently observed. The former are usually connected through a set of vertical disrupted reflections (Figure 3b).\nOn seismic profiles, bending upward and uplift of the overlying sedimentary rocks is observed above sill intrusions and thus, some of the sills are overlain by convex reflections forming dome-shaped uplifts. In other cases, offset reflections are developed from the tip of the sills upward (Figures 3a and 3c)."
  }, {
    "heading": "4.3. Sill-Related Structures",
    "text": "Three major types of structures linked to sill intrusions have been recognized in the Subvent Basin piercing the sedimentary sequence. These structures range from small to large scale, and produce conspicuous reliefs in the seabed (Figure 1c) overlying long columns connected to the formerly described intrusions. In addition, scattered volcanic cones have also been mapped. 4.3.1. Type I Structures: Mound With Depressions This first type of structures is represented by the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound, a huge seabed swell, 22 km long and 15 km wide, with a NE-SW elliptical shape in plan view (Figures 1 and 4 and Table 1). This structure, found at 4875 m depth, is about 78 m higher than the surrounding seafloor considering the total relief. The bathymetric map and high-resolution seismic profiles show an irregular topography promoted by the occurrence of linear depressions and ridges that cross the whole swell with a NE-SW trend (Figure 4a). An axial main depression of 1300–3200 m in width and 25 m depth, is found in the central part of the mound (Figure 4b), bounded by NE-SW and NNE-SSW scarps. To the northwest of this depression, a segmented ridge of 3700 m long extends with a NE-SW trend. On high-resolution seismic profiles, the recent sediments are represented by an uppermost layer of 25 ms (TWTT) characterized by parallel continuous reflections that overlies a highly deformed transparent layer of 12 ms (TWTT), which extends along the whole ‘‘Garo e’’ structure (Figure 4c).\nThe ‘‘Garo e’’ mound is developed on a Cretaceous to Quaternary sedimentary cover of about 1000 m thickness. The NE-SW central seabed depression is bounded laterally by two major faults with a length of 1.1 s (TWTT), which connect this structure to sill intrusions over an oceanic basement high (Figure 4d) and reach all the way up to the seafloor. Both faults are seismically imaged as disrupted and offset reflections. At both sides of the faults, reflections are bent up and show a concave pattern (Figures 4d and 4e). On the symmetric flanks of the top of the oceanic basement high, several inclined high-amplitude reflections correspond to vertically stacked sill intrusions. These sills terminate upward close to two high-amplitude horizons slightly undulated that extend to both sides of the basement high at about 680 m. These outstanding reflections extend more than 35 km eastward and 20 km westward.\nEast and west of the depression (Figures 4d and 4e), closely spaced small faults are found. These faults terminate up and down at the same stratigraphic levels, i.e., between 6.8 and 7.2 ms TWTT (about 515 mbsf). On the western flank and close to the seafloor, a concave unconformity can be observed at both sides of the central depression, which is marked by a light green dashed line in Figure 4f. 4.3.2. Type II Structures: Domes The Subvent Basin displays numerous seafloor domes, which are mainly subcircular, but also elongated in plan view, with low to moderate relief (10–69 m), and smooth convex flanks showing slopes of 3–98 (Figures 1 and 5 and Table 1). No surrounding depressions are observed. Domes are mainly found to the NE of the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound at 4875 m depth, grouped in an area of about 35 3 35 km, but also to the SW (Figure 1c). Isolated domes with similar external geometry have been also identified close to the volcanic cones in the ‘‘Tenores’’ field (Figure 1c).\nThese domes, which are the most numerous among the recognized seabed structures, are found directly over the lateral tips of deeper sill intrusions and in contrast to other structures found, they show a clearly organized internal structure. In this sense, no destruction of the sedimentary layering is observed on top of the sills, which are overlain by dome-shaped bulges (Figure 6). The architecture of the domes is clearly imaged on multichannel seismic lines and consists from bottom to top of (a) saucer-shaped or inclined sills at the base, (b) a lense-shaped acoustically attenuated zone (CR in Figure 6e), and (c) a vertical set of convex continuous and parallel reflections, which generally terminate at the sea floor and form a seabed dome (Figure 6e). They form vertical columns of 1–1.5 s (TWTT) long and 2.5 km wide above the sills, which represent\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3145\nthe depth and the length of the sill respectively. This structure is flanked by disrupted and slightly offset reflections developed at both edges of the sill (Figures 6a, 6c, and 6d) or only one edge (Figures 6b).\nOn high-resolution seismic profiles (Figures 5c–5e), the domes at the seabed show a similar image: a vertical set of broken reflection bounds the domes (Figure 5), which display convex parallel reflections of highfrequency overlying almost transparent facies. At both sides of the domes, well-layered sediments slightly undulated (Figure 5c) to highly deformed (Figure 5e), are observed. This deformed layer is overlain by\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3146\nonlapping parallel and flat reflections of 15–20 ms thickness (Figure 5e). At about 30 ms (TWTT) from the sea floor a wedge-shaped transparent layer of 20–30 ms (TWTT) always appears, sometimes offset (Figure 5c). In Figure 5d a well-defined area of acoustic blanking stands out at the base of the dome encased in fine-layered sediments. At the top of this dome 14 (Figure 5d), a transparent thin column can be observed in the central part. This feature is also identified on a multichannel seismic section which crosses this dome (Figures 6e and 6f), where it is imaged as overlying broken and offset convex reflections in the central part of the dome. 4.3.3. Type III Structures: Cone-Ring Complexes This type of structure is represented by two groups of cone-ring complexes to the SE of the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound at 4900 m depth: a group of three complexes named as the ‘‘Tenores,’’ 25–40 km to the SE of the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound (1–3 in Figure 1 and Table 1) and another group of isolated complexes surrounded by domes that constitutes the ‘‘Gaire’’ field (7 in Figure 1).\nThe ‘‘Tenores’’ edifices are represented on the seabed by three subcircular cones of 103, 228, and 243 m height (1–3 in Figures 1c, 7, and 8) and 4 km in diameter with steep slopes of up to 238. All of them display surrounding depressions bounded by an outer ring with more gentle slopes of 158 (Figures 8a–8c). These seabed edifices show a bicone shape (two cones pointing upward and downward) with a chaotic seismic configuration (Figure 7b). High-resolution seismic profiles show irregular and undulating reliefs on the sea floor and inward-dipping reflections at the boundary with the transparent seabed cone (Figure 8e). On multichannel seismic profiles, these cones topped vertical columns of 1.5–1.8 s high (TWTT) and 2500 m wide, interrupting the reflections of the sedimentary sequence (Figures 7c and 7e). The upper segments of these vertical cylindrical columns (400–500 ms TWTT) show discontinuous high-amplitude reflections sometimes bent downward and quite chaotic, flanked by lateral wings that extend at both sides. Along these columns, the seismic signature progressively changes to attenuated and eventually quite transparent facies downward. Numerous broken reflections related to small fractures along the chimney are observed (Figures 7c and 7d). The strongest change in seismic signature takes places quite abruptly below the base of the highly faulted interval, where the reflections are broken between 6.6 and 6.9 s TWTT (Figure 7f).\nTable 1.

HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3147\nThe vertical columns, anchored at the top of the basement at 8.1–8.4 s (TWTT), offers a strong contrast with the well layered host sediments, characterized by parallel continuous reflections (Figures 7c and 7e). Numerous high-amplitude horizontal reflections 2.5 km long, probably representing sills, are observed at different depths on both sides of the lower part of the column. These sills are also recognized at the top of the basement, parallel to the stratification or inclined and crosscutting the sediment reflections. All these intrusive features produce doming of the reflections upward.\nThe second group of structures consists of lower and gentler edifices represented by seabed cones about 90 m high with slopes of 10–128 (Figure 9). Figure 9a shows one of these hydrothermal-volcanic complexes,\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3148\nwhere three cones tower over a convex-up mound of 1.5 km of maximum diameter. This seabed edifice overlies a wide column of broken and offset reflections that become chaotic and quite attenuated downward (Figure 9b). Between 7.2 and 8 s (TWTT) high-amplitude reflections are found. The column is flanked\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3149\nMEDIALDEA ET AL.

The entire group of structures, named as the ‘‘Gaire’’ field, has a width of 15 km. An array of small normal faults is identified at shallow levels.\nIn addition to the structures described above, several isolated volcanoes of 73–170 m high scattered all over the area of the Subvent Basin, represented by steep-sided NE-SW (12.5–158) elongated edifices on the bathymetric map (Figure 1 and Table 1). On seismic profiles, these volcanoes are imaged as cone-like structures of 500–1000 m high, developed directly over oceanic basement highs (Figure 10). Cones show lateral wings that are clearly outlined on seismic images interbedded with the host sedimentary rocks, showing a Christmas tree geometry (Figure 10b). A fault array between 7 and 7.3 ms (TWTT) is found at both sides of the volcano edifice (Figure 10a)."

HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3152\ninformation on the nature and geochemistry of rocks and sediments. A gravity core performed on the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound recovered only the first 2.61 mbsf, which consist of brown to ochre hemipelagic calcareous muds rich in foraminifera and cocolith skeletons. The same muds were also recovered from one core taken on dome 5 (Figure 1, TG04), in the ‘‘Gaire’’ field, and two cores from volcanic cone 16 (TG13 and TG14) at the center of the ‘‘Papas Arrugas’’ field (supporting information Table S1).\nOn the ‘‘Tenores’’ field, several dredges and gravity cores were successfully obtained (supporting information Table S1). On the ‘‘Tenor’’ cone 1, four cores (TG15, TG16, TG17, and TG18) penetrated up to 2.81 mbsf (Figure 8a). Among them, TG18 core, at the ring of the ‘‘Tenor’’ cone 1 has provided very significant information displaying three main sections differentiated on the basis of textural features, microfossils, sediment color, major and trace element geochemistry and mineralogy (Figure 8d): (a) the upper section (0–2.37 mbsf) is dominated by the same brown to ochre hemipelagic calcareous muds sampled in ‘‘Garo e,’’ dome 5 and volcanic cone 16; (b) the intermediate section (2.37–2.44 mbsf) formed by dark brown-black volcanic tephra deposits dark brown-black in color; and (c) the lower blue-green section (2.44–2.61 mbsf) is formed by intensely hydrothermally altered mafic rocks. The latter are highly fractured, displaying breccia textures in which olivine and pyroxene crystals are completely replaced by phyllosilicates and quartz-chalcedony. Phyllosilicates include abundant Al-smectite (Fe-beidellite-montmorillonite), and minor amounts of palygorskite, kaolinite, and illite. Chemically, the Fe-beidellites in these altered-rocks have higher Al2O3 and Fe2O3 contents (up to 36 and 17 wt %, respectively), than palygorskite and montmorillonite (supporting information Table S2 and S3). Core TG15, TG16, and TG17 also recovered tephra layers at 1.60, 2.09–2.14, and 0.74– 0.78 mbsf, respectively (supporting information Table S4 and Figure S3).\nIn the ‘‘Tenor’’ cone 2 (Figures 1c and 8b), relatively fresh vesicular olivine basalts were dredged on the volcano surface (DA02, Figure 8f). They show a porphyritic texture with around 10 vol % of small olivine phenocrysts, usually including minute grains of euhedral opaque minerals, and scarce pinkish (Ti-rich) clinopyroxene phenocrysts. Basaltic tephra deposits, similar to those dredged in ‘‘Tenor’’ cone 1, were also sampled at 0.88–1.24 mbsf and 1.81–1.91 mbsf (TG01, supporting information Figure S3). These tephras show analogous petrographic features to those of vesicular olivine basalts. In the ‘‘Tenor’’ cone 3 (Figures 1c and 8c), pahoehoe mafic lavas were dredge (DA-03) and tephra deposits were recognized by coring at 1.47–1.50 mbsf (TG03, supporting information Figure S3). Figures 8g and 8h display some of the rock fragments dredged (DA03) that consist of highly vesicular lavas (6–20 vol % vesicles) with abundant (50–70 vol %) glassy and relatively fresh groundmass (Figure 8g). K-Ar dating of these volcanic rocks acquired in the ‘‘Tenores’’ 2 and 3 cones has yielded ages between 0.78 6 0.05 and 1.61 6 0.09 Ma (Table 2).\nAll volcanic samples recovered by dredging and coring (Figures 8d, 8f, 8g, and 8h) have broadly similar geochemical characteristics (supporting information Table S2). They are classified as basanites (supporting information Figure S4) based on the total alkalis-silica diagram of Le Maitre [1989], which is the most\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3153\nabundant and typical rock type of the Canary Islands and the dominant in the El Hierro Island rifts with recent activity [Pellicer, 1977; Carracedo et al., 2001]. All samples belong to the strongly alkaline series characteristic of OIBs, which is also reflected on their trace elements patterns. In this way, rare earth spectra show typical steep patterns with LREE enrichment over HREEs and multielement diagrams are also similar to OIBs.\nThe blue-green altered rocks in the ‘‘Tenores’’ 1 cone, dominated by K-rich phyllosilicate minerals, exhibit chemical trends also similar to those of the OIB tephras overlying them (supporting information Figures S4b and S4c), but enriched in large ion litophile elements (Rb, Th) and heavy rare earths, both of which are easily accommodated in the large sites of the phyllosilicate crystal structures. Low-temperature hydrothermal alteration of basalts (precursor) gives rise to great chemical and mineralogical changes. These changes include oxidation, hydration, alkali update and loss of Ca, Na, and Mg as a result of the complete breakdown of olivine and plagioclase to phyllosilicates. Consequently, these altered rocks have gained significant amounts of SiO2, Al2O3, K2O, Rb, LOI and many have clearly lost Fe2O T 3, MnO, MgO, Na2O, and CaO. These altered rocks are also slightly enriched in Pb and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), but depleted in transition metals (Cu, Ni, Co) and light rare earth elements (LREEs), compared to the overlying unaltered volcanic rocks."

    "text": "The different types of structures described above surround the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound (Figures 1c and 11a), which is the largest one of the Subvent Basin. Some are grouped in fields dominated either by domes or cones and others occur isolated. Northeast of the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound, the ‘‘Papas Arrugas’’ field is made up of at least nine domes (Figure 1c). Likewise, southeast of the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound, two clusters of seabed edifices are recognized: the closest one corresponds to a cone-ring complex surrounded by three domes that constitute the ‘‘Gaire’’ field, whereas in the more distant cluster, another three complexes and two domes stand out forming the ‘‘Tenores’’ field. Westward two additional clusters are also found, one composed of volcanic edifices to the NW of the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound and another formed by elongated and rounded domes to the SW. Other isolated volcanic edifices appear with a random distribution.\nThe distribution of these different types of structures in the Subvent Basin also deserves a detailed analysis. The ‘‘Garo e’’ mound is located on a basement high (supporting information Figure S2), whereas the other structures are developed in deeper parts of the Subvent Basin (Figure 11a). The volcanic cones are found on isolated basement highs at 6.3–6.5 s (TWTT) from the sea level, rising from the basin. The domes extend from 7.2 to 7.8 s (TWTT) to the seabed, whilst the ‘‘Tenores’’ cone-ring complexes have developed in small subbasins with an elevated sediment thickness, where the top of the basement reaches about 8.1–8.4 s (TWTT)."

In this region, at least 39 seabed structures have been identified on bathymetric and seismic reflection data (Figure 1c). Considering both the seismic images and the samples described in previous sections, we conclude that all of the identified structures have grown by intrusive activity at the top of the oceanic basement and at different levels upward in the stratigraphic record and by extrusive activity, resulting in the formation of different types of volcanic-hydrothermal structures.\nOn the basis of the type of linked-sill intrusions, the seabed morphology, the bypass system and the basin setting, we have differentiated three main types of hydrothermal-volcanic structures in the Subvent Area\nTable 2.

The three types correspond to hydrothermal vent depressions (type I), hydrothermal domes (type II) and volcanic-hydrothermal complexes (type III). Some of them hold strong similarities with those identified on seismic data in the More and Vøring basins (Norway) in the North Atlantic formed in the Paleocene-Eocene [Planke et al., 2005; Gay et al., 2012] and in the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California [Berndt et al., 2016]. We interpret the development of all these structures as a consequence of an important magmatic event where intrusive activity seems to prevail over extrusive activity and whose age would be farther discussed."

    "heading": "5.1. Relationship Between Intrusive/Extrusive Magmatism and the Hydrothermal Systems",
    "text": "Seismic data clearly document the striking spatial correlation between the seismic imaged intrusive sills, the sampled volcanic rocks and the wide spectrum of seabed structures described (Figures (3 and 6), and 8). The buildup of volcanic cones on the seabed is due to the extrusive activity whereas domes, mounds, and depressions can be spatially associated with an extensive intrusive complex: the ‘‘Subvent Intrusive Complex.’’ Moreover, the analysis of seismic profiles reveals not only the location of hydrothermal vent complexes above the tips of sill reflections, but also the relationship between the different types of seabed complexes and the geometry and distribution of the intrusive bodies.\nThe Subvent Intrusive Complex is dominated by sills, which can infiltrate weakness zones as, for example, the interfaces between sedimentary strata (Figure 7c). The propagation of these intrusions, fed from an underlying source, can also be controlled by the regional stress orientation, by the presence of fractures and faults in the host rock and by changes in the properties of the host rocks [Pollard, 1973]. Sills in the Subvent Area display different shapes, as has also been reported in other North Atlantic locations such as the Norwegian margin [Planke et al., 2005], the Faroe Islands [Smallwood and Maresh, 2002], or the North Rockall Trough [Thomson and Hutton, 2004]. From the study of the seismic data, we can conclude that the different types of hydrothermal-volcanic structures are associated with different shapes and geometries of sills. The most frequent geometries are layer parallel, saucer-shaped and inclined sills (Figures 3a, 3c, and 3e, respectively). Inclined sheets are associated with the development of depressions at one of the tips of the sills (Figure 4d). On the other hand, formation of a vertical stack of flat-lying sills is favored by layering in the host rock, which facilitates lateral spreading at different levels (Figure 7c). This vertical stack of sills is related to the formation of volcanic-hydrothermal complexes with long seismic chimneys. Finally, saucer-shaped and inclined sills promote the growth of large domes on the seabed (Figure 6). The former promotes the development of large rounded domes on the seafloor, whereas the latter are associated with more elongated geometries.\nThe occurrence of domes and cones grouped in fields (e.g., the ‘‘Gaire’’ field, Figure 1c) may indicate the existence of a variety of feeding intrusive bodies at different depth levels that can be connected to the same deep intrusive source. This is similar to what is observed in the feeder intrusive systems exposed, either by erosion or by volcanic landslides, in the Canary Islands. In Fuerteventura, the oldest island of the archipelago, outcropping dyke swarms with associated sills are the feeder system linking the Miocene volcanic edifices and the Basal Complex plutonic bodies [Ancochea et al., 1996] and this scheme is also observed at the Barranco de las Angustias in the island of La Palma, which is one of the two youngest Canary Islands [Staudigel et al., 1986].\nThe importance of intrusive systems lies in the generation of hydrothermal vent complexes in the sedimentary basin. Hydrothermal vents act as conduits for fluids and gas phases originated within the contact aureole of the associated sill intrusion [Jamtveit et al., 2004; Planke et al., 2005; Gay et al., 2012]. According to experimental and analogue modeling [e.g., Mathieu et al., 2008; Galland et al., 2009; Aarnes et al., 2010; Iyer et al., 2013], boiling of pore fluids and fluids released by magma degassing and during metamorphic dehydration reactions due to sediment heating in the contact aureole, will result in a large volume increase and fluid overpressure and subsequent hydrofracturing and upward migration of hot fluids [Iyer et al., 2013]. Boiling of fluids only occurs to a depth of less than 1 km, below which the fluids are supercritical [Hovland et al., 2014]. Hydrofracturing at greater depths is instead caused by the release of large volumes of lowdensity gas phases such as CO2, CH4, and SO2 during thermal maturation of the heated sediments [e.g., Aarnes et al., 2010; Iyer et al., 2013]. Methane might migrate to the seafloor and vent into the water column through these hydrothermal complexes.\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3156\nConsidering the depth to the seafloor (4800–5200 m) in addition to the depth from the seabed to the sill intrusions in the Subvent Area (900–1600 m) (Figure 11a), the high temperature and the occurrence of organic-rich sediments (Upper Cretaceous black shales rich in organic matter) close to the sills location, release of greenhouse gases such as CH4 and CO2 is expected to formed by contact metamorphism in aureoles around sill intrusions. This release will be responsible of hydrofracturing of overburden strata and upward fluid migration forming vertical chimneys and pipes imaged on seismic sections as disrupted and offset reflections (i.e., Figure 6). The bypass systems extend from the tip of sills to the present seafloor (Figures 11a), pointing to the triggering of hydrothermal activity at the time of the sill intrusion."

    "text": "The ‘‘Garo e’’ mound is the largest structure and perhaps the longest-lived one of the region. The depression at its center resembles the crater-shaped hydrothermal vent reported in the Vøring Basin by Planke et al. [2005]. Unfortunately, none of the samples recovered can testify the presence of hydrothermal or volcanic deposits as only shallow hemipelagic muds were recovered. The depression is built over a basement high (Figures 4e, 11a, and 11b), which is interpreted as an old seamount formed in the early stages of the oceanic basin development back in the Cretaceous. This volcano was subsequently buried by Upper CretaceousEocene (UK and LK-E) units. The high amplitude of the two horizons near and at the top of LK-E unit (Figure 3e), extending laterally on both sides of the basement high, is due to the impedance contrast with the adjacent sediments and would represent two extensive lava flows. If the age assigned to LK-E unit is correct (Figure 2), this volcanic episode could have taken place by Eocene times. At this time, a voluminous intrusive event also took place in the NE Atlantic, related to Paleocene/Eocene continental rifting and breakup [Planke et al., 2005; Hansen and Cartwright, 2006]. The present appearance of the mound was acquired after reactivation of the magmatic activity and faulting in recent times. Updoming produced by increasing magma pressure could have eventually given rise to host rock ruptures promoting the emplacement of a swarm of sill intrusions. Faults, extending from the tip of the inclined sills to the seabed, were probably used by the sill-expelled fluids to migrate to the seafloor (Figures 11a and 11b). Phase separation of these pore fluids and gas formation at the tip of the inclined sills may have caused fluid pressure buildup, leading to explosive formation of a cone-shaped hydrothermal vent complex [Gay et al., 2012; Planke et al., 2005]. The shallowest concave unconformity on the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound (Figure 4f) is probably related with the last episode of activity, that was followed by subsidence and collapse at both sides of the mound, especially to the west, where onlapping sediments are thicker (150 ms TWTT).\nMagmatic doming and slight upward bending of the overload related to a local mantle upwelling has also been proposed for the origin and the initial stages of growth of the rift zones in other Canary Islands such as Tenerife [Carracedo and Troll, 2013]. These rift zones concentrate the recent eruptive activity and form the main reliefs in the island, whose internal structure consists of a dense swarm of dykes. The seabed image of the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound displays some ridges that could be interpreted as formed by aligned clusters of emission centers going over the flanks (Figure 4a). It is proposed that the construction of these ridges is associated with intrusive bodies as those located at the top of the basement high, and that their growth and development upward is accomplished through the fractures bounding the central depression. The intrusions would be oriented approximately parallel to the axis of the ridge. 5.2.2. Hydrothermal Domes The study of the genesis of the Subvent Area domes must start from the outstanding correspondence between them and the spatial distribution of underlying inclined and saucer-shaped sills (Figures 6 and 11). These domes bear a strong resemblance with those derived from models and experiments developed by Hansen and Cartwright [2006], Mathieu et al. [2008], and Galland et al. [2009] to explain the formation of saucer-shaped sills.\nAfter the observation of the seismic profiles, different stages can be differentiated in the growth of these domal complexes, which is driven by the development of inclined, but mainly saucer-shaped sill intrusions (Figure 6). Experiments carried out by Iyer et al. [2013] indicate that on a first-stage heating of fluids results in their flow toward the edges of the sill and the generation of a plume of hot fluids rooted at both ends of the intrusion (Figure 12a). At these high pressures and temperatures found near the intrusion, supercritical water vapor (ScriW) may have been released and migrate upward [Hovland et al., 2014] and CH4 and CO2-rich fluid reservoirs (CR in Figures 6e, 11d, and 11e) may formed by contact metamorphism of organic-rich\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3157\nsediments around sill intrusions (Figure 12b). Gradual expansion and thickening of the sill intrusion caused uplift of the overburden along reverse faults that bound the flexed host material (peripheral faults in Figures 6e, 11, and 12c), resulting in the formation of a dome at the surface. There is strong evidence on the seismic profiles for a vertical link between the tips of the sills and the domes, expressed as vertical narrow seismic chimneys of disrupted and offset reflections related to peripheral faults (Figures 3c and 6e).\nThe formation of convex reflectors above the saucer-shaped sills require that the local fluid pressure becomes larger that the lithostatic pressure. Hansen and Cartwright [2006] have proposed that a forced fold (FF in Figure 12b) with a structural relief is formed at the seabed, after a sill has spread over a distance of approximately two times the depth of intrusion. This rate is similar to that observed on seismic profiles, where the diameter of the saucer-shaped sills (2.5 km) reaches about two times the depth of intrusion (about 1400 m, considering an average velocity of 2 km/s). According to the experimental laboratory\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3158\nmodels of Mathieu et al. [2008] and Galland et al. [2009], as the thickness in the central part and the curvature of the folded overburden increases due to the intrusion growth, fractures, or faults are formed on the convex part of the forced fold (Figure 12c). This mechanism can account for the genesis of craters as the one found at the center of dome 5, linked to a fault (Figure 9b), that can favor upward migration of magma from sills [Thompson, 2007], pointing to the possible occurrence of extrusive episodes.\nThe intrusive episode and faulting and uplift of the overburden must be very recent as can be inferred from the detailed observation of high-resolution seismic profiles (Figures 5c–5e), where thin shallow transparent layers that laterally disappear are observed at the top and the sides of the domes. They represent a sedimentary sequence of mud with a high-fluid content due to fluid injections through lateral faults (Peripheral faults in Figure 12c), subsequent to the emplacement of magmatic sills. These shallow transparent layers are folded and offset by the faults bounding the dome (Figures 5e and 12c). On Figure 5d, acoustic blanking at one side of the domes also provides evidence of the presence of fluids [Judd and Hovland, 2007; Løseth et al., 2009; Gay et al., 2011] in very recent muddy sediments (Figure 12b). These transparent layers in the domes are similar to the identified shallow layer in the ‘‘Garo e’’ mound (Figure 4c). 5.2.3. Hydrothermal-Volcanic Complexes We have differentiated hydrothermal-volcanic complexes in the ‘‘Tenores’’ and ‘‘Gaire’’ fields. Regarding the type and distribution of their associated sill intrusions, these complexes can be classified as: stratified (Figure 11f) and branched (Figure 11g). The former is constituted by a plumbing system composed by a vertical chimney with lateral migration of strata-concordant sills and topped with a single volcanic cone and the latter is composed of an inverted tree-shaped plumbing system with a volcanic cone at their top surrounded by a branched divergent system of inclined sills topped by domes. 5.2.3.1. Stratified Hydrothermal-Volcanic Complex The architecture of these stratified complexes strongly differs from that of their nearby structures (Table 1), considering its location on deep basins with a thick sedimentary succession and the occurrence of a deep and long vertical column anchored at the top of the basement, which is interpreted as the chimney or conduit that feeds the whole hydrothermal-volcanic system (Figures 7 and 11f).\nIn the case of the ‘‘Tenores’’ structures, the suite of horizontal sills found at different depths could be interpreted as a radial swarm linked to the central conduit (Figure 11f). This configuration would be generated when the rate of magma input and its volume were insufficient to raise the magma and then, sills intruded laterally at a level where the magma pressure can overcome the lithostatic pressure and tensile strength of the sediments (Figure 12d). Due to the increase in the lithostatic pressure and the tensile strength as sills are progressively added, the younger sills were intruded at higher levels in such a way that the sill complex is built up vertically and horizontally [Einsele, 1985; Gibb and Kanaris-Sotiriou, 1988].\nThe central conduit or chimney is rooted into the basement (Figure 12e) and it is characterized by chaotic and low amplitude seismic facies that can be related to ascending melts and/or fluids that completely disturb the sediment layering. Large fluid pressure buildup due to fluid migration from sills toward the surface and expansion would promoted fracturing and brecciation of the overburden. The chimney is made up of numerous fractures related to hydraulic fracturing (Figure 7d). Intrusive bypass is one of the ‘‘bypass system’’ groups recognized by Cartwright et al. [2007], defined as geological features that promote cross-stratal fluid migration and allow fluids to bypass (Figure 12e). The formation of these structures requires a local larger fluid pressure than the hydrostatic pressure. According to Jamtveit et al. [2004], this overpressure build-up can only occur if the pressure buildup is faster than the pressure release, i.e., if the host-rock permeability is small and the pressure generation is fast [Planke et al., 2005]. The outbuilding of the seabed edifice with a bicone shape is the consequence of the collapse and subsidence that follow the construction of the edifice, a process in the evolution represented by downward dipping reflections in the hosting sediments (Figure 12e) and by the development of rim depressions (Figures 8a–8c and 12e). The recovered samples in ‘‘Tenores’’ 1–3 cones display the occurrence of tephra layers overlain by lava flows that would represent reactivation of volcanic activity after a quiescence period.\nGravity cores document that the ‘‘Tenores’’ edifices consist of hydrothermal and volcanic deposits. We suggest that vigorous hydrothermal circulation took place through the seismic chimney piercing the upper crust and promoting alteration at shallow-levels, sampled by cores (Figure 8d). The intensive alteration of the blue-green muds and their restriction to the core bottom immediately beneath the fresh basaltic tephra deposit, suggest that hydrothermal alteration occurred on the seafloor previously to the deposition of the\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3159\npyroclastic tephra, not affected by hydrothermalism. The original volcanic rocks (basalts) were probably altered through reaction with low-temperature hydrothermal fluids that transformed and silicified them (Figure 12f).\nWe suggest that the abundant Al-rich smectite (beidellite) assembles of the blue-green clays, testified in the core TG18 at the rings surrounding the ‘‘Tenores’’ structures (Figures 8a–8c), have been formed by hydrothermal alteration of volcanic rocks. The intrusion of alkali basalt magma sills may have also provided the heat source necessary to drive the hydrothermal system (Figure 8d). The extensive fracturing focused fluid flow and facilitated the alteration of the rocks with high seawater/rock ratios. Near the seafloor, slightly elevated temperatures (up to about 50–708C) likely increased reaction rates and extended alteration of the rocks (Figure 12f). The Mg-poor, alkali-rich nature of the fluids led to the observed Mg loss from volcanic rocks and the formation of abundant smectites (supporting information Table S2). Similar blue-green hydrothermal Al-rich smectite (beidellite) assemblages have been observed in extensively altered rocks of DSDP and IODP boreholes in the western Atlantic and Pacific [e.g., Alt and Honnorez, 1984; Alt et al., 1992]. 5.2.3.2. Branched Hydrothermal-Volcanic Complex In contrast to the stratified hydrothermal-volcanic complexes, this type consists of a hydrothermal-volcanic mound surrounded by a cluster of hydrothermal domes at the ‘‘Gaire’’ field. Nevertheless, its genesis must be similar to the stratified hydrothermal-volcanic complexes. This complex is interpreted as composed by a swarm of inclined sills that diverges upward from a central feeder source resembling the branches of a tree (Figure 11g). The chaotic reflection pattern zone within the upper part of the conduit is interpreted as remobilized and altered sediments [Løseth et al., 2003; Somoza et al., 2012]. This type of structure resembles the >10 km ring structure composed of outer inclined sills and inner volcanic cones fed by a central sagging conduit reported in Irruputuncu, Chile [Mathieu et al., 2008].\nThe observed interval of small extensional faults with a thickness of about 200–300 ms (TWTT) is interpreted as an array of polygonal faults (Figure 9b). These nontectonic faults affect the uppermost sedimentary sequence and are located only close to all the hydrothermal-volcanic structures of the Subvent Area (Figures 4–9, and 10). In this area, the base of the polygonal fault array is located at about 370 m bsf (BPF in all interpreted seismic sections), which correlates to the base of the LM-Q unit (Miocene-Quaternary age) at 7.0 s TWTT (Figure 7e). Their development results from burial compaction and dewatering of fine-grained unconsolidated sediments [Gay et al., 2004; Berndt et al., 2003; Gay and Berndt, 2007]. It has been proposed that in siliceous sediments, polygonal fault arrays can be triggered thermally, due to the transition of opal-A to opal-CT at depths of 100–1000 m. This conversion causes differential compaction and shear failure and then fault initiation [Davies and Ireland, 2011]. The fact that occurrence of polygonal faults are located only close to the main hydrothermal-volcanic complexes confirms that anomalous local heat triggered by the emplacement of intrusive-extrusive complexes could have influence this process."

    "text": "Seabed volcanic and hydrothermal structures have been recognized in the Subvent Area pointing to a recent phase of volcanic and hydrothermal activity. It is difficult to determine the timing of intrusive activity as there is no borehole penetrating the Subvent Sill Complex. Nevertheless, an attempt to constrain the timing of sill intrusion and hydrothermal-volcanic activity has been carried out on the basis of seismic and sample data and K-Ar dating methods.\nTo this respect, observations gathered from the seismic images and gravity cores have revealed some evidence: (1) all hydrothermal-volcanic structures identified in the Subvent Area affect the present seafloor topography; (2) timing of saucer-shaped sill intrusions is coeval with dome uplift, that deformed the present seafloor; (3) occurrence of hydrothermally altered mafic volcanic rocks sealed by volcanic and calcareous muddy deposits near the seafloor. All these observations lead us to propose a quite recent episode of magmatic activity and genesis of the derived hydrothermal-volcanic structures.\nDating the recent volcanic activity by K-Ar methods has yielded ages of 0.78–0.87 Ma and 1.61 Ma for the basanite lavas dredged in the ‘‘Tenores’’ cones 3 and 2, respectively (Figure 8 and Table 1). Other calculations have been performed with core data. According to sedimentation rates around 1–3 cm/ky estimated from DSDP and ODP sites in the region [Hayes et al., 1972; Firth et al., 1996] and by Levin and Gooday [2003], the tephra layers sampled (cores TG15–TG18) can be dated in a range between 25 and 237 ky in ‘‘Tenor’’ 1 cone (supporting information Table S3), between 35 and 181 ky in ‘‘Tenor’’ 2 cone (core TG01) and between\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3160\n49 and 147 ky in ‘‘Tenor’’ 3 cone (core TG03). These results testify a long period of volcanic activity in the ‘‘Tenores’’ field lasting from 1.61 Ma to 25 ky.\nThese data are consistent with a long hydrothermal alteration of lavas on the seafloor after the eruptions with an age of 0.78–1.61 Ma, prior to the deposit of several tephra layers and carbonate muddy sediments. Combining K-Ar ages with seismic and core data calculations in the ‘‘Tenores’’ cones, we suggest that alteration by hydrothermal fluids forming the green muds (core TG18) may have develop in a period of ca. 500.000 years, between the second magmatic event (ca. 780 ky) and the deposit of the tephra layer (ca. 237 ky).\nTiming of the recent hydrothermal episodes has also been tentatively constrained by the assessment of the thin sedimentary layer uncomformably overlying the flanks of the seabed hydrothermal domes together with sediment rates. In high-resolution TOPAS profiles (Figure 5e), these parallel layered sediments onlap quite deformed and transparent sediment layers of about 10 ms (TWTT) thickness. In highresolution TOPAS profiles (Figure 5e), these parallel layered sediments onlap quite deformed and transparent sediment layers, which are consequently interpreted as sediments charged in fluids. Considering this thickness and assuming a velocity of 1700 m/s and a sedimentation rate of 1–3 cm/ky calculated in the nearest DSDP and ODP boreholes (Sites 139, 140, 958 in Figure 1a [Hayes et al., 1972; Firth et al., 1996]) and data provided by Levin and Gooday [2003], the end of recent hydrothermal activity might be dated between 283 and 850 ky.\nWe propose that seismic data and rock samples clearly indicate a Quaternary to Recent emplacement for at least the youngest sill intrusive and alkali extrusive episode in the Subvent region. Older episodes of activity cannot be discarded, at least in the area that surrounds the Subvent Area. In fact, sill intrusions (three diabase layers up to 14 m thick each) have been drilled at Site 368 close to the Cape Verde Islands interbedded with Albian-Turonian black shales [Lancelot and Seibold, 1978]. Radiometric dating indicates an age of 19 Ma, placing them in the lower Miocene [Duncan and Jackson, 1977]. These intrusions are probably related to a major volcanic phase in the Cape Verde Islands."

    "text": "Geophysical and sediment/rock samples data document for the first time the discovery of a recent deepwater system of magmatic-induced hydrothermal vents in the eastern central Atlantic (Canary Basin), located about 500 km west of the Canary Islands.\nThe analysis and interpretation of these newly acquired data set has shown that the Subvent Area is characterized by the presence of a huge magmatic complex of sills that intrudes the sedimentary sequence and exceptionally deep volcanoes so far unknown. Three types of hydrothermal volcanic structures have been differentiated on the basis of the type of the linked-sill intrusions, the seabed morphology, the bypass system and the setting within the basin, (Table 2 and Figure 12): depressions are associated with inclined sills; hydrothermal domes formed above inclined, but mainly saucer-shaped intrusions; and hydrothermalvolcanic complexes are associated with stratified and branched sills, where magma eventually extruded to form volcanic cones surrounded by hydrothermal rings. These hydrothermal-volcanic structures are observed isolated or grouped at 4800–5200 m water depth extending from deeper intrusions (900–1600 mbsf) to the seabed. Samples recovered from hydrothermal-volcanic complexes revealed that the volcanic cones are constituted by OIB-type lavas and tephras (basanites) and blue-green hydrothermal Al-rich smectite clays, formed from the alteration of the volcanic rocks at temperatures of about 50–708C.\nThe magmatic events which occurred between 1.6 Ma and 25 ky and the OIB nature of the lava and tephras sampled in the deep-water volcanoes, evidence the presence of a mantle anomaly in the area during the Quaternary and open new intriguing questions about if this new deep water magmatic system found in the Atlantic Ocean floor. At this point, it is difficult to decipher if there is any link to the long-lived Canary hotspot or if it represents an independent and new embrionary hot spot. We expect that further studies in the near future will give us an answer.\nBeyond these considerations at a regional level, we would like to emphasize that the Subvent complex is the first modern hydrothermal-magmatic system reported in a deep oceanic basin related to an intraplate hotspot, since other reported systems in the Atlantic continental margins (i.e., Vøring and Møre basins) are\nMEDIALDEA ET AL. HYDROTHERMAL SYSTEM IN THE CANARY BASIN 3161\nfossils. Hydrothermal vents have been explored and investigated only in rifted margins or in mid-ocean ridges. Consequently, the discovery and study of this new system at 5000 m depth, shed new light to a greater understanding of these quite unknown intraplate deep oceanic basins, which has been scarcely investigated so far. At the same time, it provides new data that contribute to the discussion of how these basins formed and evolved over time.\nFinally, this work opens new questions about the extension and the potential impact of sill-induced CH4 and CO2-rich fluid reservoirs generated under supercritical conditions in deep oceanic crust sedimentary basins in recent times and its possible influence in global warming by the release of these greenhouse gases to the ocean or atmosphere through the vent complexes."

  "abstractText": "New seismic profiles, bathymetric data, and sediment-rock sampling document for the first time the discovery of hydrothermal vent complexes and volcanic cones at 4800–5200 m depth related to recent volcanic and intrusive activity in an unexplored area of the Canary Basin (Eastern Atlantic Ocean, 500 km west of the Canary Islands). A complex of sill intrusions is imaged on seismic profiles showing saucer-shaped, parallel, or inclined geometries. Three main types of structures are related to these intrusions. Type I consists of cone-shaped depressions developed above inclined sills interpreted as hydrothermal vents. Type II is the most abundant and is represented by isolated or clustered hydrothermal domes bounded by faults rooted at the tips of saucer-shaped sills. Domes are interpreted as seabed expressions of reservoirs of CH4 and CO2-rich fluids formed by degassing and contact metamorphism of organic-rich sediments around sill intrusions. Type III are hydrothermal-volcanic complexes originated above stratified or branched inclined sills connected by a chimney to the seabed volcanic edifice. Parallel sills sourced from the magmatic chimney formed also domes surrounding the volcanic cones. Core and dredges revealed that these volcanoes, which must be among the deepest in the world, are constituted by OIB-type, basanites with an outer ring of blue-green hydrothermal Al-rich smectite muds. Magmatic activity is dated, based on lava samples, at 0.78 6 0.05 and 1.61 6 0.09 Ma (K/Ar methods) and on tephra layers within cores at 25–237 ky. The Subvent hydrothermal-volcanic complex constitutes the first modern system reported in deep water oceanic basins related to intraplate hotspot activity. Plain Language Summary Submarine volcanism and associated hydrothermal systems are relevant processes for the evolution of the ocean basins, due their impact on the geochemistry of the oceans, their potential to form significant ore deposits, and their implications for global climate change, considering the heat transport, maturation of organic matter and the release of carbon-rich fluids associated to these systems. Hydrothermal vent complexes have been found all over the world in the fossil record related to large igneous provinces as those found in the North Atlantic margins. Nevertheless, studies focused on modern deep water magmatic hydrothermal systems are generally confined to ocean spreading centers, while scarce works address their study in deep oceanic intraplate basins. This study reports and documents for the first time the discovery of a recent deep water system of magmatic-induced hydrothermal vents at 4800–5200 m depth in an unexplored area of the Canary Basin (eastern central Atlantic), located about 500 km west of the Canary Islands. The analysis and interpretation of the newly acquired data set has shown that the study area is characterized by the presence of a huge magmatic complex of sills that intrudes the sedimentary sequence and exceptionally deep volcanoes so far unknown.",
