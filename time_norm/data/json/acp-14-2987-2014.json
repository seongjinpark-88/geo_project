Independent solar radiometric measurements confirmed that the master colourist’s R / G ratios which were used to model his AODs, matched the AOD values measured in situ by co-located sun photometers during the declining phase of the Saharan aerosol. An independent experiment was performed to understand the difference between R / G ratios calculated from a typical volcanic aerosol and those measured from the mineral aerosol during the Hydra experiment. It was found that the differences in terms of R / G ratios were small, ranging between −2.6 % and +1.6 %. Also, when analysing different parts of cloudless skies of paintings following major volcanic eruptions, any structural differences seen in the paintings had not altered the results discussed above. However, a detailed study on all possible sources of uncertainties involved (such as the impact of clouds on R / G ratios) still needs to be studied. Because of the large number of paintings studied, we tentatively propose the conclusion that regardless of the school, red-to-green ratios from great masters can provide independent proxy AODs that correlate with widely accepted proxies and with independent measurements.\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union."

    "text": "In the paper by Zerefos et al. (2007), the monochromatic ratios between red, green and blue colours, in paintings before, during and after large volcanic eruptions were examined. In that study, digital images from 554 paintings were downloaded from the websites of several art galleries and museums. These images were processed to derive ratios between the intensities of monochromatic colours. For the calculation of the R / G ratios only the parts of the sky over the field of view of the artist near the horizon avoiding clouds were analysed. The average values and the standard deviation of R / G ratio for each painting were presented in Appendix B of Zerefos et al. (2007). In that study, the mean error value was 0.014 due to the variability of R / G ratios within the paintings/images. That variability and how it could affect the estimated AOD values for different aerosol conditions and solar zenith angles was examined. The uncertainty found was less than 0.05 for small optical depths and smaller SZA (70◦). The error increased with increasing AOD and SZA (85◦) and could be as large as 0.18 for AOD values exceeding 0.5. The study by Zerefos et al. (2007) concluded that regardless of the school or the style of the painter, the R / G ratios at low solar elevation angles, correlated well to the modelled aerosol optical depth (AOD) values following large volcanic eruptions. After its publication we were faced with the dilemma that the various digital images available at the above-mentioned websites were not necessarily accurate representations of the true colour profile reproduction, because they were not created following a single colour profile protocol and thus, we decided to revisit the issue.\nIn this work we provide new evidence that our earlier results, based on R / G ratios to estimate and model AODs in paintings are robust, a hypothesis which is supported using the following three methods: firstly, by correlating the available R / G ratios from the above-mentioned public websites with the same ratios from their respective high quality colour profile protocols. A colour profile protocol is the protocol (set of instructions) used to accurately translate colour through different devices. In our work a colour profile was absolutely necessary so that the scanned paintings retained their original colour information when distributed through digital means. Also by having the colour profile along with calibrated scanners it was possible to compare paintings from other colourists without any uncertainty by differences due to colour translation. Secondly, by comparing our earlier results of AODs based on art, with results and indices from other proxies (ice cores, pyrheliometric and other data) which cover the past 500 years (Lamb, 1970, 1977, 1983; Sato et al., 1993; Stothers, 1996, 2001; Robertson et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2008; Crowley and Unterman, 2013). Thirdly, by performing an experiment involving the creation of sunset paintings and then measuring the ratios of the art piece with collocated AOD measurements actually recorded in the atmosphere during and after the passage of a Saharan dust event. 1\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 1 4\n5\nMore specifically, we have organized an experimental campaign where Panayiotis Tetsis1 (a well-known Greek landscape painter and colourist) painted the sunsets at the Hydra island in the Aegean Sea, during and after the passage of a Saharan dust event on the 19 and 20 June 2010. During the creation of the paintings, we performed simultaneous measurements of the evolution of the observed AODs and the actual meteorological conditions were carefully monitored. The results from these three methods are described below."

    "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, in an earlier study (Zerefos et al., 2007) the vast majority of images were analysed from museum web sites which were not created following a rigorous colour profile protocol. The method of painting sampling and an analysis of the corresponding uncertainties is described in the study by Zerefos et al. (2007). Since it was not possible to obtain high quality images of paintings from all galleries, we focus here on the subset kept at the Tate Gallery in the United Kingdom (UK). At this gallery we found 124 digital images of paintings (with a 300 dpi resolution, RGB, 8 bit compressed jpeg format files) which were also analysed in our earlier work (listed in Appendix A).\n1http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/panayiotis-tetsis\nAtmos.

Distribution of the relative differences (in %) between the R / G ratios derived from the high- and the low-resolution images from 124 landscape sunsets at the Tate Gallery (listed in Appendix A).\nFigure 1 shows the results of the R / G values retrieved from these high quality images in comparison to the ratios (calculated for the same paintings) from the website images, using the same methodology, as described in Zerefos et al. (2007). As can be seen from Fig. 1, the difference between the R / G values of the lower and higher resolution digital images stays within ±4 % for almost all paintings. Very few exceptions with overestimations correspond to solar zenith angles exceeding 90◦.\nThis result is clearly seen in Fig. 2 which shows the percent distribution of the relative differences between the R / G ratios derived from the high vs. the low resolution 124 images from the Tate Gallery.\nAdditionally, an independent sample of 186 landscape paintings of high quality/resolution (10000 × 10000 pixel images), covering the 1500–1900 time period, obtained from the National Gallery, London, calibrated using the Gretag Macbeth 24-patch colour rendition chart (Saunders et al., 2002; McCamy et al., 1976). None of these paintings has been studied in our earlier study because they did not fulfil the selection criteria set, that is, for representing sunsets and the possibility for direct or indirect measurements through clear shades, to facilitate the estimate of solar zenith angle, pertaining to each painting.\nThe high-quality/resolution images obtained directly from the National Gallery were next compared to their corresponding low-quality/resolution images obtained from the website (http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.\n1\n1\n2\n3\nFigure 3 4\n5\ndll/CollectionPublisher) to test further the results obtained from the Tate Gallery comparisons shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\nThe retrieved R / G values of these images are shown in Fig. 3, from which we see that on the average, the R / G values are overestimated by 0.04 ± 0.08. This result is in agreement with the results from the Tate Gallery sample of paintings and a tentative result is that the overestimation is larger (up to 0.3) deviating from the linear fit for the higher R / G values. At any rate, the correlation coefficients are still highly significant (99 % confidence level). It should be noted here that all images in this study were processed with the “nip2” software (e.g. http://www.vips.ecs. soton.ac.uk/index.php?title=Nip2) which comfortably works with multi-gigabyte images. A special work script has been created in order to calculate the average R / G values of the sky from each painting, as derived from the low- and highquality/resolution images."

    "text": "to ageing, the unknown systematic practices used by the painters, the mood of the painter and the different styles of schools. However, we have to keep in mind that the earlier and present findings, of a relation between high aerosol content at sunsets, were not based on true colours but confined only to the case of the R / G ratios. The different factors affecting the true colours mentioned above, being either random or systematic, may also affect the R / G ratios. Although this may be true for an individual painting, the statistics presented here show that when a large number of paintings by different painters are considered, these uncertainties could be much reduced. This is supported by the signal-to-noise ratio analysis of the statistical standard errors discussed in the introduction and in Zerefos et al. (2007). In addition, we have searched for a possible impact of structural differences. We provide here examples of paintings with and without structural differences following two major volcanic eruptions namely Tambora (1815) and Krakatau (1883). The calculated R / G ratios in parts of the sky give a similar result in which the differences are small, anyhow smaller than the standard errors we have encountered in this work (see paintings in Appendix C). Therefore, we have to tentatively assume that the impact of structural differences when studying R / G ratios in parts of the sky of the painting are small. We note here that we have made every possible effort to avoid measuring R / G ratios in the presence of clouds. It appears that R / G ratios as measured in this work somehow remind us of the ratios of solar irradiance in different wavelengths which are used in spectrophotometers to measure columnar gases in the atmosphere. In these spectroradiometers the noise introduced by aerosols and other factors related to scattering and related effects are indeed cancelled out and this is how we obtained the long series of total ozone, total sulfur dioxide, and total nitrogen dioxide with remarkably small standard error. We think that the reduction of errors when using R / G ratios provides useful information on the overhead aerosol content which correlates well when averaged with other proxies and/or with real AOD measurements as was the case with the Hydra experiment, discussed in paragraph 5.\nIn our study, a detailed quantification of each source of uncertainty was not possible except for the effects of quality in digitization of the paintings, structural differences and the solar zenith angle. Potential sources of uncertainty could be the atmospheric/aerosol related dynamics which affect the magnitude of the impact of each volcano in the area under study (of the painter) as well as the impact of cloudiness on the depicted R / G. We believe any effects from clouds have been avoided by trying to confine our R / G “measurements” to the cloudless parts of the sky in each painting. Following the above discussion and since our goal in this part of the manuscript was focused on the validation of the volcanic eruption effect and not on the actual quantification of the volcanic aerosol in the painting area, we believe that correlation coefficients with the mentioned proxies provide evidence that this goal has been achieved."

    "text": "schools so it was inevitable to have more paintings in European countries. Nevertheless, the paper focuses on big volcanic eruptions that have an effect over the entire planet atmosphere, so the evidence could be noticed in most parts of the world. This long-term data set of AODs is compared to other independent proxies as shown in Fig. 4. Detailed information on those proxies can be found in the primary literature by Lamb (1970, 1977, 1983), Sato et al. (1993), Stothers (1996, 2001), Robertson et al. (2001), Gao et al. (2008) and Crowley and Unterman (2013). Using the data shown in Fig. 4, we found that the correlation coefficients between other proxy indices and the estimated AODs from the R / G ratios from paintings are statistically significant (Table 1). Appendix D presents the data used in the calculations shown in Table 1. The reader is also referred to the precision by which the extreme AODs between paintings and proxies during large volcanic eruptions match in most cases. In particular, in 102 cases for which data of both DVI and this study are simultaneously available, DVI spikes are coinciding with AOD spikes from this study at a percentage of 80 % (9 out of 11 cases). As spikes we define the values in both time series that belong in the upper 10 % range of values. In addition, this study revealed two high AOD cases that do not match with DVI spikes and it is worth noting that both failing cases succeeded a period of two consecutive years with spikes in both indices.\nTotal sulfate is the total measured sulfate concentration in ppb in the core, as resulted from deposition either from the stratosphere (volcanic) or the troposphere (anthropogenic and other biogenic sources), as described by Zielinski et al. (1996) and Robertson et al. (2001). The presented values do not refer directly to the atmospheric concentration, but rather to the deposition on ice which, however, is related to ambient concentrations. The values of calculated index of total sulfate from Greenland ice cores (Zielinski, 1995; Zielinski et al., 1996) and the longer time series of stratospheric AOD (Robertson et al., 2001) were grouped in 50-year time intervals with the same procedure described above for AODs calculated from paintings. The three data sets are presented in Fig. 5. We note here the point raised by Robertson et al. (2001) that the last 150-year increase in total sulfate from ice cores was hypothesized to be the result of tropospheric anthropogenic sulfate deposition. The point raised by Robertson et al. that there have been no major volcanic eruptions between 1900 and 1960, needs some clarification. Indeed in the list of major volcanic eruptions in the past 500 years (Appendix B after Ammann and Naveau, 2003; Robock, 2000), we can see that based on VEI two eruptions, Santa Maria (1903) and Katmai (1912) have been classified with VEI 6. However, VEI is known to be not a good index of stratospheric sulfate loading since it measures the explosivity of a volcano and not its stratospheric injection. A good example is the 1980 St. Helen’s eruption, with a VEI of 5 but no stratospheric or climatic impact (A. Robock, personal communication, 2014). Stratospheric injection is important to ensure\nits global or hemispheric effects. From the above discussion it can be proposed that compared to the pre-industrial period, the industrial period shows higher painting-derived aerosol content, in agreement with what is expected from the literature (e.g. Neftel et al., 1985; Robock and Free, 1995; Robertson et al., 2001; Forster et al., 2007; Wild, 2012)."

    "text": "The experiment was conducted in Hydra, the painter’s home base. Hydra is an island located in the Aegean Sea (37.21◦ N, 23.28◦ E), 80 km south of Athens, and has a population of about 2000 inhabitants. The size of the island satisfies the main requirement for negligible local aerosol emissions (cars are not allowed in the island). Apart from sea spray particles, that constitute the background aerosol component around the island, the only case of regional pollution influence is under northerly winds when the island is within the outflow of pollution from Athens. In the case of winds from southerly directions, most of the Athenian sources of aerosols do not reach Hydra island.\nFor the design of the experiment, paintings and measurements during relatively low and high AOD cases was the main goal. According to Gerasopoulos et al. (2011),\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/2987/2014/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 2987–3015, 2014"

    "text": "the typical background AOD for the area is 0.12–0.13 corresponding to long and fast trajectories from westerly to northerly directions, with origin from high altitudes over the Atlantic. Higher aerosol loading over the area is related to the advection of dust particles from desert and arid locations of North Africa and is in the AOD range of 0.3–0.4. The most frequent season for dust outbreaks over the eastern Mediterranean is well documented to be in late spring (e.g. Kalivitis et al., 2007; Gerasopoulos et al., 2011) and early summer (the latter mostly as elevated dust layers; Papayannis et al., 2008).\nFor the selection of the experiment days, a regional model designed to simulate and forecast the atmospheric cycle of mineral dust aerosol over the campaign site was deployed. In particular, forecasts from the BSC-DREAM8b dust regional model were used (Nickovic et al., 2001) and the period finally selected to combine an AOD episode followed by clean conditions and the painter’s availability was 19–20 June 2010.\nThe instrumentation used for the campaign, included a multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFR-7 Yankee Env. System Inc., Turner Falls, MA) and a Microtops II sunphotometer (Solar Light Inc., Philadelphia, USA). The MFR7 installed at Hydra was used to perform measurements of the total and diffuse solar irradiance to calculate the direct component of the irradiance (Harrison et al., 1994). MFR7 provided 1 min average measurements and from these the AOD values at 500 nm was extracted. The instrument performs valid measurements during daytime and under clear sky conditions. The methodology followed for the extraction of the AOD values from direct solar irradiance is thoroughly described in Gerasopoulos et al. (2003). The calibrated handheld sunphotometer (Microtops II) was used to provide the AOD at 1020 nm, at 10 min intervals."

    "text": "As mentioned, the experiment took place in Hydra on 19 and 20 June 2010. During the campaign, a Saharan dust event passed over Greece (18–21 June 2010). On these two dates\nmaster Tetsis created two successive paintings; before and during sunset on the 19 and two additional paintings at sunset on the next day, 20 June 2010. Although the typical size and vertical profile of the Saharan aerosols differ from the volcanic ones, their effect on solar irradiance and R / G close to sunset was proved to be significant because of their relative high values of AOD (∼ 0.25 at 500 nm). The Tetsis experiment has initially started as an experiment dedicated to investigate if AOD’s can be calculated from such a live study. During the two day experiment the substantial difference between the aerosol condition of the first and the second day provided a more adequate data set, supporting the assumption that a painter is able to reproduce such an aerosol change. Quantitatively it has been proven that this assumption was correct, as analysed in the following. In the next paragraph it will be shown that the Saharan dust outbreak of the 19 June has been found to affect the R / G ratios of Tetsis’ paintings.\nThe results from the BSC-DREAM8b model simulations of the space and time evolution of the columnar dust loading for the campaign days (19 and 20 June,) are shown in Fig. 6, as isopleths of AODs. Additionally, the wind fields at 3000 m heights are superimposed, showing clearly a southwestern flow affecting the site in both campaign days. No precipitation or cloudiness prevailed over Greece during the campaign period (Fig. 6 – upper panel), also corroborated by MODIS satellite images (not shown here). A massive transport of dust from the Saharan desert was observed on the 19 June over Greece and western Turkey, while on 20 June the centre of the dust plume moved to the east and spread and declined (Fig. 6 – lower panel). Following the BSC-DREAM8b simulations, the dust load reached maximum columnar concentration values of the order of 0.75 g m−2 over the Hydra site on the 19 June.\nThe model simulations agree with real-time measurements, as shown in Fig. 7 by the time evolution of the observed AOD values on site for 19 and 20 June, measured with MFR-7 and Microtops. As stated before, the local pollution\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 2987–3015, 2014 www.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/2987/2014/\nC. S. Zerefos et al.: Further evidence of important environmental information content 2993\n1\n1\n3\nFigure 6 4\n5\nat Hydra is considered negligible and under southerly flows urban pollution from Athens does not reach the island. The meteorological conditions prevailing during both days (at sunset hours) were similar, namely temperatures between 28 and 30 ◦C (slightly higher on the second day) relative humidity between about 45 and 60 %, and calm wind conditions (1–2 m s−1). The AOD values observed at Hydra, for the most part, can be attributed to the presence of the Saharan dust aerosol and follow the temporal evolution depicted by the dust simulations shown in Fig. 6, from which we see higher AOD values on 19 June and lower on the next day at Hydra. The temporal decay is profound also in the Microtops measurements at 1020 nm, performed at Hydra and shown also in Fig. 7.\nSunphotometric measurements are a trustworthy source for identifying the Saharan dust presence, for which we expect higher AOD values and lower spectral dependences between the multi-wavelength AOD retrievals. This is clearly seen in the data presented in Fig. 7, where higher AODs for 19 June are accompanied by lower spectral dependences between the 500 and 1020 nm channels. Moreover, the respective Ångström exponents were on average 0.4 on the first day, indicative of coarse dust aerosols and in the range 0.7–1.0 on the second day, representing a mixture of sea salt particles with low loadings of continental aerosols (see Gerasopoulos et al., 2011, for indicative ranges of Ångström exponents in the area).\nAcknowledging the good performance of the BSCDREAM8b model for the days of our campaign, we present in Fig. 8 the simulations of the vertical distribution of Saharan dust concentrations over the area for 19 and 20 June 2010. As can be seen from that Figure, large dust concentrations in the lowest one kilometre were observed on the 19 of June, while on the next day the dust concentrations declined significantly, in the boundary layer and in the column as well. We focus mainly on the aerosol load in the planetary boundary layer since this is expected to impact mostly the painter’s perception during the late afternoon hours. It is evident that the dust concentrations within the first kilometre are four (4) times higher on 19 June than those simulated on 20 June.\nFigure 9 shows the temporal evolution of the MFR-7 AOD values at 550 nm during the two days of the campaign together with the R / G ratios from a digital camera on site and from the high precision digital images (produced by National Gallery, London, with the methodology described in paragraph 2) of Tetsis paintings (Fig. 10) for the two sunset cases (high aerosol and low aerosol over Hydra). The paintings were transported to the National Gallery where the digital protocol analysis was done. On 19 June 2010 (Fig. 9, upper panel), the estimated AOD differences between the paintings and the closest time digital photos is ±0.02. However, a bias of about 30 % is revealed between these and the MFR measurements on the day of the Saharan dust event. In all three types of measurements/estimations, the variability of AOD\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/2987/2014/ Atmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 2987–3015, 2014\n2994 C. S.

On 20 June 2010, the agreement between the digitally derived and the measured AOD values is substantially improved: differences as small as 0.02 can be found. The measured decrease of the AOD values is also successfully represented by the digital estimations. Under each painting a digital photograph at the centre of the time interval it took to paint each painting is displayed for comparison.\nFinally, a comparison between the impact of mineral aerosol (Saharan dust) and the impact of a typical volcanic aerosol in terms of RGB is also attempted. The mineral aerosol during the Hydra experiment at 500 nm was measured to vary close to 0.25. Therefore, we have made model runs with the volcanic aerosol setting the volcanic AOD case at 500 nm also equal to 0.25. Note here that the mean volcanic AOD (500 nm) in our paintings is very close to that number and is equal to 0.22. Figure 11 shows the percent difference in R / G ratios between the ones measured in the Hydra Saharan dust aerosol profile and a typical modelled volcanic aerosol profile as was used previously in this work. In both cases AOD (500 nm) was set to 0.25. The ratios are shown as isopleths in a graph where the position of the sun is fixed at 80◦ solar zenith angle. It was quite surprising to see that although both the nature, size and the vertical profiles of the Saharan and the volcanic aerosols differ, their effect on R / G overhead ratios in the sky induce so small a difference ranging from a minimum of −2.6 % to a maximum +1.6 %, depending on the solar zenith angle and the angle relative to the position of the sun. 1\n1\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nH e\nig h\nt (k\nm )\nDust Concentration (μg / m 3 )\n19 June 2010 20 June 2010\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 1000123456789101112 Height (km) Dust Concentration (μg / m3) 19 June 2010 20 June 20102\n3\nFigure 8 4\n5\nFig. 8.

Especially for atmospheric components such as aerosols and their variability over the past 500 years, relevant information is rare (Thornes and Constable, 1999; Grattan, 2006; Zerefos et al., 2007). In this work we have expanded the idea of Zerefos et al. (2007), which used an alternative and indirect way of using the Ångström’s law of atmospheric physics that describes the different effects of aerosols on the different wavelengths (colours) of solar light, together with the use of an alternative “database of solar light representations”, calculated from paintings by great masters in the past centuries.\nAt first, a series of paintings by master painters (in the period of 1500–2000) have been revisited and comparisons between digital images of paintings from lower resolution vs. high resolution, derived from high precision protocols, showed similar results, as far as the R / G ratios measured at sunsets are concerned. Statistically significant correlation coefficients were found between the R / G ratio values retrieved from low quality/resolution and high quality/resolution digital images at a sample of 124 landscape paintings from the Tate Gallery.

Zerefos et al.: Further evidence of important environmental information content 2995\n1\n1\n2\nFigure 9 3\n1\n1\n2\nFigure 10 3\n4\nAODs between paintings and proxies, during large volcanic eruptions, match in most cases.\nThe comparison between 50-year averages of the AODs (from R / G paintings) with the total sulfate in ice core and the stratospheric AOD, from which the year of known large volcanic eruptions and the three years that followed were excluded, shows that compared to the pre-industrial period, the industrial period had higher aerosol content, as it is well known and expected from independent data sets in the literature (e.g. Neftel et al., 1985; Robock and Free, 1995; Robertson et al., 2001; Forster et al., 2007). Based on the information retrieved from the paintings studied, we estimated this\nincrease to range from 0.15 (middle 19th century) to about 0.20 (by the end of the 20th century).\nFinally, to corroborate our findings, an experiment was designed in which a master painter/colourist painted successive sunsets during the passage of a Saharan dust outbreak over our experimental site (island of Hydra, Greece) on 19 and 20 June 2010. The master painter did not know anything about the passage of a Saharan dust event. Our independent sunphotometric measurements at Hydra confirmed that the calculated AOD values from R / G ratios measured in the master colourist paintings, matched quite well to the AOD values measured in situ as well as with measurements from a digital camera. It should be noted here that all four watercolours by Panayiotis Tetsis were digitized using the same procedures and standards applied to all works of art photographed by the Photographic Department of the National Gallery, London. These findings point to the conclusion that the experiment provides a new presentation of how a painter, a digital camera and scientific instruments capture changes in R / G ratios at high and low aerosol overhead cases.\nThe new information in the paper can be summarized as follows:\nThe comparison of high precision with low precision colour protocol images at independent samples of paintings from the Tate and the National Galleries in London strengthen the tentative results proposed in an earlier paper by Zerefos et al. (2007).\nAODs from a multi-hundred sample of paintings show statistically significant correlations with independent proxies.\nStructural differences in paintings do not seem to alter the above results. The signal-to-noise ratios following volcanic eruptions are statistically significant.\nWhen averaged in 50-year intervals, AODs from paintings in non-volcanic years agree with completely independent data sets with the observed increases of the industrial aerosol in the past 150 years.\nR / G ratios calculated from different natural profiles such as from volcanic aerosols and Saharan mineral aerosols show\nwww.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/2987/2014/ Atmos.

This explains how the experiment performed with an internationally known master colourist arrived at similar results with an increase in R / G ratios during the passage of a Saharan dust event.\nRegardless of the school, red-to-green ratios from great masters can provide independent proxy AODs that correlate with widely accepted proxies and with independent measurements.\nThe main conclusion of the paper is that nature speaks to the hearts and souls of the artists. When colouring sunsets the R / G ratios perceived by the brain contain important environmental information. It remains to an interdisciplinary community to study further the evidence presented in this research.\nAcknowledgements.

  "abstractText": "We examine sunsets painted by famous artists as proxy information for the aerosol optical depth after major volcanic eruptions. Images derived from precision colour protocols applied to the paintings were compared to online images, and found that the latter, previously analysed, provide accurate information. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) at 550 nm, corresponding to Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes, calculated by introducing red-to-green (R / G) ratios from a large number of paintings to a radiative transfer model, were significantly correlated with independent proxies from stratospheric AOD and optical extinction data, the dust veil index, and ice core volcanic indices. AODs calculated from paintings were grouped into 50-year intervals from 1500 to 2000. The year of each eruption and the 3 following years were defined as “volcanic”. The remaining “non-volcanic” years were used to provide additional evidence of a multidecadal increase in the atmospheric optical depths during the industrial “revolution”. The increase of AOD at 550 nm calculated from the paintings grows from 0.15 in the middle 19th century to about 0.20 by the end of the 20th century. To corroborate our findings, an experiment was designed in which a master painter/colourist painted successive sunsets during and after the passage of Saharan aerosols over the island of Hydra in Greece. Independent solar radiometric measurements confirmed that the master colourist’s R / G ratios which were used to model his AODs, matched the AOD values measured in situ by co-located sun photometers during the declining phase of the Saharan aerosol. An independent experiment was performed to understand the difference between R / G ratios calculated from a typical volcanic aerosol and those measured from the mineral aerosol during the Hydra experiment. It was found that the differences in terms of R / G ratios were small, ranging between −2.6 % and +1.6 %. Also, when analysing different parts of cloudless skies of paintings following major volcanic eruptions, any structural differences seen in the paintings had not altered the results discussed above. However, a detailed study on all possible sources of uncertainties involved (such as the impact of clouds on R / G ratios) still needs to be studied. Because of the large number of paintings studied, we tentatively propose the conclusion that regardless of the school, red-to-green ratios from great masters can provide independent proxy AODs that correlate with widely accepted proxies and with independent measurements.
