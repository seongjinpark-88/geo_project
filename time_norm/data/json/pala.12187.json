    "text": "of major geological activity as regards palaeogeography, volcanism and climate change, the last of these evidenced by a series of cooling episodes and glaciations that climaxed in the Hirnantian (Late Ordovician). The presence of cryptospores in the Darriwilian (Middle Ordovician) marked the advent of higher plants on land. A critical survey of direct (mega- and microfossils) and some indirect evidence in succeeding rocks indicates the presence of algae, Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, Fungi, probable lichens, cryptophytes and basal tracheophytes. Similar associations of photosynthesizers and decomposers occur today in cryptogamic covers (CCs), for example biological crusts, except that bryophytes replace cryptophytes (basal embryophytes) and tracheophytes are absent. Thus, extant CCs, which make significant contributions today to global carbon and nitrogen fixation and prevention of erosion, provide an excellent analogue for the impacts of early land vegetation on both lithosphere and atmosphere. As a prerequisite to assessing impacts in Ordovician–Silurian times, with particular consideration of parameters used by climate modellers,\nthe effects of a number of abiotic factors on the growth and survival of extant cryptogamic ground covers and their environmental impacts are reviewed. Factors include photosynthetically active radiation, ultraviolet radiation, temperature, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, surface roughness and albedo. A survey of the nature and extent of weathering facilitated by such vegetation concludes that it was limited based on depth of weathering when compared with that from rooted tracheophytes today, with minor effects on carbon dioxide drawdown. As global net productivity from Ordovician–Silurian CCs was very probably lower than today, and while the small fraction of intractable material in their organic carbon would have resulted in a more rapid turnover of terrestrial biomass, we conclude that there was decreased possibility of long-term organic carbon burial. Hence, there would have been very limited increase in atmospheric oxygen and decrease in carbon dioxide resulting from carbon burial.\nKey words: cryptogamic covers, atmospheric evolution, climate models, rock weathering, volcanism, palaeogeography.\nTHE colonization of Earth’s subaerial surfaces by embryophytes is celebrated as a major event in the history of life, an event which not only greened the planet, but also resulted in changes in atmosphere and lithosphere while ameliorating the latter, creating habitats for animals. Sixty years ago, this benchmark tended to be equated with the advent, close to the Silurian–Devonian boundary, of vascular plants (tracheophytes) and their subsequent radiations/ diversifications (e.g. Berkner and Marshall 1965), but it is now appreciated that the green revolution began much earlier and is marked, currently in the Middle Ordovician, by the appearance in palynological assemblages of spores of non-tracheophytic embryophytes (Rubinstein et al.\n2010). Much credit for raising awareness and significance of such spores is due to the late Jane Gray, who advocated their bryophyte affinity and grade of organization, with inferences for their palaeoecology and physiology (Gray 1984), even though their architecture, tissue construction and life histories had next to no foundation in the fossil record. Initially, she subdivided the time interval into microfossil assemblage zones I–III based on the appearance and relative frequencies of cryptospores and trilete spores (Gray 1985) and subsequently placed these in her mid-Ordovician– Permian Palaeophytic Era (Gray 1993; Table 1). Evolutionary Level I in the Epeirophytic–Phycomycophytic Era (Precambrian–mid-Ordovician) included algae, Cyanobacteria,\n© The Palaeontological Association doi: 10.1111/pala.12187 803\nlichens and Fungi but not embryophytes. Gray emphasized that Level II included elements of I plus bryophytes or bryophyte-like plants that ‘necessarily prepared the way for the development of vascular plants’ (Gray 1993, p. 159) that characterized levels III and IV.\nEqually appropriate to the hypothesis to be tested here was the approach by Bateman (1991) who subdivided the time interval into three phases: 1. Biochemical (c. 2000 Ma – Ordovician) when fundamental chemical pathways in algae and Bacteria were\nestablished in aqueous environments.\n2. Anatomical (Ordovician–Silurian) which saw the emergence of most lineages and alternation of genera-\ntions, based on turgor-stabilized tissues.\n3. Morphological (Devonian acme) which was marked\nby disparity and increase in size.\nHere, we would also emphasize that in consideration of the impact of vegetation through time, changes in composition transcend taxonomic boundaries as ecosystems became cumulatively more complex. We put forward the proposition that the land was colonized from at least the Middle Ordovician to almost the end of the Silurian by a community that was a complex of varying proportions of (non-cyano) Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, algae, cryptophytes (basal embryophytes cf. bryophytes; sensu Edwards et al. 2014), basal tracheophytes, Fungi and lichens, sometimes known in extant analogues as biological crusts, etc., but here we use the term ‘cryptogamic covers’ (CCs) (Elbert et al. 2012; see also LePage and Pfefferkorn 2000). Although today these communities flourish in environments where the amplitude and frequency of extremes of temperature and water availability preclude or greatly restrict the occurrence of vascular plants, this does not mean that CCs did not modify their environment. We would advocate that in the mid-Palaeozoic CCs also modified their environment, at least locally and, were eventually replaced by vascular plants in most habitats. In this study, we evaluate their ecological roles in CO2 and N2 fixation and hence soil fertility through, in part, nutrient availability from weathering and N2 fixation, water retention, stabilization/erosion (local effects) and, via photosynthesis and weathering, atmospheric/climate changes (global effects).\nSuch potentially global impacts require an understanding of the physical world in Ordovician through Silurian times as sources of alternative drivers to global change."

    "text": "Atmospheric qCO2 was a major driver of Phanerozoic climate (Royer et al. 2004). Climate models indicate very high qCO2 values (8–20 PAL (Pre-Industrial Atmospheric Level)) in the Early Palaeozoic before a large drop in the Devonian–Carboniferous in response to weathering induced by large vascular plants on continents (e.g. Berner 1991, 1994, 2006a, b; Berner and Kothavala 2001;\nFig. 1). Such high values, indicative of a greenhouse world, have to be reconciled with at least temporary falls to qCO2 <8 PAL required for Late Ordovician glaciation(s) to occur. Among the physical parameters used in model simulations to reduce qCO2 are continental silicate weathering, degassing fluxes from volcanism and orogenesis, and evolving palaeogeography with associated changes in sea level and ocean circulation (e.g. Berner models, Herrmann et al. 2004a; Godd eris et al. 2014; Nardin et al. 2011; Pohl et al. 2014). A long-term cooling trend from the Cambrian to modern equatorial temperatures for Middle–Late Ordovician seawater is predicted from d18O stable isotopes (Trotter et al. 2008). Among few values reconstructed from d13C for atmospheric qCO2, ~16 PAL was reported from the Late Ordovician (Yapp and Poths 1992).\nGlobally, high sea levels in the Ordovician, which submerged continental margins in mid-low latitudes under vast areas of epeiric seas, reached a Palaeozoic maximum in the Late Ordovician (early Katian ~225 m above present day; Haq and Schutter 2008; Fig. 2A–C). With reduced land surface areas, low albedo would feed back to high temperatures. The Hirnantian climax of Late Ordovician glaciation(s) was accompanied by a sharp sea-level fall of 50–100 m (Brenchley 2004). Herrmann et al.’s (2004b) model simulations indicate that for ice sheets to form and glaciation to occur, even with reduced qCO2 to PAL 8, both a fall in sea level and reduction in poleward heat transport through ocean circulation would be necessary. Early Silurian post-glacial transgression reflooded the continental shelves as another long-term deepening trend culminated in a mid-Silurian high before steady decline through into the Early Devonian (Emsian; Haq and Schutter 2008;\nFig. 2D–F)."

    "text": "Ordovician palaeogeography has the South Pole on the drifting Gondwanan supercontinent, most continents also in the southern hemisphere and oceans covering northern temperate and high latitudes, and the North Pole (Fig. 2; ~95% of northern hemisphere covered by oceans in the Middle–Late Ordovician: Pohl et al. 2014). Ordovician – Early Devonian closure of the Iapetus Ocean and the Tornquist Sea led to volcanic island arc/microplate–continent collision as opposed to true continent–continent collision (van Staal and Hatcher 2010) to form the Caledonide mountain chain and extensive terrestrial environments on the Old Red Sandstone continent (Laurussia; Fig. 2). While Iapetus was still wide, Early Ordovician subduction and arc volcanism on both sides produced early Taconian (Laurentia), Penobscottian (Gondwana) and Finnmarkian (Baltica) orogenic events, with extensive\npericratonic arc systems fringing both Laurentia and Gondwana through the Ordovician (van Staal and Hatcher 2010). During the closure of Iapetus, Avalonia, which formed part of a ribbon-like continent of arc terranes including Ganderia, joined with Baltica before collision with Laurentia took place in early Silurian times (Llandovery–Wenlock; Soper and Woodcock 1990; Cocks and Torsvik 2002; van Staal and Hatcher 2010). The Avalonian continent, Baltica and Siberia had drifted north into temperate to low latitudes with Iapetus closure, the formation of Laurussia and opening of the Rheic Ocean, while Gondwana moved southwards and rotated clockwise (Fig. 2). On Gondwana, Ocloyic–Famatinian orogenesis resulted from subduction-related magmatism along the proto-Andean margin of South America (e.g. Gonz alez-Men endez et al. 2013). Remnants of mountain chains associated with Early Palaeozoic orogenesis via continental drift, preserved in many present-day continents (Eurasia, North and South America, Australia and Antarctica; van Staal and Hatcher 2010), would have had much greater topographical significance in midPalaeozoic times.\nExplosive volcanism, preserved as tephra layers (bentonites and tonsteins) in the rock record, has a peak of abundance in the Ordovician–Silurian (Kolata et al. 1996; Histon et al. 2007; Sell 2011; Fig. 3). Extensive volcanic activity in continental and volcanic arc settings associated with Iapetus closure is evidenced by K-bentonites in Ordovican–Silurian deep marine successions in Laurentia, Baltica and Avalonia (Fig. 3). In the Precordillera of Argentina, intense arc magmatism also on the southern margin of Iapetus is indicated by widespread and numerous Gondwanan K-bentonites from Early to Middle Ordovician (Floian–Darriwilian; Fig. 3; Huff et al.1998). This concentrated volcanic activity corresponds to model estimates of volcanic rocks comprising 10.5–13.5% of total continental surface between Late Ordovician and Early Devonian, and contributing 33% of qCO2 consumption through weathering in the Late Ordovician (Nardin et al. 2011; cf. ~30% today). Enhanced volcanic weathering leading to a large and rapid fall in sea water 87Sr/86Sr in the Middle–Late Ordovician (late Darriwilian – early Sandbian), and continuing through to the end of the Ordovician may have provided a major sink for qCO2 (Young et al. 2009), via the generalized equation (Raven and Edwards 2001): 1 CaMg(SiO3)2 + 4 CO2↓ + 6 H2O ? 1 Ca 2+ + 1 Mg2+ + 4 HCO3 + 2 Si(OH)4. A cluster of very large eruptions across 1–2 m.y. in the Late Ordovician (basal Katian) spread ash across wide areas of North America (Deicke, Millbrig, Kinnekulle K-bentonites; >2 9 106 km2) and central-north Europe (<7 9 105 km2), and K-bentonites are also recorded at this time in South China successions (Fig. 3; Huff et al. 1992, 2010; Kolata et al. 1998; Histon et al. 2007; Sell\nA\nB\nF IG . 1 .

These occur shortly before the start of the early Katian GICE (Guttenberg) prominent carbon stable isotope excursion (Bergstr€om et al. 2010). The effects of explosive volcanic activity introducing ash into the water column, as well as ocean anoxia and heavy metals, have been suggested as the most likely explanations for teratological effects widely recorded among Ordovician to Early Devonian acritarchs and chitinozoans (Munnecke et al. 2012; Delabroye et al. 2012)."

    "text": "Major explosive events are known to result in global cooling on a historical scale as a result of oxidation of\nvolcanic sulphur gases to sulphuric acid aerosols that backscatter and absorb incoming solar radiation (e.g. Chenoweth 2001). Arc volcanism is typically less frequent than non-arc but more violent, increasing in SO2 outgassing with explosivity (Bluth et al. 1993). Larger, supereruptions (>450 km3) have occurred at a frequency of 100–200 000 years, most recently at 26 000 BP (Oruanui eruption at Taupo, NZ; Self 2006). Four Late Cretaceous and Pliocene episodes of widespread explosive volcanism interpreted from tephra in marine drill cores correlate with glacial episodes and have been implicated as causal in climate cooling (Sell 2011).\nLate Ordovician – Silurian glaciations span a period when atmospheric qCO2 was relatively elevated (<15 PAL; Berner and Kothavala 2001; Nardin et al.\nF IG . 2 .

As temperature and qCO2 are positively correlated, this apparent anomaly may be explained by short-term perturbation beyond the resolution of global climate models (Berner and Kothavala 2001), contributed to by lower solar luminosity that raised the CO2-threshold for ice formation (Royer 2006). The short-lived glacial maximum of the Late Ordovician Hirnantian glaciation corresponds to sea-level fall, mass extinction events and the major HICE stable carbon and oxygen isotope excursions (Brenchley 2004). Arguably however, this represents the culmination of much longer term climate cooling (Frakes and Francis 1988; Veizer et al. 1999; Trotter et al. 2008), with qCO2 drawdown resulting from increased volcanic weathering up to the onset of Ordovician glaciation (Kump et al. 1999; Young et al. 2009; Lefebvre et al. 2010). Buggisch et al. (2010) proposed that a single very large Late Ordovician (earliest Katian) volcanic eruption (Deicke K-bentonite) provided the trigger for glaciation. Model simulations for the Palaeozoic, based on an absence of land plants, indicate a cooling of 3°C in from Middle Ordovician to early Silurian in response to enhanced weathering of fresh volcanic rocks (highest in the Late Ordovician) combined with the effects on overall\ncontinental silicate weathering of continental plate movements and changing sea levels (Nardin et al. 2011). Notably, however, palaeogeographical effects were considered more important than volcanism through this period in controlling qCO2 drawdown (Nardin et al. 2011; Godd eris et al. 2014). By contrast, models for the Devonian include land plant cover, which reduced albedo and led to warming that countered increased continental silicate weathering and resulted in CO2 drawdown without temperature change (Le Hir et al. 2011).\nPalaeoclimatic cooling and qCO2 drawdown have been linked with oceanic anoxia, deposition of black shales and C sequestration (e.g. Page et al. 2007). Black shale successions are common from late Middle Ordovician to late Silurian and include notably organic C-rich de-glacial black shales deposited during transgression by eutrophic epeiric seas (e.g. Luning et al. 2000; Page et al. 2007; Edwards et al. 2009; McLaughlin et al. 2012; Fig. 4). Based on a variety of facies indicators, including black shale horizons, sea-level curves and carbon stable isotope records, Cherns and Wheeley (2009) interpreted multiple climatic cooling events from Late Cambrian through to late Silurian. Testing of the periodicity of these events\nF IG . 3 . Distribution of Ordovician–Silurian explosive volcanism as recorded by K-bentonites in successions from high to low palaeolatitude palaeocontinents: Gondwana, Perigondwanan terranes (Podolia/Carnic Alps), Avalonia, Baltica, South China, Laurentia (Scotland/ Northern Ireland and North America).

Facies evidence for glacial deposits on Gondwana from Late Ordovician (Sandbian) through to early Silurian (Llandovery/Wenlock; Grahn and Caputo 1992; Diaz-Martinez and Grahn 2007; Fig. 4) supports longterm climatic cooling and recovery. Silurian climates returned to greenhouse conditions, while sea levels rose to a maximum in the late Llandovery (Telychian; Loydell 1998) although not approaching those heights reached in the Ordovician. Following this, through overall shallowing up to Iapetus closure, further cooling events are interpreted for lowstands in Silurian sea-level cycles that correspond to C stable isotope excursions and biotic events (Fig. 4; Johnson 2006; Cherns et al. 2013). In the Appalachian foreland basin, Silurian sea-level falls and positive C stable isotope excursions correlate with the onset of reducing, sulphidic conditions in an anoxic basin, Fe mineralization and spread of grey to black pyritic shales from basin across to shelf (McLaughlin et al. 2012).\nFOSSIL EVIDENCE FOR PREDEVONIAN PHYTOTERRESTRIALIZATION (EXCLUDING EUTRACHEOPHYTES)"

Some of the most important localities yielding such megafossils as well as palynomorphs in the lower Silurian are in the Massanutten Sandstones in the Tuscarora Formation (Rhuddanian/Llandovery) exposed in Passage Creek, Virginia (e.g. Pratt et al. 1978, Tomescu and Rothwell 2006). The sediments were deposited on river plains with fossils formed on overbank deposits. The organisms, some possibly preserved in growth position, were thought to have colonized drier areas in riverine wetlands, because preburial cracks, indicating subaerial exposure, characterize many of the coalified compressions.\nF IG . 4 . Lower Ordovician – Lower Devonian fossil record of early terrestrial plants (*first records) shown against multiple cooling events interpreted before and after the Hirnantian glacial climax, on the basis of sedimentary facies (glaciogenic deposits/periglacial geomorphology, black shales with ‘hot’ horizons (white zigzags), cool-water carbonates and carbonate mud mounds: G-pG, Gondwana, Perigondwana; A, Avalonia; B, Baltica; L-K, Laurentia, Kazakhstan), in combination with the d13Ccarb record and sea-level curves (global, Baltica; amended from Cherns et al. 2013, fig. 1).\nThe fossils, often covering bedding planes, are isodiametric black patches up to 10 cm in diameter, most with irregular outlines and some with smooth curves possibly representing the limits of the organisms; irregular projections on one side of the fossil may indicate penetration of the sediment. Strap-shaped forms also occur.\nTomescu and Rothwell (2006) illustrated five types of internally stratified organization, with layers differing in thickness, degree of folding, variations in their brown colour reflecting density (some were termed diaphanous) and repeated composition of layers. Some may comprise filaments rather than laminae, and it was an example of the former that later received more detailed examination (Tomescu et al. 2006, 2009a). Bleaching had revealed parallel spaces and opaque linear structures embedded in their hundreds in amorphous material. The linear structures (filaments) were resolved as comprising one to four tightly packed trichomes whose spherical cells were replaced aggregates of iron oxide crystals. More diffuse crystalline deposits around the filaments were interpreted as demonstrating the possible existence of sheaths in addition to the amorphous extracellular matrix. The overall colony was strap-shaped and sinuous. From dimensions and organization, the fossil was considered cyanobacterial and of possible oscillatorian affinity and assigned to a new genus Prattella massanuttense (Tomescu et al. 2009a); the possibility that these organisms were diazotrophic is considered under Nitrogen below. The same authors (Tomescu et al. 2008) used scanning electron microscopy to demonstrate rod-shaped Bacteria, also potential diazotrophs, within the coalified extracellular material surrounding the filaments.\nThus, based on their anatomical investigations, Tomescu and colleagues had demonstrated that thalloid coalified compressions were of diverse origin whose affinities were investigated by two further approaches. The first involved experimental fossilization of a variety of organisms in an attempt to detect what structures might survive taphonomic processes to become Silurian fossils (Tomescu et al. 2010). Subjects included Cyanobacteria, red, brown and green algae, lichens and bryophytes. The procedure involved compressing the organisms in a sandwich of wetted filter and waxed paper and further compression (using clamps) at 130°C using a clothing iron. Sections of embedded material showed that the major lineages remained clearly identifiable, but there was variation in the distribution of internal structure ranging from those almost unaltered (e.g. the brown alga Fucus, red alga Mazzaella, lichen Parmotrema) to those where cellular construction was no longer visible (e.g. the green alga Spirogyra, ascocarps and basidiocarps of Fungi, the lichen Palligera, the bryophytes Marchantia and Anthoceros). Intermediate preservation was noted in cyanobacterium Nostoc, and the liverworts Pellia and Conocephalum. The\nauthors themselves appreciated that their simulation of fossilization processes was far removed from actual diagenesis, which would have involved intense pressures and high temperatures over considerable time intervals, but thought that, with refinement, it might provide more insightful interpretations of the structures seen in the fossils.\nA more conventional approach involved carbon isotope analyses on coal scraped from thalloid compressions and contemporaneous Ordovician and Silurian rocks in the Appalachians, including the localities in the Tuscarora Formation, and comparisons with isotopic values from extant plants including those for liverworts corrected for life in Ordovician/Silurian times of postulated high atmospheric CO2 (Tomescu et al. 2009b). They demonstrated that the signatures recovered from organic matter in the Rhuddanian Massanutan Sandstones at the heavier ends of their ranges overlapped with those predicted for liverworts, with the inference that some of the encrustations might represent the fossilized remains of that group. Freshwater algae today, however, have a range of carbon isotope ratios encompassing the lower and higher values of those measured or predicted for extant liverworts. Overall, the remains were considered to have values consistent with a terrestrial origin, but an aquatic origin cannot be ruled out (see under ‘Carbon dioxide effects on CCs’ below).\nAlthough very fragmentary remains/encrustations are recorded throughout the Silurian, there are only two further comprehensive investigations on their nature with discussions on their affinities. Lang (1937) placed many of his Pridoli examples in his new genus Nematothallus. He showed that they comprised four elements: a cuticular layer with reticulate (pseudocellular) patterning that covered two associations of tubes and numerous isolated spores. Branching was rare in all tubes and septa not recorded. Wefts of the wider tubes (12–40 lm diameter) sometimes contained examples (c. 12 lm diameter) with internal, narrow, annular wall thickenings (2.5–5.0 lm apart). The smaller tubes (c. 2.5 lm diameter) were always smooth-walled. It was impossible to reconstruct the three-dimensional organization in these compressions but their consistent association in many examples persuaded Lang that the organism had a thallus in which wefts of fine tubes were sandwiched between the uppermost peripheral pseudocellular cuticle and more deeply seated wefts of wide and small tubes. Such layers may have differentially been preserved and separated on decay, thus accounting for the frequent presence particularly of cuticles and tubes in palynological preparations. Lang deliberated on the processes involved in the production of the pseudocellular patterning on the resilient cuticles, be it produced by the dilated ends of tubes at right angles to the surface or the points of contact of the underlying\nmesh with the cuticle, but, concluded (Lang 1945) that the cuticle with internally projecting flanges represented the remains of a cellular sheet in which the inner periclinal walls and wider limits of the anticlinal walls were not preserved. Based on the consistent association of spores with tubes, he was convinced that, even though the former varied in shape and size, they were part of the reproductive cycle of the organism.\nAs to affinities, Lang, comparing the associations of tubes with those seen in Prototaxites and the frequent cooccurrences of the two genera in assemblages in the Welsh Borderland Pridoli and Lochkovian, concluded that the two might be related, with Nematothallus possibly the ‘leafy’ appendages of Prototaxites stems and trunks, and he placed them in a new ‘class’ Nematophytales. The affinities of Prototaxites had been debated very soon after it was so misnamed (Dawson 1859, Carruthers 1872). Carruthers favoured algal affinities with the browns most likely based on the size of specimens and complexity of their tissues. This was at odds with the terrestrial status proposed by Dawson and reinforced by Lang (1937) on the presence of cuticle and spores. Indeed, Lang was of the opinion that the nematophytes were a unique group of land plants close to neither algae nor tracheophytes, but with some characteristics of both. Recently discovered charcoalified mesofossils from the Lochkovian of the Welsh Borderland have revealed the three-dimensional construction of the thallus (Edwards et al. 2013). It was stratified with a superficial, usually uniseriate upper cortex, the outermost layer of which gives rise to the cuticle with reticulate patterning. It covered a palisade zone of wider tubes with occasional septa and a basal zone of narrow randomly interwoven and infrequently branched tubes. Although spores were occasionally found adhering to the tissues, the authors considered it unlikely they had been produced by the organism, and that the banded tubes, when present, were interpreted as contaminants, possibly involved in the degradation of tissues. In addition to the thalli with the imperforate cuticles, others, of similar internal construction, had perforated surfaces with papillae or protruding hyphae. Isolated ‘cuticles’ of this type, when found in palynological assemblages, had been called Cosmochlaina (Edwards 1986).\nEdwards et al. (2013) interpreted such thalli as made of fungal hyphae, and from the complexity of organization as closest to those of lichenized Fungi, although a photobiont could not be identified. The recovery of cuticles and sheets of cells from the Upper Ordovician of Libya (Gray et al. 1982; Fig. 4) extends the record of this kind of organization in deep time (see below) although whether or not to use the genus Nematothallus as defined by Lang in this context has been debated (e.g. Edwards 1982) and deemed inadvisable by Strother (1993). He had earlier described (Strother 1988) four different types of\nthalloid compressions with tubular construction from the late Wenlock – early Ludlow Broomsburg Formation in Pennsylvania and described three new species, viz. N. taenia (thalli: narrow sinuous strap-shaped; 1–2 cm long; tubes: unbranched 6–10 lm wide; longitudinal alignment), N. elliptica (thalli: circular to elliptical; <1 cm wide; tubes: unbranched 3–13 lm wide extend to margins) and N. lobata (thalli: irregular lobed with shallow concave depressions; 1–2 cm maximum length), plus N. cf. pseudo-vasculosa (thalli: ovate (11 9 17 mm) with circular indentations (3 mm wide): tubes of two types (c. 15 lm, c. 4.0 lm); embedded in an amorphous matrix. He initially concluded that the generic name was better confined to thalloid fossils of tubular construction, because the cuticles were frequently absent from Lang’s material. In 1993, he elevated Lang’s Nematophytales to the level of phylum as suggested by Burgess and Edwards (1988) and created the Nematothallaceae to distinguish thalloid from axial (e.g. Prototaxites) members. Lang’s Nematothallus pseudo-vasculosa was chosen as the type species, although the lectotype selected from Lang’s material possessed differentially thickened tubes, but no cuticular layer. He altered Lang’s diagnosis of the species to omit the latter as well as cuticularized spores and emphasized that some species might lack the differentially thickened tubes.\nIt would clearly be impossible to undertake anatomical investigations on all coalified encrustations in midPalaeozoic rocks and also unwise to conclude that all belonged to the nematophytes or Bacteria. Indeed, Strother introduced the possibility that some were the remains of thalloid gametophytes such as are present in major clades of liverworts and hornworts today (Strother 2010). A liverwort-like dorsiventral thallus has been proposed for the last common ancestor of present-day land plants (Mishler and Churchill 1985) although, based on the nature of the gametophyte apical cell in extant basal liverworts and mosses, Ligrone et al. (2012) advocated leafless axial organization in the archetypal gametophyte. To date, there is no direct fossil evidence compatible with either hypothesis in pre-Devonian rocks.\nAxial fossils. No axial compression fossils have been recorded in Ordovician rocks. The earliest examples named Eohostimella heathana comprise isotomously branching axes of essentially tubular construction preserved in marine rocks in Maine dated by invertebrates as upper Llandovery (Schopf et al. 1966). Unlike Hostinella, which lacks any enations, the surfaces of the axes were covered by minute spinose appendages (up to 0.3 lm). These were borne on a coalified cylinder (100–300 lm thick) filled with sediment: no vascular tissues were recorded. The fragments, up to 35 mm long and varying in width between 1 and 2 mm, were thought to derive\nfrom, at least in part, an erect plant, because they extended through several bedding planes. Such orientation of transported material in marine rocks makes such an inference questionable as indeed are the affinities of the fossils. The first record of fertile bifurcating axial plants comes from the late Wenlock (Homerian) of Ireland (Fig. 4). The fragments are very small with axis diameter rarely exceeding a millimetre (range 0.3– 1.7 mm) and the terminal sporangia being short and wide conform to Lang’s 1937 definition of Cooksonia (Edwards et al. 1983). In outline, some of the sporangia resemble Cooksonia pertoni and others, for example C. hemisphaerica (Fig. 4), but they are usually somewhat smaller. It is impossible to estimate the height of a complete plant: the longest fragment is 15 mm and branches three times, while a 13.5-mm-long example branches twice. The basal parts of the plant are unknown, and the fossils lack anatomy.\nThe earliest records of axial fossils in Gondwana (from the Kirusillas Formation near Cochabamba, Bolivia) are in rocks dated by graptolites as late Wenlock – early Ludlow.

(1997) indicated the presence of Cooksonia, Rhynia, Zosterophyllum and Drepanophycus, but subsequent recollection at the locality uncovered bedding planes with abundant unidentifiable coalified debris and probable coprolites as described by Edwards et al. (2001). However, loose blocks further down the hillside were full of very short lengths of narrow, parallel-sided axes and occasional forking ones similar to later Hostinella, but much smaller. Traces of longitudinally aligned superficial cells, some with iron oxide infill, were present, but tracheids were not observed. None of the material was fertile. By contrast, in the slightly younger early Ludlow to early Pridoli Lipeon Formation in southern Bolivia near Tarija, well-preserved rhyniophytes, including Cooksonia cf caledonica (C. caledonica is now known as Aberlemnia Gonez and Gerrienne 2010), diverse isolated rhyniophytoid sporangia as well as abundant smooth axes some with branching typical of Hostinella, were preserved in a shallow-water marine setting (Edwards et al. 2001). Also present were quite diverse small, irregularly branching fragments possibly the tips of algae such as Buthotrephis or Hungerfordia.\nThe disparity in sporangial morphology is similar to that in Pridoli and Lochkovian assemblages in the Welsh Borderland, and comparisons were made with Steganotheca, Tarrantia, Cooksonia hemisphaerica, C. cambrensis and Culullitheca but unequivocal assignation proved impossible (e.g. Fanning et al. 1990, 1992). At the Bolivian locality, the diameter of the sterile axes reached 1.3 mm, but was usually less than a millimetre. The most complete specimen, comprising an axis subtending three lateral branches on one side, one of which branched dichotomously a further two times, was tentatively inter-\npreted as a creeping rhizome bearing upright stems. The biggest fertile specimen at this locality was 5 cm long and 0.7–0.2 mm wide and branched at least twice with two axes terminating in sporangia.\nSimilar grades of organization and sizes of plants were recorded in the Ludlow of the developing palaeocontinent Laurussia and in the Bohemian and Libyan assemblages of north Gondwana (Obrhel 1968; Daber 1971). In South Wales, Cooksonia pertoni was found in the Gorstian (upper Ludlow) along with Hostinella (Edwards et al. 1979), while in the Ludfordian, these taxa occurred with Steganotheca (Edwards and Rogerson 1979) from the locality that had produced an unbranched sterile axis with the earliest to date record of in situ tracheids (Edwards and Davies 1976). However, that vascular tissues had evolved by this time is evidenced by discoveries in the Ludlow of both zosterophyll (Kotyk et al. 2002) and lycopsid (Tims 1980; Fig. 4) clades of Canada and Australia, respectively. Such fossils mark a radical change in plant architecture as plants were released from the constraints of determinate growth and limits on reproductive capacity imposed by terminal sporangia production. The resulting increase in biomass above ground produced by increased branching and laminar light harvesting capability, initially via microphylls, increased the potential for export of metabolite for further innovation and investment in underground systems such as more extensive rhizomes and roots.\nThe Prototaxites complex. (See also ‘The Prototaxites enigma’ below) In addition to the very well-defined axial fragments of embryophytic derivation, there are numerous roughly cylindrical/axial compressions in Ludlow and Pridoli rocks of southern Britain that possess a usually greater thickness of coal and pronounced surface striations. These have been frequently assigned to Prototaxites, and occasional more detailed anatomical investigation has revealed the diagnostic two systems of tubes (e.g. Lang 1937). They are, however, considerably smaller than the Emsian examples from the type and other localities, where they attained tree-trunk size dimensions (Dawson 1859, 1871; Fig. 4). The earliest convincing examples are recorded in the Llandovery Denbyshire Grits, north Wales (Hicks 1881), where two sizes of tubes are described from irregularly shaped fragments, some parallel sided. Such fragments are small with dimensions more typical of later Silurian records than Devonian ones. A possibly earlier (lower Llandovery) member of the prototaxalean complex was described by Niklas and Smocovitis (1983), although anatomy came from an elongate fragment within an irregularly shaped coalified compression. It comprised longitudinally aligned smooth tubes surrounding differentially thickened ones (banded tubes). Niklas and Smocovitis included comparisons with nematophytes in their somewhat inconclusive discussions on affinities: the\ndescription of banded tubes in organisms (Nematosketum, Burgess and Edwards 1988) with typical construction otherwise very similar to that in Prototaxites reinforces placement in the prototaxalean/nematophyte complex. Prototaxites itself has not been recorded as a megafossil in the Ordovician."

    "text": "Spores. An assemblage of spores recovered from the early Middle Ordovician (Dapingian: 473–471 Ma) Zanjon Formation in Argentina (Rubinstein et al. 2010; Fig. 4) is commonly regarded as the oldest evidence for terrestrial vegetation. Similar but not identical, and far more convincing, spores have been described from younger Ordovician, Silurian and Lower Devonian assemblages, and are distinguished from the trilete spores (monads) that characterize vascular plants by their distinctive configurations including dyads and tetrads and have been named cryptospores because the producers were conjectural (Richardson et al. 1984). That they derived from land plants is evidenced by: (1) their size and general morphology; (2) their occurrence in both continental and marine rocks; (3) their resilience through time; and (4) geochemical analyses that indicate similar wall compositions to extant land plant spores. That they were produced from plants with relationships to bryophytes is evidenced by: (1) liberation of mature spores as permanent tetrads (e.g. the liverworts Sphaenocarpos, Riccia); (2) lamellate ultrastructure of their walls albeit recorded in dyads (e.g. Taylor 1995; Wellman et al. 2003); (3) molecular studies that indicate that bryophytes are paraphyletic to the vascular plants and that liverworts are sister group to all other land plants (e.g. Kenrick and Crane 1997; Cox et al. 2014); and (4) the nature of tissues in extant bryophytes that reduces the likelihood of their preservation and accounts for the lack of megafossils in the coeval rocks. Indeed, the first indication that the parent plants were embryophytes comes from fragments of wall or cuticles in contact with masses of tetrads in the Middle Ordovician (Llanvirn) of Oman (Wellman et al. 2003; Fig. 4), while spores in better-preserved sporangia are found in upper Silurian and Lochkovian localities (for review, see Edwards et al. 2014).\nThe oldest cryptospore assemblage is preserved in marginal marine/estuarine sequences and was dated by chitinozoans (Rubinstein et al. 2010). Described as moderately diverse, it contained three monads and two tetrad taxa. Sphaerasacus glabellus is an enveloped smooth-walled spherical monad, also recorded from the Late Ordovician and early Silurian. Naked hilate monads included Chomotriletes? sp. with ornament on the distal surface comprising convolute muri resembling fingerprints. Laevigate\nexamples were too poorly preserved to allow assignment to a species of Laevolancis. The two tetrad taxa comprised naked Tetrahedraletes cf. medinensis and a new taxon, in which a tetrad of laevigate spores with equatorial thickenings is surrounded by a loose crumpled, but smooth, envelope. The authors accepted the spores as derived from liverworts.\nSlightly younger (by 8–12 m.y.) late Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian) assemblages from the Czech Republic (Vavrdova 1990) and Saudi Arabia (Strother et al. 1996) showed limited increased diversity including both naked and enveloped (rare) tetrads including Stegamibiquadrilla contenta with microregulate–semipunctate ornament as well as, for the first time, naked and enveloped permanent dyads.\nLarger numbers of the latter characterized assemblages from the type Caradoc succession (Sandbian–mid-Katian) in southern Britain. Wellman (1996) described at least 16 taxa in the assemblages including well preserved, but rare, laevigate monads with intact hila assignable to Laevolancis. Assemblages of similar composition occurred throughout the Upper Ordovician and Silurian with increase in numbers of smooth laevigate Laevolancis types in the basal Llandovery and ornamented forms in the Wenlock. However, in a mid-Katian assemblage recovered from a core through the Qasim Formation in Saudi Arabia (Steemans et al. 2009), trilete monads are reported for the first time (Fig. 4). The previous earliest convincing record was of smooth forms in the basal Silurian (Llandovery: Hoffmeister 1959). Among abundant cryptospores, Steemans et al. 2009 illustrated seven species of trilete examples: two smooth and the remaining five with an ornament of verrucae and/or muri. All types have been found in Cooksonia pertoni. Isolated ornamented forms had previously been recorded in Wenlock and younger rocks. Such data extend the record of vascular plants into the Ordovician, but their spores did not dominate assemblages of palynomorphs in terms of taxa and numbers until the Devonian. Almost all cryptospores disappeared at the end of the Lochkovian. Numbers of permanent tetrads and dyads had declined during the Silurian, but hilate monads continued in comparatively large numbers into the Lochkovian (Richardson 2007) when, at least in the Welsh Borderland, crassitate spores characteristic of basal tracheophytes, such as Cooksonia, were replaced by retusoid examples characteristic of zosterophylls.\nFootnote. Records of palynomorphs with some characteristics of cryptospores have been recovered from middle and upper Cambrian rocks from the USA (Strother and Beck 2000; Strother et al. 2004; Taylor and Strother 2009). Dominant elements from the older strata are clusters of dyads and tetrads ‘not substantially different’ from cryptospores. Walls are mostly smooth, but some are\ngemmate or scabrate and spores may be enveloped. Strother et al. (2004) concluded that they derived from an extinct terrestrial flora intermediate between chlorophytes (s.l.) and embryophytes. Their credentials as cryptospores were queried as they appeared to lack clear tetrahedral symmetry, and there were variable numbers of units in some polyads (Wellman 2003). Similar clusters were reported by Taylor and Strother (2009) as part of a far more detailed account based on upper Cambrian examples of enveloped polyads, described as synoecosporal packets. The basic unit of each packet comprised a dyad, and there were 2–4 dyads in each packet. Groups of packets containing variable numbers of dyads were surrounded by a further synoecosporal wall. The basic unit of the dyad comprised at least two laminae close to the spore lumen. Such configurations are not compatible with the tetrads and dyads assumed produced by meiosis in later examples (see Edwards et al. 2014). Whether or not they represent a further extinct group and one which colonized land surfaces remains open to question.\nFungi. Palynological preparations from Ordovician into Lower Devonian rocks frequently contain small fragments of tubes or filaments which from their dimensions and cellular characteristics might well belong to Fungi. The best preserved come from the near shore, upper Silurian Burgsvik Sandstone, Gotland, and are associated with pellet-like masses interpreted as coprolites (frass) produced by microarthropods and multicellular spores (SherwoodPike and Gray 1985). Most of the hyphae have roughened, granulate surfaces, verticillate branching and have perforate septa. The lateral branches are flask-shaped (ampulliform) structures compared with the conidiophores of Fungi Imperfectae, allied to the terrestrial ascomycetes. Burgess and Edwards (1991) had isolated similar material from Wenlock to Lower Devonian localities and named examples with granules clustered around branches as Ornatifilum granulatum. Their preparations included smooth-walled tubes, also recorded from the Upper Ordovician, in which septa were absent and branching rare. A new species, O. lornensis, was described from the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Scotland (Wellman 1995), and broadly similar remains were recorded from a number of older Silurian localities in the Midland Valley. Such records demonstrate the probable existence of Fungi in terrestrial vegetation during the Ordovician–Silurian time interval but little more.\nThe mid-Ordovician record of glomalean Fungi from Wisconsin, USA (Redecker et al. 2000, Redecker and Graham 2002), is based on wefts of occasionally branching non-septate hyphae containing spherical to subspherical spores all of which terminate hyphae. Thus, the spores resemble those of glomelean Fungi and particularly the genus Glomus. Similar configurations of spores and hyphae\nwere compared with those in present-day arbuscular mycorrhizal Fungi, and raised the possibility that such symbolic associations were present with coeval land plants. The problem with this record rests on its syngenicity, not on its biogenicity. The Fungi were preserved in limestones laid down in a ‘preserved shallow marine’ environment. The researchers took the precaution of isolating nonweathered rock, not contaminated with roots of extant plants and found no modern material in their macerates. However, they did not produce or examine petrological sections of the matrix, which is a dolomite, a postdepositional replacement of limestone and as such a porous rock, into which extant Glomeromycota may have percolated or even colonized surfaces with Bacteria and Fungi when the rock was redeposited. Thus, further evidence is required to demonstrate the syngenicity of the Fungi.\nThat Fungi were present throughout this time interval seems likely as molecular evidence suggests that all major fungal lineages had diverged at least 1000 m.y. ago (Heckman et al. 2001). Evidence from Precambrian fossils is controversial; for example, Eomycetopsis has been reinterpreted as a cyanobacterial sheath (for references, see Taylor et al. 2010, Butterfield in press).\nThe Prototaxites enigma\nPrototaxites has already been included as an axial fossil in the Silurian, based on much smaller representatives than the Emsian examples that attained tree-trunk dimensions (Dawson 1859, 1871). Here, it is included as a fungus as originally hypothesized by Church (1919) and more recently by Hueber (2001) based on a very thorough examination of material from the Emsian-type locality. Hueber favourably compared the various kinds of tubes in Prototaxites with hyphae present in the Holobasidiomycetes and placed the fossils in a new order, the Prototaxales. His conclusions on the reproductive structures are less compelling. His hypothetical reconstructions are based on poorly preserved structures interpreted as inflated sterigmata, each bearing a speculum, but no spores. These were repeatedly observed at the concentric growth increments interpreted as remains of a hymenium. The status of Prototaxites as a land plant (Dawson 1871, Lang 1937, Hotton et al. 2001) is no longer questioned, thus dismissing questions of affinity with algae. The recent suggestion that the ‘trunks’ were concentric mats of marchantioid liverworts presumably produced by rolling down a slope with the larger tubes equivalent to rhizoids (Graham et al. 2010) has been widely criticized, both as physically impossible (Boyce and Hotton 2010) and on anatomical grounds (Taylor et al. 2010).\nBoyce et al. (2007) had earlier produced d13C isotope values from both Prototaxites and co-occurring vascular\nplants and showed considerable variation in values in Prototaxites, ranging from 15.6& to 26.6&, which is within the range likely for CCs in the mid-Palaeozoic ( 15 to 30&; see under ‘Carbon dioxide: effects on CCs’ below) which strongly suggested heterotrophic nutrition on isotopically distinct subtrates as is seen in Fungi. Carbon isotope values for Prototaxites produced by Graham et al. (2010) appeared to show a signature similar to that measured in experiments on Marchantia, but these are not thought meaningful because no allowance was made for either differences in atmospheric d13C in Devonian times or the type of medium used in their cultures. Finally, narrow intact axial structures with prototaxalian anatomy recovered from Lochkovian rocks (Edwards and Axe 2012) were interpreted as cords or rhizomorphs and show no liverwort features.\nSuch discussions on affinity are clearly important considerations on carbon cycling. Indeed, the identity of Prototaxites as a heterotrophic organism raises major questions on suitable nutrient sources for such a potentially gigantic sporophore. Such issues were addressed by Selosse (2002), who then advocated a lichen-type symbiosis for Prototaxites purely on energy relationships. A similar affinity has more recently been postulated by Retallack and Landing (2014) on anatomical grounds, but the cortical nests of coccoid algae are not, as the author admitted, very well preserved and thus do not provide unequivocal evidence for a photobiont.\nHow plausible is photosynthetic energization of Prototaxites? The very low surface area per unit volume or dry matter of Prototaxites means that, even at the higher atmospheric CO2 in the mid-Palaeozoic, intercellular gas spaces are essential to attain a CO2 assimilation rate that uses a substantial fraction of the photons that can be absorbed from full sunlight (Raven 1986; Raven and Edwards 2014). Extant terrestrial photosynthetic embryophytes with similar dimensions and surface area per unit volume to Prototaxites are all homoiohydric, for example the cactus Carnegeia gigantea with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) (Bronson et al. 2011). Raven (1986) pointed out that the structures and functions required for homoiohydry occur in Fungi, albeit in a diversity of species in this large and diverse kingdom. However, there is no direct evidence in Prototaxites of the occurrence of these attributes, i.e. dead water-conducting cells, intercellular gas spaces, hydrophobin-like hydrophobic proteins as a cuticle analogue, and, perhaps less plausibly, nematode- and protest-trapping machinery based on constriction of a ring of three cells (20–30 lm in diameter) by rapid cell turgor increase as a prototype for stomata (Raven 1986; Yang et al. 2007). Finally, homoiohydric Prototaxites exhibiting facultative CAM could explain the range of natural abundance carbon isotope ratios in Prototaxites (Boyce et al. 2007), that is 15.6&\nto 26&, with the lower (more negative) values relating to C3 expression and the higher values involving the expression of CAM (Raven and Spicer 1996). However, the absence of evidence of homoiohydry in Prototaxites (see above) and the absence of evidence of CAM in the Palaeozoic (Raven and Spicer 1996) make this explanation of the carbon isotope ratios of Prototaxites unlikely."

    "text": "First, that lichens were present in the Lower Devonian is evidenced by silicified Winfrenatia reticulata, which shows a consistent structural association between fungal hyphae and cyanobacterial photobiont, in the Pragian Rhynie Chert (Taylor et al. 1995, 1997), although it differs from any extant forms in comprising an association of possibly two Cyanobacteria and a mycobiont of uncertain affinity (Karatygin et al. 2009). Preservation of photobionts is more conjectural in the coalified specimens assigned to two species of lichens with stratified organization from the early Lochkovian of the Welsh Borderland (Honegger et al. 2013a). The generic names Chlorolichenomycetes and Cyanolichenomycetes reflect the affinities of the photobiont. Nematothallus and Cosmochlaina differ from these taxa in their possession of a stratified thallus in which a palisade tissue of wide tubes is sandwiched between an upper superficial cortex, which decomposes to leave Nematothallus cuticles, and basal wefts of small tubes (Edwards et al. 2013). However, a Nematothallus ‘cuticular’ patterning was recorded in Chlorolichenomycetes and the authors concluded that Nematothallus and other similar organisms with stratified thalli were best assigned to lichens, and from their complexity with the lichenized ascomycetes and more precisely to Pezizomycotina. Earlier, Kerp and Kring (in Steur and van der Brugghen 1998) commented on anatomical similarities between Leptogium lichenoides and Nematothallus. As is discussed below, calibrated molecular clock outcomes suggest that ascomycetous lichen Fungi (the commonest lichens today) originated in the early Carboniferous.\nAs mentioned earlier, Nematothallus cuticles and fragments of tubes (hyphae) are common constituents of palynomorph assemblages and extend the range of the genus into the Ordovician (e.g. Caradoc (Katian or Sandbian), Gray et al. 1982), with the inference that thalloid organisms comprised principally of fungal hyphae were present on land from the Middle Ordovician, and their organization into complex tissue-like systems best fits lichenized Fungi. Wefts of unbranched, non-septate tubes recovered from mid-Cambrian rocks were considered by\nStrother et al. (2004) as indistinguishable from those Strother had also isolated from Silurian strata. This led to the inference that nematophytes and even possibly Nematothallus existed some 45 million years before these records in the Ordovician, but more compelling evidence from this is needed to confirm nematophytes on land in mid-Cambrian times.\nThere are no further body fossils in the Early Palaeozoic that have been unequivocally identified as lichens. Yuan et al. (2005) described as lichen-like, associations of filamentous, ?non-septate, hyphae with ensheathed clusters of coccoid Cyanobacteria or possibly green algae preserved in phosphorite in the Cambrian Doushantuo Formation (635–551 Ma) of southern China. The fossils, found in rocks originally described as marine, showed only little contact between fungus and presumed photobiont, and lacked any structured organization characteristic of lichens, although three-dimensional reconstruction was impossible. Fungal hyphae were common in the matrix, and the authors postulated that such associations in which a number of hyphae enveloped coccoids might represent early stages towards the fungal/photoautoph symbiosis, beginning with facultative interactions between the two groups. A further inconsistency lies in the dimensions of the hyphae which are much smaller than in Fungi, but are characteristic of active bacterial filaments (Honegger et al. 2013a). Although Retallack (2014) describes the fossils as glomeromycotan lichens, their location in a marine environment or possibly an isolated non-marine basin (Bristow et al. 2009) would seem unlikely because of the logistics of transfer of nutrients in fluids between two separate organisms with limited contact. Yuan et al. had compared pyriform structures attached to the hyphae as similar to spores in glomaleans, but much smaller. In a separate evolutionary scenario, Pirozynski and Malloch (1975) had hypothesized that symbiotic associations between a semi-aquatic green alga and aquatic oomycote were essential for the successful colonization of the terrestrial environment.\nFurther claims for the presence of lichens in the Cambrian and Ordovician times were based on impressions/moulds on surfaces of putative palaeosols (Retallack 2009, 2011). Farghera robusta was described on surfaces of the Cambrian/Ordovician Grindstone Range Sandstone of South Australia and associated with the ichnospecies Rivularites repertus (Retallack 2009). The cracked and pustulate surfaces of the latter closely resemble predominantly desert substrates today, which are too dry to support vascular plants. Petrographic thin sections showed branching structures that were compared with the cyanobacterial cords, fungal hyphae and lichen rhizines seen today in biological crusts of desert and tundra. Farghera robusta was diagnosed as comprising 2–4 times dichotomously and pseudomonopodially\nbranching thalli (1–3 mm wide) with rounded tips and 1 mm wide marginal threads, which tapered and branched downwards. It was the latter feature, together with the prevailing environmental conditions, which led Retallack to conclude an affinity with lichens and especially with lichenized members of the Ascomycota (e.g. Xanthoparmelia reptans) possessing marginal rhizines. Much rarer impressions were tentatively and inconclusively compared with gametophytes and sporangia and Fungi of land plants.\nBased on similar sedimentary evidence, Retallack (2014) had concluded that palaeosols were associated with the 550 Ma Ediacaran communities of South Australia, and hypothesized, somewhat controversially, that several well-known members of the intensively investigated assemblages were lichens or microbial associations forming solid crusts, rather than marine metazoans or protists (Retallack 1994, 2007, 2013). Segmented examples, including Dickinsonia with associated burrows and traces (‘Autozoan’), were interpreted as either its rhizomes or mycelia organized into cords or rhizomorphs of lichens. Relief was accounted for by the presence of fungal chitin. Discoidal fossils, such as Cyclomedusa and Aspidella, were interpreted as microbial communities colonizing solid surfaces. Aspidella (as well as Charnia) in Newfoundland Ediacaran assemblages had earlier been posited to have lived saprotrophically in marine habitats on sulphate-reducing Bacteria, but was described as fungus-like, because it did not possess characters diagnostic of any living lineage, and hence had no affinities with the crown group (Peterson et al. 2003). Similar arguments might be used to refute Retallack’s contention of lichen affinities based on the Australian material, for which there is complete absence of any morphological, anatomical or reproductive characters diagnostic of lichens or indeed Fungi as recorded in the crown group."

    "heading": "EVIDENCE FOR PRE-DEVONIAN BRYOPHYTES",
    "text": "There is no unequivocal megafossil evidence for bryophytes in the Ordovician and Silurian. Fossils from the Chinese Neoproterozoic (Longfengshania, Zhang 1988) and Cambrian (Parafunaria, Yang et al. 2004) are described as bryophyte-like on very tenuous comparative morphology. Pridoli Tortilicaulis transwallensis was originally discussed as such (Edwards 1979) based on twisting in unbranched fertile axes, but later Lochkovian specimens possessed spores typical of vascular plants and dichotomous branching in the diagnostic twisted axes (Edwards et al. 1994). However, a number of highly fragmented plant remains recovered in palynological preparations from the Middle Ordovician into the Lower Devonian have been considered favourably as evidence\nfor mosses and liverworts based on superficial resemblances by Professor Linda Graham and her team. To mimic taphonomic processes, extant bryophytes were exposed to prolonged acid hydrolysis at high temperatures, followed by treatment with HCl and HF to simulate extraction procedures. Such studies have demonstrated the resilience of the cell walls impregnated by auto-fluorescent polyphenolic compounds in certain tissues of both gametophytes and sporophytes (Kroken et al. 1996). The patterning of cells in fragments of sporangial walls of Sphagnum was compared favourably with the patterning of cell outlines in cuticles and sheets of Nematothallus recovered from Ordovician to Lower Devonian rocks, but recent work (Edwards et al. 2013) has revealed their connection to hyphae of the reconstructed Nematothallus. Similarly, the recent discovery of the tissues below the perforated, sometimes papillate cuticles called Cosmochlaina is again indicative of a hyphal construction with some hyphae penetrating the perforations (Edwards et al. 2013). This negates the hypothesis that the cuticles represent the lower epidermis of a marchantioid liverwort with the perforations representing the bases of rhizoids (Graham et al. 2004). Finally, remnants of the calyptra covering the sporangia of the moss Polytrichum recovered after acetolysis and rotting that comprised bundles of rows of elongate thick-walled cells with distinctive swollen junctions were compared with isolated tubes and wefts of tubes isolated from Silurian and Lower Devonian rocks (Kodner and Graham 2001). The wefts of tubes from Polytrichum ohioense are very similar, except for branches, to those recorded in Nematothallus thalli. The rare, very thick-walled isolated tube (Edwards 1982), illustrated for comparison with that from P. commune, lacks swellings and has recently been found associated with wefts of narrow thin-walled hyphae (work in progress). The thinwalled branched tube (named Ornatifilum lornensis) was illustrated from Wellman’s studies of plant debris from the Lower Old Red Sandstone of Scotland where it was considered to be part of a complex of probably hyphal filaments with phialides and conidiophores comparable with those in extant ascomycotous Fungi (Wellman 1995). Thus, such highly questionable affinities taken collectively do not add up to unequivocal evidence for bryophytes in Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian rocks (e.g. Graham et al. 2014, p. 22).\nRetallack’s (2001) claim that ichnotaxa (burrows) and palaeosols in the Upper Ordovician Juniata Formation (Pennsylvania) provided the earliest evidence for plant– animal interaction on land in a liverwort–millipede polsterland community living on flood plains in a semi-arid topical setting has recently been challenged on sedimentological grounds by Davies et al. (2010), who interpreted the sedimentology as from a marginal marine environment of deposition. Retallack had speculated that plants\nmust have been present to support the animal community (most likely millipedes) as evidenced by burrows in the palaeosols and coprolites in the burrows, and although there is no evidence of liverworts in the strata, the presence of tetrads in coeval rocks made these, in his opinion, the most likely candidates."

    "heading": "EVIDENCE FROM SEDIMENTOLOGY FOR PRE-DEVONIAN VEGETATION",
    "text": "Davies and Gibling have published a series of articles in which they relate changes in fluvial facies from the base of the Cambrian to the end of the Devonian (e.g. Davies and Gibling 2010a, b; Davies et al. 2011; Gibling and Davies 2012). Their case histories were based mainly in North America and Europe. They divided the time interval into five stages (VS2–6) which reflect the changing composition of vegetation on land and discussed the interrelationships between vegetation and changes in fluvial style. A recent change in the timing of first records of major innovation somewhat modifies their conclusions. The first embryophytes as recorded by the appearance of cryptospores (cryptophytes) occurs in the Dapingian (Middle Ordovician) but the range of the earliest trilete spores, regarded as deriving from tracheophytes, is extended into the Katian (Upper Ordovician). There is a change in vegetational composition in the Ludlow in that the small rhyniophytes/rhynophytoids known from megafossils as old as the Wenlock are replaced in the Ludlow by the much larger tracheophytes that characterize the Pragian in Arctic Canada (Kotyk et al. 2002) and Australia (Tims 1980). Vegetational stages VS3 and VS4 show ever-increasing contributions of mudstones in fluvial and coastal deposits interpreted as indicating increased upland weathering of the baffling and binding of small grains in sediments in the lowlands. The beginnings of very limited changes in architectural style as evidenced by lateral accretion and hence meandering and bank stabilization are recorded in the Pridoli of southern Britain. This is not unexpected. Although there is a change in the taxonomic composition of vegetation in VS3 and VS4, the earliest tracheophytes, as marked by the appearance of trilete spores, were probably very small and of similar architecture to some cryptophytes with similar impact on substrate, although we have absolutely no direct evidence on the nature of the basal regions of the plants. Thus, the distinction between VS3 and VS4 based on biological relationships seems unnecessary, merely indicating a change in affinities of the components of the CCs. Comparisons between the fluvial styles of late Silurian and Lochkovian sequences in Arctic Canada and southern Britain are of particular interest, because assemblages in the latter are dominated\nby rhynophytes/rhyniophytoids (axial tissues with terminal sporangia) except for middle–upper Lochkovian Zosterophyllum. By contrast, the Canadian Silurian assemblage is dominated by zosterophylls, which are related to later Pragian representatives which possess extensive creeping rhizomes with downwardly branching rooting structures at intervals (Gensel et al. 2001, Kotyk et al. 2002). In the intervening Pridoli interval, there is a marked difference in fluvial deposition between the two areas in that calcic vertisols are not recorded in Canada (Miall and Gibling 1978) where aeolian deposits and evaporates indicate an arid climate. In the Anglo Welsh region, there are abundant calcic vertisols linked to deposition in a monsoonal climate, high annual rainfall, strong seasonality between wet and dry periods (Love and Williams 2000), indicative of climate not vegetation control on sedimentation. Vegetational Stage 5 is thus transitional between the CCs of little impact on fluvial architecture and the first larger plants with extensive rooting systems, the earliest best known from the Givetian, Eifelian plant records being rare. Its members show a wide range of adaptations to facilitate anchorage and exploitation of a greater volume of soil for water and mineral nutrients. The plants themselves might have had substantial aerial biomass and basal regions colonizing soil surfaces or penetrating the substrate. Limited superficial rhizomatous systems are best known from the Rhynie Chert with rhizoids preserved on lower surfaces. Very rare examples of ‘uprooted’ almost intact plants preserved in clastic rocks show tufted rooting structures (e.g. Pragian zosterophylls, Arctic Canada; Basinger et al. 1996). Adventitious rooting systems are known from (pre) lycophytes, for example Asteroxylon and Drepanophycus, and these penetrate several centimetres of soil (Kidston and Lang 1920) or sediment (Rayner 1984).\nINTERACTIONS OF CCS WITH ABIOTIC FACTORS RELEVANT TO GROWTH, SURVIVAL AND IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT\nModellers (e.g. Herrmann et al. 2004a, b; Godd eris et al. 2014; Nardin et al. 2011; Pohl et al. 2014) use a number of physical parameters in their reconstruction of past climates that can be modified by the performance of land vegetation and its environmental consequences. These physical factors and the availability of essential nutrient elements are reviewed here. As background, we first describe the composition of CCs in the mid-Palaeozoic and, today, the latter providing information on how photosynthetic organisms interact with the environment, which can inform analysis of how the mid-Palaeozoic CCs might have performed."

    "text": "The fossil record provided information on cryptophytes, cyanobacterial mats, Fungi including lichened examples, and early tracheophytes probably of the architecture exemplified by Cooksonia, although initially lacking the strengthening tissues (Edwards et al. 1986). Younger anatomically preserved cryptophytes include those with branching sporophytes, but the majority are preserved as sporangia and older examples are represented by spores indicating again a predominance of parenchymadominated tissues as is seen in bryophytes.\nThere is very limited fossil evidence for Cyanobacteria, but S anchez-Baracaldo et al. (2014) have demonstrated that organisms such as the non-heterocystous diazotrophic Collema and heterocystous diazotrophic Nostoc first occurred not later than the Neoproterozoic. Similarly, although there are no fossil records of terrestrial eukaryotic algae, molecular studies and fossils of aquatic algae show that green algae of the Chlorophyta sensu stricto (free-living Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae, and lichenized Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae), all with desiccation-tolerant representatives in CCs today, would have been present (Lewis and Lewis 2005; Raven and Edwards 2014). Among the non-photosynthetic biota, the occurrence of Archaea and noncyanobacterial Bacteria seems inevitable. For Fungi, calibrated molecular clock data (L€ucking et al. 2009; Prieto and Wedin 2013) suggest the occurrence of Mucoromycotina, Glomeromycotina and Basidiomycotina and at least basal Ascomycotina in the mid-Palaeozoic, although lichenized Ascomycotina, comprising the majority of extant lichens, did not occur until the Early Carboniferous. This means that any lichens in the midPalaeozoic would have been like Winfrenatia or would have been basidiolichens.\nThus, taxonomically, apart from basal embryophytes replacing bryophytes, tissue composition, physiognomy, habitat interactions and land vegetation during this time interval would have analogues in cryptogamic ground covers today, but excluding those which are epiphytic on tracheophytes."

    "text": "Photosynthetic members today include Cyanobacteria (free living, such as the non-heterocystous diazotrophic Collema and heterocystous diazotrophic Nostoc, and Nostoc in cyanolichens), Chlorophyta sensu stricto (freeliving Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae, and lichenized Trebouxiophyceae and Ulvophyceae) and Streptophyta (algae, as free-living Charophyceae, and the non-vascular embryophytic hornworts, liverworts and\nmosses) (Housman et al. 2006; Thomas and Dougill 2007; Bolhuis et al. 2010; Gadd and Raven 2010; Fu cikov a et al. 2014; Raven and Edwards 2014). Non-photosynthetic biota associated with the photosynthetic members of CCs include Archaea, non-cyanobacterial Bacteria and non-lichenized Fungi forming mycorrhizal associations (Mucoromycotina, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota) (Smith and Read 2008; Bidartondo and Duckett 2010; Gadd and Raven 2010; Pressel et al. 2010; Bidartondo et al. 2011; Field et al. 2015; Rimington et al. 2015). All of the Glomeromycota are symbiotic, associated with a cyanobacterium as Geosiphon, or as arbuscular mycorrhizas with non-vascular embryophytes such as liverworts in the Marchantiopsida as well as vascular embryophytes (Smith and Read 2008; Bidartondo and Duckett 2010; Gadd and Raven 2010; Pressel et al. 2010; Bidartondo et al. 2011; Field et al. 2015; Rimington et al. 2015). Members of the other three fungal phyla also form mycorrhizal symbioses with non-vascular embryophytes, with Mucoromycotina forming symbioses with the basal clade (the Haplomitropsida) of liverworts, the basal clade of embryophytes (Smith and Read 2008; Bidartondo and Duckett 2010; Humphreys et al. 2010; Pressel et al. 2010; Bidartondo et al. 2011; Field et al. 2015; Rimington et al. 2015), as well as vascular embryophytes (Smith and Read 2008; Rimington et al. 2015).\nRelevant abiotic factors and interactions with CCs: physical factors\nPhotosynthetically active radiation: effects on CCs. The increase in solar energy output with time (the ‘Faint Young Sun’ hypothesis) means that the flux of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) incident on the top of the Earth’s atmosphere was a few per cent less than today; there were more days per year, and shorter photoperiods and scotoperiods (Raven and Edwards 2014). There was a significantly lower daily integral of PAR (faint young sun plus shorter photoperiod), and a slightly lower yearly integral PAR (faint young sun). None of these differences should have posed significant problems for the photosynthetic elements relative to PAR (Raven and Edwards 2014). The global impact of clouds as PAR screens and PAR reflectors would probably have been the same as today, but the incidence of cloud in the past is not well constrained.\nPhotosynthetically active radiation: effects of CCs. It is unlikely that CCs influenced cloudiness. One possibility relates to those of saline inland habitats producing high concentrations of compatible solutes. If one of these compatible solutes was dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), it would break down to produce the volatile dimethylsul-\nphide (DMS), and hence SO2 and H2SO4 (Charlson et al. 1987). H2SO4 forms cloud condensation nuclei, and thus clouds (Charlson et al. 1987); DMSP-producing organisms in these saline habitats could increase Earth’s albedo. The original Charlson–Lovelock–Andreae–Warren hypothesis (CLAW; Charlson et al. 1987) may have overestimated the importance of biogenic atmospheric H2SO4 and hence its potential to have Gaia-like effects on cloudiness and Earth surface temperature (Tyrrell 2013). Most of the probable contributors to pre-tracheophyte dominance in CCs (i.e. Cyanobacteria; Chlorophyta, predominantly the Trebouxiophyceae, but also Charophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Ulvophyceae; Embryophyta; associated Fungi, Archaea and Bacteria (Fu cikov a et al. 2014; Raven and Edwards 2014)) are not known as major producers of DMSP, and hence DMS, unlike marine members of the Haptophyta and Dinophyta.\nUltraviolet radiation: effects on CCs. UVB (and UVA) probably had a slightly higher flux incident on the top of the Earth’s atmosphere than occurs today, so slightly greater flux at the Earth’s surface assuming the same cloud cover and (for UVB) O3 content of the stratosphere. Assuming similar UV screening by the organisms to that occurring today, there is more potential for damage to nucleic acids, proteins and phenolics by UVB (less damage by UVA), and also more potential for a small contribution to photosynthesis from UVA, despite its shorter wavelength range (320–400 nm) than the normally accepted 400–700 nm range for PAR (Cockell and Knowland 1999). Photosynthetic organisms also have mechanisms that repair at least some of the damage caused by UVB (Sinha and H€ader 2002). UVB- and/or UVA-screening compounds that restrict the UV flux to the interior of cells occur in many organisms; both extracellular in sheaths (e.g. scytonemin in Cyanobacteria) or cell walls (e.g. of mosses) and soluble intracellular UVscreening compounds occur in components of CCs, of which Cyanobacteria and mosses are the best-investigated examples (Cockell and Knowland 1999; Clarke and Robinson 2008; Varnali and Edwards 2010). The small optical thickness of many components of CCs restricts their capacity to screen UVB (Raven 1991; Garcia-Pichel 1994). It would be unwise, in the present state of knowledge, to suggest which of the taxa comprising CCs is most UVB-resistant.\nUltraviolet radiation: effects of CCs. The effect of CCs on the UVB flux reaching the surface of vegetation is probably minimal. The production of stratospheric O3-destroying volatile chloro- and bromocarbons today involves volcanism and, predominantly, biosynthesis by marine micro-organisms (Watling and Harper 1998; Keppler et al. 2000). Sources of chloro- and bromocarbons on\nland today that involve biology are wildfire and woodrotting Fungi, and also abiological degradation of organic matter (Watling and Harper 1998; Keppler et al. 2000). The involvement of CCs in the present-day production of volatile halocarbons is probably negligible, although the production of halocarbons by those on saline environments needs investigation. Denitrifying Archaea and Bacteria produce N2O that is known to destroy stratospheric O3 (Portmann et al. 2012).\nBefore there was a significant tracheophyte contribution to terrestrial vegetation, there would have been no wood, so the abiotic and fungal contributions to volatile halocarbon production would have been less than today, and the overall contribution of terrestrial biota to global biological production of halocarbons would probably have been less than that today, assuming a similar flux from the ocean to that found today.\nTemperature: effects on CCs. Today, mosses, trebouxiophycean alga such as Coccomyxa and Prasiola, free-living Cyanobacteria and lichens are common on (relatively) snow-free terrestrial polar habitats with (on the Antarctic continent) only two species of vascular plant (Broady 1996; Robinson et al. 2003; Konrat et al. 2008; Geffert et al. 2013). Some terrestrial Cyanobacteria and trebouxiophycean green algae are tolerant of high temperatures for growth, and many components are tolerant of lower and higher temperatures when desiccated than they are when growing (Sand-Jensen and Jesperson 2012). These distribution and laboratory data show a wider range of tolerance of temperature by cryoptophytes than by tracheophytes. So, CCs with their present temperature tolerance should have coped with essentially all terrestrial habitats in the Early Palaeozoic before there was a significant tracheophyte component in the vegetation.\nTemperature: effects of CCs. If the CLAW hypothesis survived further scrutiny for cryptophytes (Tyrrell 2013) and caused a global increase in cloud cover, it would result in decreasing incoming short-wave, including near infrared, solar radiation incident on the Earth’s surface and hence decrease Earth surface temperature.\nSurface roughness: effects on CCs. Low surface roughness allows a thicker atmospheric diffusion boundary layer over the vegetation (Jones 2014). This means a lower diffusive conductance for ecophysiologically important gases such as CO2, O2 and H2O vapour, as well as for conductive exchange of heat (a small component relative to radiative and convective heat exchange) (Jones 2014). Low surface roughness means that plant factors regulating gas exchange become relatively less important (Kellner 2001; Rice and Schneider 2004; Jones 2014).\nSurface roughness: effects of CCs. The mechanical properties of CCs restrict the extent to which an organism can grow in height without support from surrounding cryptophytes. Although the polytrichaceous moss Dawsonia can grow to 0.5 m above surrounding vegetation, this occurs in sheltered (from wind) conditions under much taller tracheophyte vegetation. With a smaller height range among CCs in the open habitats of the Early and midPalaeozoic with no tall tracheophyte vegetation, there would have been a smaller surface roughness than in much of the tracheophyte-containing vegetation today (see Thomas and Dougill 2007; Jones 2014).\nAlbedo: effects on CCs. High albedo of CCs vegetation in the PAR range (400–700 nm) decreases the PAR incident on photosynthetic pigments and so decreases the rate of photosynthesis at relatively low PARs, and also decreases the potential for photodamage at high PARs, for a given external radiation field (Jones 2014). The lower absorptance of PAR (and near infrared) means that there is less photon energy dissipated as sensible heat (lower plant temperature) and/or as latent heat of evaporation of water, and hence decreased water vapour loss in transpiration (Jones 2014). A higher cryptophyte albedo in the UVB means less potential for UVB damage in a given radiation environment (Jones 2014).\nAlbedo: effects of cryptophytes. Components of the CCs lack the highly reflective cuticle found in some desert tracheophytes, so the maximum albedo by CCs is less than that of tracheophyte vegetation (Jones 2014). Aside from this, depending on the reflective properties of the substrate, CCs can have a higher or lower albedo than adjacent unvegetated areas, with effects on temperature of the vegetation relative to unvegetated areas (Tsoar and Karnieli 1995; Jones 2014).\nRelevant abiotic factors and interactions with CCs: nutrient chemicals that regulate the physical environment\nWater: effects on CCs. Members of the CCs are at the poikilohydric end of the poikilohydry–homoiohydry continuum, and many are at the desiccation-tolerant end of the desiccation-tolerant–desiccation-intolerant continuum (Raven and Edwards 2014, table 3.2). They have a limited capacity to restrict water loss, but are generally tolerant of desiccation when not growing. Cyanobacteria and cyanolichens, and embryophytes, can only rehydrate from liquid water; some terrestrial green algae, and chlorolichens, can rehydrate from water vapour, within certain limits of relative humidity (Raven and Edwards 2014). Photosynthesis may be restricted by CO2 supply when there is a\nthick water layer over the organism as a result of the low diffusivity of CO2 in water, especially a problem for bryophytes and some trebouxiophyceans (e.g. those in some lichens) that lack CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), assuming the distribution of CCMs was the same as today (see ‘Carbon dioxide: effects on CCs’ below). Cyanobacteria almost certainly had CCMs in the mid-Palaeozoic; this is probably not the case for trebouxiophyceans (Meyer et al. 2008; Raven et al. 2012; Meyer and Griffiths 2013; Raven and Beardall 2014). Extant hornworts that have CCMs only acquired these in the past 100 m.y. (Villarreal and Renner 2012; Meyer and Griffiths 2013). Problems with CO2 supply are partly offset by the high atmospheric CO2 in the Ordovician (and the rest of the Early Palaeozoic). The presence of CCMs could increase nitrogen-use efficiency (mol carbon assimilated in growth per unit nitrogen in the organism per unit time) and water-use efficiency (mol carbon assimilated in growth per unit water lost under emersed conditions) in the growth of cryptophytes (Surif and Raven 1989, 1990).\nThe distribution and tolerance data discussed above for temperature (Broady 1996; Robinson et al. 2003; Konrat et al. 2008; Sand-Jensen and Jesperson 2012; Geffert et al. 2013) are also relevant to the range of water availabilities tolerated by extant members, and hence their ability to colonize a great range of habitats before the advent of tracheophytes as a significant component of the terrestrial vegetation.\nWater: effects of CCs. Bog-producing bryophytes create an extraplant water store, but this only occurs in habitats that have high precipitation:evaporation ratios. If the CLAW hypothesis survived further scrutiny for these communities (Tyrrell 2013), it could alter rainfall patterns, but this would not necessarily be to the advantage of the producer organisms.\nOxygen: effects on CCs. While some estimates of O2 suggest values of 75% or higher of the PAL, others (Bergman et al. 2004) suggest values closer to 25% of PAL. This latter, lower, value would mean that there was less stratospheric O3 and hence more UVB reaching the Earth’s surface (see sections on ultraviolet radiation above). Atmospheric O2 at 25% of PAL would also have meant less production of oxidized non-N2 forms of N by lightning, as well as less effect of O2 on Rubisco carboxylase in organisms relying on diffusive CO2 entry in photosynthesis, as a result of the higher atmospheric CO2:O2 than is the case today (Harfoot et al. 2007). The lower O2 levels would have meant that maintaining the rate per unit biomass at levels found in extant organisms with low O2-affinity oxygenases used in the production of some defence compounds (possibly including, in embryophytes,\nprecursors of lignin) would have involved a compensatory increase in O2-saturated enzyme activity, and a corresponding increase in enzyme protein content (Raven and Edwards 2014).\nThere is no charcoal as an indicator of wildfire before 419 Ma, and there were no significant tracheophyte contributions to vegetation (Glasspool et al. 2004; Glasspool and Scott 2010). This absence could be the result of a low vegetation standing crop (see ‘Oxygen: effects of CCs’ below), and an oxygen concentration that, at the lower end of the range of estimates, would not be able to support wildfire (Glasspool et al. 2004; Glasspool and Scott 2010).\nOxygen: effects of CCs. A role for CCs in atmospheric oxygenation depends on whether there was sufficient burial of organic carbon produced, and insufficient oxidation of ferrous iron and of sulphide to remove the oxygen equivalent to the organic carbon burial. The small standing biomass (about 1% of present terrestrial vegetation biomass) with its rapid turnover (perhaps due to the lack of recalcitrant organic matter in the organisms) allows rapid turnover of this biomass, and the small standing biomass was unlikely to have allowed sufficient organic carbon burial to significantly alter the atmospheric oxygen content.\nCarbon dioxide: effects on CCs. Studies on photosynthesis in components of present-day cryptophyte vegetation show that some rely on diffusive CO2 entry, while others have CCMs (Meyer et al. 2008; Raven et al. 2012; Meyer and Griffiths 2013; Raven and Edwards 2014). Organisms relying on diffusive CO2 entry are some free-living and lichenized trebouxiophycean green algae, liverworts, mosses and some hornworts. Organisms with CCMs are free-living and lichenized Cyanobacteria, some free-living and lichenized trebouxiophycean green algae and some hornworts. Members of other classes of green algae found in CCs (Charophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Ulvophyceae) do not seem to have been examined as to their mechanism of inorganic carbon acquisition. Under water-availability conditions resulting in no, or thin, surface water films (but without restrictions on photosynthetic capacity by loss of intracellular water) organisms lacking CCMs will have an increased photosynthetic rate at levels of CO2 above PAL (40 Pa CO2). Organisms with CCMs are CO2-saturated when CO2 is at PAL (Surif and Raven 1989, 1990), and therefore their photosynthetic rate will be unaffected by any increase.\nThere were probably fewer organisms with CCMs in the CCs of the Early Palaeozoic with CO2 concentrations of around 10-fold the PAL (Bergman et al. 2004). The beta-Cyanobacteria, whose Form IB Rubisco has a low CO2 affinity and low CO2/O2 selectivity, would almost certainly have had CCMs, while the extant hornworts with CCMs have only acquired them over the last 100 Ma; i.e.\na similar time interval to that of the origin and diversification of C4 flowering plants (Raven et al 2012; Villarreal and Renner 2012). While the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus could well have been limiting for the terrestrial flora before tracheophyte dominance, work on eukaryotic algae shows that CCMs are retained at higher CO2 concentrations for growth under nitrogen and (often) phosphorus limitation than is the case for growth under nitrogen- and phosphorus-replete conditions (Raven and Beardall 2014). Extant Cyanobacteria do not repress their CCMs when grown in Early Devonian CO2 concentrations (Raven et al. 2012). The timing of the origin of CCMs in eukaryotic algae is unresolved (Raven et al. 2012; Meyer and Griffiths 2013), but it is likely that CCMs had not evolved in the early to mid-Palaeozoic. Regardless of the presence or absence of CCMs, all elements of the cryptophyte vegetation would probably have been CO2-saturated under water availability conditions giving no, or thin, surface water films but without restrictions on photosynthetic capacity by loss of intracellular water. Thicker surface films of dew or rainwater (relatively low pH; air-equilibrium CO2 and little or no HCO3 ) would have been more likely to limit the rate of photosynthesis than the same thickness of water that had been involved in weathering of silicate and/or carbonate rocks. The argument here requires that: (1) the water had been able to reequilibrate with the atmosphere to replace CO2 used in weathering; and (2) the photosynthetic organisms have HCO3 transporters as part of CCMs (Cyanobacteria) or, in the absence of CCMs, have extracellular carbonic anhydrase converting HCO3 into CO2, with the CO2 consumed in photosynthesis after diffusive entry.\nThe natural abundance of stable carbon isotopes in organic material in fossils of photosynthetic organism has been used to support the suggestion that the organisms were terrestrial (Tomescu et al. 2009a; Raven and Edwards 2014) and their possible phylogenetic relationships (Fletcher et al. 2004; Raven and Edwards 2014). However, the range of carbon isotope ratios for extant organisms in aquatic habitats extends from higher values than occur in terrestrial organisms to lower values than found in terrestrial organisms (Raven and Edwards 2014). Even allowing for the probable absence of CCMs from eukaryotic members of CCs in the mid-Palaeozoic, with corresponding decreased (i.e. to lower) d13C values of those eukaryotes that today have CCMs, the Cyanobacteria would still have had CCMs and relatively positive d13C values (Raven et al. 2012; Meyer and Griffiths 2013; Raven and Edwards 2014; see Fletcher et al. 2004, appendix and Lakatos et al. 2007, fig. 6.2). This makes the natural abundance of stable isotopes an inappropriate indicator of habitat of phylogenetic affiliations unless more additional information is available.\nCarbon dioxide: effects of CCs. Drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide by CCs in the early to mid-Palaeozoic depends on the extent of burial of organic carbon produced in CCs photosynthesis, and the extent of CCs-induced weathering of, especially, silicates. Silicate weathering is particularly important because of the incomplete reversal of CO2 drawdown by marine processes, in contrast to carbonate weathering that can be offset by marine processes in <1 Ma. Such areas are explored further below.\nRelevant abiotic factors and interactions with CCs: chemicals acting mainly as plant nutrients\nNitrogen: effects on CCs. Atmospheric N2 is generally assumed to have been relatively constant over billions of years. N2 is the major contributor to total atmospheric pressure today, and recent application of Lyell’s (1851) method of estimating total atmospheric pressure from raindrop impact structures gave a value of 0.5–2.0 of the present value in the Archaean (Som et al. 2012). There are no such estimates for the early to midPalaeozoic.\nNitrogen is an essential element for all organisms. CCs are unable to use atmospheric N2 to supply the N needed for growth, with the exception of diazotrophs such as some Cyanobacteria (free living and in symbiosis), some other Bacteria and Archaea. The CC Cyanobacteria include Collema, a non-heterocystous filamentous organism morphologically similar to Oscillatoria, and the freeliving and lichenized heterocystous filamentous Nostoc that occurs not only on land but also in fresh waters (Housman et al. 2006; Bolhuis et al. 2010). Apart from biological N2 fixation, non-N2 N in oxidized form (NO, NO2, HNO3) is made available from lightning and, in amounts two orders of magnitude smaller globally but perhaps locally important, terrestrial volcanism (Mather et al. 2004a, b). Assuming similar frequency of lightning, the lower atmospheric O2 (25% of PAL) and N2 (assumed to be the PAL) partial pressures in the early to mid-Palaeozoic would result in rates of production of NO, NO2 and HNO3 that were 25% of those occurring today (Bergman et al. 2004).\nThere is negligible non-N2 N in igneous rocks. This is also the case for sedimentary rocks, with the exception of highly localized cases from the Pleistocene (guano; coprolites; Chilean saltpetre), biogenic non-N2 N involving birds and mammals.\nDiazotrophy requires more Fe (invariably), Mo (usually) and P (frequently) per unit biomass than does growth on non-N2 N. Fe would have been less available in the higher O2 early to mid-Palaeozoic than through most of the Proterozoic, while Mo would have been more available.\nNitrogen: effects of CCs. CCs would not have had a significant effect on the quantity of atmospheric N2. Depending on the extent of waterlogging, denitrifying Archaea and Bacteria would have contributed to atmospheric N2O and hence stratospheric O3 destruction. Diazotrophy would have increased the quantity of non-N2 N in the terrestrial biosphere. Ascomycota and especially Basidiomycota, as ectomycorrhizas in certain seed plants, are able to access N from recalcitrant high molecular mass organic complexes in soil (Smith and Read 2008). Whether these two fungal clades in association with extant bryophytes have similar functions has not been investigated. The nonvascular embryophyte mycorrhizas (Glomeromycota in the Marchantopsida; Mucoromycotina in the Haplomitropsida) have been shown to enhance uptake of ammonium, but more recalcitrant N forms have not been tested (Humphreys et al. 2010; Field et al. 2012, 2015).\nPhosphorus: effects on CCs. The essential element P occurs as apatite in igneous rocks, and from apatite and phosphorites in sedimentary rocks, with localized concentrations of phosphorites that are commercially viable as sources of rock phosphate for the production of P fertilizers and other uses from 2.1 Ga onwards (Papineau 2010). However, the concentration of dissolved inorganic orthophosphate in equilibrium with P in rocks is very low.\nPhosphorus: effects of CCs. Biological weathering increases the concentration of dissolved inorganic orthophosphate in solution. Particularly important is the production and secretion of citrate by CCs and by plants roots (Neaman et al. 2005; Lambers et al. 2008; Lenton et al. 2012; Porada et al. 2014). This releases P as dissolved inorganic orthophosphate by anion exchange from P bound to Fe2O3 and Al2O3 and P from apatite. Increased citrate secretion as a response to P limitation, both in very P-depleted soils and from volcanic soils where P is not readily available, occurs in a variety of flowering plants; no other embryophytes, or other cryptophytes, seem to have been examined for this response. However, it is known that the moss Physcomitrella patens secretes citrate as well as glycerate, malate and succinate, and showed that the moss increased P weathering from granite and andesite 60-fold (Lenton et al. 2012).\nGranted the occurrence of low concentrations of dissolved inorganic orthophosphate in the soil solution, rhizines/rhizoids/root hairs and mycorrhizal Fungi increase the volume of soil explored, and then exploited, for dissolved inorganic orthophosphate at a lower resource cost per unit of soil than normal rooting structures. Of these, the glomeromycote arbuscular–vesicular (AM) mycorrhizas have particular advantages over rhizines/rhizoids/ root hairs for minimizing resource input per unit soil explored in terms of their smaller radius, longer lifetime\nand greater volume of soil explored (Smith and Read 2008). AMs are very common among extant vascular plants, but basal embryophytes, and especially mosses, have no, or non-glomeromycote, as well as glomeromycote, fungal associates in parallel with their rhizoids. Many thalloid liverworts have glomeromycote AMs (Smith and Read 2008; Bidartondo and Duckett 2010; Humphreys et al. 2010; Bidartondo et al. 2011; Field et al. 2015; Rimington et al. 2015). The Fungi involved in these non-glomeromycote symbioses are members of the mucoromycotes, ascomycotes and basidiomycotes. The Mucoromycotina form associations with basal liverworts, some lycopods and a fern, while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota occur in some bryophytes and in seed plants as ericoid and ectomycorrhizas (Smith and Read 2008; Bidartondo and Duckett 2010; Bidartondo et al. 2011; Field et al. 2012; Field et al. 2015; Rimington et al. 2015). These non-vascular embryophyte mycorrhizas have been shown to enhance uptake of inorganic orthophosphate (Humphreys et al. 2010; Field et al. 2012, 2015); no attempts seem to have been made to determine whether the mycorrhizas of non-vascular embryophytes can access organic P or insoluble metal (Ca, Al, Fe) complexes of phosphate.\nOnce a terrestrial biosphere has been established, the turnover of organisms produces phosphate esters in the soil; these cannot be taken up and are converted into dissolved inorganic orthophosphate by extracellular phosphatases that have been characterized from marine and freshwater Cyanobacteria and algae, lichens and flowering plants. In the chlorolichen Cladonia portentosa (Hogan et al. 2010), its expression is increased by phosphorus deficiency, as is the case for other organisms. Bacteria associated with the chlorolichen Lobaria pulmonaria can, from genomic evidence, produce proteins associated with phosphorus mobilization (Grube et al. 2015).\nIron: effects on CCs. Fe deficiency decreases the growth of all organisms, but has a particular impact on diazotrophic organisms (Kustka et al. 2003). Fe is a relatively abundant element, but has limited availability from oxygenated environments due to the very low solubility of the predominant redox state of Fe (Fe3+) in these conditions (Raven and Edwards 2001; Raven 2013).\nIron: effects of CCs. Aquatic Cyanobacteria produce and secrete siderophores, organic compounds that chelate Fe3+; the Fe3+-containing siderophore can then be taken up by the producer Cyanobacteria, as well as by other (cheating, rather than chelating) organisms (Raven and Edwards 2001; Kustka et al. 2003). A few algae, and some Fungi, also secrete siderophores (Raven 2013). A number of aquatic algae have surface reductases that convert extracellular Fe3+ to extracellular Fe2+; the Fe2+ can then\nbe taken up by the algal cells (Raven and Edwards 2001; Raven 2013). Cryptophytes do not seem to have been physiologically examined for either of these two mechanisms of Fe acquisition, although there is genomic evidence for siderophore production by Bacteria associated with the chlorolichen Lobaria pulmonaria (Grube et al. 2015). Lenton et al. (2012) showed that the moss Physcomitrella patens increased Fe weathering from granite 170-fold and from andesite 360-fold relative to controls lacking the moss but, apparently, not sterile. However, the closed system used in this investigation means that the solution surrounding the grains of rock rapidly becomes saturated with Fe, so pH increases and the rate of dissolution declines.\nESTIMATES OF NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY, BIOMASS AND BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN FIXATION OF MID-PALAEOZOIC CCS AS A BASIS FOR MODELLING OF THEIR GLOBAL IMPACT\nHere, the estimates of extant global net primary productivity, biomass and biological nitrogen fixation resulting from CCs are used to suggest values for net primary productivity, biomass and biological nitrogen fixation before there was a significant tracheophyte contribution to terrestrial vegetation. Such estimates of the global contribution of mid-Palaeozoic CCs are needed for modelling of their possible global impact on atmospheric composition and weathering.\nContribution of extant CCs to global terrestrial net primary productivity and biological nitrogen fixation\nGlobally, CCs (cryptogamic ground covers plus cryptogamic plant covers, i.e. epiphytic on tracheophytes) today convert some 0.32 Pmol C from carbon dioxide to organic carbon per year; this is some 7% of the net primary productivity of terrestrial vegetation (Belnap 2012; Elbert et al. 2012). An even more extreme difference occurs for the biomass, as organic C content of CCs (0.41 Pmol C) and total terrestrial vegetation (39– 54 Pmol C) today (Elbert et al. 2012). Elbert et al. (2012) divided the C-based biomass by the C-based net primary productivity to yield a turnover time for the C in biomass, giving values of 1.2 years for CCs (with a smaller content of refractory organic matter) and 10 years for total terrestrial vegetation (with more refractory organic material); both of these are much larger than the 2–20 days for oceanic phytoplankton.\nThe free-living and lichenized Cyanobacteria, and diazotrophic Archaea and non-cyanobacterial Bacteria (see next paragraph), in CCs (again, cryptogamic ground covers plus cryptogamic plant covers) account for 3.9 TMol non-N2 N production by biological nitrogen fixation, which is nearly half of nitrogen fixation on land (Elbert et al. 2012).\nPossible global terrestrial net primary productivity and biological nitrogen fixation in the mid-Palaeozoic before a significant contribution from tracheophytes\nIn considering what global CO2 and N2 assimilation could have occurred on land in the early to mid-Palaeozoic before tracheophytes became significant contributors, we can consider present-day global estimates for cryptogamic ground cover and the area occupied by this cover. For carbon, we use the values from Elbert et al. (2012), with further details of upper limits on the estimates and sensitivity analysis in Porada et al. (2013) and Porada et al. (2014). From Elbert et al. (2012, table S1a), the global net carbon assimilation by cryptogamic ground cover today is 0.20 Pmol C per year out of a total for cryptogamic ground cover plus cryptogamic plant cover of 0.32 Pmol C. The total area of cryptogamic ground cover today is 68.38.1012 m2 (Elbert et al. 2012, table S1a), compared with a total land surface area of 153.0.1012 m2. The 80% of the land surface that is vegetated in today’s glaciated world (from USGS) then has an area of 122.4.1012 m2, so that the cryptogamic ground cover occupies 55% of the vegetated land area. This fraction is not, of course, to the exclusion of co-occurring tracheophytes, especially in extratropical forest, and to a decreasing extent in the order steppe, tundra and desert. Assuming that these biomes occurred in the same fractions of area in pre-tracheophyte times in the early to mid-Palaeozoic with glaciation to the same extent as today, and that the C assimilation per unit area is the same as today, global primary productivity on the land surface would have been 0.36 Pmol C per year. This compares with a global C assimilation on land today (tracheophytes plus cryptogamic ground cover of 4.7 Pmol C per year). The present-day value is 4.7/0.36 or 13 times the value estimated for CCs with no significant tracheophytes, remembering the assumptions made and the comments in Porada et al. (2013) and Porada et al. (2014).\nOf course, there are many assumptions in relating cryptogamic ground cover today to that in pre-tracheophyte times. Examples are the effects of the higher CO2 concentrations in the early to mid-Palaeozoic, the absence of shading of that component of cryptogamic ground under tracheophytes in forest, and to a lesser extent in\nsteppe, communities, and the absence of the significant tracheophyte contribution to pedogenesis. Nevertheless, the calculations are likely to be correct in indicating much lower total net primary productivity in times before there was a significant tracheophyte contribution than is the case today, with very low terrestrial primary productivity in the Ordovician and early Silurian, based on d13C data (Jones et al. 2015).\nTurning to terrestrial biomass before there was a significant contribution by tracheophytes, we start with the extant 0.41 Pmol C for biomass of CCs, including cryptogamic ground cover and cryptogamic plant cover. The downward correction of 0.41 Pmol C for including only cryptogamic ground cover is probably similar to the upward correction of 0.41 Pmol C for the larger land area available to cryptophytes when there was a negligible tracheophyte contribution. Thus, the value of 0.41 Pmol C for global terrestrial C-based biomass of vegetation can be taken to hold for global terrestrial vegetation biomass dominated by cryptophytes. The low global biomass and rapid turnover of organic C in vegetation before there was a significant tracheophyte contribution are two factors militating against large-scale burial of organic C from pre-tracheophyte vegetation.\nFor the role of CCs today (ground cover plus plant cover) in biological nitrogen fixation, Elbert et al. (2012, table S1b) cited a global value of 3.5 Tmol N per year, which is about 46% of total global nitrogen fixation each year on land. The global value for cryptogamic ground cover alone is 2.4 Tmol N per year. Correcting for the larger ground area available to cryptophytes in pretracheophyte times (1.79-fold), this gives a value for pretracheophyte biological N fixation on land of 4.2 Tmol N per year. This value is subject, like the estimate of net primary productivity cited above, to a number of caveats. Porada et al. (2014) used the alternative approach of scaling estimates of net C assimilation (Elbert et al. 2012; Porada et al. 2013) for the C:N:P ratio of CC vegetation to give values for the range of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake of 0.25–2.5 Tmol N per year and 0.015–0.15 Tmol P per year. For cryptogamic ground cover, the extant range is 0.17–1.7 Tmol N per year and 0.011–0.11 Tmol P per year. Correcting for the larger ground area available to cryptophytes in pre-tracheophyte times (1.79-fold), this gives pre-tracheophyte values of 0.30–3.0 Tmol N per year and 0.019–0.19 Tmol P per year."

    "text": "The influence of CCs before there was a significant contribution from tracheophytes in the mid-Palaeozoic was probably more local rather than global. The impact of weathering by CCs in the supply of phosphorus and iron,\neven with as large an area of CCs as in present-day vegetation, would be significantly less than what is seen today because of the very limited depth of weathering. The lower global net primary productivity in the mid-Palaeozoic than today, plus the small fraction of intractable material in the organic carbon produced by CCs, means a more rapid turnover of terrestrial biomass than occurs today; the result is a smaller global standing biomass in the mid-Palaeozoic, with a correspondingly smaller possibility of long-term organic carbon burial with a corresponding increase in atmospheric oxygen."

    "text": "Many hypotheses relating to global climate change in the Ordovician involve increases in rock weathering with resultant drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide and associated cooling. Exceptions emphasize, inter alia, the importance of continental positions, their movement and, in particular, the location of a pole on the supercontinent, Gondwana (e.g. Caputo and Crowell 1985, Crowley and Baum 1991). More recently, Pohl et al. (2014) posited that changes in continental configurations during the Middle and Upper Ordovician had produced a 95% oceanic northern hemisphere with consequences for oceanic heat transport which could have been sufficient to account for decreases in temperature even in the absence of CO2 drawdown. A particularly comprehensive and critical review of contemporary differing approaches relating to climate modelling was provided by Boucot and Gray (2001).\nThe weathering hypothesis requires the generation of fresh rock and, as outlined earlier, the Ordovician–Silurian was a period of intense volcanic activity (Huff et al. 2010; Sell 2011). Evidence for terrestrial weathering comes from a post-Lower Ordovician substantial decrease in sea water of 87Sr/86Sr ratios, considered a proxy for global silicate weathering flux, attributable to tectonic activity (e.g. the Taconic orogeny) and the weathering of fresh continental basalt beginning in the Darriwilian (Shields et al. 2003; Young et al. 2009), as well as increase in finegrained sediments in the rock record (Davies et al. 2011). The extent of terrestrial magma production is difficult to quantify. Only one in ten volcanoes today is terrestrial and 85% by volume of products occur in the sea (e.g. Mitchell 2012). Most ash falls are preserved in oceans regardless of source (Huff et al. 2010), and there are relatively few records of oxidized basalts indicative of terrestrial lavas. There have been attempts to correlate major eruptive episodes/tectonic activity with marine carbon isotope excursions in the Late Ordovician (Sandbian\nGICE, Hirnantian HICE; Buggisch et al. 2010) and refinement of their dating reinforces coincidences (Sell et al. 2013). Quantitative approaches to assessment of contributions of abiotic weathering involve not only extent and nature of substrate but physical parameters such as temperature, moisture/precipitation, aspect, atmospheric CO2 and latitude, which also affect plant distribution and productivity. Latitude is particularly important as continents moved into the intertropical convergence zone (e.g. Nardin et al. 2011 attributed 33% of weathering in the Hirnantian to fresh magma weathering, the rest to plate movements). It has long been speculated that land surfaces before the advent of tracheophytes were not barren (see Berner 1992 for references), with ‘vegetation’ ranging from microbial crusts to lichens and bryophytes (e.g. Beerbower 1985; Gray 1985, 1993; Wellman 1999; LePage and Pfefferkorn 2000), although Nardin et al. (2011) modelled them as rocky deserts, and Jones et al. (2015) used d13C data to suggest a very limited terrestrial primary productivity in the Ordovician and early Silurian. Attempts at quantification were initially limited to field observations and measurements but have now been extended to laboratory experiments. For example, an increase in thickness of a weathering rind on the surface of a Hawaiian basalt under a lichen was later attributed to the accumulation of dust around the thalli, and although Berner and Cochran (1998) demonstrated some chemical weathering associated with lichens, this was much less than that associated with plant roots. Colonization by higher plants (e.g. ferns and angiosperms) tends to concentrate in crevasses where the nitrogen-deficient substrate characteristic of basalts is enhanced by dust and accumulation of water. The actual surfaces of the basalt of pahoehoe type tend to be smooth and glassy, relatively dense and impermeable, and apart from lichens and very occasionally mosses are devoid of vegetation over long periods. Only on the removal of the rind does agricultural cultivation become possible. The rough rubbly clinkers of a’a lava flows tend to be highly porous and often too dry for colonization. Although intrinsically high in mineral nutrients, lavas are generally inhospitable substrates for colonization. It has recently been shown that regeneration of trees on lavas in the Central Oregon Cascades, USA, was facilitated by the introduction of ash, with greater mineral accessibility introduced by either wind or flooding episodes (Deligne et al. 2013). This introduces the relative importance of ash, plus other constituents of pyroclastic flows, and lava in consideration of vegetationmediated weathering both today and in mid-Palaeozoic times. The substrates may be broadly similar in chemical composition depending on type of eruption, but differ in physical properties, particularly permeability, water storage and susceptibility to erosion. Thus, the small grain size of ash (<2 mm, decreasing rapidly in grain size away\nfrom the volcano; e.g. Mt St Helens, Sarna-Wojcicki et al. 1981) facilitates more rapid chemical weathering and is water rich, but more susceptible to airborne redistribution (Deligne et al. 2013). Although today lavas are commoner around volcanic eruptions than pyroclastic activity, ashes have received more attention because ashderived soils are among the most fertile today (Ugolini and Dahlgren 2002). However, fertility results from a combination of successive ash flows and interbedded organic material produced from decaying vegetation which is exploited for nitrogen by rooted vascular plants on recolonization, thus compensating for its deficiency in the mineral nutrient ash.\nSuccessive layers of CCs would not allow such recycling, and perhaps account for their absence in recolonization of recent ash falls, for example in Mount St Helens, Surtsey and Ksudach volcanoes, where angiosperms are usually the primary colonizers (e.g. del Moral and Grishin 1999a, b; del Moral and Wood 1993; Grishin et al. 1996; Fridriksson and Magnussen 1992). Unpublished images and observations by Professor Katharine Cashman (Bristol University) are intriguing in that in Iceland today, ash surfaces alongside more or less contemporary basalts are conspicuously absent. She attributes this to the ready erodibility (and possibly low pH?) of fresh ash, with the possibility that when consolidation has occurred, much of the mineral nutrient content may have been chemically weathered. By contrast, Parnell and Foster (2012) noted the coincidence of high ash falls and the beginnings of land vegetation, and emphasized the importance of ash (with its high nutrient content, especially phosphorus, and good drainage) to colonization. As evidence, they cited the high concentration of plant spores and ‘symbiotic nitrogen fixing Fungi’ in ash today.\nThe timing of colonization, although negligible on a geological scale, has relevance to discussions here. Delays following eruptions caused by instability and possibly toxicity (low pH) would have allowed abiotic chemical weathering as well as ameliorating the substrate. Relevant literature searches covering almost all latitudes and involving both distribution of CCs and their roles in recolonization reveal little directly relevant information except to demonstrate complexity in responses, relating to climate, substrate type and aspect/landscape. Lichens (del Moral and Grishin 1999) tend to dominate on dry substrates particularly at high elevation and latitude, while mosses and liverworts are also recorded at lower latitudes, such as recorded on the thick deposits of pumice on Soufri ere, St Vincent and on Mt Pel ee (Beard 1976). Most field surveys relating to colonization were made some time (tens to hundreds of years) after eruptions and hence are dominated by records of angiosperms (usually trees). On a shorter timescale, del Moral and Grishin wrote that ‘succession has not recapitulated phylogeny’\nwhen commenting on the absence of lichens, Fungi and Cyanobacteria and the sporadic occurrence of mosses among the vascular plants on Mount St Helens, although lichens and bryophytes were recorded on Sakurajima volcano in south-west Japan (Tagawa et al. 1985). On Ksudach volcano, Kamchatka Peninsula, Grishin et al. (1996) in a survey encompassing the hundred years since eruption, reported that the immediate pioneers were angiosperm herbs, but after 20–30 years, nine species of lichens were growing on the high-altitude, deepest, nutrient-poor, acidic, rapidly draining pumice deposits to the exclusion of angiosperms. The most in-depth study based on Katmai volcano, Alaska, which has been monitored since eruption in 1912 involved both field and laboratory studies (Griggs 1933). For at least 11 years, ash, similar in chemical composition to granite, but with low K and P content, was barren, but then colonized by fertile leafy jungermannalian liverworts, Lophozia bicrenata and more importantly Cephalozia byssaca (now C. bicrenata) to the exclusion of almost all other plant species, although microscopic examination revealed fragments of moss protonema (but no fertile specimens), green algae and fungal hyphae, but no Cyanobacteria, as had been recorded as pioneers on Krakatau, which lacked liverworts (Tagawa et al. 1985). Apart from minute quantities in rainfall, Gribbs found no other nitrogen sources, nor any indications of organic matter in the substrate, and speculated the possibility of a symbiosis with a fungus. More than 75 years later, an ascomycete has been demonstrated in Cephalosia (Pressel et al. 2010) and the basidiomycete, Sebacina, in L. bicrenata. (Bidartondo and Duckett 2010). Such Fungi can access recalcitrant organic nitrogen, presumably recycling it from decaying liverworts (Smith and Read 2008). Although the liverworts reproduced prolifically, subsequent moss colonizers were less successful and exhibited stunted growth. Vascular plants were represented by rare willow seedlings. Similarly, exhaustive studies have not yet been undertaken on Iceland where CCs extend over considerable areas – and would provide an excellent outdoor laboratory for weathering and development of soils on a variety of magmatic substrates (work in progress at NHM)."

    "heading": "Quantitative laboratory approaches",
    "text": "More quantitative approaches via experiment and modelling have involved estimates of microbial soil respiration, extent of mineral weathering and microcosm experiments involving modern analogues of rooted and non-rooted ecosystems. Thus, for example, Keller and Wood (1993) argued that pre-vascular plant subaerial surfaces would have hosted algae and lichens and, from modelling respiration values in the vadose zone beneath,\nwould have produced levels of carbonic acid and weathered minerals similar to those in similar habitats in post-Silurian times, even at today’s atmospheric CO2 values. In an alternative approach, Yapp and Poths (1994) measured the Fe(CO3)OH component of goethite in an Upper Ordovician oolitic limestone which has been subjected to tropical chemical weathering. They used this as a measure of the atmospheric CO2 present at the time of goethite crystallization and derived values of microbial respiration. They concluded that the prevascular plant biota was as productive as extant tropical/ temperate examples, thus indicating significant biologically mediated chemical weathering on land, but did not extrapolate as to whether this would have been sufficient to drawn down atmospheric CO2 to levels that initiated glaciation, as was achieved by Lenton et al. (2012;\nFig. 1). Various models had suggested that glaciation became possible at values lower than c. 8 PAL and, based on scenarios in which biotic silicate weathering was not included, modelled values at 460 Ma predicted atmospheric CO2 to be c. 16 PAL (e.g. Herrmann et al. 2004b).\nLenton et al. (2012) cultured fragments of the moss, Physcomitella patens in water with fragments of basalt and andesite and then measured abundances of Ca, K, Fe, Al, K and P in the medium as indications of chemical weathering. The enhanced silicate weathering values over background abiotic effects were considered similar to those from vascular plants, and when incorporated into an adapted version of their COPSE model, the predicted CO2 value for 460 Ma dropped to 8.4 PAL with a global temperature of c. 17°C; such values are around the threshold for glaciation and are consistent with a global cooling episode. Further, Lenton et al. (2012) suggested that phosphorus released by moss-induced weathering is enhanced by a factor of 60 compared with controls lacking moss. However, this enhancement is derived from the sum of the measured phosphorus in the leachate and an assumed (from the literature) phosphorus uptake into the moss; it would have been helpful to have direct measurements. Given an increase in weathering (see also Porada et al. 2014) the additional phosphorus washed into the seas would have increased productivity and eventually led to burial of carbon as recorded in marine carbon isotope excursions (e.g. Guttenberg (GICE) and Hirnantian (HICE)) and hence further cooling. Periodicity could have resulted from exhaustion of terrestrial, and hence marine, phosphate, with subsequent increased phosphate input from volcanicity, and from glaciation followed by deglaciation. Midde–Late Ordovician phosphate-rich limestones on Laurentia associated with upwelling and high d13C (GICE; Lavoie and Asselin 1998; Pope and Steffen 2003; Cherns and Wheeley 2007), as also seen at each end of\nthe Proterozoic (Papineau 2010), deserve further attention in this respect.\nSuch microcosm experiments can always be criticized as regards procedural detail and difficulties of scaling up globally. A major problem with the measurements in Lenton et al. (2012) is that these relate to grain-scale weathering, while what moves to the ocean reflects landscapescale processes. Moulton et al. (2000) found that silicate weathering from a western Icelandic landscape vegetated by small trees was 5–6 times that from a landscape partially vegetated with mosses and lichens. The choice of a moss by Lenton et al. (2012), although understandable as a complete genomic sequence is known in Physcomitella patens, is unfortunate as compared with other postulated members of CCs as contact with substrate is low in the field compared, say, with thalloid liverworts. Baars et al. (2008) used the latter (Conocephalum conicum) in less well controlled (as regards temperature and light regimes) microcosm experiments in which trays containing algae/ Bacteria, bryophytes, Psilotum (a non-rooted tracheophyte) and Equisetum (a rooted tracheophyte) were grown on trays in cabinets approaching ambient (360 ppm) and c. 10 PAL (3500 ppm), and the leachate containing inorganic carbon species and organic acids (negligible amounts) was collected and analysed. Elevated carbon dioxide concentrations were recorded in leachates only in the elevated CO2 cabinets and in the leachate from Equisetum, and this was the only solution to produce very minor erosion on basalt tiles. The trays in the bryophyte cabinets were dominated by the liverwort, which thrived under the elevated CO2. Organic matter had been kept to a minimum in trays to keep down soil respiration. Such data provide support for Berner’s contention that rooted tracheophytes were most important for CO2 drawdown, a conclusion substantiated by Quirk et al. (in press) in experiments based on the thalloid, basal liverwort Marchantia paleacea, which may be colonized by the glomeromycotean arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus. They grew the liverwort with and without the symbiont for 12 months at three CO2 levels (200, 450 and 1200 ppm) on a free-draining substrate comprising quartz and Sphagnum peat under which were situated mesh bags containing chips of basalt of uniform size. Interspersed in the basalt were slides bearing flakes of biotite and phlogopite. Trenches developed on the latter below fungal hyphae and liverwort rhizoids provided information on extent and depth of interaction with substrate while the analysis of the mineral content of the solution and liverwort tissues compared with the plantfree controls indicated the amounts of Ca, Mg and P liberated from the basalt.\nResults showed that liverworts with and without symbionts increased Ca release three- to fivefold compared with controls, the greatest effect being at ambient CO2,\nwhile P weathering was amplified 11-fold under liverworts with symbionts compared with sevenfold in fungus-free liverworts, the effects being greater at ambient and high CO2. These figures are substantially lower than those obtained by Lenton et al. (2012). Similar experiments involving saplings of trees hosting a variety of types of mycorrhiza showed that, although at the hyphal/rhizoid level, the penetration of substrate surfaces was similar to that recorded for root hairs of the trees, the depth of substrate exploited was substantially greater in the latter, leading to the conclusion that amplification of weathering under liverworts would have been about 5% relative to forests today.\nWe have no evidence for liverworts similar to extant forms, let alone evidence of symbionts, in the Ordovician and Silurian. Arbuscular mycorrhizas were present in at least two taxa in the Lower Devonian Rhynie Chert (Taylor et al. 2015), although extent of hyphal interaction with the substrate is unknown. It does seem likely that there were thalloid basal bryophytes in the CCs that would have produced effects on weathering at least comparable to those produced by liverworts lacking symbionts in the above experiments, but in the absence of rooted tracheophytes we agree with Quirk et al. (2012) that it would be too little to cause the drawdown of CO2 resulting in Ordovician–Silurian glaciations."

    "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "The limited direct evidence outlined above plus inferences from extant vegetation provides data to support the existence and biological consequences of a land surface in the in the mid-Ordovician to the end of Silurian dominated by CCs, but their impacts on lithosphere and atmosphere remain conjectural. Considering the distribution of terrestrial vegetation today, it seems likely that areas occupied by all categories of vegetation (e.g. Matthews 1984) would be suitable habitats for the various elements in CCs in the mid-Palaeozoic, the major exception in terms of habitat being epiphytic substrates. Calculations of current vegetated areas based on satellite data (e.g. ESA, GLOBCOVER; USGS, GLCC) indicate c. 80% coverage, and c. 87% in an ice-free world. Directly comparable estimates for the mid-Palaeozoic are highly speculative because the interval was one of great geological upheavals with limited data on climate controls such as continental sizes and configuration, latitudinal position (temperature, precipitation, seasonality), ocean circulation and topography, with additional inputs from orbital forcing of climate. These geological and astronomical inputs to environmental conditions would have evolved throughout the time, as would the composition of vegetation itself. However, it seems reasonable to assume, based on the ecological\ntolerances of elements of the CCs today in a wide range of habitats hostile to tracheophytes, that they were widespread in these and more equable habitats dominated by modern vascular plants. Their composition, reflecting ecological responses to substrate, temperature and water availability, is impossible to quantify. An interesting approach was adopted by Strother (2010), who estimated the proportions of axial and thalloid fossils on bedding planes. Using seven slabs collected by Lang (1937), he estimated 50% of the surface was occupied by incrustation and 1% by axial fossils. These fossils were allochthonous and preserved in fluvial rocks with all the limitations of sorting during transport, but may approximate to the extent of contact between organism and substrate in habitats in the catchment area. Tomescu and Rothwell (2006) reported that some of these incrustations (no embryophytic axial fossils were present) were autochthonous and almost covered overbank, floodplain deposits. Such analyses also draw attention to the fact that our megafossil evidence during this time interval derives from marginal depositional settings, be they shallow marine, coastal plain or proximal fluvial facies. Thus, the vegetation that was fossilized would have been growing on substrates dominated by sands and muds, which would have been impoverished in mineral nutrients as a result of hinterland weathering. Thus, drawdown of CO2 via rock weathering would have been lower than that on fresh magma. Such substrates have so far been overlooked in empirical activities. As to the magma itself, the extent of volcanism on land and the relative proportions of lava and ash as well as the contribution of weathering of ancient cratons remain imponderables.\nSuch uncertainties and gaps in knowledge make it impossible to answer our initial question as to whether photosynthesizing land vegetation bioengineered the planet in mid-Palaeozoic times, although our conclusions on interactions of extant CCs with abiotic factors indicate minimal effects on a global scale. However, there is a developing scenario of evolutionary changes in the composition of CCs and the emergence of tracheophytes of ever-increasing complexity and stature such that by the end of the Silurian homoiohydric, photosynthesizing tracheophytes with underground rooting structures had become established, heralding the beginnings of a vegetation with far more profound impacts on the nature of terrestrial ecosystems particularly relating to atmospheric changes.\nAcknowledgements.

  "abstractText": "The Ordovician and Silurian periods were times of major geological activity as regards palaeogeography, volcanism and climate change, the last of these evidenced by a series of cooling episodes and glaciations that climaxed in the Hirnantian (Late Ordovician). The presence of cryptospores in the Darriwilian (Middle Ordovician) marked the advent of higher plants on land. A critical survey of direct (megaand microfossils) and some indirect evidence in succeeding rocks indicates the presence of algae, Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, Fungi, probable lichens, cryptophytes and basal tracheophytes. Similar associations of photosynthesizers and decomposers occur today in cryptogamic covers (CCs), for example biological crusts, except that bryophytes replace cryptophytes (basal embryophytes) and tracheophytes are absent. Thus, extant CCs, which make significant contributions today to global carbon and nitrogen fixation and prevention of erosion, provide an excellent analogue for the impacts of early land vegetation on both lithosphere and atmosphere. As a prerequisite to assessing impacts in Ordovician–Silurian times, with particular consideration of parameters used by climate modellers, the effects of a number of abiotic factors on the growth and survival of extant cryptogamic ground covers and their environmental impacts are reviewed. Factors include photosynthetically active radiation, ultraviolet radiation, temperature, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, surface roughness and albedo. A survey of the nature and extent of weathering facilitated by such vegetation concludes that it was limited based on depth of weathering when compared with that from rooted tracheophytes today, with minor effects on carbon dioxide drawdown. As global net productivity from Ordovician–Silurian CCs was very probably lower than today, and while the small fraction of intractable material in their organic carbon would have resulted in a more rapid turnover of terrestrial biomass, we conclude that there was decreased possibility of long-term organic carbon burial. Hence, there would have been very limited increase in atmospheric oxygen and decrease in carbon dioxide resulting from carbon burial.",
