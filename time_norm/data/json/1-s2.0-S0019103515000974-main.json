This promotes the transport of water ice from relatively warmer lowlying areas to the highlands, where deposition and accumulation of water ice result in an ‘‘icy highlands’’ Late Noachian Mars. Deposits will remain stable in the highlands under nominal Late Noachian conditions, but the potential exists for punctuated heating by both top-down (e.g. impacts, volcanism) and bottom-up (e.g. elevated geothermal heat flux) processes. Important in understanding melt generation from these processes is the state of the accumulated snow and ice. Through modeling of the firn densification process in the ‘‘icy highlands’’ framework we assess: (1) the nature of snow accumulation and the physical growth and evolution of the predicted ice deposits, and (2) the implications for the thermal properties of the ice sheets and the response to heating events. Analysis of the firn densification process in the ‘‘icy highlands’’ context indicates that: (1) the upper layers of the ice sheet will be more vulnerable to melting from top-down heating processes because they are comprised of the least dense and least thermally conductive ice, and (2) even with a low thermal conductivity firn layer, basal melting is only likely to occur through a combination of top-down and bottom-up heating. This is because at the nominal mean annual surface temperatures and estimated effective thermal conductivities, the predicted ice sheet thicknesses do not produce enough basal warming to initiate melting for plausible geothermal heat fluxes. Variations in spin-axis/orbital parameters alone are not predicted to cause widespread ablation (melting and sublimation) of the icy highlands ice sheets.\n2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "Global Climate Model (GCM) simulations of an early CO2 martian atmosphere and Late Noachian (LN) climate predict that for atmospheric pressures beyond a fraction of a bar, atmosphere-surface thermal coupling occurs (Forget et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2013). As a result the martian surface transitions from one at radiative equilibrium to one dominated by an adiabatic lapse rate where mean annual surface temperatures primarily reflect changes in elevation instead of latitude. Following the adiabatic lapse rate, mean annual temperatures in high areas across Mars fall considerably below the global average. The reduction in mean annual temperatures promotes the transportation and deposition of water–ice in the highlands where ice deposits will remain stable because of the persistently cold\nconditions. These conditions lead to a ‘‘cold and icy’’ LN Mars climate characterized by an ‘‘icy highlands’’ scenario (Wordsworth et al., 2013) (Fig. 1).\nDeposition of water–ice throughout the highlands at predicted net accumulation rates (Madeleine et al., 2009; Forget et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2013; Fastook and Head, 2014a) will exceed the currently observed polar/near-surface water inventory on Mars (Carr and Head, 2015) over a time scale on the order of 30 Ka. Here we assume that the supply of water–ice is constrained by the near-surface water–ice reservoir (Carr and Head, 2015) and that the deposition of snow across the highlands is therefore a supply-limited process (Fastook and Head, 2014a; Head et al., 2014); we adopt a surface reservoir 5X the amount of water–ice currently available in the polar/near-surface reservoirs (equal to 150 m GEL). We adopt this value in light of recent estimates of the water inventory of Noachian Mars as a conservative estimate of the amount of water that may have been available for surface processes (e.g. glaciation and ice sheet formation) (Carr and Head, 2015). This assumption is highly uncertain and\ndepends upon several factors including estimates of the volumes of the near-surface/polar water ice reservoirs (Carr and Head, 2015) and the amounts of water that have been lost to space since the LN period (Greeley, 1987; Jakosky et al., 1994; Mellon and Jakosky, 1995; Kass and Yung, 1999; Hodges, 2002; Lammer et al., 2005; Greenwood et al., 2008). Given this uncertainty we later assess our finding on the basis of higher and lower volume estimates. Distribution of this 5X current GEL LN assumed water–ice reservoir above an equilibrium line altitude of +1 km across the highlands of Mars results in an average ice sheet thickness of approximately 700 m (Carr and Head, 2015 ; Fastook and Head, 2014a) (Fig. 1). Under the nominal Late Noachian ‘‘icy highlands’’ (LNIH) conditions, melting is not expected to occur at either the ice sheet surface or base (Wordsworth et al., 2013; Fastook and Head, 2014a). However, there is potential for anomalous heating of the ice sheets by top-down (e.g. impacts, volcanism) and bottom-up (e.g. elevated geothermal heat flux) heating processes.\nPrevious investigators have analyzed the firn densification process and its implications for Mars. Carr and Head (2003) implemented empirically derived relationships to assess the density–depth relationship of snowpack and the potential for basal melting to have produced meltwater to form the valley networks. Arthern et al. (2000) assessed firn densification under the currently prevailing climate conditions of Mars to model the densification of the north polar residual cap. Arthern et al. (2000) used this approach to assess how the past climate record might be distributed within the ice mass of the residual cap in the form of entrained gas bubbles.\nIn addition to determining the relationship between ice porosity, ice age and depth, the densification process can be used to assess the physical formation and thermal characteristics of ice sheets. In particular, the characterization of the thermal properties\nof ice sheets places important constraints on the susceptibility of the ice to punctuated heating from top-down (ideal insolation geometry, impacts, volcanism) and bottom-up (increased geothermal heat flux, excess ice accumulation) sources (Head et al., 2014). In the context of the LNIH Mars climate scenario we model the process of firn densification to assess: (1) the general nature of snow accumulation, ice sheet growth and evolution and, (2) the implications the derived density-structure has for the thermal characteristics of the ice sheets and the response to potential mechanisms of melting. Throughout this work we define snow as water–ice having a bulk density below 360 kg/m3; firn for bulk densities between 360 and 830 kg/m3; and ice for bulk densities greater than 830 kg/m3."

    "heading": "2. Firn densification modeling",
    "text": "The densification from snow to firn, and finally to ice, occurs in three distinct stages outlined conceptually in Fig. 2. Snow, deposited at some initial surface density (typically ranging from 100 to 400 kg/m3) begins densification in Regime I primarily by grain boundary sliding (Alley, 1987; Cuffey and Paterson, 2010). The pore space between the ice grains is reduced until a density of 550 kg/m3 is reached at which point densification cannot continue without ice grain deformation. Densification proceeds into Regime II where grain deformation and recrystallization by vapor diffusion become the dominant mechanisms. Once a density of 830 kg/m3 is reached, the pores within the ice mass become isolated, and the permeability (and therefore vapor diffusion) is substantially reduced. Densification continues in Regime III, to a maximum ice density of 917 kg/m3, by creep compressing the individual pore spaces in the ice mass. To quantitatively simulate\nthe firn densification process we have implemented the following relation (Cuffey and Paterson, 2010):\ndq dt ¼ f 0q exp Q RT\nqi q 1 qiðg R qðzÞdzÞ q n ð1Þ\nIn a steady-state condition Eq. (1) becomes:\ndq dz ¼ f 0q\n2\nqi 1 _b exp Q RT\nqi q 1 qiðg R qðzÞdzÞ q n ð2Þ\nwhere q = density at depth z [kg/m3], qi = density of ice [kg/m3], _b = accumulation rate [m/yr], Q = activation energy [45,600 J/mol] (Salamatin et al., 2009), R = gas constant [8.314 J/mol K], T = temperature [K], g = acceleration due to gravity [m/s2], n = 3 (ice deforms as the third power of the applied stress), f0 is a constant coefficient set equal to the value derived in Cuffey and Paterson (2010).\nThis simplified densification model was selected for several reasons: (1) The model is a physically-derived, process-based model, allowing the densification process to be modeled without the requirement of empirical data. (2) The conditions of early Mars\nare not well constrained, and as a result, the application of a more sophisticated model will not necessarily produce results of any greater accuracy. (3) Here we are interested in modeling the large-scale, long-term effects of the densification process on ice sheet evolution, and obtaining general constraints in order to assess potential melting mechanisms. Therefore, given these broad objectives, a simplified model is suitable for this study, despite the existence of more advanced Mars firn densification models (e.g. Arthern et al., 2000). However, the simplified nature of this model leads to some limitations, the most significant being the prediction of near-surface densification rates that are considerably below the observed rates (Fig. 3). This is because the model as it appears in Eqs. (1) and (2) focuses on dislocation creep, and does not account for other potentially important processes including: grain boundary sliding facilitated by sublimation (Cuffey and Paterson, 2010), grain growth (Arthern et al., 2010), and temperature annealing (Morris and Wingham, 2014).\nAs an alternative, an empirical densification model calibrated with the use of terrestrial data could be applied. However, these models are derived to fit empirical terrestrial data. Therefore, without any data to guide the application of an empirical model to the fundamentally different martian conditions, interpretation of the model results would be difficult and could introduce significant error. For these reasons, we favor the known shortcomings of the simplified physical model, over the errors that might result from the implementation of a terrestrially-derived empirical model that may not be applicable to the conditions of interest.\nHere, because of the potentially large sublimation rates predicted to occur on Mars (Madeleine et al., 2009), we attempt to offset one limitation of the simplified physical model by considering the enhancement of grain settling in the early stages of densification (Regime I) caused by sublimation. We incorporate a sublimation term: _Se 550 q 1ð Þ into Eqs. (1) and (2) to account for this effect. The value of the sublimation coefficient ( _S) was determined by calibration with empirical density–depth data from Siple Dome, Antarctica (Hawley et al., 2004). The model was parameterized to the Siple Dome conditions, and the sublimation coefficient was adjusted until a best fit was obtained (Fig. 3). To produce density–depth curves, Eq. (2) is numerically integrated from the ice sheet surface, starting from an assumed surface density of 360 kg/m3 (Arthern et al., 2000), to the ice sheet base. The sublimation term enhances the densification rate in an exponentially decreasing manner up to a density of 550 kg/m3 at which point the term is dropped from Eq. (2) for the remainder of the integration. Once calibrated, the model was parameterized to LN conditions with results from GCM simulations (Forget et al., 2013; Wordsworth et al., 2013), and used to generate density–depth curves.\nDue to the geologically rapid formation of the ‘‘icy highlands’’ ice sheets (potential accumulation of a 700-m ice sheet at 10 mm/yr in 70 kyr), the limiting water–ice supply, and the low likelihood of abundant melting and recycling back to the source as snow, it is likely that the ice sheets existed under the prevailing LNIH climate conditions for extended periods of time with little deposition. This would tend to produce ice sheets that are initially relatively free of impurities which over time would become capped by a layer of impurities (e.g. dust and ash; e.g. Wilson and Head, 2009). Throughout periods of little to no deposition the density structure of the ice sheets will continue to evolve. We have modeled the time-evolution of the density structure by applying Eq. (1) to each point in the nominal density–depth profile ( _b ¼ 0:01 m=yr; T = 225 K; _S ¼ 0:01 m=yr) generated with Eq. (2) and integrating forward 1 Myr."

    "heading": "3. Thermal conductivity",
    "text": "The density state of the ice affects the thermal conductivity of the bulk ice mass by controlling the volume fraction of pore space. Carr and Head (2003) investigated estimations for the effective\nthermal conductivity of an ice mass derived by Clow (1987) whereby the effective thermal conductivity of the ice mass depends on the combination of the thermal conductivity of ice (KT,i) and the thermal conductivity of the pores (KT,p). The conductivity of the pores is the sum of the conductivity of the gas in the pores (KT,g) and the conductivity from water vapor diffusion through the pores (KT,v) where\nKT;i ¼ 9:828eð 0:0057TÞ\nKT;g ¼ q CpD T T\nKT;v ¼ 4D V lLs RT 2 P P es T\nKT;p ¼ KT;g þ KT;v\nq⁄ = density of CO2 at STP [kg/m3], Cp = specific heat of CO2 [J/kg K], D⁄ = diffusivity constant of CO2 [m2/s], T⁄ = standard temperature [K], D V = molecular diffusivity of water through CO2 [m\n2/s], l = molecular weight of water [kg/mol], Ls = latent heat of sublimation of water [J/kg], P⁄ = standard pressure [Pa], P = pressure [Pa], es = saturation vapor pressure of water over ice [Pa].\nAccording to the Brailsford and Major (1964), model the effective thermal conductivity then depends on the combination of these conductivities as a function of the pore volume fraction (u) given by:\nKT;e ¼ KT;i 4 ð3u 1Þ KT;p\nKT;i\nþ 2 3u\nþ 3u 1Þ KT;p KT;i þ 2 3u 2 þ 8KT;p KT;i ( )0:535 ð3Þ Carr and Head (2003) concluded that under martian conditions the method developed by Clow (1987) is likely to represent an upper bound for the thermal conductivities and that the power-law relation: log (KT,e) = 0.4 + 2.9log(q) was likely to be more representative at martian temperatures ( 200–250 K). Here, we implement both of these estimations to serve as upper and lower bounds for the effective thermal conductivity and assess the variability as a function of density through changes in time and climate parameters."

    "heading": "4. Ice sheet basal temperature",
    "text": "The harmonic mean of the effective thermal conductivity versus depth, in conjunction with the mean annual surface temperature, ice sheet thickness, and geothermal heat flux, directly controls the temperature at the base of the ice sheet. In order for basal melting to occur, the combination of these parameters must act to raise the basal temperature of the ice sheet to the pressure melting point. To determine if basal melting can occur for the simulated ice sheets under LNIH conditions we estimate basal temperatures with the following steady-state relation (Robin, 1955): TB Ts ¼ z p\np 2 dT dz\nB\nerfðz=z Þ erfðH=z Þ½ ð4Þ\nwhere\nz2 ¼ 2aT H= _bi aT ¼ kT=qc c ¼ 152:5þ 7:122T\ndT dz B ¼ G kT\nG = geothermal heat flux [W/m2], z⁄ = characteristic thermal diffusion length [m], H = total ice sheet thickness [m], c = specific heat capacity [J/kg K], aT = thermal diffusivity [m2/yr], kT = Harmonic mean effective thermal conductivity [W/m K].\nThis model is derived with the simplifying assumptions that heat transport by both horizontal conduction and advection can be neglected. Disregarding the horizontal conduction of heat is reasonable because the horizontal temperature gradient in an ice sheet is insignificant compared to the vertical gradient. Conversely, neglecting heat transport through the horizontal advection of ice is generally only applicable at ice sheet divides where there is little to no ice flow. However, on Mars it has been shown that ice flow proceeds very slowly even under favorable conditions (Fastook and Head, 2014b), allowing for the general application of this model."

    "heading": "5. Results",
    "text": "The dependence of the ice sheet density structure on the climate parameters was assessed by varying each parameter independently for the nominal LN density–depth profile (Fig. 4). For a given ice sheet thickness, a higher accumulation rate results in a lower average density because the thickness is obtained more rapidly despite the higher overburden pressure (Fig. 4a). However, the average density of the ice sheet will then increase with time after deposition, trending towards higher average densities that would be obtained for the same ice sheet thickness accumulated at a lower accumulation rate over a longer period of time. The effect of temperature on the density structure is dominant, and in all cases increased temperatures causes increased average density (Fig. 4b). Increases in the sublimation rate alone also enhance densification in all cases but only within the upper portions of the\nice mass (Fig. 4c). The effective thermal conductivity of the ice mass is directly dependent upon the density state of the ice and is therefore affected similarly by the varying climate parameters (Figs. 5 and 6). However, the upper bound case for the effective thermal conductivity shows a more complex dependency on temperature: at lower temperatures the thermal conductivity increases in response to increasing temperature, but at the higher temperatures this trend reverses such that increasing temperature causes the thermal conductivity to decrease (Fig. 6b). This is because increasing the temperature decreases the thermal conductivity and enhances the ice density (which then increases the thermal conductivity). As the temperature nears 260 K, the reduction in thermal conductivity of ice associated with higher temperatures begins to dominate over the effect of increased conductivity due to increased density and so the average conductivity of the ice sheet decreases.\nAfter the supply limit has been reached and snow deposition ceases, the ice sheets will continue to densify over time. Under the prevailing ‘‘icy highlands’’ conditions the firn-to-ice contact transitions from an initial depth of 110 m, to a depth of 20 m after 1 Myr, representing a considerable increase in the average density of the deposit as the proportion of the ice sheet comprised of solid ice increases from 0.85 to 0.97 (Fig. 7a; Table 1). The increase in density over time corresponds to an associated increase in the thermal conductivity of the ice-mass as the pore space is reduced (Fig. 7b and c; Table 1). Without continual mass input, the time-evolution of the density structure will also reduce the overall thickness of the deposit by 5% after 0.1 Myr, and by 7% after 1 Myr, which will result in a reduction of the insulating capacity of the ice sheets. The reduction in ice sheet thickness (and therefore the insulating capacity) associated with the compaction of the firn layer will decrease for ice sheets of greater thickness. This is because ice sheets of greater thickness will be deposited with an initially higher proportion of ice, and so relatively less compaction can occur.\n0:01 m=yr; T = 225 K; _S ¼ 0:01 m=yr) (Wordsworth et al., 2013) to variations in: (a) blimation rate ð _S ½m=yr Þ.

In this scenario we find that the lower ice sheet thickness, lower temperature, and higher accumulation rate all contribute to an\nice sheet with substantially lower average densities and effective thermal conductivities (Fig. 8; Table 1)."

    "heading": "6. Response to heating",
    "text": "The density structure of the ice deposits has two important implications for the response of the deposits to both top-down and bottom-up transient heating events (Fig. 9): (1) the amount of energy required to melt a unit volume of firn or ice is directly proportional to the ratio of the density to the density of ice (Q 334 J/cm3 ⁄ q/qi) and (2) the effective thermal conductivity of the ice mass is directly dependent upon the ratio between the volume of pore space and the volume occupied by ice (as described in Section 4)."
  }, {
    "heading": "6.1. Top-down heating",
    "text": "With respect to melting in response to top-down heating these dependencies again have two important implications (Fig. 9b):\n(1) The ice sheets will generally be more susceptible to top-down melting. This is because: (1) the least dense layers, which require the least energy to initiate and sustain melting, will always be at the surface of the ice sheet, and (2) because the supply-limited icy highlands ice sheets are not thick enough to cause basal melting without a raise in the nominal mean annual surface temperature (Table 2). (2) As the ice sheets become older, the average density, and therefore the effective thermal conductivities, will increase as the firn-to-ice transition trends towards the surface. This reduces the amount of overlying firn and snow, increasing the amount of energy required to melt a unit volume and enhancing the ability of the ice sheet to disperse incoming surface heat to the layers below. In order for short-term top-down heating to melt the uppermost meter of the ice sheet, a punctuated heating event would need to raise the surface temperature to 273 K for a total of approximately 20 days. Complete melting of one square kilometer of the surface of an ice sheet with a nominal surface density of 360 kg/m3 to a depth of one meter will result in the generation of 360,000 m3 of melt water. However, as top-down melting\nproceeds the introduction of meltwater will complicate continued melting. If the top-down heating is sufficient to cause melting it will enhance the densification rate within the firn layers and cause a more rapid transition to ice, thereby reducing the potential for further melting. Conversely, as top-down melting proceeds, the albedo of the ice sheet surface will decrease in response to the densification of the surface snow and firn, thereby enhancing melting. Therefore, sustained top-down melting will depend upon the balance of these two effects (Fig. 9b).\nAny meltwater generated at the ice surface will begin to migrate down into the ice sheet by two major pathways: (1) fractures, crevasses, and moulins, and (2) percolation through the permeable snow and firn layers (Fig. 9b). Meltwater that migrates downward through fractures, crevasses and moulins will refreeze if the ice sheet remains cold-based through the punctuated topdown heating event. Refreezing will occur at a depth where the temperatures are below freezing and where the permeability is sufficiently low to reduce the flow velocity of the meltwater. Once the meltwater refreezes it will release latent heat energy and warm the surrounding ice, enhancing local densification of surrounding layers that have not already reached the maximal ice density ( 917 kg/m3). Refreezing and expansion of meltwater at depth within the ice sheet may also lead to the formation (or extension) of cracks within the ice sheet. If, however, the ice sheet is warm-based then the meltwater may drain through fractures, crevasses and moulins and coalesce in englacial tunnels that will drain towards the glacial margins following local and regional pressure gradients beneath the ice sheet.\nMeltwater that percolates through the snow and firn layers will propagate downwards until it refreezes or encounters an impermeable layer of firn or ice. If the infiltrating meltwater\nrefreezes, it will deposit latent heat into the surrounding firn, enhancing the densification and creating ice layers (Fig. 9b). If the meltwater does not refreeze, it can enter storage in the porous firn layers, akin to terrestrial groundwater aquifers. Acting as an aquifer, the snow and firn layer can store significant quantities of meltwater and may also delay refreezing by protecting and insulating the meltwater from variable surface conditions (Forster et al., 2014). Given the low gravitational acceleration of Mars and the nominally low temperatures with little to no thermal cycling across the freezing point, it is probable that a snow and firn layer would exist across most of the ‘‘icy highlands’’ ice sheets. If meltwater is introduced to the firn layer and temperatures are maintained above freezing, the firn layer will gradually become saturated and the water table will rise towards the surface of the ice sheet. In areas of gentle surface slopes the water table can intersect the ice sheet surface and lead to the formation of meltwater ponds, particularly in areas of thin firn cover (Fig. 9b). Once formed, the melt ponds will enhance local melting through more efficient absorption of incident solar energy due to the decreased albedo and decreased thermal conductivity of liquid water (KT 0.56 W/m K at 273 K). The melt ponds can then either refreeze, drain downwards into the ice, or drain towards the ice sheet margins by steady discharge or episodic flooding (Carr and Head, 2015). In areas where the ice sheet surface slope is steeper, melt produced in excess of the saturation limit of the firn layer will produce channels and supraglacial drainage networks (Fig. 9b).\nLarge variations in spin-axis/orbital parameters typical of Mars cause the global distribution of solar insolation to change over time (Laskar et al., 2004). Under the current conditions on Mars, where the surface is at radiative equilibrium, changes in solar insolation\ncan have a large effect on mean annual surface temperatures and lead to the latitudinal migration of zones where ice is stable (Head et al., 2003; Forget et al., 2006; Madeleine et al., 2009). Migration of ice stability zones in response to changes in the spin-axis/orbital parameters leads to widespread ablation (melting and sublimation), and redistribution of ice deposits across Mars (Head et al., 2003; Head and Marchant, 2003; Forget et al., 2006; Madeleine et al., 2009). Preliminary modeling of the LN climate indicates that the thicker CO2 atmosphere and the adiabatic cooling effect act to maintain low temperatures throughout the highlands of Mars across a range of obliquities (Wordsworth et al., 2013). This preserves the stability of ice in the highland regions through temporal variations of the spin-axis/orbital parameters. Therefore, in the LNIH scenario the effect of variations in the spin-axis/orbital parameters on ice stability will be dampened by the thicker atmosphere and should not result in significant melting scenarios or ablation of the regional ice sheets in the highland areas."

    "heading": "6.2. Bottom-up heating",
    "text": "The density structure of the ice sheet will also affect melting in response to bottom-up heating in two important ways (Fig. 9c): (1) Older ice sheets will have higher average densities (more latent heat of fusion per unit volume) and thermal conductivities (enhanced heat dissipation to overlying ice layers) and will therefore require more energy input to the bottom layers of ice to cause melting. (2) Since basal temperatures depend on the harmonic mean effective thermal conductivity of the ice sheet, the presence of a low density, low thermal conductivity firn layer will cause a considerable decrease in the mean effective thermal conductivity of the ice sheet (Table 1). Therefore, younger ice sheets will have a much lower mean thermal conductivity due to the presence of a thicker and less conductive firn layer, resulting in enhanced insulation and higher basal temperatures. Conversely, since thermal conductivity will increase with the average density, older and denser ice sheets (with thinner firn layers) will provide less insulation than younger, less dense ice sheets. Consequently, if the geothermal heat flux and mean annual surface temperature remain constant, the temperatures at the base of the ice sheet will decrease as the ice sheets become older and the average density increases. Thus, for basal melting to occur in older, denser ice deposits, higher mean annual surface temperatures and/or a higher geothermal heat flux are required. Alternatively, if a punctuated top-down heating event were to take place, an older, denser, and more conductive ice sheet would be able to transmit the increased surface temperatures to the base of the ice sheet substantially faster (Fig. 9c). For example, if the mean annual surface temperature were increased to 241–255 K above the 700 m ice sheet just after deposition (surface temperatures required to initiate basal melting at the nominal LN geothermal heat flux of 55 mW/m2 (Solomon et al., 2005; Clifford et al., 2010) and accumulation rate of 10 mm/yr, for the lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively) then temperatures at the base would reach the melting point after 30,000–45,000 yr (upper and lower bound thermal conductivity models, respectively). If the temperatures increased to the requisite levels after 1 Myr of density evolution ( 250–257 K above the 700 m ice sheet, for the upper and lower bound thermal conductivity models, respectively), then temperatures at the base would reach the melting point within 25,000–35,000 years (upper and lower bound thermal conductivity models, respectively). With no additional top-down heating, basal melting at the nominal LN mean annual surface temperature of 225 K would require a geothermal heat flux of between 85–150 mW/m2 for the 700 m ice sheet after deposition (for the lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively) and 120–170 mW/m2 for the ice sheet after 1 Myr of density evolution (for the lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively). All of these geothermal heat fluxes are approximately double, or more, than the predicted background values of 45–65 mW/m2 (Solomon et al., 2005; Clifford et al., 2010; Fastook et al., 2012). The highly elevated geothermal heat fluxes required to cause basal melting of a 700 m ice sheet under nominal LN conditions suggest that melting in the ‘‘icy highlands’’ scenario will most readily be achieved by top-down heating events, or by bottom-up heating in conjunction with some degree of top-down heating.\nWhile basal melting of the LNIH ice sheets under nominal conditions is not predicted to occur, it is important to note the possible contribution of ground-ice. Under the cold climate conditions predicted by the LNIH model, the porous upper 2 km of the martian crust will remain at temperatures below the freezing point of water perennially (given a surface temperature of 225 K and geothermal heat flux of 55 mW/m2; Clifford et al., 2010;\nCassanelli et al., 2015). This zone of continuously frozen crust is referred to as the cryosphere. Under these same conditions, emplacement of the LNIH ice sheets will provide a thick insulating surface layer, resulting in the reduction of the subsurface cryosphere thickness (to 0.7–1.5 km, range corresponding to the low end mean thermal conductivity estimate just after deposition, and the high end thermal conductivity estimate after 1 Myr). If the pore space of the martian crust within the cryosphere contained water–ice prior to LNIH ice sheet deposition (e.g. Clifford, 1991), then reduction of the cryosphere thickness could result in widespread bottom-up melting of cryospheric ice, liberating a significant amount of meltwater to any groundwater system that might exist at greater depth (Clifford, 1993; Clifford et al., 2010; Cassanelli et al., 2015)."

    "heading": "7. Effect of impurities",
    "text": "During the LN period elevated volcanic fluxes and impact rates could have led to an increased atmospheric load of dust and ash (Tanaka, 2000; Solomon et al., 2005; Wilson and Head, 2009). The dust and ash in the atmosphere could then have become incorporated into the ‘‘icy highlands’’ regional ice sheets during formation as impurities. The inclusion of impurities within the accumulating ice mass affects both the physical and thermal properties of the ice sheet. In terms of the physical evolution of the ice sheet, the incorporation of impurities will increase the bulk density of the upper firn layers, thereby increasing the overburden pressure and enhancing densification (dust q 1500 kg/m3 (Zent et al., 2010); ash q 2000 kg/m3 (Wilson and Head, 2009)). If the accumulation rate of impurities exceeds that of snow, then layers of impurities will form at the ice sheet surface, also causing increased overburden pressure and enhanced densification. Incorporation of 10% impurities by volume into the ice sheet, dispersed throughout the ice mass or concentrated into layers, will raise the average density of the ice sheet from 850 kg/m3 after deposition (Table 1) to 930/980 kg/m3 (dust/ash) and from 910 kg/m3 after 1 Myr (Table 1) to 970/1020 kg/m3 (dust/ash).\nThe effects of impurities on the thermal properties on the ice sheet are more complex and depend upon the balance between the snow and impurity accumulation rates. If the accumulation rate of impurities is less than that of the snow then the impurities will become suspended within the matrix of snow and firn. This will reduce the surface albedo and enhance the potential for melting from top-down heating processes by causing the ice sheet surface to more effectively absorb incident solar radiation. The incorporation of impurities within the ice mass will also have an effect on the basal conditions of the ice sheet by altering the effective thermal conductivity of the ice sheet. However, the net effect of the impurities suspended within the ice mass is unclear. The impurities may enhance grain–grain contact and reduce void spaces, thereby increasing the conductivity, but may also reduce the bulk thermal conductivity by reducing the mean thermal conductivity of the ice sheet.\nAlternatively, if the impurities are concentrated into layers by periods of high accumulation rates (e.g. tephra deposition following a volcanic eruption) or by the formation of lag deposits from ablation at the ice sheet surface, then initially the superposed layer of impurities will act to reduce the albedo of the ice sheet surface, causing the underlying ice to absorb more heat. However, after a sufficient thickness of impurities has accumulated ( 2 m) the effect will be to protect the underlying ice from ablation (Wilson and Head, 2009). Any top-down melting that occurs during impurity accumulation may erode away the impurities, concentrating them into lows, and prolong the accumulation of a\nsufficient thickness to protect the ice from ablation. Once the accumulation rate of impurities subsides to nominal levels, the layer of impurities will become buried if the ice sheet undergoes continued growth. The effect of impurities concentrated in layers on the ice sheet thermal properties will be to reduce the harmonic mean effective thermal conductivity of the ice sheet. This will increase the insulating effect of the ice sheet and result in increased basal temperatures in proportion to the volume fraction (and thermal conductivity) of the impurities (dust KT 0.1 W/m K (Zent et al., 2010); ash KT 1 W/m K (Wilson and Head, 2009)). Incorporation of 10% impurities by volume concentrated in layers will reduce the mean effective thermal conductivity of the ice sheet from 1.2 to 2.1 W/m K after deposition (lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively; Table 1) to 0.6–0.7 W/m K for dust (lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively) and to 1.2–1.9 W/m K for ash (lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively). After 1 Myr of ice sheet evolution the mean effective thermal conductivity of the ice sheet will be reduced from 1.7 to 2.5 W/m K (lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively; Table 1) to 0.7–0.8 W/m K for dust (lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively) and to 1.6– 2.2 W/m K for ash (lower and upper bound thermal conductivity models, respectively). If basal melting is initiated as a result of the reduced thermal conductivities then the impurities that are suspended within the ice will be deposited at the base of the ice sheet. These impurities may then either be transported to the ice sheet margins by subglacial drainage, or may simply raise the elevation of the ice sheet base by adding to the underlying topography. In reality, it is unlikely that the accumulation rate of snow or impurities is consistent, and so both of these effects are likely to occur throughout the course of ice sheet formation and evolution.\nIn addition to ash and dust, potent freezing point depressing salts (such as perchlorates, sodium chloride, calcium chloride; e.g. Clifford et al., 2010), could have also been incorporated into the ice sheet. The presence of freezing point depressing salts would have enhanced the susceptibility of the ice sheets to melting in proportion to the type, and concentration, of the salts within the ice. This would have had at least two important effects on ice sheet formation and evolution: (1) If the freezing point depression was strong enough to allow for at least transient melting at the ice sheet surface, the densification process would have been significantly enhanced. This is because after the snow and firn at the ice sheet surface melts, it will refreeze as pure ice, bypassing the typical densification processes (Fig. 2). As the melt refreezes, it will release latent heat into any surrounding, or underlying, firn and ice, further enhancing local densification rates. (2) Sufficient reduction of the freezing point (to 237–257 K at the nominal 700 m thickness and 55 mW/m2 geothermal heat flux for the range of mean thermal conductivity estimates; Table 2) could also have allowed for basal melting of the LNIH ice sheets. This would be offset to some extent by the increased mean thermal conductivity of the ice sheet due to the enhanced densification of the snow and firn layer. However, if the net effect allowed for basal melting, then wet-based glaciation could have been initiated, favoring thinner and faster moving ice sheets. However, any melting produced by the freezing point depression effect of salts would be buffered by dissolution. As salts are diluted from the melt, the concentration will drop and the freezing point will return towards that of pure ice, leading to a cessation of melting. Therefore, the amount of melting that can take place in this manner is limited by the salt concentrations, which would likely be highly variable. Given that there is little evidence to suggest widespread wet-based glaciation in Noachian-aged terrains (e.g. Fastook et al., 2012), these conditions are not predicted to have been common."

    "heading": "8. Effect of anomalous conditions",
    "text": "Assessment of possible melting mechanisms indicates that LNIH ice sheet melting will not occur under the mean predicted conditions (ice sheet thickness, surface temperature, geothermal heat flux). However, local variations in these conditions are certain, and may have varied significantly from the predicted averages (Wordsworth et al., 2013). Asymmetrical accumulation of ice, or concentration of ice in local depressions due to glacial flow, could have resulted in ice sheets with thicknesses far greater than the regional mean (e.g. Fastook and Head, 2014a). At greater ice sheet thicknesses, the increased insulation would result in higher basal temperatures, possibly initiating localized wet-based glaciation. Under the nominal LNIH conditions examined here, this would require a local ice sheet thickness of 1–2.2 km (range corresponding to the low end mean thermal conductivity estimate just after deposition, and the high end thermal conductivity estimate after 1 Myr). However, analysis by Fastook and Head (2014a) indicates that only a small percentage of the LNIH regional ice sheets basal area (in the deepest impact craters) would reach the melting point for reasonable values of the LN surface water inventory.\nIn addition, the geothermal heat flux would have been regionally variable, owing to variations in crustal age, thickness, and concentration of heat producing elements (Cassanelli et al., 2015). These background variations in the local and regional geothermal heat flux would have been further pronounced by widespread LN volcanic and magmatic activity (Phillips et al., 2001; Head et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2014), creating the potential for anomalous heating conditions at the base of the LNIH ice sheets. Cassanelli et al. (2015) have examined this in more detail and found that LNIH ice sheet basal melting is likely to occur as a result of enhanced geothermal heating at local scales near active volcanic features where highly elevated geothermal heat flux values can be sustained. However, basal melting induced by this mechanism was only predicted to occur over a limited area, therefore providing little meltwater.\nLastly, while the predicted LN mean annual surface temperature (225 K; Wordsworth et al., 2013) is far below the melting point, it is possible for top-down melting to have occurred in response to peak daily or seasonal temperatures above the melting point. Assessment by Wordsworth et al. (2013) has shown that melting of the LNIH ice sheets induced by peak temperatures is very limited and is only likely to have occurred in small regions near ice sheet margins.\nTherefore, while local variations could have produced the conditions required for the operation of melting mechanisms not predicted to occur in the average case, the total area over which these conditions were satisfied, and the amount of meltwater generated, is predicted to be limited."

    "heading": "9. Effect of assumed water inventory",
    "text": "Throughout this assessment we have assumed a LN water–ice inventory 5X the currently observed polar/near-surface reservoir. When distributed throughout the ‘‘icy highlands’’ above an ice stability line of +1 km, this reservoir results in average icy highlands regional ice sheet thickness of 700 m (Fastook and Head, 2014a). However, the water–ice inventory estimate is very uncertain and depends upon poorly constrained assumptions of the amount of water lost from Mars since the LN (Carr and Head, 2015). Depending on the actual value of this quantity our assumed water–ice inventory may be a considerable over-estimate or under-estimate of the actual Late-Noachian water–ice surface reservoir.\nIf the LN surface water–ice reservoir is less than our assumed inventory then the average icy highlands ice sheet thickness can decrease considerably (down to 300 m for a surface water–ice reservoir 1X the currently observed polar/near-surface water–ice inventory; Fastook and Head, 2014a). Reduction of ice sheet thickness will have several impacts on the physical and thermal properties of the icy highlands ice sheets: (1) The ice sheets will be deposited with an initially lower average density due to the reduced overburden pressure. (2) The lower average density will result in lower effective thermal conductivities. (3) The lower mean thermal conductivities will favor increased basal temperatures, but the effect of reduced thickness will dominate, resulting in a net decrease in basal temperatures. Over time the average density and thermal conductivities of the thinner ice sheets will increase, further decreasing the basal temperatures. (4) The reduced thickness will allow heat from top-down heating processes to penetrate to the ice sheet base substantially faster despite the lower thermal conductivities.\nConversely, if the LN surface water–ice reservoir is larger than our assumption then the average thickness of the ice highlands ice sheets could exceed 700 m ( 1000–1500 m for 10–20X the currently observed polar/near-surface water–ice inventory; Fastook and Head, 2014a). An increase in the average thickness of the icy highlands ice sheet will also impact the physical and thermal properties of the ice sheets in several ways: (1) The average density and thermal conductivity of the ice sheets will increase. However, the increase in average density and thermal conductivity will be dampened at greater ice sheet thicknesses because more of the ice sheets will be comprised of ice, relative to snow and firn. The greater ratios of ice-to-firn associated with the thicker ice sheets will simply trend the average density and conductivity of the ice sheet towards that of pure ice. (2) The increased thickness of the ice sheets will provide more insulation despite the slight increase in the mean thermal conductivity and so basal temperatures of the ice sheet will increase. (3) The increased thickness will make top-down induced basal melting less likely by increasing the time required for heat to propagate from the ice sheet surface to the base."

(2) The lower temperatures, and lack of thermal cycling across the melting point, act to preserve the upper firn layer and increase the length of time required for the ice-to-firn transition to move towards the surface.

(b) Variations in spin-axis/orbital parameters are not predicted to cause widespread ablation (melting and sublimation) of the icy highlands ice sheets. (c) Younger ice sheets are more vulnerable to melting because they require less energy per volume to melt and are less thermally conductive.\n(d) Inclusion of impurities (e.g. ash, dust) can enhance or impede top-down heating depending upon the balance of the influx versus the snow accumulation rate. For example, if the influx of impurities is considerably less than the accumulation rate of the snow, then heating will be enhanced by lowering the albedo and the thermal conductivity of the ice. Conversely, if the influx of impurities far exceeds the accumulation rate of snow, then a protective layer can be formed at the ice sheet surface impeding heating by shielding the underlying ice. (e) Basal melting of a 700 m ice sheet is only likely with some degree of top-down heating because of the high geothermal heat fluxes otherwise required.\n(f) Inclusion of impurity layers (e.g. ash, dust) can enhance bottom-up heating by reducing the harmonic mean effective thermal conductivity of the ice sheet in proportion to the volume fraction of impurities and their thermal conductivity. (g) Older ice sheets provide less insulation for a given thickness and are therefore less likely to undergo basal melting. (h) Older ice sheets are more vulnerable to top-down induced basal melting because they are more thermally conductive.\n(i) Local variations and anomalous conditions could have allowed the operation of melting mechanisms not predicted to occur in the average case.

    "heading": "10.3. Typical Late Noachian icy highlands conditions",
    "text": "Under nominal LNIH conditions, we favor a ‘‘typical’’ scenario in which the regional ice sheets are rapidly deposited ( 70 kyr) to the supply-limited average thickness. This will result in the formation of regional ice sheets that are initially relatively pure. Following the initial deposition there will be little to no snow accumulation due to the supply-limited nature of the ice sheet formation, and the paucity of melting and snow recycling events. Limited additional inputs of snow and ice after deposition may come in the form of water vapor outgassed by active Tharsis or plains effusive and explosive volcanism; or by sublimation of ice deposits in the lowlands (refrozen drainage melt from a highlands heating event). In either case, the additional inputs of snow and ice will not be likely to contribute significantly to the physical or thermal properties of the regional ice sheets. Therefore, subsequent accumulation of impurities will tend to form a layer at the ice sheet surface. This will initially enhance the potential for ice sheet melting, but will act to protect the underlying ice from ablation once a sufficient thickness has accumulated ( 2 m). Continued accumulation of impurities will increase the thickness of the surface layer, and will reduce the mean thermal conductivity across the ice sheet, raising basal temperatures and enhancing the potential for basal melting."

  "abstractText": "Recent modeling of a thicker early CO2 martian atmosphere and Late Noachian climate predicts that for pressures beyond a fraction of a bar, atmosphere-surface thermal coupling occurs, resulting in adiabatic cooling of high areas across Mars. This promotes the transport of water ice from relatively warmer lowlying areas to the highlands, where deposition and accumulation of water ice result in an ‘‘icy highlands’’ Late Noachian Mars. Deposits will remain stable in the highlands under nominal Late Noachian conditions, but the potential exists for punctuated heating by both top-down (e.g. impacts, volcanism) and bottom-up (e.g. elevated geothermal heat flux) processes. Important in understanding melt generation from these processes is the state of the accumulated snow and ice. Through modeling of the firn densification process in the ‘‘icy highlands’’ framework we assess: (1) the nature of snow accumulation and the physical growth and evolution of the predicted ice deposits, and (2) the implications for the thermal properties of the ice sheets and the response to heating events. Analysis of the firn densification process in the ‘‘icy highlands’’ context indicates that: (1) the upper layers of the ice sheet will be more vulnerable to melting from top-down heating processes because they are comprised of the least dense and least thermally conductive ice, and (2) even with a low thermal conductivity firn layer, basal melting is only likely to occur through a combination of top-down and bottom-up heating. This is because at the nominal mean annual surface temperatures and estimated effective thermal conductivities, the predicted ice sheet thicknesses do not produce enough basal warming to initiate melting for plausible geothermal heat fluxes. Variations in spin-axis/orbital parameters alone are not predicted to cause widespread ablation (melting and sublimation) of the icy highlands ice sheets. 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
