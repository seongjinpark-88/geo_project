As Pinatubo erupted more than 20 million tons of climate-affecting sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, it made the dream of atmospheric general-circulation-modelers come true. This “natural experiment,” as it was called, put existing computer models to the test. Climate models had predicted a global surface cooling, lasting for several years, which was in fact more or less observed, as global temperatures diminished roughly 0.3° Celsius for the next two years. Pinatubo thus confirmed that volcanoes ejecting large quantities of sulfate into the higher atmosphere, the stratosphere, could have a significant influence on climate, and mask at least briefly an overall rise in global temperature.\nIt has become a tradition in current historical accounts of volcanism and climate change to start with a reference to Benjamin Franklin and his interpretation of the unusual haze in the European and American skies in the summer of 1783. This history is fictitious. Franklin first suggested meteorites, “great burning balls or globes which we happen to meet with in our rapid course round the sun,” and only then as another possible cause of Icelandic volcanoes. He speculated about Hekla and another unnamed volcano, perhaps todayʼs Laki. However, Hekla did not erupt in 1783, nor did Franklin discuss (or perhaps know of) another important eruption of 1783, Asama, in Japan, which may have played an important role in\n*IRIST, Université Louis Pasteur, 7, rue de lʼUniversité, 67000 Strasbourg, France; Matthias.Doerries@gersulp.u-strasbg.fr.

Corroborating this interpretation, the eruption of the southeast Asian volcano, Tambora, in 1815, by far the largest eruption of the last two hundred years, remained out of view when meteorologists observed strange weather phenomena in parts of Europe and America in the following year, the famous “year without a summer.”2\nWhat then put the topic on the table throughout the 20th century? I suggest three factors: trigger events in the form of major volcanic eruptions, which attracted scientific and public attention; the availability of long-term global data obtained by instruments including pyrheliometers, sondes, computers, and satellites, which allowed generalizations and theoretical considerations; and major scientific and public debates that assigned an important place to the theme. No one of these factors alone would have been sufficient; the new object of research emerged only from a specific but not necessarily simultaneous combination of chance events in nature, standardized measurements of global reach, and public demand. The latter comprised many aspects, beginning with the debate about the cause of the ice ages and mutating into the environmental discussion of man-made climate change, covering a spectrum of apocalyptic scenarios that pointed up the fragility of human existence on earth.\nThis paper makes some adjustments and additions to existing historical representations of the research field of volcanism and climate change (VCC).3 Aside from some peripheral remarks in books on climate change, the relevant history has been written exclusively by VCC scientists themselves. Unfortunately, VCC publications tend to present the past in the bright light of the present. For example, the AGU report of 1992 states that the eruption of Krakatau in 1883 “stimulated modern scientific interest in the volcanism-climate connection.”4 On the contrary, Krakatau engendered no research in this area; the major research reports issued a few years later did not even mention the subject. Likewise with the eruption of Tambora in 1815. The link between this eruption and the dismal weather in parts of Europe and the United States in 1816 was made only in the 20th century. Other\n1.

I use this abbreviation for convenience. The term “climate change” was hardly used until the late 1950s when it appeared frequently in connection with the Geophysical Year of 1957. Its use increased exponentially from the 1970s, then mostly associated with anthropogenic modification of climate. 4.

Furthermore, he concentrated mostly on key developments from the 1970s on, when research rose exponentially and attracted many people from various disciplines. Going beyond Robock, I will pay closer attention to the early period of research, which was frankly speculative as it lacked data, and describe how the research was, and still is, embedded in the larger scientific and political debates of the 19th and 20th centuries. I begin with literature about Krakatau as an example of anachronistic VCC writing and then identify the circumstances under which scientists became interested in linking the eruption to global climatic change at the turn of the 20th century. The second part analyzes the revival of studies on climate and volcanism during the 1950s in the context of the cold war. The third part looks at the expansion of the field from the 1960s to 1992.7"

    "text": "The absence of research on climate change after the eruption of Krakatau surprised many people who later on worked on the topic. The comprehensive and influential British report of 1888 on the eruption systematically studied global phenomena linked to it, but did not look at worldwide changes in temperature. It is therefore misleading to start the historical account of the relation between volcanism and global climate change with the year 1883.8\nKrakatauʼs eruption in 1883 in what is today Indonesia, and was then the Netherlands East Indies, was the first natural catastrophe of global magnitude almost immediately recognized as such. It began on August 26 and culminated in\n5. John Imbrie and Katherine Palmer Imbrie, Ice ages: Solving the mystery (Short Hills, 1979). 6.

Simarski (ref. 4).\na spectacularly violent explosion on August 27. Altogether some 30 gigatons of material erupted, the equivalent of 11 cubic kilometers of dense rock; of two thirds of the island, formerly 9 kilometers long and 5 kilometers wide, there remained only an undersea caldera. The explosion on August 27 caused a tsunami that moved towards the coastlines of Java and Sumatra, killing about 36,000 people along the coastlines. The Dutch issued a report in 1885 that focussed on the volcanic aspects and the local phenomena, while the British formed a Krakatoa Committee, a collaboration between the Royal Society and the Royal Meteorological Society, which published its report in 1888.9 The British researchers devoted much of their report to the global movement of the atmospheric pressure wave caused by the explosion and the so-called smoke stream in the higher atmosphere (the stratosphere). By studying all observations of blue and green suns, halos, and spectacularly colorful sunrises and sunsets, the British scientists worked out precise maps of the propagation of the smoke stream over the earth within the first year of the eruption. The stream first circled the earth along the equator within 13 to 14 days, then slowly spread towards higher latitudes, arriving in Europe and the United States a few months after the eruption.10\nNeither the participation of the Royal Meteorological Society in the work nor the existence within the worldwide British Empire of standard thermometers led to research on global temperature effects. Only in talking about the immediate effects of the eruption, does the report remark on a significant drop of temperature in the vicinity of the volcano caused by the darkened sky, but without considering longterm or global consequences. This seems strange from the standpoint of modern research in the VCC since scientists had access to standardized temperature data taken globally in the vast British empire and elsewhere. Furthermore the first systematic observations with a new instrument, the pyrheliometer, which measured variation in the strength of the sunʼs radiation on the earth, had begun in 1883.\nHow to explain the absence? I have been unable to find any direct statement by members of the Royal Society or the Royal Meteorological Society, so I can only speculate. Concerning the data, perhaps temperature changes were the least exciting of the global consequences of the event for scientists at the time, and their collection and analysis would have been a severe burden on the budget at the expense of other, more promising studies. There may have been the fear among meteorologists that error margins in temperature measurements would not have allowed them to draw any significant conclusions, given a probably minimal drop in temperature (northern hemisphere summer temperatures dropped around 0.3° Celsius, according to recent estimates).11 Furthermore, earlier worldwide climatic disturbances may have muddied the data. One such event was the “Great Southern\n9. Rogier D. M. Verbeek, Krakatau (Batavia, 1885). 10. George J. Symons, ed., The eruption of Krakatoa and subsequent phenomena.

Also, 1879 and the early 1880s had been marked by cooler and wetter weather in northern Europe and England in particular, leading to an agricultural depression. These extreme events may have made it difficult to detect any volcanic signal in the interannual climate change.12 Beside these meteorological considerations, dearth of data may have played a role. Since pyrheliometric measurements had started in 1883, scientists had little experience with them and lacked comparative data over sufficiently long periods.\nAll these reasons contain the assumption that researchers knowingly considered and then discarded the topic from further scrutiny. That assumption derives from projecting current knowledge upon the past, of looking for logical reasons where there was no logic at work. The relation between volcanism and global climate change might simply have stayed below the scientific horizon. And in any event it would not have seemed reasonable at the time to assume that only four cubic kilometers of dust (then the value used), projected into the high atmosphere, could affect the earthʼs climate."

    "heading": "The ice age debate",
    "text": "Suddenly, beginning in the mid-1890s, large volcanic eruptions were invoked as possible causes for the ice ages. Krakatau served as the reference eruption for these speculative accounts. In 1837, at the occasion of the Versammlung der Schweizer Naturforscher in Neuenburg (Neuchâtel), the Swiss geologist Louis Agassiz had proposed the idea of a great ice age as an alternative to the concept of the great flood to explain the previous extension of glaciers and other natural phenomena. From that date, debates had raged about its possible causes, whether cosmic (variations in the solar constant, changes in the earthʼs orbit) or terrestrial (the shape and extensions of continents and oceans, the varying height and covering of the earthʼs surface, currents of oceans and atmosphere). While none enjoyed unanimous acceptance, cosmic causes dominated, and as long as they were in favor, partly in combination with other terrestrial explanations, there was no need for volcanoes.\nBy the end of the 19th century, investigation of the geological record had demonstrated not one but a series of ice ages. Volcanoes appeared to be a way to obtain the necessary frequency. The arguments in their favor show common characteristics: First, they offer a fresh perspective by looking at the earthʼs atmosphere and its role in historic climate shifts (discussing alternately the role of water vapor, carbon dioxide, clouds at high altitude, and dust). Second, they are highly speculative about possible historic links between volcanic eruptions and climate change because of the lack of a reliable timetable of historical volcanic eruptions and of quantitative data, which left them with only the Krakatau reports\n12. I thank Gregory Cushman for drawing my attention to the 1877 ENSO.\nas their common reference point and empirical source for all things global. The widely read British report had directed scientists  ̓attention towards global effects of volcanoes. Thus while Krakatau did not immediately engender research into possible climatic changes in the short-term, it ultimately nourished debates and speculations in a very different domain in the long-term, from the mid-1890s. From Krakatauʼs globe-encompassing effects lessons could be drawn, it was hoped, for the (semi)global reach of the ice ages.\nThe first suggestion came from Italy, which has some good volcanoes. Luigi De Marchi (1857-1937), an Italian geographer and climatologist, and, beginning in 1902, professor of physical geography at the University of Padua, won the prize competition of 1894 of the Lombardy Institute of Science for a work on the causes of the ice age, published in 1895 as Le cause dellʼera glaciale. De Marchi rejected cosmological explanations for the ice ages in favor of terrestrial ones, and proposed a reduction of the transparency in the earthʼs atmosphere arising from a greater quantity of vapor in the atmosphere.13 How then to explain the sudden rise of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere? Volcanic eruptions seemed to De Marchi the solution.14 He admitted that it was audacious to claim that even immense (grandiosi) local events, like volcanic eruptions, could have an influence on global climate, but pointed out that it was also difficult to disprove the idea, as Krakatau had provided an excellent case for the global presence of at least optical phenomena. He provided a chronological list of volcanic eruptions from 1801 to 1875 based on Carl Wilhelm C. Fuchs  ̓Vulcani e terremoti of 1881 and the Krakatau report of the Royal Society of 1888, a product of the search for a statistical correlation between the eleven-year sunspot cycle and volcanic eruptions. Though De Marchi could not prove any correlation between volcanic eruptions and climate variations in the 19th century, he nevertheless continued to suggest that volcanic eruptions were the “most probable” explanation for rapid increases of water vapor in the atmosphere.15\nIn parallel with Italian developments, interest also picked up in Sweden with the work of Arvid Högbom as advertised by Svante Arrhenius. Early in 1895 Arrhenius gave a lecture on “The influence of carbonic acid on the earthʼs temperature,” resulting in the retroactively famous paper of 1896, “On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground.” As Arrhenius pointed out, he had been influenced by “lively” but inconclusive debates in the Stockholm Physics Society about the causes of the ice age on the Scandinavian peninsula in the quaternary period.16 Arrhenius came to consider volcanoes by way of the geologist\n13.

In 1893 and 1894 Högbom lectured on the variation of carbon dioxide in the earthʼs atmosphere to the physical and the chemical societies of Stockholm. He suggested that variations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could be linked to the pattern of major volcanic eruptions during geological times.17 He did not consider the climatic impact of these variations. Arrhenius spent a year designing a model that could explain temperature fluctuations by variations of the atmosphereʼs carbon dioxide concentration. The idea was not new; in 1861 John Tyndall had suggested that variations of carbon dioxide levels could explain the ice ages.18 Arrhenius went beyond Tyndall by introducing a model that included latitudinal temperature variations and feedback mechanisms, and was able to explain the drop of 5° Celsius necessary to cause the ice ages.19 He supported De Marchiʼs guess that a “change in the transparency of the atmosphere would possibly give the desired effect,” but focused on carbon dioxide instead of water vapor.20\nOther publications pursued the theme.21 The first to suggest dust clouds as possible causes of ice ages were the widely-travelled Swiss zoologists and anthropologists, the cousins Paul (1856-1929) and Fritz Sarasin (1859-1942) in a talk given at the Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Basel on November 20, 1901. For the two Sarasins an ice age resulted from a global depression in temperature of 3° to 6° Celsius, assuming otherwise stable conditions for the distribution of land and water, ocean currents, and the climatological differences between different parts of the earth. They speculated that a series of large volcanic eruptions—many Krakataus—might have produced an ice age owing to volcanic dust clouds in the upper atmosphere, vulkanische Höhenstaubwolken. This was admittedly merely a working hypothesis, as they had no temperature data to prove their point, and failed\n17. Högbom as translated by Arrhenius, in Arrhenius (ref. 16), 270.

The Sarasin cousins expressed their surprise at the lack of measurements of global temperatures after Krakatau, but admitted also the difficulties of obtaining reliable results, given the “number of factors which needed to be taken into account.”22 They provided fresh ideas at a moment when none of the widely discussed celestial explanations for the ice age had obtained a consensus and the debate had become sterile.\nTwo very large eruptions at the beginning of the 20th century, Santa Maria in Guatemala in 1902 and Ksudach on Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia in 1907, did not stimulate further research. In fact, prominent researchers expressed doubts about the volcanic hypothesis. For example, Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin (1843-1928), chair of the geology department at the University of Chicago whose research focused on the ice ages, saw no evidence for Högbomʼs and Arrhenius  ̓ idea of volcanoes as sources of carbon dioxide. He wrote Charles Greely Abbot, the director of the Smithsonian Observatory, in 1905: “Our knowledge of volcanism in its worldwide aspects in geological times is very limited on the land and practically nil for the ocean areas...as far as evidence goes, I have been unable to detect a relationship between volcanic activity and the extraordinary climatic episodes of geological history.”23 Abbot, however, would soon have good reason to look closely into the matter.\nKatmai (1912)\nIn the 1910s, the subject of VCC found a first shaky empirical and theoretical foundation in the United States. This geographical shift of research resulted from the spectacular volcanic eruption of Katmai (Novarupta) in Alaska, in June 1912, which led to the first systematic, quantitative, and theoretical studies of the influence of volcanoes on climate.24 Now the topic was no longer peripheral, but formed the core of studies. Historical data on global surface temperatures in connection with 19th-century eruptions, like Krakatau and Tambora, became retroactively an issue of great importance. The larger scientific framework within which the issue resided was solar physics (variation in solar radiation) and the ice age debate. VCC was discussed at the meeting of the Astronomical and Astrophysical Society\n22.

Martin, “The recent eruption of Katmai volcano in Alaska,” National geographic magazine, 24 (1913), 131-181.\nof America in Cleveland in January 1913, and two important articles appeared shortly afterwards.\nIn a paper of March 1913, entitled “Volcanoes and climate,” Abbot and his collaborator Frederick E. Fowle provided data for changes in the intensity of solar radiation owing to the haze in the higher atmosphere.25 By chance, when Katmai erupted in June 1912, Abbot and Fowle were making parallel measurements in Bassour in Algeria and on Mount Wilson in California. They used a pyrheliometer (for the intensity of the radiation of the sun) and a spectrobolometer (for separate wavelengths and the total intensity of sky radiation). Results showed a reduction of 20% maximum of total direct radiation of the sun at both stations, and a diminution of 10% of the quantity of heat warming the earth.26 When in January 1913 an article by Gustav Hellmann appeared in the Zeitschrift für Meteorologie arguing that the haze observed in the northern hemisphere could only be attributed to the Katmai eruption, Abbott and Fowle decided to explore the link between volcanic haze and terrestrial temperature more closely. They studied previous eruptions—1783 (Asama, Japan; Laki, Iceland), 1814 (Mayon, Philippines), 1815 (Tambora), and 1883 (Krakatau)—and even earlier qualitative descriptions of haze or dry fog in the higher atmosphere, relying on the British Krakatau report.27\nIn a second step, they linked a drop in solar radiation to historic volcanic eruptions. Quantitative measurements of solar radiation had begun in 1882, and depression of solar radiation found for 1883-1887, 1888-1893, and 1902-1904, which they attributed to Krakatau (1883), Bandai, Japan (1888), and a series of other eruptions, and finally Santa Maria, Guatemala (1902) and Colima, Mexico (1903).28 In a last step, they studied the effect of the haze on worldwide surface temperatures. Abbot and Fowle plotted solar radiation and sunspot numbers against annual mean departures of temperature in the U.S. (15 stations) and the world (47 stations) for the years between the 1880 to 1909, and found a “most striking” correspondence between the combined sunspots and volcanic haze effects and the U.S. mean maximum temperature. They concluded that the topic was “well worth serious consideration” and that recent volcanic eruptions had influenced temperatures by “perhaps as much as several degrees.”29 Abbotʼs ultimate obsession was\n25.

Volcanic eruptions were for him more a disturbing noise than a primary object of study.\nWilliam Jackson Humphreys  ̓article “Volcanic dust and other factors in the production of climatic changes, and their possible relation to ice ages” of June 1913 is the first substantial theoretical contribution to VCC.30 Humphreys (1862-1949) had trained in physics, especially spectroscopy, under the supervision of Henry A. Rowland at Johns Hopkins University in 1897. He joined the U.S. Weather Bureau in 1905, first as the supervising director of the Mount Weather Observatory (1905- 1908), later, until 1935, as a spectroscopist and meteorologist in the Central Office in Washington. His influential textbook, Physics of the air (1920), went through three editions by 1940. Humphreys  ̓contribution consisted of searching for a physical explanation of the phenomena observed, comparing the sparse experimental data with theoretical considerations about the size and shape of the dust particles in the atmosphere. His article introduced for the very first time the notion of “greenhouse effect” to the scientific literature.31\nHumphreys regarded the ice ages as phenomena extending over the whole globe and recurring at irregular intervals with unequal duration and intensity from the earliest geological ages. By emphasizing the irregularity of the ice ages, Humphreys excluded periodic cosmological causes and favored terrestrial ones. While the Sarasin cousins had invoked absorption of solar radiation by high volcanic clouds as a possible mechanism for lower surface temperatures of the earth, Humphreys came to the opposite result: absorption increased the earthʼs surface temperature. Hence, he had to look for other interceptive mechanisms, such as reflection and scattering from dust particles, to explain a change in the balance of incoming solar and outgoing terrestrial radiation that would procure a drop of temperature. This required theoretical calculations on the probable size of the “individual grains of floating volcanic dust” in the atmosphere and the evaluation of their effect on solar and terrestrial radiation. He concluded that the dust veil was thirty times more likely to backscatter incoming sunlight than to keep the earthʼs radiation in, and so would create an “inverse greenhouse effect.”32 Humphreys depended on the research that had been done on the Krakatau dust clouds. Further observational support came from the pyrheliometric measurements started in 1883 by Herbert H. Kimball of the U.S. Weather Bureau, who provided Humphreys with data up to 1913.33\nThe last step was to identify the volcanic signal in the history of the earthʼs global surface temperatures. The problem had received only scant attention except for the work of Abbot and Fowle.34 Here Humphreys worked with two data sets.\n30. William J.

World climate in 1816 (Ottawa, 1992). Abbot and Fowle had mentioned Tambora, but had limited themselves to what had been said in the Krakatau report of the Royal Society.\nFirst he selected seventeen American stations, seven in Europe, and one in India, and looked at average annual temperatures from the 1870/80s to 1912, the data being provided by the Climatological Division of the U.S. Weather Bureau. He preferred high altitude inland stations, as he assumed that differences in temperature would show much more clearly there, and would be less dependent on seasonal changes. He then compared the average temperature departures from annual mean temperatures in these stations with those of 13 tropical or semitropical low-level stations, and found them to agree “remarkably well,” which strengthened his confidence in his methodology. The data showed a drop of surface temperatures in the aftermath of the Krakatau and Katmai eruptions, and parallel drops in the pyrheliometric values (though these were not necessarily simultaneous).35 Second, Humphreys used data from 1750 of worldwide mean annual temperatures provided by the meteorologist Wladimir Köppen in Hamburg.36 He noted an agreement between the history of world temperatures and sunspots, and attributed “marked discrepancies” to the action of volcanoes. This work resulted in a graphical representation that charted historic volcanic eruptions since 1750 with the earthʼs mean temperatures, the pyrheliometric values, and the sunspot numbers (figure 1).\nHumphreys was the first to suggest that the eruption of Tambora in Sumbawa (todayʼs Indonesia) in 1815 affected global temperatures, a link that had not been made at the time in the 1810s by such astute observers as Joseph Banks or his contact, the British governor, Sir Stamford Raffles in Batavia. For Humphreys, only “violent volcanic eruptions…which drive a lot of dust into the isothermal region” would lead to a drop in worldwide temperatures.37 Indeed, Tambora had blown up in an eruption an order of magnitude bigger than Krakatau in terms of material. Recent studies indicate that altogether some 140 gigatons of magma, equivalent to 50 cubic kilometers of dense rock, erupted, ejecting some 60 million tons of sulfur into the stratosphere.38 Tambora showed worldwide effects similar to those of Krakatau, such as spectacular sunsets and pressure waves. The year after the eruption, 1816, became famous for its unusually cold weather; it was called “the year without a summer,” the “poverty year,” or “eighteen hundred and froze to death.”39 Meteorological observations from Europe and the northeastern part of the United States and Canada showed abundant rain in the unusually chilly summer\nFI G\n1 H\num ph\nre ys\n ̓c ha\nrt co\nm pa\nrin g\nth re\ne pa\nra m\net er\ns: P\nry he\nlio m\net ric\nv al\nue s,\nsu ns\npo t n\num be\nrs , a\nnd m\nea n\nte m\npe ra\ntu re\nflu\nct ua\ntio ns\nw ith\nth e\ntim in\ng of\nm aj\nor v\nol ca\nni c\ner up\ntio ns\n.

Subsequent crop failures and high food prices led to famine and death in America, Switzerland, and Ireland.\nHumphreys found a drop of roughly 1° Celsius in 1816 in the aftermath of the 1815 Tambora eruption. Therefore he concluded that a longer series of major volcanic eruptions could lead to a drop of the surface temperature of several degrees Celsius, enough to produce an ice age.40 Thus the “earth itself possesses potentially the power of bringing about its own climatic changes—even of beginning and of ending its own ice ages.”41 In conclusion, Humphreys pointed to the larger societal implications of his research. Climate change had consequences for crop production and plant development, as changes of temperatures of only of 1° Fahrenheit, as caused by sunspot variations or volcanic eruptions, would shift the latitude of the isotherms by 80 miles.\nThe first to react to Humphreys  ̓paper was the meteorologist Wladimir Köppen (1846-1940), a pioneer in the tedious work of collection and treatment of worldwide temperature data. Other meteorologists had been discouraged from pursuing this line of research by Brücknerʼs book Klimaschwankungen of 1890, which argued in favor of climate periods of 36 years, a speculation that Köppen regarded as impossible to prove with the data at hand. Köppen pointed to some weaknesses in Humphreys  ̓apparently “effective” historical chart of volcanic eruptions, sunspots, and temperature: Humphreys  ̓smoothed temperature curve tended to suppress abrupt changes of temperatures, which could not be attributed to volcanoes, and in any case his data before 1840 were useless as they covered only a very small part of the surface of the earth.42 Krakatau, Köppen stressed, had not led to an “abnormal cooling.” He did not reject Humphreys  ̓hypothesis outright, but thought that the effect of volcanic eruptions on worldwide surface temperatures was much weaker than Humphreys had claimed. He also observed that, in contrast to Krakatau with its global effects, the dust of the eruption of Katmai in the northern latitude had not gone beyond the northern temperate zones, an important observation that went by unnoticed.43 Along similar lines, the Polish meteorologist Henryk Arctowski (1871- 1958), resident of New York, also studied long-term variations and saw volcanic eruptions on the sidelines of larger historic climatic variations. Like Köppen, he preferred to look for cosmological causes, such as sunspot variations, but his data covered much less time and geographical scope than Köppenʼs. Again contrary to\n40. Humphreys (ref. 30), 31-32. In parallel with volcanic eruptions, Humphreys also discusses land elevation as an additional cause for ice ages and does not exclude cosmological variations, such as changes in the output of solar energy.

Current theories make an important distinction between low-latitude volcanoes (such as Tambora or Krakatau), which may affect both hemispheres, and high latitude volcanoes that affect only one hemisphere.\nKöppen, he attributed to Krakatau—in distinction to Katmai—a great influence on temperature, ranging 0.2° to 1.4° Fahrenheit.44\nDuring the 1920s Humphreys continued to advocate terrestrial causes of climate change in his influential Physics of the air and in his contribution on climate control to a symposium on “Ancient Climates” organized by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1925.45 In his presidential address to the American Meteorological Society in 1924, Willis I. Milham of Williams College discussed the influence of the Tambora eruption on American weather in 1816 and finished by proclaiming “a crying need for a weather map of the whole Northern Hemisphere, if not for the world.”46 Indeed, the lack of globe-encompassing data contributed to wrong assumptions: for example, Humphreys assumed that any larger volcanic eruption would have global temperature consequences, since its dust would spread around the world; furthermore, he grossly overestimated the climatic effect of volcanic eruptions, and his theoretical model of the physical mechanisms in the atmosphere was flawed. The matter remained speculative and drew few researchers. Yet, by the 1920s the link between large volcanic eruptions and climate change seemed plausible."

No eruption with significant global atmospheric impact happened until 1963, when the volcano Agung erupted in Indonesia. The pause of 51 years stretched over almost two generations of scientists.47 Without new data or researchers, the debate had stagnated. By the 1950s the idea was “the first to be discarded by modern writers on climatic variation,” according to Harry Wexler of the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, who tried to revive the connection between climate and eruptions.48 Researchers in the late\n44.

Both were and still are little studied, not least because they seem to have had no global impact on climate. Their DVI was very low in comparison to Agungʼs. 48.

To proceed, Wexler studied the increase of the total cloud cover owing to nucleating properties of ash particles in the formation of ice crystals, and the general circulation of the atmosphere arising from the temperature gradient between higher and lower latitudes.51\nWexler had yet another motive for his interest in VCC. He had collaborated since the late 1940s on military research on the global atmospheric and meteorological effects of nuclear bombs, a project supported by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the Air Force and involving the RAND Corporation. Wexler participated in Project Sunshine, which studied the long-range worldwide effects of atomic weapons; its report included a section on the atmospheric distribution of radioactive particles.52 His interest in volcanoes, and the explosive eruption of Krakatau in particular, rested on an argument by analogy. The report of the Royal Society on Krakatau figured prominently in studies on the global effects of Hbombs, given their similarity in size and effects.53 Military research on the atomic\n(1947), 321-333; Joseph Gentilli, “Present day volcanicity and climatic change,” Geological magazine, 85 (1948), 172-175; Harry Wexler, “Spread of the Krakatoa volcanic dust cloud as related to the high-level circulation,” American Meteorological Society, Bulletin, 32 (1951), 48-51, and Harry Wexler, “Volcanoes and world climate,” Scientific American, 4 (1952), 74-80. 49.

Publications of the U.S. Weather Bureau, for example, by Lester Machta, discussed the effects of atomic explosions on weather.54\nMachta referred to the many letters addressed to the U.S. Weather Bureau and the AEC suggesting that “atomic bombs should be used to dissipate hurricanes and tornadoes or otherwise improve undesirable weather;” and to equally numerous communications “blaming unpleasant weather on the atomic explosions” with enhanced testing programs.55 He rejected both these claims for the atomic bombs used in the Nevada tests. With the tests of the hydrogen bombs in the Pacific, however, the situation seemed to have changed. Helmut E. Landsberg, director of the Office of Climatology at the U.S. Weather Bureau, wrote in 1958:56\nConceivably one could throw enough dust into the stratosphere by nuclear explosions to intercept an appreciable amount of the solar radiation. This might, again conceivably, cause some changes of the general circulation. The effect would pass off in a few years—a short time as climatic spans go. Also, the effect would be general over the globe, with unpredictable effects as far as small land segments are concerned. It could hardly be called control.\nThe possibility that a hydrogen bomb might alter the weather in the Pacific worried Japanese scientists. Confronted with an exceptionally cold summer in 1954 and failures of rice crops in the Tohoku district in Northern Japan, Hidetoshi Arakawa, of the Japanese Meteorological Research Institute, studied the historical record of summer surface temperatures from 1883 on, and looked at possible causes of temperature drops. Arakawa was able to link the eruptions of Krakatau (1883), Santa Maria (1902), and Katmai (1912), with temperature drops and crop failure; Krakatau had caused a “record-breakingly cold” year in 1884, the “coldest year ever known in Japan.” Arakawa took the “abominable experiments” at the Bikini atolls between March and May 1954 as probable cause of the cold summer of 1954, though he neither had data to prove his contention, nor could he suggest a possible mechanism.57 In a subsequent study, Akio Arakawa and his collaborators extended this work to the study of monthly mean temperatures and weather\nKrakatoa,” Science, 154 (1966), 1325-1327. 54.

Looking at historical temperature records they rejected the influence of sunspots on climate, as proposed by Wladimir Köppen, and found clear evidence for volcanic eruptions in line with Humphreys and Wexler. Pointing to similarities in temperature records, they concluded that a series of H-bomb explosions, such as took place in the first half of 1954, “may possibly [have an] affect on the world-wide circulation through contaminating the higher atmosphere” by throwing up fine dust into the stratosphere.58 Studies of the propagation of the pressure wave and tsunami created by H-bomb explosions complemented this work.59\nIn 1961 J. Murray Mitchell, then at the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, who was also involved in the study of meteorological effects of nuclear bombs, studied global worldwide surface temperature trends. He showed that the warming trend observed since the late 19th century had reversed in the 1940s.60 Something other than volcanic eruptions and nuclear bombs must steer the world climate in the long-term. To show that volcanic dust and also the volcanoes  ̓latitude (which determined the dust s̓ global distribution) might nevertheless play a part in affecting climate in the short-term, Mitchell used data for the residence time of radioactive debris in the stratosphere.61 He concluded that eruptions led to lower temperatures, perhaps to a drop of “as much as 0.5° Fahrenheit or more in the first or second year following an unusually violent eruption.”62 Mitchell also speculated that the Krakatau eruption might have caused the low temperature of the late 1880s and early 1890s. To identify the volcanic signal more clearly, he introduced the so-called “superposed epoch analysis,” averaging temperatures over several years. In a later paper given at the conference “Global effects of environmental pollution” organized by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in December 1968, Mitchell undertook a comparison between human and natural contributions to atmospheric dust loading from 1850 to 1970.63\nMitchell relied on yet unpublished data provided by Hubert H.

He relied as Mitchell did on military studies of atmospheric circulation mechanisms with radioactive tracers caused by nuclear explosions.64 While Mitchell had focussed on global average temperatures and had discussed the influence of volcanoes on climate as one factor among many, Lamb focused exclusively on this issue and did extensive empirical work that oriented future research.\nIn the late 1950s Lamb switched his research from atmospheric and oceanic circulation to historical climatology. The stimulus was a wide range of new historical studies, such as pollen analysis in biology, radiocarbon dating, and lake sediments analysis. He embarked on a “thorough assessment of the effects of volcanic explosions and their products in the atmosphere.”65 Lamb established a chronology of volcanic eruptions, relying in part on publications by Karl Sapper and the Krakatau report of the Royal Society,66 studied the nature of volcanic pollution, and suggested a classification by introducing a dust veil index (DVI). The DVI took into account a number of factors, such as the height of dust in the atmosphere, its lifetime, and its effect on climate.67 Lamb made use of the widest range of sources to estimate the consequences of historical eruptions. Subsequent research relied on his pioneering studies, and improved upon the DVI.68\nLamb s̓ interdisciplinary research swam against the current. Historical climatology was not fashionable in the 1960s in the field of meteorology, which preferred modeling and forecasting.69 Furthermore, few of Lambʼs colleagues took climate change seriously, and Lamb s̓ strongly empirical and partly subjective approach did not find favor with his superiors. They took an inconsistency in his method (he had incorporated temperature in the DVI, which was supposed to determine whether volcanoes had an effect on climate) as justification to deny publication of his report in 1965. The report was published only in 1970 thanks to renewed interest after a minuscule volcanic eruption in 1967 on the British Deception Island.70 Two years later, Lamb founded the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia University in Norwich, still a center in the field of historical climatology.\n64.

    "heading": "Unwelcome noise: Agung (1963)",
    "text": "The eruption of Agung on the island of Bali, Indonesia, did not meet a prepared research community; therefore the data collected on it came as a “by-product of unrelated programs and facilities.”71 Nevertheless, it was the “first volcanic eruption that was followed by direct measurements of stratospheric temperatures, and in situ collection of stratospheric particles.”72 Many important observations were made unintentionally, as annoying disturbances to other research. For example, the U.S. Air Force had collected samples in the stratosphere at a height of 20 km with a U-2 airplane with the aim of detecting extra-terrestrial particles. These efforts were “effectively frustrated” by the eruption, however, they led to the identification of sulfuric acid of volcanic origin in the stratosphere.73 This kind of research paralleled the atmospheric observations during the 1950s and early 1960s done in connection with atmospheric tests of nuclear bombs and space research. Astronomical observatories all over the world noticed and measured the phenomena associated with volcanic dust in the atmosphere.74 Moreover, a new instrument, still in its infancy, was first used when Agung erupted: the ruby optical maser, developed in the early 1960s to detect particles in the atmosphere. An “optical radar,” a pulsed ruby laser, detected the backscattering from Agungʼs volcanic particles.75 The technique of detecting aerosol particles by measuring the backscattering of a laserʼs light soon became an invaluable tool for atmospheric scientists. It was known as LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging).\nAltogether Agung “did not receive the scientific attention it merited.” There was no concerted effort to obtain global standardized data, a situation quite different from the mid-1970s and 1980s.76 A number of reasons for this lack of coordination may be mentioned. Harry Wexler, the volcano advocate, who might have been able to launch a coherent interdisciplinary research program, had died in August 1962. Many instruments and data were still rudimentary and insufficient in volume and\n71.

For example, while some observers measured an increase in temperatures in the stratosphere and attributed it to Agungʼs dust, others, like J.G. Sparrow of the University of Minnesota, pointed to the changes in the quasi-biennial oscillation (the wind direction in the stratosphere) that happened at the time of the eruption. Sparrow concluded: “The Bali eruption is perhaps the only large eruption for which a reasonable amount of meteorological data is available. It is unfortunate therefore that so little use has been made of such a potentially powerful means of studying stratospheric properties.”77\nA final reason was the lack of an adequate theoretical and conceptual framework, for chemical processes in the atmosphere, for example, or for modeling. In the end, political and public interest in climate change arising from bomb blasts faded away during the 1960s. The topic received less attention after the moratorium on atmospheric nuclear tests agreed to by the Soviet Union and the United States in October 1963. The early 1960s present a curious situation. Whereas observation of the trigger event, Agung, profited from instruments set up for military research, no further coordinated research took place because of a drop in funding for studies on anthropogenic climate change caused by the H-bomb.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, research groups with a wide range of scientific specializations (chemistry, atmospheric science, ice core analysis, tree ring analysis, planetology, oceanography, climate science, modeling) took an interest in volcanism and climate change. The field became an arena for discussion of current and past climate changes. Two important conferences organized by the American Geophysical Union resulted: Hilo, Hawaii in 1992, and Santorini, Greece in 2002. The major themes that dominated the field at the beginning of the 21st century sprang from the 1970s.\nEnvironmental concerns assured climate change an unprecedented place in public and political debate in the late 1960s and 1970s. A flood of publications, following up Rachel Carson s̓ Silent spring (1962), considered limitations in growth and resources. Scientists contributed disconcerting observations and speculations: the possibility of the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the possibility of a new ice age, the pollution of the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer, and so on.78 These issues led to new regulations and the creation of global institutions that monitored potential global risks. The first pictures of the blue earth taken from space became an icon of the fragility of the planet.79 VCC profited greatly from these environmental debates and also shaped them by delivering cutting-edge science that ranged from planetary climates to the chemical and physical properties of greenhouse gases.

The three principal institutions involved were the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and its division, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, New York.80 The first advanced mostly the theoretical understanding of radiative effects in the atmosphere, the second devoted itself to the instrumental side, and the third worked on modeling.\nThe key players at the Ames Research Center were James B. Pollack and his collaborators, particularly Owen B. Toon.81 Pollackʼs doctoral work in 1965 at Harvard under Carl Sagan looked at the greenhouse effect on Venus. His subsequent research at the Ames Research Center focused on planetary atmospheres, their history, composition, temperature profiles, and radiative properties. Pollack studied dust storms on Mars and developed a general circulation model for the planet. In the early 1970s the spacecraft Mariner 9 observed a dust storm on Mars that revealed a significant modification of its climate: a temporary warming produced winds that reinforced the dust in the atmosphere. Toon called it “the only global climate change whose cause is known that man has ever scientifically observed.”82 It was tempting to look for similar feedback mechanisms on the earth. Pollack turned to a study of the impact of volcanic clouds on the climate of planet Earth to check and calibrate his models. He regarded the climate impact of volcanic eruptions as “the least controversial agent of climate change, because the eruption serves as a time marker after which the Earthʼs climate can be carefully monitored for small changes until the volcanic debris has fallen from the sky.” While other agents of change, such as carbon dioxide or the sunʼs luminosity, altered only slowly over time, volcanic eruptions with their immediate onset and observable short-time effects could serve as a “unique, well-defined check upon climate models.”83\n84.

Ibid., 1082.\nIn 1976 Pollack, Toon, Sagan, and others published an influential theoretical article on volcanic explosions and climatic change. In it they transferred their previous research on the radiative effects of aerosols produced by supersonic-transport (SST) and the space shuttles to the radiative effects of volcanoes. They were the first to pick up the thread that Humphreys had left, and looked in detail at optical properties of stratospheric aerosols to calculate their impact on the Earthʼs surface temperatures and temperatures of the troposphere and stratosphere. In their carefully argued and documented article, Pollack et al. criticized Humphreys  ̓results and inconsistencies in the light of more recent research. They subjected historical pyrheliometric data for the years 1883 to 1922 to close scrutiny, pointing to shifts in the measurement techniques and the impossibility of error analysis because of the lack of detailed information about the older instruments  ̓characteristics.84 More importantly, while Humphreys had focused on optical depth of volcanic dust at visible and infrared wavelengths and had favored backscattering to explain a drop in surface temperature, Pollack et al. studied specific aerosols and pushed radiative transfer calculations of the effects of stratospheric aerosols on the global heat budget.\nContrary to the community of volcanologists, Pollack et al. identified sulfuric acid, rather than dust, as the agent of long-term climatic effects of volcanic clouds. The then recent discovery that Venus  ̓atmosphere was largely composed of sulfuric acid guided them.85 They also relied on military research of the 1960s in connection with atmospheric nuclear tests: the German atmospheric scientist Christian E. Junge of the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories had shown that a fine layer of the earthʼs stratosphere, subsequently called the Junge layer, consisted of 75% sulfuric acid, which later was shown to be of volcanic origin.86 While volcanic dust disappeared rapidly out of the stratosphere, sulfur dioxide transformed into sulfuric acid, which produced the characteristic veils in the stratosphere.87 Pollack et al. concluded that the “net effect of volcanic explosions would be a cooling of the earth, whose magnitude would be controlled by the effect of the sulfuric acid aerosols.” They suggested that a major volcanic eruption could prompt a drop of 1° Celsius in global temperatures (leaving aside the possibility of feedback mechanisms).88\n89.

Hansen (ref. 92), 1067.\nThe Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provided the first direct extraterrestrial measurements from satellites, an “invaluable tool” for VCC, given that volcanoes often were inaccessible.89 In 1975 Donald F. Heath, Arlin J. Krueger, and others had devised a solar backscatter ultraviolet and total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) that flew on the Nimbus-7 satellite from 1978 to 1993.90 Originally designed to determine total amounts of ozone by measuring the backscattered ultraviolet sunlight and direct irradiation, it proved to be able to monitor sulfur dioxide as well and so to measure the “volume, dispersion, and drift of volcanic gas clouds.”91 Krueger was the first to make use of TOMS after the eruption of El Chichón in 1982. It enabled to make an estimate of the total mass of sulfur dioxide deposited in the stratosphere. This method superseded earlier quantitative estimates of the strength of volcanic eruptions that extrapolated from local measurements.\nThe third NASA institution involved, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, was a division of the Goddard Space Flight Centerʼs Earth Sciences Directorate. Here James E. Hansen, a physicist and astronomer by training, worked on computer simulations of the Earthʼs atmosphere. In the late 1970s he and his collaborators Wei-Chyung Wang and Andrew A. Lacis developed a global-average one-dimensional radiative-convective model, which looked at the vertical distribution of the climatic effects of the Agung eruption and deduced surface cooling and stratospheric warming.92 Hansen was concerned with the effect of carbon dioxide and sulfate aerosols of both natural and anthropogenic origin on terrestrial climate change. He took care to discuss the shortcomings of his “grossly oversimplified” model, which did not take into account feedbacks or three-dimensional atmospheric dynamics and treated aerosol properties and atmospheric temperatures only superficially. He concluded, nevertheless, that radiative perturbations similar to the magnitude of volcanic emissions “do noticeably affect the climate, contrary to some recent opinions.”93\nFrom the mid-1970s, the larger political and environmental issues drove research in VCC.

Stephen H. Schneider, at that time deputy head of the Climate Project at the National Center for Atmospheric Studies (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, expressed similar concerns. Schneider and Clifford Mass of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington were the first to develop a simple climatic model based on energy balance to compute global surface temperatures over time.\nTo test their model, they compared the pattern of surface temperature variation with the history of volcanic dust and sunspots beginning in C.E. 1600. They frankly admitted the fragmentary and unreliable character of their data sets, but nevertheless insisted on the necessity of developing models: “With so many parameters to vary one could fit almost anything to anything, and our chief purpose here is to try to show the consequences for computed surface temperatures of accepting a set of assumptions and observations already in the literature.”96 It was high time to devise ways to treat the data amassed by meteorologists, especially given the lack of explanation for the rise of global surface temperatures from 1968 on: “How urgent it is for society to deal with the growing burden of thermal pollution and atmospheric carbon dioxide—external climatic forcing functions that are increasingly competing with the natural factors that cause climatic change.”97 Identifying natural noise that might hide a man-made shift of global temperatures guided research. This new global environmental concern pushed modeling of the earthʼs atmosphere despite incomplete data. As Paul Edwards has pointed out, “By the late 1970s, computer-based climate models…had come to dominate climatological discourse. With this change, the very meaning of climate shifted from a local to a global understanding. The term climatology gradually fell from favor…[to be] replaced by the term climate science.”98\nIn VCC modelers aimed at three-dimensional and more physically realistic models. Two-dimensional ones, so-called zonally-averaged models, which took into account vertical and latitudinal responses to eruptions, were first proposed in the early 1980s.99 Truly three-dimensional, so-called general circulation models\neffects of the El Chichón eruption,” Geofísica internacional, 23 (1984), 385-401. 100.

    "text": "From the 1970s, climate science underwent “unprecedented interdisciplinary scientific collaboration and political coordination,”102 and VCC attracted funding and researchers. All that was needed was a major eruption of data to feed and improve their models. Theoretical, observational, instrumental, and institutional preparations were in place when the next natural experiment struck. This was an eruption of limited global significance, the explosion of Mount St. Helens in 1980. However, it was monitored quite closely, not least thanks to its convenient geographical location in the state of Washington, which helped to draw unprecedented public and scientific attention within the United States.103 Now a trigger event (though a small one), empirical data, and public interest fell together. Alan Robock of the Department of Meteorology of the University of Maryland carried out a systematic study of local surface temperatures and found a net warming, a result of day-time cooling and night-time warming.104 His model of long-term global effects, which took into account the latitude and season of the volcanic eruption, predicted that the climatic effects of the eruption would be minimal.105\nJames E. Hansen had stressed in 1978 the “enormous potential scientific value of the natural climatic experiment provided by a large volcanic eruption” and suggested making “detailed observations and analyses of the next large volcanic explosion” listing “global monitoring of the spread, growth, and decay of the aerosols, sampling of the aerosol properties in situ, and accurate global monitoring of the climatic response.”106 Shortly before the Mount St. Helens eruption, Toon and Pollack had commented favorably on the on-going NASA satellite and aircraft\n107.

Satellites monitored the sulfur dioxide clouds and tracked the stratospheric dust-clouds circling around the earth.109 Scientists rejoiced in the new comparative data provided by two very different eruptions. Between April 1982 and May 1983 NASAʼs Climate Program Office financed four major coordinated measuring campaigns involving satellites, airplanes, and balloons, partly in coordination with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and a number of ground-based LIDAR stations.110 The first results were published a few months later in a special issue of Geophysical research letters with Pollack and Toon as guest editors. Its cover drawing depicted the volcano still slightly smoking, the spectacular reddish twilight effects caused by the aerosols in the stratosphere, the NASA U-2 and Convair 990 airplanes, and the Solar Mesosphere Explorer satellite of the University of Colorado and NOAA in Boulder (figure 2). The satellite, launched in October 1981, was built to learn about ozone in the mesosphere. In place when El Chichón erupted, it collected valuable data.111"

They reevaluated data of past eruptions in the light of new research, and the research in the light of the data, an ongoing process of mutual adjustment. Avant-garde computer-driven research was thus complemented during the 1970s and 1980s by a series of important historical and empirical studies.\nHistorical studies provided a challenge for VCC, as they required different methods and different skills from those employed by the modellers. Here\n112. Climatologists distinguish between three historiographical periods: Up to the 18th century, they depend on natural proxy indicators and written or pictoral sources; from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century, they dispose of the first quantitative temperature measurements of limited comparability but not yet of truly global scale; and in a third period from the mid-19th century on, quantitative data of global reach are available and can be used to reconstruct global climate surface temperatures. 113.

Historical climatology and volcanology made use of human archives—grain prices, reports about crops, death rates—to evaluate past climates and the effects of volcanic eruptions during historical times, something that Lamb had already taken into account for volcanic eruptions after 1500.112 Paleohistorical work relied on natural proxy indicators for eruptions or temperature change, such as ice cores, sea cores, and tree rings. Ice cores, which contained deposits of volcanic acids, provided data on past climateaffecting volcanic eruptions of at least the last several thousand years. These studies calibrated the magnitude and geography of past eruptions by comparing the distribution patterns of strontium (90Sr) after nuclear explosions at various latitudes with the spread of the aerosols released by a volcanic eruption.113 In a second step, these volcanic eruptions were ranked according to their acid output, the climate-relevant sulfate, and compared to historical climatic data as inferred from, say, tree-ring records.114 The Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University undertook deep core drillings in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. The analysis of ash layers in these cores made possible conclusions about the volcanic history of the Cenozoic, the last 65 million years.115 (These ocean cores also put the volcanism/ice age thesis to rest when they showed in 1976 a direct link between the ice ages and variations in the Earthʼs orbit around the sun, a dominant cycle of roughly 100,000 years, and two others of roughly 23,000 and 42,000 years.116)\nThis work contributed to establishing long-term global chronologies of massive volcanic eruptions with links to significant though short-term climatic changes or cooling trends of Earthʼs climate.117 Previous eruptions of unknown scales and types came into sight: for example, prolonged basaltic-flood lava eruptions, though not explosive, could have a strong effect on weather, as happened with the\n118.

    "heading": "Politics and doubts",
    "text": "With success came doubt in the new findings on VCC. This debate lasted from the 1970s to the early 1990s when the research on Pinatubo settled many issues. Opposition occurred on several levels: disciplinary (volcanologists versus climatologists), methodological (empiricism versus modeling), and political (environmental versus economic concerns, anti-nuclear versus pro-military stances). From the 1970s, scientists who advocated modeling and dominated theorizing took the initiative not only on scientific, but also on political grounds, presenting their scientific work as both inspired and driven by urgent societal needs. Others urged caution about claiming too much in view of the number of unclarified methodological issues, confusing temperature data, and uncertainty about the particles that caused a lowering of temperatures. Given the scarcity of significant amounts of volcanic material that reached the stratosphere, it was also difficult to decipher the importance of such temporal and geographic circumstances as the month of the eruption and the volcanoes  ̓latitude.\nIn the 1970s, the atmospheric physicist Diran Deirmendjian of the RAND corporation analyzed then recent studies of the historic eruptions Krakatau, Katmai, and Agung, and concluded that there was “little evidence of volcanically induced climatic effects.”119 The meteorologists Helmut E. Landsberg and J.M. Albert did not see “substantial evidence” that Tambora had lowered global temperatures.120 They also pointed to the complete lack of any statistical tests of temperature data in previous work, such as Humphreysʼ. When Pollack et al. published their theoretical paper of 1976, in which they deduced a drop of surface temperatures of 0.3° Celsius two years after major volcanic eruptions, meteorologists were quick to point to technical errors in their use of temperature data.121 Relying on models, B.\n122.

Stommel and Stommel (1983) could not identify Tambora as the cause for the climatic changes in 1816 (see ref. 39). Robock explained the cooling before 1816 by a series of previous eruptions of other volcanoes, but could only speculate about the causes for the strong warming afterwards.

Toon, “Volcanoes and climate,” in Adarsh Deepak, ed., Atmospheric effects\nJohn Mason, Director General of the UK Meteorological Office, saw no lowering of surface temperatures in the aftermath of the Agung eruption and discarded the volcanic hypothesis.122 Reacting to the increasing use of models during the 1970s, the meteorologist Landsberg stated that “one reliable observation is worth a thousand models and a million speculations.”123\nIn 1983 Hugh W. Ellsaesser, a meteorologist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, gave a critical overview of recent VCC articles. He did not reject a connection between surface cooling and large volcanic eruptions per se, but stressed the inconsistencies in the data; for example, he pointed out the strange observation that in the case of Tambora and other eruptions surface cooling started before the eruption. This observation, made by several analysts in the 1970s, had prompted speculation that cooling could offset explosive eruptions.124 Ellsaesser argued against “an emerging consensus that volcanic eruptions constitute the clearest signals identifiable in the climatic record and that the relationship is sufficiently quantitative that it can now be used to calibrate climatic models.” He did not mince his words: “In my view, much of the recent effort on this subject can be described as no more than a game of one-up-manship in curve fitting.”125 Ellsaesser also pointed to a non-linear relationship between the size of volcanic eruptions and subsequent surface temperature drops, which might invalidate the volcanism-climate-nexus altogether.126\nAt stake in these disputes was the validity and potential of modeling, and the consistency and statistical relevance of the data on which these models were based. In his report for the United Nations, Kirill Ya. Kondratyev summarized a contradictory situation as one where studies indicated a correlation between volcanic eruption and surface temperatures “even though they used data sets that are not consistent.”127 Some climatologists regarded the relation between volcanoes and climate as exclusively a statistical matter. In contrast, Pollack and Toon stressed that the effects of volcanoes could be verified by observation: “Unlike other potential causes of climate variability, such as solar luminosity fluctuations, the effects of volcanoes on climate can be quantified because their effects on the Earthʼs radiation balance can be measured.”128\nand potential climate impact of the 1980 eruptions of Mt.

But this conflict was solved rapidly. In the early 1980s, “the observation of rapid ash fallout from the atmosphere [from Mount St. Helens]…convinced volcanologists that expelled dust and ash did not remain in the atmosphere long enough to modify climate.”129 Samples collected by U-2 and Convair 990 aircraft based at NASA Ames Moffett Field after the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and El Chichón provided further irrefutable evidence. Volcanologists also pointed to methodological errors in the uses of data of past eruptions by climate modelers: for example, during the 1980s some climatologists wrongly equated the degree of volcanic explosivity as defined by the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) with possible climatic impact.130 They struck a cautious note, given the inconclusive data after the 1982 El Chichón eruption:131\nThus, even though El Chichón produced the aerosol cloud of the last 100 years, with an atmospheric opacity in the Northern Hemisphere perhaps half that after Krakatau 1883, it is not at all clear that the eruption produced a simple cooling effect on hemispheric (or even zonal) temperatures in the following year....We still cannot forecast those regional and seasonal atmospheric effects of eruptions that would be most important in terms of impact on agriculture, transportation, and health.\nEl Chichón had not delivered the desired results because surface temperature drops were masked by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. One had to believe on the basis of a single documented case that the ENSO effects equalled those of the El Chichón eruption. Little seemed definitive, and the volcanologists Stephen Self and Michael R. Rampino saw the relations between volcanic eruptions and climate change as still a “conundrum.”132 Equally, in 1988, the atmospheric scientist Veerabhadran Ramanathan, then professor at the University of Chicago, regarded the warming of the lower stratosphere resulting from large volcanic eruptions “as the only aspect of the entire climate theory for which there is unambiguous verification,” contrary to surface cooling which had “not yet been satisfactorily demonstrated.”133\n134.

Pollack, “Environmental effects of an impact-generated dust cloud: Implications for the cretaceoustertiary extinctions,” Science, 219 (1983), 287-289.\nAlan Robock, however, thought that it was time to face the results of the latest research: “Conventional wisdom...holds that the effects of volcanoes on climate have not yet been demonstrated, but other work has claimed that volcanoes can be important causes of hemispheric temperature changes for several years following large eruptions, and even on a 100-year time scale when their cumulative effects are taken into account.”134\nThe few examples listed here indicate the range and tone of conflicts within VCC studies. In part this was a conflict about competence, about who knows best in the complex analysis of global temperature measurements and in the determination of past volcanic eruptions; in part, it reflected the divide in VCC between empirical research and theoretical modeling. And it mirrored the environmental and political clash about global warming and environmental politics at large. This was particularly evident in the debate over “nuclear winter.”\nResearchers at the forefront of VCC in the 1970s played a crucial role in this highly political debate. Pollack and Toon transferred their research on the atmospheric pollution from supersonic transport, the space shuttle, asteroids, and volcanoes to the effects of nuclear bombs. Inversely, Richard Turco of the R&D Associates in Marina del Rey in California, a defense think tank, who had worked on aerosol formation in the stratosphere in connection with supersonic transport and nuclear explosions, became interested in volcanic aerosols. Their environmental concerns joined political ones, now spilling over from the issue of anthropogenic atmospheric pollution and global warming, to the consequences of a nuclear war between the two superpowers. Turco coined the term “nuclear winter” in 1983, in an article written in collaboration with Toon, Pollack, and Thomas P. Ackerman from the NASA Ames Research Center, and Carl Sagan of Cornell University.135 A report and two widely read articles had inspired them: the National Research Councilʼs Long-term worldwide effects of multiple nuclear-weapon detonations, which had excluded major climatic consequences; the famous paper by Luis Alvarez et al. on the extinction of the dinosaurs (1980); and the paper of the atmospheric scientists Paul J. Crutzen and John W. Birks on the consequences of a nuclear war (1982).136\nTurco calculated the possible impact on climate of a nuclear war owing to soot and dust in the atmosphere caused by fires that would reduce sunlight for weeks or months. Using a one-dimensional model, they suggested a temperature drop of 25 to 35° Celsius in the Northern hemisphere during the summer months, hence\n137. Richard P.

The National Research Council was asked for another report on the atmospheric consequences of a nuclear war. Political pressure and scientific uncertainties were obvious in the report, as reflected in the introductory statement by the chairman, Frank Press, which spoke of the “strong emotional reactions” and “profound gaps in existing knowledge.” The tensions appear also in the opinions of the reviewers: Some feared misinterpretation of even the “most qualified results,” others suggested dropping the topic and admitting the impossibility of treating the issue scientifically. Still, the consensus prevailed that the report should go forward, “given the enormous human stakes,” and apply quantitative methods to sort out the important issues. The mid-1980s thus repeated the debates of the 1970s between those who emphasized the limitation of models and lack of appropriate data, and those who thought it urgent to address pressing environmental and political issues. Unsurprisingly, the consensus view of the 1985 report was an exercise in linguistics: “Obviously, calculations made under these conditions cannot be read as a scientific prediction of the effects of a nuclear exchange; rather, they represent an interim estimate from which the reader can infer something of the potential seriousness of the atmospheric degradation that might occur.”138\nA review article by Stephen H. Schneider and Starley L. Thompson summarized subsequent research, this time using three-dimensional models. They confirmed the serious atmospheric consequences of a nuclear war, but suggested a drop of temperatures rather in the 5-15° Celsius range. They spoke of a “nuclear fall,” which still held the prospect of “unprecedented human catastrophe.”139 Given the multiple uncertainties and the absence of experimental data entering in these calculations, the debate saw no closure and in any case lost its immediate urgency with the end of the cold war in 1989.\nThough the atmospheric consequences of a nuclear war and volcanic explosions were not necessarily identical, many of the main actors in the field of VCC moved easily between the two fields. The field developed ever more refined models of atmospheric circulation and chemistry. The nuclear winter debate ignited one over “volcanic winters” caused by massive eruptions and feedback mechanisms. One such supereruption might have involved the volcano Toba in Sumatra 73,500 years\n140. Michael R. Rampino, Stephen Self, and Richard B.

Rampino and Stephen Self suggested a possible drop of temperature around 3 to 5° Celsius with consequences not dissimilar from a nuclear winter. This research was part of an effort to establish reliable chronologies for volcanic eruptions on human and geological timescales and to look for their climatic effects."

    "text": "The eruption of Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991 came at a perfect moment for the VCC community. The debate around nuclear winter and global warming had sharpened arguments and convictions; now Pinatubo played the judge and scientists eagerly awaited data that would either confirm or invalidate their models and calculations. It did not hurt that the spectacular images of the eruption attracted immense public attention.\nAgain NASA, energized by Louis S. Walter (1933-2000), associate director of the Earth Sciences Directorate at the Goddard Space Flight Center, led the way. It fielded satellites (TOMS for sulfur dioxide determination, SAGE II for optical depth and aerosol extinction measurements from 1984 on) and airplanes from the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, and it worked with NOAAʼs AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) on cloud cover and surface temperatures and with NOAAʼs Mauna Loa LIDAR. Pinatubo, “the largest volcanic impact to the stratosphere ever observed by satellite instruments,” provided an excellent occasion to calibrate satellite measurements by having in situ airplanes, balloons, and other sensors in the path of the eruption cloud. Furthermore, to assure comparability researchers made sure that they had the instruments that had been used to monitor the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and El Chichón. New data about the distribution of the aerosol cloud, its total mass, optical depth, temperature, and ozone depleting capacities abounded. The eruption was expected to figure as the “ʻAcid test  ̓for climate models,” which predicted a significant surface cooling for 1992.141\nThe first results appeared in January 1992 in a special section of Geophysical research letters. In March 1992 in Hilo, climate scientists and volcanologists joined forces for a conference on “Climate, Volcanism and Global Change” funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA. On this occasion the International Association of Volcanism and Chemistry of the Earthʼs Interior (IAVCEI) and the International Association for Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences (IAMAS)\n142. I am grateful to Richard Turco for providing material and discussion on that meeting. 143. Simarski (ref.4), iii.

Ibid., 19.\nformed a Commission on Volcanism and the Earthʼs Atmosphere. The conference, convened by Turco and the geologist Stephen Self and attended by more than 130 scientists, brought together a wide range of disciplines and issues, ranging from atmospheric chemistry through volcanology, (historical) climatology, eruption mechanisms, proxy records of past climate, to modeling.142\nGiven the attractiveness of the field for scientists, politicians, environmentalists and the public at large, it is perhaps not surprising that the American Geophysical Union (AGU) convened its first press conference in Washington, D.C. two months later. The organizers and four other leading figures of the field participated. The purpose of the press conference was to “promote public awareness, understanding, and appreciation for the research within the areas of AGUʼs interest;” its subject, the Hilo conference, was picked because “it dealt with global change, a topic of clear public interest.”143 On that occasion, a 32-page special report, Volcanism and climate change, written by an AGU staff member in close collaboration with the organizers of the conference and reviewers, was distributed to the journalists. The report addressed the political implications of VCC research: “It is now clear that to understand how human activity is changing the Earthʼs environment—a vital concern of both the public and policy-makers—the complex, natural variations in the Earthʼs atmosphere and climate system must first be deciphered.”144\nThe AGU report did not hide that around the time of the conference the question of the impact of volcanoes on climate was still unsettled. While stratospheric warming did occur in accordance with theoretical predictions, measurements for surface temperatures showed conflicting results: some indicated cooling in late 1991, followed by warming in the first three months of 1992; others, obtained from satellites, showed a continuous drop of global temperatures during early 1992. The report asked for time: “At least another 6-12 months of data are needed to confirm Pinatuboʼs effects and to calibrate them against observations made after El Chichón.”145 It was necessary to sort out many factors, from background noise over random variation to regional differences in climate change. Modelers were trying to incorporate feedback mechanisms (by way of clouds, water vapor, and sea ice) that could amplify or moderate the effects of volcanic aerosols. They paid considerable attention to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO)—a sudden change in atmospheric and oceanic circulation in the equatorial Pacific, happening every four to seven years, starting off the west coast of South America, and causing weather anomalies for about a year. ENSO had caused surface warming and thus masked the cooling caused by El Chichón.\n146. Alan Robock and Jianping Mao, “Winter warming from large volcanic eruptions,” Geophysical research letters, 24 (1992), 2405-2408, on 2406. 147. Ibid., 2407. 148. Robock and Oppenheimer (ref. 75).\nBy the end of 1992 Alan Robock and Jianping Mao had shown that large volcanic eruptions, independent of the hemisphere of the volcanoes, led to winter warming over Eurasia and North America and cooling in the Middle East in the first or second winter, depending on the latitude of the eruption. They managed to provide a mechanism: The cooling arose from the blocking of incoming sunlight, while an enhanced zonal wind from the heating of the tropical stratosphere caused the warming. This was the first plausible explanation of previous conflicting temperature data after large eruptions. In order to confirm their findings for Pinatubo, Robock and Mao looked to history, and chose from a combination of the existing volcanic records (DVI, VEI) twelve large historical volcanic eruptions (1883-1992) for examination. They relied particularly on the “best global surface temperature data” of the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, which needed to be corrected for long-term temperature variations and the disturbing ENSO signal, which had affected temperature measurements after the El Chichón eruption.146 Their last step was to check the statistical relevance of this pattern. They found that it existed in roughly 20% of all non-volcanic years; however, all the years of major volcanic eruptions consistently showed it. The pattern “almost exactly matches the pattern found in the perpetual January general circulation model (GCM) calculation of the effects of stratospheric aerosols on climate” as developed in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg.147"

    "heading": "3. CONCLUSION",
    "text": "In Robock s̓ and Mao s̓ work the two main research lines within VCC, computer modeling and historical studies, complemented each other and inaugurated a string of new research that clarified many earlier disputes. They culminated in another AGU conference in 2002.148 Pinatubo had raised the VCC field to new levels, not only by attracting global attention and generous funding, but also by providing new data sets obtained with instruments and methods identical to those used during the previous large eruption, El Chichón. Comparability sharpened the similarities and differences, and gave a better understanding of the mechanisms by which singular volcanic events could affect the earthʼs climate for a few years. It was clear at last that the measurable effects of volcanic eruptions offered precious indicators for exploring the susceptibility of the earthʼs climate system. The results also had an immediate political effect as they entered the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) whose task is to summarize and evaluate research on the risk of global warming for policy makers.\nReliable long-term data on a global scale were the exception at the turn of the 20th century; temperature and pyrheliometric measurements gave only rudimentary\nindications. Krakatau (1883), though it did not directly trigger VCC research, ultimately came to stand in for everything global and to act as a point of reference for speculation. Volcanoes served as new exciting stimuli for an on-going discussion of the causes of the ice ages within scientific circles and beyond. Katmai (1912) instigated VCC research and led to the first theoretical considerations, but the data set was too slim to encourage further research and to withstand statistical analysis. Humphreys, however, discussed not only the ice ages, but also stressed policy implications, such as the necessity of a better understanding of climate change for agriculture. Lack of data and of further eruptions undermined interest. More than thirty years later, the debate reignited, now over anthropogenic climate changes caused by the atmospheric tests of nuclear bombs. Here, explosive volcanoes served as analogies. However, opinions about volcanic climatic effects remained inconclusive and shifted when longer periods of warming and cooling could not be attributed to either bombs or volcanoes.\nAfter a drought of more than 50 years, Agung (1963) produced lots of data and observations thanks to continued military funding, but there was neither a close community of researchers nor a broader theory that could put them to good use in the short run. Agung had fallen into the void of public disinterest in climate change. Only a few years later things had changed considerably. By the 1970s, environmental concerns about atmospheric pollution were on the agenda for scientists, the public, and politicians alike. With it came a renewed interest in aerosols and climate change resulting from large volcanic eruptions. Environmental concerns furthered the development of globe-encompassing models with the help of computers and pursued the systematic collection of data from all over the earth, further facilitated by new instruments and booming space research. Volcanic eruptions now served as crucial test cases for the first computer models and hence promoted understanding of the atmospheric mechanisms that entailed climate change. When Mount St. Helens and El Chichón erupted, researchers jumped on the occasion. The eruptions attracted broad attention and hence funding, mostly through NASA. With public debates raging during the 1980s about anthropogenic climate change from global warming or nuclear war, VCC researchers found themselves in the middle of the storm. Thus in the early 1980s everything came together nicely: spectacular trigger events, the availability of globe-encompassing data, and, finally, widespread public attention.\nResearch on volcanoes and climate change developed in the light of large public debates about the ice ages, nuclear bombs, and climate change—all existential issues with the future of the globe and its inhabitants at stake. While natural climate changes, like the ice ages, remained beyond human intervention, the appearance of anthropogenic climate change introduced another dimension: the possibility of human self-destruction. Scientific and political reasoning were now intimately intertwined, and many of the VCC protagonists have pursued the field for that very reason. Concerns over the future have been the driving force of VCC research, outweighing the availability of reliable data and the slow pace of eruptions. For a long time there were more questions than answers. Things seem to have changed\nonly very recently in VCC. Still, despite new data and continuing interest, in the end the field and its future will depend on natureʼs inscrutable timetable for rare climate-affecting volcanic eruptions. For better or worse, the pace of these eruptions—while regular on a geological timescale—does not follow the patterns of scientific careers and human lifetimes."
