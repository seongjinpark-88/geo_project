The sedimentary sequence was dated using climatostratigraphic alignment, varve chronology, tephrostratigraphy, argoneargon single-crystal dating, radiocarbon dating, magnetostratigraphy, and cosmogenic nuclides. Based on the lithostratigraphic framework, the different age constraints are compiled and a robust and precise chronology of the 600,000 year-old Lake Van record is constructed. Proxy records of total organic carbon content and sediment color, together with the calcium/potassium-ratios and arboreal pollen percentages of the 166-m-long eventcorrected Ahlat Ridge record, mimic the Greenland isotope stratotype (NGRIP). Therefore, the proxy records are systematically aligned to the onsets of interstadials reflected in theNGRIP and synthesizedGreenland icecore stratigraphy. The chronology is constructed using 49 age control points derived from visual synchronizationwith the Greenland ice-core stratigraphy using the GICC05 timescale, an absolutely-dated speleothem timescale (e.g., Hulu, Sanbao, Linzhu cave) and the EpicaDomeC timescale. In addition, the uppermost part of the sequence is complemented with four ages from Holocene varve chronology and three calibrated radiocarbonages. Furthermore,nineargoneargonagesandacomparisonof the relativepaleointensityrecordof the magnetic field with reference curve PISO-1500 confirm the accuracy of the agemodel. Also the identification of the Laschamp event via measurements of 10Be in the sediment confirms the presented age model. The chronology of the Ahlat Ridge record is transferred to the 79-m-long event-corrected composite record from theNorthern Basin and supplemented by additional radiocarbon dating on organicmarco-remains. The basal age of the Northern Basin record is estimated at w90 ka. The variations of the time series of total organic carbon content, the Ca/K ratio, and the arboreal pollen percentages illustrate that the presented chronology links ice-marine-terrestrial stratigraphies and that the paleoclimate data are suited for reconstructions and modeling of the Quaternary and Pleistocene climate evolution in the Near East at millennial timescales. Furthermore, the chronology of the last 250 ka can be used to test other dating techniques.\n2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction overall good agreement of Glacial/Interglacial and stadial/inter-\nLake sediments constitute valuable terrestrial archives of past environmental conditions. They are potentially continuous over several Interglacial/Glacial cycles and, ideally, varved, providing annually-resolved to seasonally-resolved records at sub-millennial timescales. An excellent example is the sedimentary sequence recovered from two sites in Lake Van (Turkey) by the PALEOVAN project of the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP). The two drill sites, Northern Basin (NB) and Ahlat Ridge (AR) are located in the north western part of Lake Van at water depths of 245 m and 360 m (relative to present lake level at w1650 m above sea level), respectively. AR e the primary site e is a morphological ridge at the northern edge of the 440 m-deep Tatvan Basin. This special volume presents several multidisciplinary contributions of the PALEOVAN scientific team. The rationale for this study is to deliver and discuss a common chronology for paleoenvironmental investigations. General information about the pre-site survey are given in Litt et al. 2009 and about the project, the drilling operations and sampling party are given in Litt et al. (2012).\nA robust age model is mandatory for a comprehensive temporal understanding of the environmental information in sedimentary archives. Terrestrial archives, and in particular the sediment of Lake Van, are also influenced by non-climate driven changes. Tectonic and volcanic activity causes post-depositional deformation, and resultes in mass-movement deposits and volcaniclastic layers (Stockhecke et al., 2014). Two major gaps occur in the composite AR record (at w125 and w170 mcblf, meters composite depth below lake floor) and the lowermost part of the NB record shows several unconformities. The lithostratigraphic framework (Stockhecke et al., 2014) takes all these processes into account in order to extract an event-corrected succession reflecting solely background sedimentation, and thus providing the backbone for the age model. Another characteristic lithological feature is the frequent intercalation of event deposits coinciding with each glacial termination and with the well expressed interstadials (Stockhecke et al., 2014).\nThe stratigraphic correlation between the PALEOVAN drill sites is used for extrapolating the AMS-14C ages of terrestrial macroremains from the NB record to the AR record. This enables the transfer of the AR chronology to the NB record. The stratigraphic correlation with previously recovered sediment cores (Landmann et al., 1996; Lemcke, 1996; Lemcke and Sturm, 1997) offers the advantage of transposing a varve chronology for the Holocene.\nThe lithostratigraphic framework of both drill sites documents that: i) lake-level variations expressed by abruptly changing lithologies and total organic carbon content were controlled by global climate changes, ii) climate-sensitive proxy records can be aligned with Greenland Stadials (GS) and Interstadials (GIS) and Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) and iii) volcanic events and associated tephras frequently intercalating the background sediments are datable (40Ar/39Ar single-crystal dating) at least back to w530 ka (Stockhecke et al., 2014). Consequently, the terrestrial archive of Lake Van provides a unique opportunity to apply both absolute and relative dating methods to records from both drill sites. To align ice-core and terrestrial records, several proxies reflecting independent processes, such as lake productivity and catchment processes, are used in combination to enhance the fidelity of the correlations.\nThe marine isotope stack LR04 (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) covering several millions of years, provides a recognized reference for correlating marine and terrestrial records at Glacial/ Interglacial timescales (Melles et al., 2012), but is of inappropriate resolution for centennial/millennial-scale comparison. The\nstadial variability expressed in the Lake Van sedimentary proxies invites comparison with other high-resolution archives. Millennial-scale reference templates include: i) the uppermost 60 ka of the NGRIP ice cores on the GICC05 timescale (NGRIP, 2004; Steffensen et al., 2008; Svensson et al., 2008; Wolff et al., 2010) and ii) the 400 kyr-old Chinese speleothem records (Wang et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2009). Moreover, Barker et al. (2011) constructed a 800 kyr-old synthetic record of Greenland climate variability based on the thermal bipolar seesaw model (Broecker et al., 1990). They showed that millennial-timescale variability occurred in Greenland throughout the last 800 kyr and, by tying their model to the Chinese speleothem chronology, they provide a refined absolute age scale back to w400 ka. By choosing absolutely dated speleothems, Barker et al. (2011) set their model free from dependence on orbital cycles underlying the Epica Dome C timescales (EDC; Jouzel et al., 2007). The expressions of interstadials/stadials in the Lake Van record, combined with a reference record resolving millennial-scale variability, provide the opportunity to use climatostratigraphic alignment to date the complete w600 kyr-old record of Lake Van. Additionally, the comprehensive catalog of dated volcanic events in eastern Anatolia back to 400 ka (w40 recognized fallout and pyroclastic flows; Sumita and Schmincke, 2013a,b,c) hold the promise of the Lake Van record becoming one of the most precise tephrostratigraphic chronologies, cross-validated using geochemical fingerprinting.\nAnother method to date the Lake Van sediment is based on the paleomagnetic record of relative paleointensity (RPI) variations (Vigliotti et al., 2014). Matching these data with reference templates (i.e. stacked PISO-1500 record; Channell et al., 2009) provides robust stratigraphic tie-points, especially considering that the RPI is a global geophysical (geomagnetic) signal devoid of environmental influences. A prominent RPI minimum associated with the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion, accompanied by natural remanant magnetization (NRM) directions with negative inclinations representing the directional expression of the excursion, provides an especially useful chronostratigraphic marker. The Laschamp geomagnetic excursion is well-dated radiometrically (41.3 0.6 ka BP, Laj et al., 2014; 40.70 0.95 ka BP, Singer et al., 2009), by astrochronology (w41 ka BP, Laj and Channell, 2007) and consistent with the pronounced peak in 10Be flux associated with the Laschamp event found in the NGRIP (GICC05 age of Laschampmagnetic event: 41.2 1.6 ka BP, Svensson et al., 2008). It demarcates the center of DaansgaardeOeschger event 10 (GIS-10) in Greenland isotope record (NGRIP), which is also identified in terrestrial counterparts (e.g. Hulu Cave in China, Wang et al., 2001), so that the identification of the Laschamp event provides a relative timemarker, which links to ice-core stratigraphies (fromGreenland and Antartica), speleothem and paleomagnetostratigraphic records (e.g., Austin and Hibbert, 2010).\nTo sum up, this contribution compiles a range of relative and absolute age constraints produced by several independent methods in order to overcome the limitations and shortcomings of each single method and to establish one common chronology for the w600 kyr-old Lake Van record. A robust and precise age model is an essential prerequisite for understanding the climate response to external forcing, for comparison of different records and data synthesis, and for resolving the successions and consequences of climate changes. Moreover, its outcome might help to improve calibration standards for other dating techniques (e.g., AMS-14C, 40Ar/39Ar, UraniumeThorium dating of autochthonous carbonate, optical stimulated luminescence and thermoluminescence)."

The lacustrine clayey silt group consists of eight lithologies, each reflecting different lake states along with one group (graded beds, Lg) reflecting regional events (Stockhecke et al., 2014). The event-corrected composite records of 166 m from AR, and 79 m from NB, represent only the lacustrine clayey silt without the event layers. The event-corrected records of both sites are used to construct the age model. Marker layers from the correlation of the two drill sites (Stockhecke et al., 2014) are taken to transpose ages between the drill sites."

Instead of using one continuous but orbital-dependent EDC-timescale of lower resolution over the w600 ka, we integrated three reference records, each with a resolution matching that of the Lake Van profile in the respective interval. This procedure involves two discontinuities at 116 ka and at 400 ka in order to link to the Lake Van record to the highestresolved and absolutely-dated time reference templates. The absolute ages facilitate comparison with, for instance, discontinuous speleothem records from other regional archives such as Sofular cave (Fleitmann et al., 2009) or Soreq cave (Bar-Matthews et al., 1999)."

    "heading": "2.4. Alignment of proxy data",
    "text": "The climate-sensitivity of the proxy records is reflected in their resemblance to Greenland temperature variability (Fig. 1). The NGRIP d18O stratotype is apparently replicated in records from Lake Van. The temperature variations over Greenland are probably transmitted to Lake Van by atmospheric circulation changes controlling precipitation and the net water budget. High lake levels\nare apparent in warm interstadials/interglacials and low lake levels for the cold stadials/glacials (Stockhecke et al., 2014). This pattern is reflected in TOC-rich brown laminated (TOC-poor gray bioturbated or banded) sediment (Stockhecke et al., 2014) containing high (low) Ca/K intensities (Stockhecke et al., 2014; Kwiecien et al., 2014; Ça gatay et al., 2014). Because the interstadial onsets are reported as a consistent universal pattern (Wang et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2009; Deplazes et al., 2013) and can be clearly identified as increases in TOC/b* and Ca/K, only the onsets were aligned to the interstadial onsets of the NGRIP d18O record. The number of events identified is comparable to the peaks of the lower-resolution AP record, supporting synchronicity between internal lake responses and the vegetation dynamics and providing a mechanistic link for decreased input of detrital material (Ca/K) during warmer intervals when vegetation was thriving. Lead/lags between the proxy records are difficult to assess due to their differing resolutions, but the AP increase generally seems to lag behind the TOC increase. The minimal tuning approach incorporates the assumption of regular sediment accumulation rates between the age control points. For the intervals showing increased frequency of event deposits\nLithostratigraphy (key in Fig. 4) and age/depth model for Lake Van NB event corrected raphic ages (Sumita and Schmincke, 2013c), and age control points derived from the e/depth model for NB composite record (mcblf).

The three lowermost ages could not be transferred unambiguously to the AR record because event deposits are intercalated with banded sediments, which are difficult to correlate between cores.

The lowermost available 14C age (for NB) are in the interval where we tune our record to the NGRIP d18O record.

To a first approximation, the normalized NRM record represents an estimate of the relative paleointensity (RPI) of the Earth’s magnetic field (Vigliotti et al., 2014). A case can be made that the RPI record is a global signal at millennial (but probably not at centennial) timescales, and therefore provides a valuable means of correlation using the calibrated RPI template known as PISO-1500 (Channell et al., 2009). RPI minima were identified in the AR record and a comparison with PISO-1500 reference template (Table 1). Some of the RPI minima in the AR record (label a in\no-climate records. A.

Ll: laminated, Lf: faint laminated, Lmo: mottled, Lb: banded, ent lithotypes.\nFig. 4) correspond to the geomagnetic excursions within the Brunhes chron (Laj and Channell, 2007). Apart from the apparent identification of the Laschamp (Table 1; Vigliotti et al., 2014) the directional excursions associated with the RPI minima are not identified at Lake Van. Directional excursions are known to be brief (often <1 ka) events that are short relative to the RPI minima in which they are found. For this reason, the directional excursions are often not recorded in sedimentary sections in which the RPI fluctuations are well defined. This is apparently the case in the sediments of Lake Van where the fidelity and resolution of the paleomagnetic directional record is insufficient to record the excursions, but sufficient to yield acceptable RPI records."

This interval is mostly included in the depth (20.06e21.6 mcblf) where the Laschamp event was identified as a low in the RPI record. Moreover the 10Be peaks are coincident with the paleomagnetic directions indicating an almost full directional change for the magnetic field. The 10Be signal shows the expected increase in the flux of this radioisotope to the sediment by about a factor of two. Thus both, width and dynamics of the 10Be signal support the proposed alignment to the NGRIP record."

The sequences covering MIS 1 and 3 are well-constrained. MIS 2 is dated by 14C ages, but the similarity between the banded sediment and the frequently intercalating event deposits limited the establishment of an event corrected depth scale and consequently led to overestimations of sedimentation rates (non-linearity; Stockhecke et al., 2014).

The age control points are given in Table 3. Ages are given in thousands of years before present (ka BP), where 0 BP is defined as 1950 AD. Marine isotope stage (MIS) boundaries follow Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) and the nomenclature of the substages follows Jouzel et al. (2007). Generally, the ages agree and\nreveal a linear sediment accumulation with time. The climatostratigraphic alignment between the proxy records and ice-core stratigraphy provided the best coverage on age control. The age model was constructed using the 49 tuning-based age control points, the four ages fromvarve chronology and three calibrated 14C ages (total 56, red line, Fig. 3A).\nThe age model of the 1st climate cycle (Fig. 1A) is based on tuning, varve chronology and 14C ages. It is very well constrained and broadly supported by three 40Ar/39Ar ages (differences are between 0.4 and 1.4 kyr) and identified RPI minima, including the Laschamp excursion (Fig. 4D). The latter include an interval with reverse polarity constrained by the age model from 38.8 to 43.0 ka BP (Table 1, Vigliotti et al., 2014), within <1 ka of the generally accepted age for this magnetic excursion (41.3 0.6 ka BP, Laj et al., 2014; 40.70 0.95 ka BP; Singer et al., 2009). With the presented age model the 10Be during this excursion shows maximum fluxes for a time range between 38.1 and 40.3 ka\n(Table 1). An error of about 1.6 ka is given for the onset of DO 10 of the GICC05 age model (Table 2, Blockley et al., 2012). The tuned age model and independent dating are thus in good agreement. Sediment accumulation changes are documented by MAR variations from 0.01 to 0.03 g cm 2 a 1 (Fig. 3C) over the last 130 kyr. The Holocene, MIS 3 and MIS 5 have similar MARs, while MIS 2 has MARs twofold higher rates. During the full development of MIS 5, the MAR increases slightly. Both trends, the higher MARs of MIS 2 and MIS 4 are in line with the expectation of increased total mass accumulation during cold conditions because of increased eolian input and erosion from open vegetation within the catchment.\nThe tuned agemodel of the 2nd last climate cycle is supported by two RPI minima (associated with known magnetic excursions) and by four 40Ar/39Ar ages. Alignment to the absolutely-dated reference templates and 40Ar/39Ar dating resulted in an acceptable consistency between 6 and 17 ka. The MARs are slightly higher during the 2nd climate cycle as compared to the 1st one, although lithologies are generally similar.\nThe age model of the 3rd climate cycle is confirmed by a very good match with one 40Ar/39Ar age, and one identified minima in the RPI record. The linear sedimentation rates (LSR) of MIS8 are partly extrapolated (red dashed lines Fig. 3A) on account of a supposed gap, which is estimated to lastw17 kyr (260e277 ka BP) and is related to the deposition of w10 m-thick volcaniclastic material (V-206), which probably eroded some of the background sediment. Obviously, LSRs and MARs within the extrapolated cannot be adequately estimated. Nevertheless, the deptheage relationship of the 3rd glacial cycle inflects that of the 2nd one and, accordingly, LSR decrease from 0.3 to 0.1 mm a 1. One explanation is that each of the event layers in this interval, eroded the underlying sediments.\nA good match between the lithology, TOC, Ca/K and AP pollen and the GLT-syn record allow to assign the sediments from the upper boundary of the Deformed Unit (DU) to MIS11, i.e., to the 4th climate cycle, although the onset of MIS11 is stratigraphically disturbed (see detail in Stockhecke et al., 2014). The upper and lower boundary of the DU are dated (by extrapolation of sedimentation rates), but ages between 413 and 480 ka can not be interpolated (Table 3) as this interval lacks independent age constraints. However, lithological changes are characterized by generally lower MARs compared to those of the 1st and 2nd climate cycle.\nThe robustness of the age for the undisturbed part of the 5th and 6th climate cycle is confirmed by one 40Ar/39Ar age. Note that the different sedimentological regime and the low resolution of the proxy data increase the likelihood of an erroneous match between the proxy records and the synthetic ice-core chronology. However, the observed change in MARs is anticipated: It reflects the change from freshwater conditions with depositions of diatomaceous mud to the present-day soda and alkaline water conditions with depositions of carbonaceous clayey silt (Stockhecke et al., 2014)."

    "text": "The compilation of the ages derived by different methods confirms that the record covers six Glacial/Interglacial cycles. The alignment of the proxy records to the Greenland stadials/interstadial on the GICC05 timescale results in a millennial-scale resolved synchronization. The presented chronology is based on GICC05/ GICC05modeltext from 0 to 116 ka BP, the absolutely-dated and precise timescale of the Chinese speleothem records from 116 to 400 ka, and the EDC timescale from Antarctica ice cores for 400 to 600 ka. Seven geomagnetic tie points (from 39 to 259 ka), based on minima in the RPI record, and nine 40Ar/39Ar ages confirm the age model. However, uncertainties increase with depth as tectonic activity affected the drill site and the sedimentary regime was completely different during the early evolution of Lake Van.\nExcluding two major gaps, the 166-m-long event corrected AR record reflects continuous sedimentation over the last w600 kyr.\nThe NB record contains several unconformities in the lowermost part, and the thicker and more frequent event deposits. Thus, the age model is less well constrained than the AR site and the record covers w90 kyr. Geochemical fingerprinting of the volcaniclastic layers will allow the chronology to be improved by tephrostratigraphy. We conclude that the AR age model enables the investigation of annual- to centennial climate variability of the Holocene, centennial- to millennial scale of the Last Glacial/Interglacial cycle, andmulti-millennial variability for the 2nd to 6th last climate cycles. The NB age model serves to date event deposits precisely and to establish an event catalog within a context of millennial scale climate change. The widely supported chronology of the AR record, based on a variety of independent methods, facilitates reconstructions and modeling of Quaternary climate evolution in the Near East over the past w600 kyr. Moreover, the chronostratigraphy for the last 250 kyr provides a useful reference to test and improve other dating methods."

  "abstractText": "Lake Van sediment cores from the Ahlat Ridge and Northern Basin drill sites of the ICDP project PALEOVAN contain a wealth of information about past environmental processes. The sedimentary sequence was dated using climatostratigraphic alignment, varve chronology, tephrostratigraphy, argoneargon single-crystal dating, radiocarbon dating, magnetostratigraphy, and cosmogenic nuclides. Based on the lithostratigraphic framework, the different age constraints are compiled and a robust and precise chronology of the 600,000 year-old Lake Van record is constructed. Proxy records of total organic carbon content and sediment color, together with the calcium/potassium-ratios and arboreal pollen percentages of the 166-m-long eventcorrected Ahlat Ridge record, mimic the Greenland isotope stratotype (NGRIP). Therefore, the proxy records are systematically aligned to the onsets of interstadials reflected in theNGRIP and synthesizedGreenland icecore stratigraphy. The chronology is constructed using 49 age control points derived from visual synchronizationwith the Greenland ice-core stratigraphy using the GICC05 timescale, an absolutely-dated speleothem timescale (e.g., Hulu, Sanbao, Linzhu cave) and the EpicaDomeC timescale. In addition, the uppermost part of the sequence is complemented with four ages from Holocene varve chronology and three calibrated radiocarbonages. Furthermore,nineargoneargonagesandacomparisonof the relativepaleointensityrecordof the magnetic field with reference curve PISO-1500 confirm the accuracy of the agemodel. Also the identification of the Laschamp event via measurements of 10Be in the sediment confirms the presented age model. The chronology of the Ahlat Ridge record is transferred to the 79-m-long event-corrected composite record from theNorthern Basin and supplemented by additional radiocarbon dating on organicmarco-remains. The basal age of the Northern Basin record is estimated at w90 ka. The variations of the time series of total organic carbon content, the Ca/K ratio, and the arboreal pollen percentages illustrate that the presented chronology links ice-marine-terrestrial stratigraphies and that the paleoclimate data are suited for reconstructions and modeling of the Quaternary and Pleistocene climate evolution in the Near East at millennial timescales. Furthermore, the chronology of the last 250 ka can be used to test other dating techniques. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
