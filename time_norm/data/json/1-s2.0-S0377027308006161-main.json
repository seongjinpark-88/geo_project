This review summarises research undertaken during the past decade and provides a new summary of the distribution of rhyolitic glaciovolcanic rocks erupted during the past 0.8 Ma. Descriptions of effusion-dominated edifices focus on the two best-studied edifices— the c.0.6 km3 and 570 m high Prestahnúkur edifice and the smaller-volume (b0.1 km3) drape of Bláhnúkur. Both show little or no evidence of magmatic fragmentation (i.e. driven by volatile exsolution), but both show abundant evidence of quench fragmentation and meltback of ice walls. A particular feature of Prestahnúkur is its sheet-like lava bodies which are interpreted as sills that intruded the ice–edifice interface. Rhyolitic tuyas are products of sustained eruptions into thick ice, and form distinctive steep-sided edifices with flat or broad dome-like tops. They are 300–700 m high with volumes up to 2 km3 (though 0.5–1.0 km3 is more typical). Initial vigorous phreatomagmatic eruptions within well-drained ice vaults build steep-sided piles of tephra confined by ice walls. Gradual upwards increases in inflated clasts point to the decreasing involvement of meltwater and the increasing ability of the magma to vesiculate. As the eruption progresses and terminates, non-explosive degassing produces lava caps up to 300 m thick. Öræfajökull is a stratovolcano illustrating complex volcano–ice interactions generated when rhyolitic lavas erupt onto steeper slopes and encounter ice of variable thickness and properties (e.g. fracturing). Eruptive units record dramatic ice thickness fluctuations of up to 500 m in valley glaciers between eruptions, which emphasises that useful palaeoenvironmental information can be gleaned from detailed studies of volcano– ice interactions. Considerable value is added when palaeoenvironmental information is combined with Ar–Ar dating. For example Ar–Ar dating of two rhyolitic tuyas at Torfajökull reveal that they erupted prior to the last glacial maximum when temperatures were at least 4 °C cooler than the present day. Ar–Ar dating of Prestahnúkur suggests it erupted during the last interglacial–glacial transition into over 700 m of ice, which corroborates studies arguing for rapid accumulation of land-based ice during global cooling.\n© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "About 10% of the Icelandic crust is estimated to be rhyolitic (Sæmundsson, 1979; Jónasson, 2007). Its abundant rhyolitic volcanism and high latitude means that Iceland contains many rhyolite edifices that were produced during volcano–ice interactions (i.e. glaciovolcanism). No other volcanic province contains such an abundance and diversity of rhyolitic glaciovolcanic rocks. Apart from one early study by Furnes et al. (1980), detailed studies of rhyolitic glaciovolcanism have only taken place in the past decade. The number of papers dealing specifically with Icelandic rhyolitic glaciovolcanism is currently less than twenty. Consequently a chief aim of this review is to summarise this recent work to provide a context and direction for future research.\nll rights reserved.\nAnother chief aim of this review is to document known and suspected occurrences of rhyolitic glaciovolcanism during the past 0.8 Ma (the Bruhnes magnetic epoch). Sæmundsson (1979) and other workers (e.g. Jónasson, 2007) consider this a useful boundary as it defines Iceland's active volcanic zones. Table 1 lists the known occurrences and comments on them. The number of ‘uncertain’ entries in Table 1 emphasises that many occurrences await detailed examination. Using Table 1 and information from published geological and topographic maps (see caption) the total volume of exposed and suspected subglacial rhyolite is estimated and suggests that at least 350km3has been erupted during the past 0.8Ma. One volcanic system – Torfajökull – is responsible for over one third of this volume (McGarvie, 1985). Three of the occurrences onTable 1 are discussed in further detail to illustrate key aspects of Icelandic rhyolitic glaciovolcanism.\nThree main types of rhyolitic glaciovolcanic edifice are known to occur in Iceland-effusion-dominated edifices, tuyas, and stratovolcanoes (Tuffen et al., 2001, 2002a; Stevenson et al., 2006; McGarvie\net al., 2007). Examples of each are described, and this underpins a discussion on contributions that rhyolitic glaciovolcanism can make to providing useful and robust palaeoenvironmental information through combining Ar–Ar dates with physical evidence of minimum ice thicknesses during eruptions (McGarvie et al., 2006, 2007). The possibility that explosive caldera-forming rhyolitic eruptions occurred beneath ice sheets is also considered, as the origins of larger rhyolite-erupting ring structures (up to 14 km in diameter and 750 m high) beneath three ice caps are not known (e.g. Björnsson, 1988; Björnsson et al., 2000). Given suitable atmospheric conditions, such large eruptions may have left distinct marker horizons in western Europe that would assist with reconstruction of human migrations (see Gamble et al., 2004, 2005).\nFinally, this review is restricted to rhyolites (minimum 69 wt.% SiO2) even though minor volumes of intermediate glaciovolcanic rocks occur (i.e. basaltic andesite to dacite) (Grönvold, 1972;\nStevenson, 2005). There are two reasons underpinning this restriction: firstly that the products of intermediate glaciovolcanism appear to have closer affinities to basaltic than to rhyolitic compositions (Stevenson, 2005; Stevenson et al., 2009-this issue); and secondly that there is a clear petrological difference between Icelandic rhyolites that plot close to the thermal minimum in the ‘granite’ system, and Icelandic dacitic–andesitic and trachyte compositions that plot towards higher temperatures in the plagioclase field (Lacasse and Garbe-Schönberg, 2001; Jónasson, 2007)."

    "heading": "2. Icelandic rhyolites and central volcanoes",
    "text": "Icelandic central volcanoes are characterised by high lava production, the presence of silicic rocks (mainly rhyolites), and hightemperature geothermal fields, and some have one or more calderas (Sæmundsson, 1974, 1979).\nThe vast majority of rhyolites in Iceland erupt at central volcanoes, which occur above regions of high magma supply in crust up to 40 km thick which provides extended opportunities for processing of trapped mafic melts, and re-melting of crust and previously-injected intrusions (e.g. Sæmundsson, 1979; Jónasson, 2007). The incorporation of meteoric waters (via active hydrothermal circulation) alters crust that may subsequently be heated and/or partially melted (Jónasson, 2007). In addition, elevated crustal temperatures at central volcanoes (due to a relatively high rate of magma supply and its subsequent storage — Sæmundsson, 1979) enhances the longevity of partly-crystalline mushes. These are becoming the popular sources for the near-solid state production of many Icelandic rhyolites because they neatly explain petrological characteristics such as their typically aphyric to crystal-poor character (see Gunnarsson et al., 1998; Marsh, 2002; Jónasson, 2007; Flude et al., 2008).\nThe co-existence of both mafic and silicic magmas at central volcanoes is demonstrated by the common occurrence of mafic inclusions within rhyolite eruptives (e.g. Walker, 1966; Sigurðsson, 1970; McGarvie, 1984; Gunnarsson et al., 1998; Hards et al., 2000). Although inmany instances the lowvolumeofmafic inclusions suggests a rather passive role for mafic magma, there is clear evidence of more extensive interactions with mafic magma that indicate triggering of silicic eruptions by mafic magma injections (e.g. Sparks et al., 1977). In such cases intense mechanical mixing of the end-member magmas can lead to the production of hybrid magmas. No detailed work has been done on what temperature increases rhyolitic magmas may experience during interactions with mafic magmas, although unusually thin subaerial rhyolite flows (~5 m, McGarvie et al., 1990) suggest that – on some occasions – rhyolite viscosities are reduced. This may have implications for rhyolitic glaciovolcanism, as rhyolites erupted athigherthan-normal temperatures will have the potential to melt greater volumes of ice (see Höskuldsson and Sparks, 1997).\nNot all central volcanoes are the same, and two important distinctions need to be made. Firstly, that central volcanoes within the active rift zones – which represent the approximate trace of the spreading ridge through Iceland – erupt basalts that are tholeiitic in composition (both olivine and quartz normative types occur), whereas the central volcanoes in the flank zones – where active rifting is much less – erupt basalts that are mildly alkalic to alkaline (Jakobsson, 1979). Rhyolitic compositions erupted at a central volcano strongly parallel the compositions of the basalts that erupt there, so low-alkali rhyolites are erupted at rift zone central volcanoes where the co-existing basalts are tholeiitic (e.g. Jónasson, 1994), whereas flank zone central volcanoes erupt alkalic rhyolites (which occasionally reach strongly-peralkaline compositions — i.e. pantellerites) in conjunction with mildly-alkaline and alkali basalts (Sigurðsson, 1970; Prestvik, 1982; Macdonald et al., 1990; Flude et al., 2008). Secondly, that the central volcanoes of the flank zones are considered ‘overdeveloped’ in comparison to their rift zone counterparts, as they erupt a higher proportion of rhyolite (Sæmundsson, 1979). It is notable that the largest explosive eruptions in historic time (the last c.1100 years) have occurred from the flank zone central volcanoes of Hekla and Öræfajökull (Thorarinsson, 1958), with even larger prehistoric eruptions occurring from the flank zone central volcanoes of Mýrdalsjökull (Lacasse et al., 2007) Tindfjallajökull (Jorgensen, 1980), and Torfajökull (McGarvie et al., 2006). No identified eruptions of comparable magnitude are known from rift zone central volcanoes, although Lacasse and Garbe-Schönberg (2001) note that 26 of 53 major silicic explosive eruptions on Iceland and Jan Mayen in the last 6 Ma came from tholeiitic volcanoes in the rift zones. The possibility therefore exists that large ice-covered ring structures presently buried beneath ice caps may have been the sites of large explosive eruptions (discussed in Section 7.2).\nMost Icelandic rhyolite eruptions have volumes less than 1 km3 (Walker, 1966). The largest suspected event is the ring-fracture rhyolite eruption at Torfajökull (McGarvie, 1984; McGarvie et al.,\n2006) which is c.18 km3 DRE. The largest historic rhyolite eruption is the 1362 AD explosive eruption of Öræfajökull which is estimated as 2 km3 DRE (Thorarinsson, 1958; Selbekk and Tronnes, 2007). Whilst basaltic tuyas may have volumes of up to N10 km3, the largest rhyolite tuyas are an order of magnitude smaller (Guðmundsson, 2005), with the largest (Laufafell, at Torfajökull) only c.2 km3 (McGarvie, 1985)."

    "heading": "3.1. Askja (rift zone — As label)",
    "text": "Askja (location on Fig. 1) is notable as it contains the greatest volume of exposed glaciovolcanic basalt of any rift zone central volcano (Sigvaldason,1968; Brown et al., 1991), and yet despite its size and high productivity (Sigvaldason et al., 1992) its few examples of rhyolitic glaciovolcanism are either minor or have been removed/ obscured (Sigvaldason, 2002). There are currently no permanent ice fields at Askja.\nAskja is the best-exposed caldera complex in the rift zones, with a main c.8–9 km diameter caldera within which is nested a smaller c.3– 4 km diameter water-filled caldera formed during the 1875 AD rhyolite–basalt eruption (Sigvaldason, 1979; Sigurðsson and Sparks, 1981). The origins of the main caldera are not known but truncated subaerial basalt flows suggest that it probably formed during the early Holocene (Sigvaldason et al., 1992). However it may have formed incrementally over a prolonged period involving a number of eruptions, as Sigvaldason (2002) considers that the c.10 ka rhyolitic Plinian eruption contributed to the creation of a small embayment in the south-east sector, whilst Brown et al. (1991) suggested that some of the main caldera walls are partly constructional features created during basaltic glaciovolcanic eruptions. The 1875 AD caldera was not formed wholly in response to evacuation of rhyolitic magma, as Sigurðsson and Sparks (1981) noted that the caldera volume is greater than the volume of erupted rhyolite. Instead, withdrawal of mafic magma from beneath Askja via laterally-propagating dykes into the fissure swarm to the north (where some erupted) was the main contributor to caldera collapse (Sigurðsson and Sparks, 1978). There are two enigmatic features of Askja in relation to rhyolitic volcanism. Firstly that the proportion of rhyolite at Askja is considerably less than that erupted at the rift zone central volcanoes of Krafla and Kerlingarfjöll. Secondly that whilst there have been at least three Holocene rhyolitic eruptions (i.e. the Plinian phases of the 1875 AD and the c.10 ka eruptions with total volume b1.3 km3 DRE, and a small Holocene rhyolitic flow (heavily contaminated with mafic inclusions) north of the main caldera [McGarvie, unpublished chemistry and field observations]), there appears to have been no rhyolitic eruptions during recent glacial periods. A possible exception is the small rhyolitic dome of unknown provenance listed in Table 1. This is somewhat perplexing given that Askja contains the greatest volume of basaltic hyaloclastite of any exposed rift zone central volcano, indicating extensive volcanic activity during glacial periods. However this may simply indicate that rhyolitic melt production is suppressed during periods of sustained basaltic volcanism, as suggested by Guðmundsson and Högnadóttir (2007)."

    "heading": "3.2. Hágöngur (rift zone — Hag label)",
    "text": "Hágöngur (see Fig. 1 for location) is an example of rhyolitedominated glaciovolcanism in an area where (according to\nGuðmundsson and Högnadóttir, 2007) a new central volcano may have started developing, and where there is currently no permanent ice. No detailed glaciovolcanic fieldwork has been done.\nThe main edifices in this area of scattered rhyolitic exposures are two steep-sided rhyolite domes of unknown age, each c.1.5 km in diameter with one rising c.500 m and the other c.400 m above their surroundings. The absence of any nearby topography of similar or greater elevation argues strongly against their formation in a subaqueous (lacustrine) environment. They are most likely to have formed in ice-walled vaults within an ice sheet that was at least 550m thick at the time of eruption. Although they have only been given a cursory examination, the presence of capping lavas along with other lava bodies and intrusions (McGarvie, unpublished field observations) suggests that they may be either effusion-dominated edifices or rhyolitic tuyas (see next section). The Hágöngur rhyolites have been linked to the Vonarskarð rhyolites by Guðmundsson and Högnadóttir (2007), who suggest that they may be two separate central volcanoes belonging to one volcanic system. From a glaciovolcanic perspective, obtaining Ar–Ar dates of the edifices would provide valuable information on minimum ice sheet thickness at the time of eruption (see Section 7.1). In contrast to Askja (see above) which is considered to be an evolved and mature rift zone central volcano dominated by basaltic glaciovolcanism, at the putative Hágöngur central volcano rhyolitic glaciovolcanism has been dominant."

    "heading": "3.3. Ljósufjöll (flank zone — Ljos label)",
    "text": "Ljósufjöll illustrates two well-known glaciovolcanic problems — establishing how many eruptions have taken place, and establishing stratigraphy. How these were solved is described later. There are only small patches of permanent ice at Ljósufjöll. Fig. 1 gives location.\nLjósufjöll is the easternmost of three rhyolite-producing central volcanoes in the Snæfellsnes flank zone in western Iceland (Harðarson, 1993), and as well as containing the largest exposed volume of silicic rocks in this flank zone it has also erupted rare\nexamples of Icelandic trachyte (Sigurðsson, 1970). Nevertheless, the total volume of exposed rhyolite is less than c.2 km3 (Flude, 2006). Topographically, the central volcano occupies the high ground of a broad linear ridge striking WNW–ESE, which rises to a maximum of 1063 m. As it lies on the narrow Snæfellsnes peninsula, the sea is only 5 km away. The rhyolitic edifices consist of conical peaks up to 350 m high and linear ridges up to 100 m high (see Fig. 2), but all edifices are extensively scree-covered with very few solid exposures, and so prima facie evidence for glaciovolcanic eruptive environments (e.g. steeply-dipping surfaces laced with columns) does not exist. However the pronounced vertical development of the larger edifices argues for growth promoted by ice confinement, whilst the narrowness of the linear ridges also argues for ice-related confinement during their eruption, whichmay have beenwithin a subglacial tunnel (i.e. esker-like) or when a dyke breached the bedrock–ice interface.\nTo establish how many eruptions had taken place Flude et al. (2008) used a known characteristic of Icelandic rhyolites (McGarvie, 1985; Macdonald et al., 1990), where each individual eruptive unit has its own distinctive trace element geochemical signature. Using this methodology thirteen different silicic units were identified, with six being rhyolitic and seven being trachytic. To establish a stratigraphic framework Flude et al. (2008) used Ar–Ar dating, which gave apparent ages of c.650–680 ka on two rhyolitic units peripheral to the main mass of silicic rock, and apparent ages younger than c.200 ka on four rhyolitic units that comprise part of the main silicic outcrop. Because of unusually high analytical uncertainties (due to inherited Ar from xenocrystic material, extraneous Ar, and low radiogenic Ar in the samples), Flude et al. (2008) urge caution in regarding these ages as true eruption ages, but argue that discussion of age ranges is acceptable. On this basis it seems that eruption of rhyolitic compositions has become more focused with time, and coincidentally it is these younger units (b200 ka) that form the steep-sided conical mounds and linear ridges that provide the best-available candidates for rhyolitic glaciovolcanism at Ljósufjöll.\n4. Effusion-dominated rhyolitic edifices\nOnly two such edifices have been studied in detail— Prestahnúkur and Bláhnúkur. Both show abundant evidence of quench fragmentation when effusing rhyolite interacted with ice/water, and both show little or no evidence for explosive (i.e. volatile-driven) fragmentation. Whilst a new tuya-like edifice c.570 m high was constructed at Prestahnúkur (McGarvie et al., 2007) during a sustained and substantial eruption (0.6 km3 DRE), Bláhnúkur only formed a drape over the upper flanks and summit of a pre-existing mountain during a small-volume (b0.1 km3 DRE) eruption (Tuffen et al., 2001). Locations are given on Fig. 1."
  }, {
    "heading": "4.1. Prestahnúkur",
    "text": "This c.570m high edifice (Fig. 3) has a basal diameter of 2.0–2.5 km with the longer axis oriented SSW–NNE which is broadly parallel to the regional tectonic trend in this area (e.g. Sinton et al., 2005). Two main lithofacies are dominant — a basal pedestal and lava sheets (McGarvie et al., 2007). The basal pedestal consists of a c.300 m thick pile of highly perlitised lobe-bearing breccias, which consist of shattered but coherent glassy lava lobes with carapaces of coarse and moderate- to micro-vesicular, pale grey and flow-banded blocks which often show prismatic jointing and jigsaw fit. These lobe-bearing breccias closely resemble the lobe-hyaloclastite complexes of silicic subaqueous eruptions (e.g. DeRita et al., 2001; Goto and Tsuchiya, 2004; Stewart and McPhie, 2006), and this is corroborated by their hyaloclastite block sizes being smaller than those of subaerial rhyolite lavas (Anderson et al., 1998). Consequently, McGarvie et al. (2007) proposed that external water was present throughout the eruption of the basal pedestal (though not as a water-filled subglacial vault), and argued that this was likely to be derived from the melting of an overlying ice sheet. This argument is strengthened by features of the overlying lava sheets.\nThe lava sheets at Prestahnúkur are unusual for such high-silica rhyolite (average SiO2 is 76.93 wt.%; McGarvie et al., 2007) because they are relatively thin (5–60 m with most between 10 m and 20 m thick), and also because they form sheet-like bodies rather than steepsided domes/coulees (see Fig. 3). Sheet bases reveal extensive\nFig. 3. Prestahnúkur from the South: 1 — upper tier; 2 — southern tier; 3 — lower tier; 4 — sl sheet; V — vents. A glacial trim-line is visible on the lower left of the edifice (T).\ninteractions with a wet substrate which produced matrix-supported breccias up to 12 m thick (Fig. 4a). These breccias grade from unfractured lava downwards into a zone of slightly-fractured lava (jigsawfit— see Fig. 4b),which progresses into a highly-fractured zone close to the substrate where clast-rotated domains dominate. These features were interpreted by McGarvie et al. (2007) as indicating flow of lava over wet substrate resulting in quench fragmentation of the flow base. The most extensive quenching occurred at the interface between the flow base and the moist substrate, and this is where explosive mixing was most energetic resulting in comminution and back injection of small lava clasts and of ash derived from fragmentation of microvesicular blocks in the substrate.\nAlthough sheet tops are poorly exposed because of till cover and/ or erosion, exposures reveal a consistent pattern of massive lava grading upwards into carapaces comprising microvesicular pumice breccias (Fig. 4c). These are different from subaerial microvesicular pumice flow tops (e.g. Fink et al., 1992), because of their greater thicknesses (of up to 30 m, although b10 m is more typical) and also because of their smaller block sizes of 3–20 cm when compared to typical dimensions of 20–30 cm for subaerial flows (Anderson et al., 1998). There is a broad similarity between the thick carapaces of these sheets and the thick hyaloclastite carapaces of silicic sills described by Hunns and McPhie (1999) and Orth and McPhie (2003), which strongly suggests that the tops of the Prestahnúkur sheets were wetted from above. This is corroborated by the frequent occurrence of small and extensive columnar jointing within the massive lava of the upper regions of sheets where the overlying hyaloclastite carapaces have been removed (McGarvie et al., 2007).\nField evidence points to the presence of water both in the substrate over which the sheets flow and the ingress of water into the upper regions of sheets. This led McGarvie et al. (2007) to suggest that these sheets are intrusive features — essentially sills that exploited the interface between the growing edifice and the overlying ice. At this interface meltback of the enveloping ice would be enhanced as heat escaped from the cooling volcanic pile, plus this interface is likely to have been a favoured pathway for meltwater escape.\nTwo further features of Prestahnúkur are noteworthy. Firstly that no evidence was found suggesting that any of the volcanic products had erupted in subaerial conditions, which implies that the edifice\nope—draping sheets; 5 — hyaloclastite carapace (see Fig. 5a); 6 — single sub-horizontal\nwas erupted entirely within a thick ice sheet which McGarvie et al. (2007) estimated must have been at least 700 m thick. And secondly, although the original volatile content of the Prestahnúkur magma is not known, there is abundant evidence of modest volatile escape (e.g. microvesicular pumices) but only a few instances of explosive volatile escape (pumice–ash breccias described in McGarvie et al., 2007).\nThe various strands of corroborating evidence suggest that Prestahnúkur represents a sustained and substantial (by Icelandic standards) rhyolitic effusive eruption into a thick ice sheet. This is also the first description of a substantial effusion-dominated rhyolitic edifice."

    "heading": "4.2. Bláhnúkur",
    "text": "Bláhnúkur (located within Torfajökull — see Fig. 1) has the distinction of being the first Icelandic rhyolitic glaciovolcanic edifice to be studied using a modern volcanological approach (Tuffen et al., 2001, 2002a). The roughly pyramidal edifice rises c.350 m above surrounding terrain, with the eruption volume estimated to be b0.1 km3 (DRE). The eruption produced a veneer of material up to 50m thick that drapes the summit and slopes of a pre-existing mountain (Fig. 5a). The main eruptive products comprise numerous conical-irregular lava lobes (mostly 5–10 m high) associated with poorly-sorted breccias and an ash-grade matrix. Tuffen et al. (2001) argued that the predominantly blocky morphologies of ash shards indicates that quenching was the dominant fragmentation mechanism. Although vesicularities of up to 40% do occur and indicate release of magmatic volatiles, the absence of bubble-wall shards suggests that volatile escape was gentle rather than violent. Tuffen et al. (2001) therefore concluded that the eruption was effusive, and that the substantial volume of fragmental material can be satisfactorily explained by quenching, rapid glass contraction, and sporadic steam explosions.\nErosive channels at the base of the eruptives (which contain earlyerupted material) indicate flow of meltwater away from the eruption site, which was enhanced by the steep slopes (Tuffen et al., 2001). Continuedmeltback of the enveloping ice by heat loss (from the cooling volcanic pile) created sufficient space for unstable sectors of thevolcanic pile to collapse, flow down the edifice slopes, and be deposited on the lower slopes. Further examples of icemeltback include substantial lavas 100–200m in length and up to 20mhigh that – because their carapaces are encircled by orthogonal columnar joints – are interpreted to have flowed into ice tunnels (Tuffen et al., 2001).\nWhilst no evidence was found of subaerial features, there is abundant evidence from all stages of the eruption that water was present, which led Tuffen et al. (2001) to conclude that the eruption took place entirely within an ice sheet that was at least 400 m thick.\nOne intriguing aspect of Tuffen et al.'s (2001, 2002a) model for the eruption of Bláhnúkur concerns the anastomosing nature of the subvolcanic vent complex (see Fig. 5b). This was proposed to explain the distribution, shapes, and abundance of the conical/irregular lava lobes. However this model has no knownparallel in either subaerial or subaqueous rhyolitic volcanism, and so it could be a unique and diagnostic feature of this type of eruption (effusive, thick ice, draping a steep-sided pre-existing mountain). This aspect requires further work, and studies on other similar edifices would help to either corroborate or refine this aspect of the Bláhnúkur model."

    "heading": "5. Rhyolitic tuyas",
    "text": "Icelandic rhyolitic tuyas develop both during fissure eruptions and during eruptions from single vents (McGarvie, 1985). They form edifices up to 700 m high with volumes up to 2 km3. Exposed rhyolitic tuyas in Iceland have smaller vertical dimensions and volumes than their basaltic counterparts, with volumes generally being an order of magnitude less (Guðmundsson, 2005). Their construction can be simplified into two phases — the first being the development of a pile\nof phreatomagmatic tephra to form a steep-sided basal pedestal up to 400 m high, and the second being the formation of a lava cap up to 300 m thick during late-stage effusion driven by non-explosive degassing (Tuffen et al., 2002b; Stevenson, 2005). Intrusions can develop within the basal pedestal at various stages of the eruption (Stevenson, 2005). Minor volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits are exposed around the low-lying fringes of some tuyas, although the timing of these in relation to the main tuya-forming event is not known (e.g. Stevenson, 2005; Tuffen et al., 2008). Finally, an important distinction between rhyolitic and basaltic tuyas is that no evidence has been found for the accumulation of substantial volumes\nof meltwater at rhyolitic tuyas, and therefore the distinctive ‘passage zone’ of many basaltic tuyas (which reflects a fossil water level — see Smellie, 2000) is absent (Tuffen et al., 2002b; Stevenson, 2005). The first-studied rhyolitic tuya from Torfajökull is now briefly described (Tuffen et al., 2002b) and then work on the better-exposed tuyas of Kerlingarfjöll is summarised."

There are indications that exposures at higher elevations contain a higher proportion of pumiceous clasts, a feature seen more clearly at Kerlingarfjöll (see Section 5.2).\nThe lava cap comprises multiple lava flows, which can be grouped into two lithofacies. The lower lithofacies (Lava A of Tuffen et al., 2002b) consists of a non-vesicular and strongly flow-banded microcrystalline lava body up to 100 m thick which is 1.5 km in length (i.e. the entire length of the tuya), of which the top 4–5 m consists of tightly flow-folded obsidian and glassy rhyolite within which occur intermittent bands of pale pumiceous obsidian (up to 40% microvesicularity). Flow banding is notably sub-horizontal at the base and becomes steep-to-vertical higher in the lava body. The upper lithofacies (Lava B of Tuffen et al., 2002b) comprises two separate lava bodies between 8 and 100 m thick, c.250 wide, and up to 750 m long comprising non-vesicular and microcrystalline rhyolite with well-developed platy fractures. Of particular note are the uppermost regions of the flows (top c.2–3 m), where steep-tovertical flow banding is prominent within glassy rhyolite which contains variable proportions of elongate vesicles up to 10 mm in length (Fig. 6b).\nEssentially, this tuya comprises a basal pedestal of ash surmounted by a two-tier lava cap. Tuffen et al. (2002b) interpreted the basal pedestal as forming during initial vigorous explosive magma–water interactions into a well-drained subglacial vault (as there was no evidence for ponded water), which was followed by effusion of two capping lavas, the lower of which was interpreted to have its lateral extent restricted by the presence of ice walls (Lava A) whilst the unrestricted uppermost lithofacies (Lava B) was emplaced in subaerial conditions within ice cauldrons open to the atmosphere (Fig. 7). A key question that could not be answered by a study of this tuya is whether\nthe overlying glacier was breached during the formation of the basal pedestal, leading to an explosive eruptive phase that may be preserved within (for example) the Greenland ice cap (e.g. Zielinski et al., 1997; Haflidason et al., 2000). Rauðfossafjöll is the first rhyolitic tuya to be studied in detail, and it provided a solid foundation for further study of the early stages of subglacial rhyolitic eruptions at Kerlingarfjöll (Stevenson, 2005)."

    "text": "This central volcano (Fig. 1 gives location) contains the largest volume of exposed rhyolite in the Icelandic rift zones. (Although Torfajökull containsmore, it lies in a flank zone.) Kerlingarfjöll forms a broad plateau some 15 km by 13 km covering an area of c.200 km2, which is constructed of subglacial basalt formations on top of which sit a number of prominent rhyolitic peaks (Fig. 8a–d) formed during subglacial eruptions (Grönvold, 1972; Stevenson, 2005). Intermediate compositions (andesites and dacites) also occur, but are volumetrically minor compares to the rhyolites (Grönvold, 1972).\nSome rhyolitic edifices have well-exposed basal pedestals (Fig. 8b, d), and these were studied with the aim of improving understanding of what happens during the earliest stages of rhyolitic tuya formation (Stevenson, 2005). The main points of this work are summarised here, full details will be published elsewhere.\nFig. 9 shows an idealised cross-section through awell-exposed and small subglacial rhyolitic edifice informally named Baby Tuya, in which various lithofacies are shown in stratigraphic order (see Table 2). Stevenson (2005) notes that this edifice has only an embryonic lava cap, but has a well-exposed underlying tephra pile. Within the tephra pile the earliest-erupted products (lithofacies A on Fig. 9) were produced during violent phreatomagmatic fragmentation with deposition taking place under moist conditions. With time there\nen et al. (2002a) the subaerial explosive phase shown in (b) is conjectural, and requires\nis a gradual change in the nature of the eruptive products towards larger grain sizes and increased vesicularity. For example the grain size distribution in lithofacies A is centered around 125 μm, which\nincreases to 1 mm in lithofacies C, but in lithofacies D much larger clasts occur withmost in the 0.5–10 cm range although outsize bombs up to 50 cm in size occur (Stevenson, 2005). Vesicularities increase upwards, and whereas grains in lithofacies A are blocky and nonvesicular to poorly-vesicular, in lithofacies D the abundant bubblewall ash shards and highly vesicular pumice clasts provide strong evidence for fragmentation driven by the exsolution and expansion of magmatic volatiles (Stevenson, 2005).\nStevenson (2005) considered that the earliest-erupted material (lithofacies A) was produced during extensive interactions between meltwater and incipiently vesicular magma (i.e. during vigorous phreatomagmatic fragmentation). As the eruption progressed there was a gradual reduction in the extent of interaction between meltwater and erupting rhyolitic magma, leading to lower degrees of phreatomagmatic fragmentation and the eruption ofmore-vesiculated rhyolite, with the last-erupted tephra (lithofacies D) being the coarsest and most vesicular of the tephra deposits and showing little evidence of interaction with meltwater. The final stage of the eruption involved non-explosive degassing of erupting lava which constructed a small lava cap (Stevenson, 2005). Textures suggesting subaerial exposure of the lava carapaces (Fink and Manley, 1987).\nSimilar features were observed at other and larger rhyolitic tuyas at Kerlingarfjöll, leading Stevenson (2005) to conclude that the model described above is generally applicable to the formation of rhyolitic tuyas. It is notable that features observed in the more poorly-exposed basal pedestal described by Tuffen et al. (2002b) agree with the more fully-developed model of Stevenson (2005)."

Of the five Icelandic volcanoes that are commonly called stratovolcanoes both in the professional and popular literature, Hekla, Öræfajökull, Snæfell, and Snæfellsjökull have all erupted rhyolite, whereas Eyjafjallajökull has not (e.g. Sæmundsson, 1979; Thordarson and Höskuldsson, 2002; Stevenson et al., 2006). On closer examination these volcanoes lack a key characteristic of classic stratovolcanoes — that of alternating layers of ash and lava (Oxford English Dictionary definition). Furthermore Icelandic stratovolcanoes (with the exception of Hekla) are constructed largely of basaltic and rhyolitic lavas that typically have shallow dips (especially in the summit regions and upper flanks), whereas the summit and upper flanks of classic stratovolcanoes are constructed of steeply-dipping (often angle-of-repose) lavas and pyroclastics of intermediate composition (i.e. basaltic andesite and andesite, with dacite). Whilst ‘composite volcano’would be a better term to describe these Icelandic edifices (e.g. Davidson and De Silva, 2000), the term stratovolcano is in common use and will be retained."

Yet from a glaciovolcanism perspective there is little of interest, largely because of the small volume of ice/snow on its upper flanks combined with the explosive nature of its rhyolitic eruptions (except one — see below).

During the Holocene, Hekla has produced more explosive eruptions of rhyolite than any other Icelandic volcano (Sverrisdóttir, 2007), typically as the first-erupted and most volatile-rich magma during a compositionally-zoned eruption that ends with venting of andesitic–basaltic andesitic magma.

    "heading": "6.2. Öræfajökull",
    "text": "Öræfajökull (location on Fig. 1) is a ~2 km high stratovolcano in south Iceland which is ice covered from c.1 km elevation upwards and has an elongate 4–5 km diameter ice-filled summit caldera containing ice up to 500 m thick (Björnsson, 1988). The summit is a rhyolitic nunatak that forms Iceland's highest point (2110 m). Its flanks are cut by c.14 valley glaciers. Thorarinsson (1958) provides detailed descriptions of the two most recent eruptions which occurred in 1727 (mafic), and in 1362 (rhyolite). No other historical eruptions are known, but part-eroded cones and lava flows with preserved rubbly flow-top breccias exist in a few places and suggest that other Holocene mafic eruptions have taken place (Thorarinsson 1958; Prestvik, 1979; Stevenson, 2005). The 1362 rhyolite eruption is considered to be wholly explosive (e.g. Selbekk and Tronnes, 2007), but the possibility exists that one or more of the rhyolitic nunataks piercing the summit icefields may have been produced during this eruption.\nThe stratovolcano was mapped by Prestvik (1979), who commented on both the abundance of rhyolitic lavas and their occurrence high in the stratigraphic succession. A number of papers arising from this mapping focused on petrological aspects (e.g. Prestvik, 1982; Prestvik et al., 2001). No detailed volcanological work had been done prior to Stevenson et al.'s (2006) paper, which showed convincingly that evidence of rhyolitic volcano–ice interactions was both abundant and complex. A feature first commented on by Thorarinsson (1958) and later by Prestvik (1979) and Stevenson et al. (2006) is the relatively shallow, characteristic dip of most lavas at Öræfajökull. This is clearly seen in Fig. 10a, and emphasises the earlier point about morphological differences between Icelandic and classic stratovolcanoes."

    "heading": "6.2.1. Vatnafjall",
    "text": "Stevenson et al. (2006) mapped Vatnafjall, which comprises the c.600m high well-exposed wall flanking the NE side of the Kvíárjökull valley glacier as well as the gentler slopes to the NE (Fig. 10b). Mapping revealed six different eruptive units, and geochemistry confirmed that four of these were silicic and were the products of three separate eruptions: the first being a suite of intrusions associated with an accumulation of rhyolitic tephra; this was overlain by a large rhyolitic lava flow; with the third and youngest unit being a trachydacite flow (which appears to be a hybrid composition that originated as rhyolitic but became contaminated with mafic magma prior to eruption). Ice–volcano interactions in these units were more difficult to interpret than the relatively-straightforward evidence of ice confinement seen in rhyolitic tuyas (e.g. Tuffen et al., 2002a,b), which suggests that the role of ice was more variable, which Stevenson et al. (2006) attributed to variation in ice thickness and properties (e.g. fracturing). Nevertheless, Stevenson et al. (2006) reconstructed the eruptive environment and likely degree of confinement (and availability of meltwater) during the construction of Vatnafjall (Table 3). By considering all seven eruptive units mapped at Vatnafjall, Stevenson et al. (2006) established that the earliest eruptions (Unit A) were into ice that was likely to be less than 150 m thick, but the next eruption (comprising Units B and C) required ice at least 200 m thick. The thick rhyolite lava (unit D) may have been confined by ice, but the only direct evidence for ice/snow involvement is the numerous hollows in the base of the flowwhich contain quench-\nfragmented obsidian breccia, which have been interpreted elsewhere (Lescinsky and Fink, 2000; Mee et al., 2006) as resulting from ice blocks being incorporated into the base of the flow. It is also notable that this rhyolite lava lacks the basal breccia typical of subaerial rhyolite lavas (Fink andManley,1987), whichmay suggest that contact with ice prevented flow-front blocks from cascading down and forming the basal breccia. The succeeding trachydacite Unit (Unit E) shows excellent evidence of ice contact, which led Stevenson et al. (2006) to argue that the Kvíárjökull valley had been excavated andwas filled with ice around 500 m thick when Unit E erupted. Units F and G (mafic) erupted subaerially from vents high on Vatnafjall, during icefree conditions."

    "text": "Other rhyolitic units at Öræfajökull are currently being mapped, and two examples are briefly described from a location on the SW flanks. Fig. 11a shows a series of lava lobes perched on the flanks of a valley, whilst Fig. 11b shows awell-preserved and glassy lobe carapace comprising small (5–10 cm) columnar joints oriented normal to lobe margin. Petrographic examination shows that the main component is rhyolitic in composition but mechanical mixing with a mafic component has produced a hybrid rock of trachydacite composition (Angela Walker, written communication). The lobate and glassy morphology of the lava lobes is interpreted as resulting from contact with ice at the time of eruption. This suggests either that ice filled the valley to an elevation higher than that of the lobes, or that the upper surface of the valleyglacierwas at an elevation slightly higher than that of the lobes, and that the lobes flowed into the bergschrund at the ice– wall interface. In either case the key point is that the lava took the path of least resistance and exploited the interface between the ice and the valleywall, whichwas probably enlarged bymeltwater escape. Fromapalaeoenvironmental perspective theminimumelevation of ice in the valley can be regarded as the elevation at which these lobes occur. The maximum elevation cannot be determined.\nThe second example is a thick rhyolitic lava buttress c.220 m high resting on an eroded pile of tillites and mafic hyaloclastites and lavas (Fig. 12a). The base of the rhyolite is exposed (Fig. 12b) and reveals quench-fragmented glassy rhyolite (Fig. 12c) typical of that found at other examples of lavas erupted in glacial environments (e.g. Lescinsky and Fink, 2000; Mee et al., 2006; Stevenson et al., 2006). Three further points are noteworthy: firstly that columnar joints\n(mostly 0.5–1.5 m in diameter) occur throughout the entire rhyolite pile; secondly that subtle internal contacts within the rhyolite pile suggest that this is a compound flow (Fig. 12a); and thirdly that the accumulation of tephra in a low-lying pocket eroded into the underlying rocks parallels that of the tephra pile exposed at Vatnafjall (Stevenson et al., 2006). The ubiquitous presence of columnar joints in this setting (well above that of any sea levelmaximum) argues strongly\nfor the supply of additional coolant, which is most likely to be water derived from melting of glacial ice. The existence of the tephra pile further emphasises an important difference between eruptions at Öræfajökull and those at Cascades stratovolcanoes (e.g. Lescinsky and Sisson, 1998; Lescinsky and Fink, 2000) where such accumulations of fragmental material are absent.

Whilst dating young (Pleistocene) Icelandic rhyolites presents a considerable analytical challenge (see summary in Flude et al., 2008), their higher K (and therefore radiogenic Ar) concentrations, means that such young rhyolites are easier to date than contemporaneous basalts.\nTwo studies piloted the Ar–Ar dating of tuya-forming Pleistocene rhyolites and produced the first published Ar–Ar dates of Icelandic rhyolites (McGarvie et al., 2006, 2007). The first study on three tuyas from Torfajökull (Fig. 13a) linked their Ar–Ar ages to the palaeotemperature curve (McGarvie et al., 2006), and exploited the alkalic rhyolites of Torfajökull (which contain relatively-high K, and hence higher radiogenic Ar) to produce Ar–Ar dates with relativelylow uncertainties. As a result Ar–Ar dates (67±9 ka, 72±7 ka, and\nd areas indicate the range of temperatures indicated by the Ar–Ar ages of three tuyas at 1 than thepresent day.

From McGarvie et al. (2007).\n278±18 ka) were obtained which are sufficiently precise to indicate the glacial period in which each tuya-forming eruption had taken place.\nThe second studywas on the Prestahnúkur tuya, the volcanological characteristics of which were discussed earlier. As this tuya is within the Icelandic rift zones and is therefore derived from a lower-K tholeiitic source than the Torfajökull rhyolites, the lower concentration of radiogenic Ar in Prestahnúkur rhyolites resulted in higher uncertainties and an age of 89±24 ka (McGarvie et al., 2007). Fig. 13b shows the regression line from which the Ar–Ar age was derived. Nevertheless, this age falls within OI stage 5 (substages 5d–5b) and this, combined with the palaeoenvironmental information that the tuya was completely encased in ice during its formation, led McGarvie et al. (2007) to conclude that the syn-eruptive ice sheet was at least 700 m thick. Rapid temperature fluctuations characterise OI stage 5 and two periods of global cooling (substages 5d and 5b) of c.9 °C (Johnsen et al., 1992) each lasting c.12–15 ky and therefore reaching peak cooling after c.6–7 ky characterise this interglacial–glacial transition. The evidence from Prestahnúkur suggests that at least 700 m of ice can accumulate in c.6–7 ky, a finding which corroborates models arguing for the rapid accumulation of land-based ice in response to global cooling (e.g. Raymo et al., 1998).\nFinally, recent pioneering work on cosmogenic exposure dating of young basaltic tuyas in Iceland (Licciardi et al., 2007) concluded that these tuyas were associated with the same deglaciation-triggered pulse of mantle melting that led to the vast outpourings of earlyHolocene basalt lavas (e.g. Jull andMackenzie, 1996; Slater et al., 1998; Maclennan et al., 2002). However Licciardi et al.'s (2007) work relies on the key but questionable assumption that tuyas with ‘unglaciated’ summits have remained ice free since formation (highly unlikely) and therefore exposure ages are the same as eruption ages. There is as yet no corroborating evidence such as radiogenic dating to support Licciardi et al.'s (2007) work, and until there is the suggested link between basalt tuya formation and deglaciation has to remain unproven. Fortunately rhyolitic tuyas appear to be dissociated from periods of deglaciation (Fig. 13a), and so at present they provide the only reliable evidence of past ice sheet thickness at particular times and locations (McGarvie et al., 2006)."

    "heading": "7.2. Calderas beneath ice-covered central volcanoes?",
    "text": "Three ice-covered and rhyolite-producing Icelandic central volcanoes possess large ring structures which have been revealed by icepenetrating radar — Mýrdalsjökull and Öræfajökull from the flank zones, and Hofsjökull from the rift zones (Björnsson, 1988; Björnsson et al., 2000). These are massive (in an Icelandic context) circular-toelliptical structures up to 14 km in diameter which rise up to 750 m from their bases (Fig. 14). Notably, where these three ring structures pierce the ice, the nunataks are rhyolitic. There are three other large ring structures in Iceland which are not known to be associated with any rhyolitic eruptions/exposures: Bárðarbunga — which is completely ice covered, and the largely ice-covered structures of Kverkfjöll and Grimsvötn (Guðmundsson and Högnadóttir, 2007).\nThese ring structures have been called calderas by many workers (e.g. Guðmundsson and Högnadóttir, 2007), and are shown as such on published maps (e.g. Jóhannesson and Sæmundsson, 1998a,b). However Cole et al. (2005) in their recent and authoritative review of calderas and caldera structures emphasised that a caldera should be ‘…principally the result of subsidence…’ but because these ring structures are ice-covered there is no first-hand observational evidence confirming that subsidence took place.\nThe purpose of raising this issue is not primarily to call into question whether or not these ring structures are calderas (sensu stricto), but instead to emphasise the likely role of constructional processes (specifically rhyolitic glaciovolcanism) in their formation. Consider two identical caldera-forming rhyolitic eruptions, one\noccurring in subaerial conditions and the other occurring beneath 700 m thick ice. Products of the subaerial eruption can readily escape from the vents and become widely dispersed, whereas beneath thick ice a higher proportion of the eruption products are likely to be retained adjacent to the vents. Whilst Höskuldsson and Sparks (1997) considered only effusive subglacial eruptions, their point about the lower energy available in rhyolitic eruptions can be extrapolated to question whether even explosive rhyolitic eruptions will have sufficient energy to melt through overlying thick ice (see further discussion in Tuffen et al., 2007). A possible contribution to this comes from Thorarinsson (1958), who suggested that the source of Iceland's largest and explosive historic rhyolitic eruption – that of Öræfajökull in 1362 –waswithin the ice-filled summit caldera, and if this is correct then it suggests that explosively-erupting rhyolitic magma can melt through substantial thicknesses of ice (up to 500 m in Öræfajökull according to Björnsson, 1988) rapidly enough that sufficient energy and exsolving volatiles remain to sustain Plinian eruption columns. An alternative explanation is that the Öræfajökull 1362 eruption took place close to the caldera rim, where thinner ice would have been encountered and where an ice–bedrock interface would have facilitated rapid passage of erupting magma to the surface and would also enhanced drainage of meltwater— features which parallel small-volume mafic eruptions at Grimsvötn (e.g. Guðmundsson and Björnsson, 1991) where there is also a caldera wall that is exploited by erupting magmas and where eruptions have become emergent very rapidly. This is in contrast to the larger mafic eruption at Gjálp, which took c.13 h to melt through 650–700 m of ice (Guðmundsson et al., 1997).\nIrrespective of whether an ice-covered caldera-forming eruption under thick ice becomes emergent or not, during the initial phase of the eruption the volcanic products will be confined by ice and this will result in the construction of a steep-sided pile of fragmental material which may be similar to (but of larger volume and extent than) the steep-sided piles of phreatomagmatic tephra constructed during the early stages of tuya-forming eruptions (Tuffen et al., 2002a,b; Stevenson, 2005). The formation of a caldera creates structural weaknesses in the crust that can be exploited by later-erupting magmas (e.g. Cole et al., 2005; Guðmundsson, 2007), and post-caldera rhyolitic ring domes erupting along the rim of an ice-covered caldera will result in enhanced vertical growth of the caldera rim. The profile of the Hofsjökull ring structure (Fig. 14) is unlike that of subaerial calderas in one important respect — that of the height of the outer caldera walls, which in places rise steeply for c.300 m. It is suggested that the unusual morphology of this structure owes much to the constructional effects of rhyolitic volcano–ice interactions, through enhanced vertical growth of ice-confined rhyolitic domes erupted along the ring structure. McGarvie (1985) made a similar suggestion to explain subglacial rhyolitic dome morphologies and locations at\nTorfajökull, and this was subsequently developed to explain constructional features at the Askja main caldera by Brown et al. (1991), with further corroboration coming from Gilbert et al. (1996), who noted the constructional effects of domes erupted along the rim of the icefilled caldera of Sollipulli, in Chile.\nOne consequence of the enhanced vertical construction of Icelandic central volcanoes during volcano–ice interactions is that it enhances the further accumulation of snow (and ice), which will lead to the growth of larger (and presumably thicker) ice caps, which in turn will enhance the likelihood of volcano–ice interactions during future eruptions. The possible importance of this positive feedback loop awaits further study.\nFinally, there is much interest in finding widespread marker horizons that can be used to assist in tracking human migration throughout Western Europe during the past c.90 ka (e.g. Gamble et al., 2004, 2005). If indeed any ice-covered ring structures in Iceland were formed during substantial and explosive caldera-forming eruptions, then there is a considerable challenge in identifying the products of these eruptions for precise chemical characterisation and subsequent correlation with any identified marker horizons in distant realms, as the syn-eruptive products are currently buried beneath a few hundred metres of ice."

    "text": "1. This first review of rhyolitic volcano–ice interactions in Iceland provides a framework for future studies of rhyolitic glaciovolcanism in Iceland and at volcanic provinces elsewhere on Earth. This has been achieved through reviewing the research that has been undertaken during the last decade — which has produced the first detailed volcanological descriptions of effusion-dominated edifices, tuya-forming eruptions, and eruptions into thinner ice at stratovolcanoes. 2. A major contribution of this review is that it that lists known and suspected occurrences of rhyolitic glaciovolcanic rocks, and provides comments on the quality and reliability of the information. It is expected that this tablewill undergo considerable revision as a result of future investigations. This table will also facilitate comparison between Icelandic examples and those in other volcanic provinces where rhyolitic glaciovolcanism has occurred (e.g. British Columbia, Canada). 3. As rhyolites of late Pleistocene age (i.e. younger than c.0.8 Ma) can presently be datedwith lower uncertainties than basalts of similar age, the opportunity has been taken to combine palaeoenvironmental information (e.g. on ice thicknesses during tuya-forming eruptions) with eruption ages to provide estimates of minimum ice sheet thicknesses at specific localities and specific times. 4. Ar–Ar dating of three peralkaline rhyolitic tuyas at Torfajökull shows that they are not linked to deglaciation."
