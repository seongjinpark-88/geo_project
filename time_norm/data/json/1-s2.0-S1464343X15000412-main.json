Three third-order sequences of transgression–regression can be defined. Dysoxic conditions were developed in the sediments and the bottom waters of the deepest environment (mid- to outer-ramp setting), in the western part of the platform. Well-oxygenated waters were present in the eastern part of the platform (peritidal zone to mid-ramp environment). The climate was arid before the CCIE, becoming warm with contrasted seasons during the CCIE. This climate is associated with a low palaeoproductivity over the entire platform, along with the presence of photozoan followed by heterozoan carbonate-producers, as found also in other parts of the Saharan platform. However, such conditions are not in accordance with many studies which suggest a wet climate during the CCIE, leading to intense chemical weathering of the continent favouring the appearance of high palaeoproductivity at a global scale and the establishment of dysoxic/anoxic conditions. In the Preafrican Trough, poorly-oxygenated waters spread outwards from the deep basins and covered the platform in response to sea-level rise.\nMany disturbances are recorded in the platform succession during the early Turonian, after the CCIE. Indeed, just after the C/T boundary, the development of an outer-ramp environment over the entire Preafrican Trough reflects flooding of the platform, linked to the end of the major Cenomanian transgression and the presence of eutrophic conditions which disrupted carbonate-producing organisms. This high palaeoproductivity, due to considerable nutrient input, led to the establishment of highly dysoxic conditions in the bottom and intermediate waters, causing the disappearance of the majority of the Cenomanian palaeontological groups, except for the opportunist benthic and planktonic foraminifera which proliferated. Part of the nutrient input could be due to the presence of a hot and wet climate that may have led a slight increase in the degree of chemical weathering of the continent. Nevertheless, many lines of evidence, such as the decrease of the detrital influx during the early Turonian and the reduction of the weatherable continental areas after the Cenomanian transgression, suggest the existence of another source of nutrient inputs. Combined with the presence of dysoxic/anoxic conditions during the lower Turonian in several regions of the tropical Central Atlantic, the occurrence of these nutrient inputs may be linked to the volcanism/hydrothermalism of the Caribbean LIP and the mid-ocean ridges.\n2015 Elsevier Ltd.

    "heading": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "One of the interesting aspects of mid-Cretaceous times is the occurrence of paleoclimatic, geochemical and palaeontological disturbances during the late Cenomanian–early Turonian (Lüning et al., 2004; Jenkyns, 2010; Flögel et al., 2011; Jarvis et al., 2011; and many others), resulting from the onset of anoxic conditions in the oceanic basins, corresponding to the Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2). While this event is generally well recorded and widely studied in oceanic basins owing the deposition and preservation of black shales (Schlanger et al., 1987; Kuhnt et al., 1990), it is poorly expressed in shallow platform environments, where the consequences of anoxia are less well known. However, since these environments are located at the interface between open-ocean and terrestrial realms, their study provides important information on climatic, physical, biological and geochemical processes, coeval with the OAE2, which are not easily detected in pelagic or terrestrial deposits. These processes involve sea-level changes, nutrient and detrital inputs, freshwater influx, changes in oceanic currents (waves, coastal upwellings, etc.), changes in the abundance and diversity of benthic biota, as well as variations in paleodepth and the extension of dysoxic/anoxic waters, etc.\nIn this study, we are focused in the upper Cenomanian–lower Turonian carbonate platform of the Preafrican Trough (Morocco). This platform, which now forms part of the Saharan platform, was influenced by Tethyan water masses, corresponding to an area extending over Tunisia (Caron et al., 2006; Jati, 2007; Faouzi Zagrarni et al., 2008) and Algeria (Herkat, 1999, 2004; Jati, 2007; Grosheny et al., 2008; Benyoucef et al., 2014; Benyoucef and Meister, 2015), as well as Atlantic water masses recorded in the Essaouira Basin (Andreu, 1991; Ettachfini, 1993; Lüning et al., 2004), Agadir Basin (Andreu, 1989, 1991; Gertsch et al., 2010a; Jati et al., 2010) and Tarfaya Basin (Lüning et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2008) in Morocco. Moreover, the stratigraphic framework of the Preafrican Trough is well established through the studies of Meister and Rhalmi (2002), Ettachfini and Andreu (2004), Ettachfini (2006), Kennedy et al. (2008), Cavin et al. (2010) and Lezin et al. (2012). Previous studies (Ettachfini and Andreu, 2004; Ettachfini, 2006; Lezin et al., 2012; Lebedel et al., 2013; Andreu et al., 2013) show that (1) the positive d13C excursion, related to the global extension of dysoxic/anoxic waters during the OAE2, is clearly identifiable on all the studied outcrops, and (2) the platform exhibits an East–West polarity during the late Cenomanian, and becomes flooded during the early Turonian. By comparing sedimentological and palaeontological observations with geochemical data (major, minor and trace elements), Lebedel et al. (2013) show that poorly-oxygenated conditions reached the platform during the late Cenomanian–early Turonian, sometimes associated with an increase of palaeoproductivity.\nThe aim of the present study is to (1) summarize all the data (from the literature as based on new results) on the upper Cenomanian–lower Turonian of the Preafrican Trough, (2) define and discuss the prevailing climate on the platform during this period and (3) propose a 3D representation of the platform in several key-steps or episodes, including all the data concerning palaeoenvironments, oxygenation, palaeoproductivity, climate, etc. This approach enables us to constrain the timing of the dysoxic/anoxic episodes, the impact of the OAE2 and its consequences on the development of carbonate producers, thus allowing comparisons with other platforms."

    "text": "The Preafrican Trough in eastern Morocco belongs to the western part of the extensive Saharan platform. It forms a wide triangular plain between the Moroccan High Atlas and Anti-Atlas mountain ranges (Fig. 1). The sediments of the platform are bounded by the South Atlas fault, which separate it from the Jurassic basins of the High Atlas to the north, the Precambrian and Palaeozoic formations of the Anti-Atlas in the south, and the Tertiary formations of the Hamada du Guir in the east (Fig. 1). The Cretaceous of the Preafrican Trough lies unconformably on a Palaeozoic or Jurassic basement. The Cenomanian–Turonian succession is composed of two Formations (Choubert, 1948; Dubar, 1948; Basse and Choubert, 1959; Choubert and Faure-Muret, 1962; Sereno et al., 1996; Ettachfini and Andreu, 2004; Cavin et al., 2010): (1) the lower and mid Cenomanian lagoonal gypsiferous marls of the Aoufous Formation and (2) a Cenomanian– Turonian escarpment consisting of marine limestones, making up the Akrabou Formation. The studied interval extends from the top of the Aoufous Formation to the top of the Akrabou Formation."

    "text": "Three planktonic foraminifera zones are recognized in the Preafrican Trough (Ettachfini and Andreu, 2004; Ettachfini, 2006; Lezin et al., 2012; Lebedel, 2013): the Rotalipora cushmani Zone, belonging to the upper Cenomanian, the Whiteinella archaeocretacea Zone, in the uppermost Cenomanian–lowermost Turonian, and the Helvetoglobotruncana helvetica Zone, from the top of the lower Turonian. Moreover, the ammonites collected in this study, along with the results of Meister and Rhalmi (2002), Kennedy et al. (2008), Cavin et al. (2010), Lezin et al. (2012) and Meister and Piuz (2013), allow us to recognize (1) the Guerangeri Zone, lower upper Cenomanian, in the lower part of the Akrabou Formation and (2) the Nodosoides Zone, upper lower Turonian, in the upper part of the same Formation.\nThe OAE2 is marked worldwide by a positive d13C excursion (Tsikos et al., 2004; Sageman et al., 2006; Grosheny et al., 2008; Elrick et al., 2009; Jati et al., 2010), also recorded in the Preafrican Trough (Lezin et al., 2012; Lebedel et al., 2013) at the top of the R. cushmani Zone and at the extreme base of the W. archaeocretacea Zone, and ranging up to the Cenomanian/ Turonian boundary (Figs. 3 and 4). Worldwide, this excursion is dated as late Cenomanian (Gale et al., 1993, 2005; Kuhnt et al., 2004; Tsikos et al., 2004; Caron et al., 2006; Westermann et al., 2010; Bomou et al., 2013) and corresponds to the time interval during which dysoxic/anoxic conditions were most extensively developed. We chose to call this period the CCIE (Cenomanian Carbon Isotope Excursion), in order to differentiate it from the OAE2 that lasts longer. Indeed, many studies (Terrab, 1994; El Albani et al., 1997; Friedrich et al., 2006; Grosheny et al., 2008; Van Bentum et al., 2009; Jati et al., 2010; Monteiro et al., 2012) show that dysoxic/anoxic conditions related to the OAE2 are locally present before and/or after this CCIE.\nThe stratigraphic studies of Ettachfini and Andreu (2004) and Ettachfini (2006) show that the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary is a major regional discontinuity (D4) over a large part of the Morocco Basins (Preafrican Trough, High Moulouya, Middle Atlas and High Atlas synclines). In the Preafrican Trough, D4 picks out an important change in the sedimentation, with the appearance of thinly-bedded limestone, often laminated and rich in cherts. These authors (op. cit.) also noted a great abundance of Heterohelicidae at around the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary, corresponding to the ‘‘Heterohelix shift’’, which is also recognized in Tunisia (Robaszynski et al., 1990; Nederbragt and Fiorentino, 1999; Caron et al., 1999; Abdallah, 2000) and in the central High\nAtlas, Morocco (Ettachfini et al., 2005). Finally, D4 occurs just at the end of the d13C positive excursion in the Preafrican Trough sections, the Mibladen section in the High Moulouya, and the Ben Cherrou section in the central High Atlas (Ettachfini and Andreu, 2004; Ettachfini, 2006; Lezin et al., 2012; Lebedel et al., 2013). In this last section, the presence of Watinoceras sp. (ammonite) just above D4 provides an additional argument that this discontinuity represents the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary (Ettachfini, 2006)."

    "heading": "2.3. Facies, environments and stratigraphy",
    "text": "The sedimentological, lithological and palaeontological analysis of twelve sections of the upper Cenomanian–lower Turonian of the Preafrican Trough allowed to define seventeen facies, named F1– F15, first described in Lezin et al. (2012) and further detailed in this study (Table 1). Each facies is characterized by typical skeletal and non-skeletal components (macro and micro), as well as specific textural features and sedimentary structures. These facies can be attributed to seven depositional environments, ranging from the peritidal zone and restricted lagoon to the deep open platform (Table 1). The interpretation of the palaeoenvironments is discussed in detail in Lezin et al. (2012) and Lebedel (2013).\nThe facies is determined for each sample in all the studied sections (a total of 659 samples). A middle to outer ramp facies (F1– F4) predominates in the Goulmima section (Lezin et al., 2012), as also observed in the other western sections (Tinghir, Izakarène, Errachidia and Tarda). By contrast, the Tazzouguert (Lebedel et al., 2013) and the other eastern sections (Takoumite, Amelkis, Ziz, Zouala, Chaabet El Ham and Aïn El Ati) are characterized by depositional environments ranging from the peritidal zone to the deep outer ramp (facies F1–F15). The deep outer ramp environment (facies F1–F4) appears mainly during the Turonian.\nThus, during most of the late Cenomanian (just before and during the CCIE), the platform displays an East–West polarity, with an opening toward the west. Shallow environments of the inner ramp/peritidal zone dominate in the eastern part of the platform, associated with an abundant and diverse fauna, while deeper environments of the mid/outer ramp are more prevalent in the western part, with rare and poorly diversified fauna, mainly composed of bivalves and opportunist benthic and planktonic foraminifera. The base of the lower Turonian is marked by flooding of the platform: an outer ramp environment is established over the entire platform, which becomes colonized by abundant opportunistic benthic and surface planktonic foraminifera (Whiteinella, Heterohelix and Hedbergella).\nA study of the distribution of palaeoenvironments over time allows us to characterize their spatial and temporal variations, leading to the identification of sequence stratigraphy. Indeed, by using correlations based on the biostratigraphic and geochemical (d13C) data, as well as the sequence-stratigraphy interpretation of the different sections, we are able to divide the sedimentary succession of the upper Cenomanian–lower Turonian of the Preafrican Trough into four 3rd-order sequences, denoted S1–S4 (Lezin et al., 2012; this study). However, a few changes have been made compared to Lezin et al. (2012) especially the paleogeographic interpretation during the S1 sequence and the chronostratigraphic position of the S4 sequence boundary. The S4 sequence boundary was originally positioned at an emersion discontinuity dated from the late Cenomanian (Lezin et al., 2012). The study of three additional sections shows that, above this emersion surface, in the eastern part of the Preafrican trough, the accommodation space increases whereas, in the western part, the accommodation space decreases. These different trends are only due to differential subsidence. That is the reason why the upper part of the upper Cenomanian is integrated in the regressive trend of the sequence S3. In this new interpretation, the S4 sequence boundary is positioned at the D4 discontinuity. An important increase in the accommodation space (transgressive trend) is recorded above this last discontinuity. So, in the present study,\nwe propose new stratigraphic correlations based on two transects: (1) an east–west transect, from Tinghir to Tazzouguert, running across the sections of Izakarène, Goulmima, Errachidia and Tarda (Fig. 3), and (2) a north–south transect, in the eastern part of the platform, extending between the sections of Takoumite and Aïn El Ati, via the sections of Tazzouguert, Amelkis, Ziz, Zouala and Chaabet El Ham (Fig. 4)."

    "text": "Lebedel et al. (2013) compared geochemical (major, minor and trace elements), palaeontological and sedimentological data to determine the oxygenation and palaeoproductivity conditions on the platform. During the early Cenomanian and the CCIE, slightly dysoxic conditions were present in the bottom waters of deeper environment (mid to outer ramp) over the western part of the platform, while the eastern waters were oxic. The palaeoproductivity was low over the entire platform. The dysoxia of bottom waters recorded in the west is related to the influx of poorly-oxygenated waters from the deeper anoxic basins of the Atlantic and/or Tethys Oceans, which occurred during the Cenomanian secondorder transgression (Hardenbol et al., 1998). In contrast, during the early Turonian, highly dysoxic bottom and intermediate waters were present over the entire platform. This Turonian dysoxia was\ndue to an increase of the palaeoproductivity, which enhanced the consumption of O2 owing the decay of organic matter. These results are supported by the studies of Andreu et al. (2013) on the ostracods of the Preafrican Trough."

    "heading": "2.5. Clay mineralogy and climate",
    "text": "A clay mineral study was performed on three sections: Tinghir (17 samples), Izakarène (30 samples) and Goulmima (23 samples). The analyses were carried out at the Geoscience Environnement Toulouse (France) laboratory, using X-ray diffraction (with a G3000 INEL instrument) on decarbonated samples. The intensities of the identified minerals are measured for a semi-quantitative estimate of clay minerals, expressed in relative percent without correction factors, because of the small error margin (<5%). Finally, we have distinguished three time periods (before, during and after the CCIE). For each, on the three sections studied, the average content of the different clay minerals is calculated.\nClay mineral data are not available for the base of the upper Cenomanian, before the CCIE). However, the presence of evaporites (gypsum) in the western part of the Preafrican Trough (Lebedel, 2013) suggests a dry climate.\nClay assemblages in the three sections consist of kaolinite, palygorskite, illite, smectites and illite–smectites (I/S) mixed layers (Fig. 5). The upper Cenomanian sediments, deposited just before and during the CCIE, are marked by the presence of palygorskite (up to 42%), illite (12–33%) and smectites (up to 36%), associated with minor amounts of I/S mixed layers (5–29%). Kaolinite is present only occasionally at Tinghir and Goulmima, with a maximum abundance of 38%. After the CCIE, palygorskite disappears during the early Turonian, along with smectites that are present only episodically at Goulmima (12% average), in favour of illite (up to 85% in Goulmima) and kaolinite (Tinghir and Izakarène, up to 72%).\nThe shallow burial depth of the Cretaceous deposits of the Preafrican Trough and the SEM observations of the clay minerals (Lebedel, 2013) indicate that they have a mainly detrital origin. Therefore, these minerals can be used as a climatic proxy. Kaolinite of detrital origin is formed under humid conditions in equatorial well drained soils (Deconinck et al., 1982). Smectites appear in tropical soils under a warm climate with contrasted seasons. The palygorskite forms in environments rich in cations (Chamley, 1989) such as lagoons, in the immediate surrounding areas of continents and lakes, as well as in desert soils (Thiry and Pletsch, 2011). Illite is a primary mineral produced by the\nmechanical weathering of pre-existing rocks in a hot and dry climate, or in very cold climates at high latitude, or alternatively in areas of high relief or tectonically active zones.\nSo, during the late Cenomanian (just before and during the CCIE), the detrital flux derived from the Preafrican Trough was both\nprimary (illite) and pedogenic (smectites and kaolinite) in origin. This detrital supply probably came from the erosion of the AntiAtlas, to the south of the platform, in an area affected by pedogenic processes under warm climatic conditions with contrasted seasons (presence of smectites). The presence of allochthonous\npalygorskite (Fig. 6A) can be explained by an input coming from the surrounding evaporite basins, or the reworking of ancient evaporitic deposits of the Aoufous Formation. During the early Turonian, the predominance of detrital kaolinite (Fig. 6B) and the disappearance of smectites (except at Goulmima) and palygorskite could be explained by the establishment of a hot and wet climate. Nevertheless, this scenario remains only a hypothesis, because the very low abundance of clay (<1%) in the Turonian limestones of the Preafrican Trough sections can disturb this climate reconstruction."

    "text": "In the eastern part of the platform, open marine sedimentation begins with the establishment of a mid/outer-ramp environment above the gypsiferous marls of the Aoufous Formation (Sequence S1 on Fig. 3 and step 1 on Fig. 10). This marine environment is characterized by the appearance of yellowish mudstone, more or less rich in planktonic foraminifera and oysters. In the west, gypsiferous marls typical of lagoonal or paralic sebkrah environments (Ettachfini, 2006) are still present. The climate is dry, the waters are well-oxygenated and the palaeoproductivity is low.\nThen, during accumulation of the Guerangeri Zone, an outer ramp environment appears in the eastern part of the platform, with the development of yellow nodular marls, more or less rich in ammonites (Neolobites vibrayeanus), planktonic foraminifera and echinids (base of S2 in Fig. 3; step 2 on Fig. 10). These open marine conditions gradually extend towards the western part of the Preafrican Trough (Fig. 7A). As observed farther west, the climate is dry, with well-oxygenated waters and low palaeoproductivity.\nJust before the CCIE, at the top of the Guerangeri Zone, the polarity of the platform changes (Fig. 7B), becoming open and deeper toward the west (top of S2 on Fig. 3; step 3 on Fig. 10). This polarity remains unchanged up until the early Turonian. The determining factor explaining this sudden change is very likely tectonic. We hypothesize that this sudden change is linked to the activation of a generally N-S trending fault (in the Antiatlasic basement?), which accounts for the present-day course of the Ziz wadi (Fig. 1). In the eastern part of the platform, bioclastic sandbars prograde to the south (top of S2 on Fig. 4), associated with, abundant stromatoporoids and rudists between the bars. These facies\ncharacterize an open high-energy environment. In the west, bioclastic limestones with ostreids, Astarte saguenzae and internal moulds of bivalves are deposited in a mid to outer ramp environment; buliminids are present in the western part. The climate is warm with contrasted seasons, while the marine environment shows low palaeoproductivity. In the east, the waters are welloxygenated while, in the west, bottom the waters are dysoxic."

    "text": "At the base of the CCIE, in the south-eastern part of the Preafrican Trough (Amelkis, Zouala, Chaabet El Ham and Aïn El Ati sections), an open mid-ramp environment is characterized by a predominance of bryozoans associated with numerous burrows (base of S3 on Figs. 4 and 8A; step 4 on Fig. 10). This environment passes laterally, toward the north-east (Tazzouguert and Takoumite sections), into a shallower high-energy open platform, characterized by facies with rudists and stromatoporoids. Towards the west, a calm and deep marine environment (outerramp) is indicated by the development of interbedded marls and limestones containing rare ostreidae, planktonic foraminifera, calcispheres and buliminids, sometimes associated with silicification. Thus, during this interval of time, the platform is open toward the south and the west, where the environments are deeper. The climate is warm with contrasted seasons, while the marine environment shows low palaeoproductivity associated with welloxygenated waters, except for dysoxic bottom waters in the west.\nThen, a rapid fall in relative sea-level leads to the establishment of sub-emergent conditions in the east (birdseye fabrics, stromatolites, and sometimes desiccation cracks; middle of S3 on Figs. 4 and 8B; step 5 on Fig. 10). In the west, the mid to outerramp environment persists, mainly leading to the accumulation of bioclasts of bivalves reworked by storms. The regional D3 discontinuity formed at the end of this episode represents the lowest relative sea level of the late Cenomanian–early Turonian, in the Preafrican Trough. The climatic conditions, as well as the oxygenation and palaeoproductivity levels, are similar to those of the previous episode (step 4).\nAt the end of the CCIE, in the eastern part of the platform, the sub-emergent facies is rapidly covered by aggrading facies typical of the peritidal zone (birdseye fabrics, stromatolites) and inner ramp (Nerinea, alveolinids and miliolids) (top of S3 on Figs. 4; 9A; step 6 on Fig. 10). This shallow environment is crossed by tidal channels. Then, a progressive opening of the platform from the north is recorded, with deeper water environments (bivalves, phosphate and occasionally planktonic foraminifera) established first in the north-east (Takoumite), which gradually move\nsouthwards to reach Zouala and Chaabet El Ham at the end of the step (Fig. 4). This succession reflects the deposition of an aggrading sequence following an increase of accommodation space. In the western part of the platform, thin beds of shelly limestone are developed, bounded by erosive surfaces. These facies reflect storm-influenced sedimentation, and their vertical succession suggests stability, and even a slight reduction of accommodation space. In this way, differential subsidence is recorded across the platform: in the eastern part, the ratio of accommodation space to carbonate production is slightly greater than 1, whereas the same ratio is slightly less than 1 in the western part. Subsidence is more marked (1) in the east than in the west of the platform and (2) in the north-eastern than in the south-east. Sedimentation takes place during a phase of high sea level,\ncoinciding with a global creation of accommodation space that ceases at the D4 discontinuity. The climate is warm with contrasted seasons, while the waters are well-oxygenated, except in the west where the bottom waters are dysoxic and the palaeoproductivity is low."

    "text": "An abrupt change in the sedimentation is recorded just above D4 (step 7 on Fig. 10). The flooding of the platform (drowning phase; base of S4 on Figs. 3, 4 and 9B) is reflected by the presence of ‘‘lag’’ facies just above this discontinuity on the western sections, as well as the appearance of thinly-bedded grey micritic limestone,\noften laminated, that are rich in phosphates and yellow chert nodules. An outer ramp environment appears on the platform, where flora is absent and the fauna is dominated by small opportunistic benthic forams (buliminids; Koutsoukos et al., 1990; Ly and Kuhnt, 1994; Friedrich et al., 2006; Friedrich, 2010) and planktonic forams (Guembelitria cretacea, Heterohelix globulosa, Whiteinella sp.) associated with fish debris. This interval records the highest relative sea level of the platform during the late Cenomanian–early Turonian. The bottom and intermediate waters are very dysoxic over the entire platform, linked to a major increase in palaeoproductivity induced by enhanced nutrient supply (Andreu et al., 2013; Lebedel, 2013; Lebedel et al., 2013). The climate is probably hot and wet.\nIn the last episode (step 8 on Fig. 10), mid-ramp type sedimentation gradually reappears in a context of high sea-level, with the return of bioclastic limestones containing gastropods, bivalves,\nbenthic and planktonic foraminifera (top of S4 on Fig. 4). The waters are poorly-oxygenated at the onset of step 8, and oxic at the end. Palaeoproductivity falls to low levels at the end of this step. The platform probably disappears at the end of the early Turonian."

    "text": "Nutrient availability is one of the main factors controlling the development of a platform. In the Preafrican Trough, during the upper Cenomanian, before and during the CCIE, the presence of numerous and diversified carbonate producers (rudists, bryozoans, large benthic foraminifera, planktonic foraminifera, etc.) indicates\noligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions (Föllmi et al., 1994; Voigt et al., 1999; Parente et al., 2008; Gebhardt et al., 2010). The geochemical proxies of palaeoproductivity (Cd, Ni, P and Zn) used by Lebedel et al. (2013) show little enrichment, which argues for a low-medium levels of palaeoproductivity. Thus, the low regional palaeoproductivity levels recorded in the Preafrican Trough during the late Cenomanian, and more specifically during the CCIE, show a trend running counter to the global record, which indicates high palaeoproductivity conditions contributing to the establishment of global anoxia (Mort et al., 2007; Jenkyns, 2010; Monteiro et al., 2012).\nDuring the lower Turonian, the high concentrations of Cd, Ni P, Si and Zn are indicative of high organic productivity (Lebedel et al.,\n2013), which is recorded throughout the Preafrican Trough. Eutrophic conditions are indicated by the enrichment of these trace metals, associated with the disappearance of the majority of the Cenomanian biota, along with the predominant occurrence of buliminids and opportunistic planktonic foraminifera (‘‘Heterohelix shift’’ in Goulmima), as well as the significant increase of fish debris (Friedrich et al., 2006; Gebhardt et al., 2010). The establishment of these eutrophic conditions could be due to enhanced nutrient inputs, caused by a mechanism such as intense continental weathering (Jenkyns, 2010; Monteiro et al., 2012) and/ or upwelling systems (Trabucho Alexandre et al., 2010). This increase in palaeoproductivity could have contributed to the drowning of the platform, by disrupting the development of\ncarbonate producers (Föllmi et al., 1994; Drzewiecki and Simo, 1997; Voigt et al., 1999)."

    "text": "Before the CCIE, the Preafrican Trough shows a low palaeoproductivity under an arid climate. It remains low during the CCIE, but under a warm climate with contrasted seasons. This climate evolution is in agreement with the data from several authors (Jenkyns et al., 2004; Steuber et al., 2005; Friedrich et al., 2011; Monteiro et al., 2012) who consider that the global climate was warmer and wetter during the CCIE than before. According to these authors (op cit.), this climate change would produce an increase of chemical weathering on the continents, leading to a higher input of dissolved inorganic matter into the oceanic basins. These solutes serve as nutrients to the organisms, favouring the onset of intense productivity and allowing the establishment of global dysoxia/ anoxia (Monteiro et al., 2012). This hypothesis, which is one of the main hypothesis explaining the establishment of a global dysoxia during the CCIE, is not supported over a large part of the Saharan platform, because of the development of (1) photozoan carbonate-producing ecosystems composed of rudists, stromatoporoids, green algae, benthic foraminifera and rare corals, which are widespread in tropical and subtropical environments, then (2) heterozoan carbonate producers, composed of bryozoan, benthic foraminifera and bivalves. The development of numerous oligotrophic platforms, as observed in Egypt, the Czech Republic, Iraq, Morocco, Oman, Algeria, Tunisia, Mexico, etc. (Philip et al., 1995; Aguilera-Franco and Romano, 2004; Grosheny et al., 2008, 2013; El-Shazly et al., 2011; Lezin et al., 2012; Al-Dulaimi et al., 2013) in an interval of time characterized by an anoxia/dysoxia at the\nglobal scale, does not argue in favor of a continental origin for intense productivity during the CCIE.\nDuring the early Turonian, a hot and wet climate seems to appear on the Preafrican Trough (Fig. 10). The development of this climate is consistent with the studies of Voigt et al. (2004), Sinninghe Damsté et al. (2008), Jarvis et al. (2011) and Van Bentum et al. (2012) who evoke a climatic optimum recorded at the base of the lower Turonian, after the CCIE."

    "heading": "4.3. Variation of relative sea level and drowning of the platform",
    "text": "In the western part of the Saharan platform, drowning of the platform is recorded in different areas. In the Preafrican Trough, the appearance of thinly-bedded limestone just above the D4 discontinuity marks a 2nd-order eustatic maximum. In the Agadir basin, the appearance of black shales in the lower Turonian is coeval with a major transgression (Jati et al., 2010). In the High Atlas synclines and the High Moulouya, Ettachfini (2006) notes a transgressive trend just above the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary which is marked by the appearance of thinly-bedded micritic limestone rich in planktonic foraminifera. In the Guir Basin (southwest Algeria), Benyoucef and Meister (2015) observe a flooding of the early Turonian platform, marked by the establishment of thin lime-mudstone beds. Moreover, around the C/T boundary, many other platforms undergo a phase of sudden drowning, for example in Italy (South Apeninnes; Parente et al., 2007), Mexico (Hernàndez-Romano et al., 1997), Spain (Drzewiecki and Simo, 1997), Germany (Wilmsen et al., 2010), Yugoslavia (Jenkyns, 1991), Oman (Philip et al., 1995) and Jordan (Schulze, 2003).\nThese drowning phases seems mainly related to (1) the high sea level stand after the major transgression of the late Cenomanian\n(Philip and Airaud-Crumiere, 1991; Hernàndez-Romano et al., 1997; Parente et al., 2007) and (2) the presence of a high palaeoproductivity, unfavorable for the development of carbonate producers (Hernàndez-Romano et al., 1997) and causing the formation of poorly-oxygenated waters. Indeed, some authors also note the presence of dysoxic/anoxic conditions during the late Cenomanian–early Turonian in platform environments (Philip and Airaud-Crumiere, 1991) in Morocco (Lebedel et al., 2013), Egypt (Gertsch et al., 2010b; El Sabbagh et al., 2011), Mexico (Hernàndez-Romano et al., 1997) and Jordan (Schulze et al., 2005). On these platforms, the dysoxic/anoxic conditions are recorded during phases of relative sea level rise, and even sometimes during drowning of the platforms. In the very shallow environments, the waters remain well-oxygenated because of the exchanges with the atmosphere."

    "heading": "4.4. OAE2 dysoxia/anoxia on the western part of the Saharan platform",
    "text": "The review study of Monteiro et al. (2012) shows that dysoxic/ anoxic conditions existed before the CCIE (upper Cenomanian) in tropical Central Atlantic: Tarfaya basin (Morocco), Demerara rise (Suriname), Maracaibo Basin (Venezuela) and Cap Verde. This pre-CCIE dysoxia/anoxia is partly recorded in the Preafrican Trough, where sediments and bottom waters display slightly dysoxic characteristics in the west (Fig. 10).\nDuring the CCIE, on the Preafrican Trough platform, slightly dysoxic conditions are recorded in the sediments and locally in bottom waters of the deep environments (mid-outer ramp; Fig. 10). In the western part of the Saharan platform (Morocco), dysoxic/anoxic conditions are recorded in the Tarfaya Basin (Sinninghe Damsté and Köster, 1998; Lüning et al., 2004; Keller et al., 2008; Mort et al., 2008), but not in the Agadir Basin (Jati et al., 2010; Lebedel, 2013). Monteiro et al. (2012) show that, during the CCIE, the dysoxic/anoxic conditions reached their maximum extension and were present in the Central and South Atlantic Ocean, Tethys, Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, in very shallow environments, as in the eastern part of the Preafrican Trough platform, the waters remain oxic owing to exchanges with the atmosphere.\nThe most important disturbances of the late Cenomanian–early Turonian in the western part of the Saharan platform are recorded in the lower Turonian, after the CCIE, where the deposits exhibit the following characteristics. In the Preafrican Trough, thin beds of muddy limestone appear, rich in chert and opportunistic fauna (Lezin et al., 2012; Lebedel et al., 2013). The waters are highly dysoxic and the palaeoproductivity is high (Fig. 10). In the Tarfaya basin, layers rich in organic matter and chert suggest an enhanced palaeoproductivity associated with dysoxic conditions (El Albani et al., 1997; Kuhnt et al., 2004; Lüning et al., 2004). In the Agadir basin, the establishment of black shales and the appearance of abundant opportunistic fauna reflect dysoxic conditions (Terrab, 1994; Jati, 2007; Jati et al., 2010; Lebedel, 2013). In the High Moulouya, the High Atlas, the Middle Atlas and the Essaouira Basin, Ettachfini (2006) highlights sedimentological and palaeontological disturbances similar to those recognized in the Preafrican Trough, linking to the establishment of dysoxic conditions (Lebedel, 2013). In the Guir basin (Southwestern Algeria), the early Turonian facies are similar to those of the Preafrican Trough, with the presence of mudstone, with rare fossils and traces of silicification (Benyoucef and Meister, 2015), which could indicate the installation of dysoxic conditions.\nIn the Agadir Basin (Terrab, 1994) and the Preafrican Trough platform, the dysoxia continues into the Nodosoides Zone, at the end of the early Turonian. In the Tarfaya basin, it seems to persist up to the middle-late Turonian (Aquit et al., 2013). Moreover, the studies of Friedrich et al. (2006), Hetzel et al. (2009) and Van\nBentum et al. (2009), on the Demerara rise, show that dysoxic conditions are also developed in the early Turonian, after the CCIE. Thus, in the early Turonian, dysoxic conditions seem to be present in the tropical zone of the Central Atlantic Ocean, as recorded in the upper Cenomanian, before the CCIE (Monteiro et al., 2012).\nOther studies are currently in progress to investigate the distribution of Turonian dysoxic conditions. Moreover, the origin of the high palaeoproductivity, as recorded in the Preafrican Trough and the Tarfaya Basin, remains to be explained. Indeed, although the climate was hot and wet on the Preafrican Trough during the early Turonian, another factor may be involved in the establishment of early Turonian dysoxia in the western part of the Saharan platform. This is suggested by the massive presence of silica, the decrease of terrigenous input and the reduction of weatherable continental areas after the 2nd-order Cenomanian transgression, which reflect the probable influence of hydrothermalism and/or volcanism of the Caribbean LIP (Large Igneous Province) and oceanic ridge."

    "heading": "5. Conclusion",
    "text": "The synthesis of data (sedimentological, palaeontological, geochemical, mineralogical, etc.) of the upper Cenomanian–lower Turonian carbonate platform of the Preafrican Trough allows us to propose a 3D model of the platform configuration. In this way, palaeoenvironmental conditions of the Preafrican Trough are compared with those of other platforms at the same period.\nDuring the late Cenomanian and the CCIE (Cenomanian Carbon Isotope Excursion), dysoxic bottom waters are present in the deepest environment of the mid- to outer-ramp, in the west of the platform. In the peritidal to mid-ramp environments of the eastern platform, waters remain well-oxygenated. The climate is arid before the CCIE and warm with contrasted seasons during the CCIE, associated with (1) oligotrophic to mesotrophic palaeoproductivity conditions and (2) the extensive development of a platform mainly composed of photozoan, followed by heterozoan, carbonate-producing ecosystems over a large part of the Saharan platform. However, this scenario is not in accordance with other studies considering that the presence of wet climate during the CCIE, causing an intense chemical weathering of the continents, also leads to an increase of the palaeoproductivity at a global scale. In the Preafrican Trough, the poorly-oxygenated waters spread out from the deep basins and cover the platform in response to sealevel rise.\nThe most significant event recorded on the platform is early Turonian in age. Just after the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary and the CCIE, the platform is flooded (drowning phase), leading to the development of an outer-ramp environment over the entire platform. This flooding is linked to the end of the major Cenomanian transgression and the establishment of eutrophic conditions which disrupt carbonate-producing organisms. These eutrophic conditions lead to highly dysoxic conditions in the bottom and intermediate waters of the platform, thus leading to the disappearance of the majority of the palaeontological groups, except for opportunist benthic and planktonic foraminifera, which are able to proliferate. The enhanced palaeoproductivity causing the dysoxia is due to increased nutrient inputs. These latter are partly linked to the presence of a hot and wet climate that could induce a slight increase of chemical weathering on the continent. But, the decrease of the detrital influx during the early Turonian, the massive presence of silica and the reduction of weatherable continental areas after the Cenomanian transgression argue for another main source of nutrient input, probably the hydrothermalism/volcanism of the Caribbean LIP and oceanic ridges. The presence of dysoxic/anoxic conditions in several regions of the\ntropical Central Atlantic during the early Turonian is another argument in favor of this last hypothesis."
