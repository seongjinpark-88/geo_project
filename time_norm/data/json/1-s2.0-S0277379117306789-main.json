Highly productive arc regions, like those in East Asia, offer a considerable number of widespread isochrons, but before records can be confidently correlated using these layers, a refined and integrated framework of these eruptive events is required. Here we present the first highresolution Holocene cryptotephra study in East Asia, using the Lake Suigetsu sedimentary archive in central Japan. The Holocene tephrostratigraphy has been extended from four to twenty ash layers using cryptotephra extraction techniques, which integrates the deposits from explosive eruptions from North Korea/China, South Korea and along the Japanese arc. This Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy is now the most comprehensive record of East Asian volcanism, and the linchpin site for correlating sequences across this region. Major element glass geochemical compositions are presented for the tephra layers in the sequence, which have been compared to proximal datasets to correlate them to their volcanic source and specific eruptions. This study has significantly extended the ash dispersal of many key Holocene marker layers, and has identified the first distal occurrence of isochrons from Ulleungdo and Changbaishan volcanoes. Utilising the high-precision Lake Suigetsu chronology, we are able to provide constrained eruption ages for the tephra layers, which can be transferred into other site-specific age models containing these markers. This new framework indicates that several isochrons stratigraphically bracket abrupt climate intervals in Japan, and could be used to precisely assess the regional and hemispheric synchronicity of these events.\n© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

McLean).\nassess their ultimate drivers operating across large regional scales (e.g., the East Asian Monsoon; EAM). Widely dispersed volcanic ash (tephra) layers preserved in sedimentary sequences can provide ideal isochronous markers to facilitate high-precision correlations (tephrostratigraphy) and transfer absolute ages (tephrochronology) across palaeoclimate records (e.g., Albert et al., 2013; Lane et al., 2014; Abbott et al., 2016; Alloway et al., 2017). These markers can facilitate the assessment of the spatio-temporal variability of abrupt climate change, particularly when they bracket the onset or\nduration of these events (e.g., Lane et al., 2013). Deciphering the regional and global synchronicity of these changes is fundamental for our understanding of the forcing mechanisms and interplay between large-scale oceanic and atmospheric systems.\nIn order to integrate and compare palaeoenvironmental records, regional tephrostratigraphic frameworks are established, which connect sites using widespread, and well-characterised marker layers (e.g., Shane et al., 2006; Davies et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2015). These regional frameworks are underpinned by key reference sites (often termed tephrostratotypes), which offer both detailed tephrostratigraphic sequences, and a precise chronology of eruptive events, usually from a range of volcanic sources (e.g., the Greenland ice cores; Abbott and Davies, 2012; Bourne et al., 2015). Both the number and geographical footprint of these visible ash layers can be significantly extended by examining sedimentary successions for the presence of non-visible (cryptotephra) ash layers (e.g., Wastegård, 2002; Lane et al., 2015; Albert et al., 2015; Mackay et al., 2016), which are essential to identify smaller magnitude and/or more distal occurrences of the largest eruptions.\nPioneering investigations by researchers such as Machida and Arai (1983) provide the foundation for Japanese tephrochronology, and have established a complex catalogue (via detailed mapping of visible ash deposits) of the succession and dispersal characteristics of the large explosive eruptions that occurred during the Quaternary (compiled in Machida and Arai, 2003). In other parts of the world, studies like those undertaken by the RESET (‘Response of Humans to Abrupt Environmental Transitions’) project, centred in continental Europe and across the Mediterranean Sea (see Lowe et al., 2015), have further refined tephrostratigraphic frameworks through detailed analysis of key eruption sequences and at distal sites. In the RESET project, all tephra deposits were sampled and geochemically fingerprinted from proximal eruptive units close to their source, and detailed cryptotephra studies were undertaken in distal sedimentary sequences. These analyses were able to: i) incorporate new and lower magnitude events into the master European tephrostratigraphic framework (e.g., Albert et al., 2013), ii) resolve the stratigraphic position of eruptions from different volcanic sources that were closely spaced in time (e.g., Karkanas et al., 2015), iii) establish which eruptions have a diagnostic geochemical signature for reliable tephra correlations (e.g., Smith et al., 2011a), (iv) identify erroneous tephra correlations (e.g., Albert et al., 2015), and v) extend the known geographical footprint of ash fallout from individual eruptions, and therefore widen the area over which the key isochrons could be used. This detailed work has revised and verified a comprehensive framework (Lowe et al., 2015) that can be used to robustly integrate key palaeoenvironmental and archaeological archives across the region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, and test long-standing questions using the high-resolution chronology (e.g., Rohling et al., 2009; Grant et al., 2012; Lowe et al., 2012; Barton et al., 2015).\nThis project aimed to refine and augment the Holocene tephrostratigraphic framework for the East Asian/Pacific region using a similar methodology to that employed by the RESET project (outlined above). Here, the sediments of Lake Suigetsu (SG14 core; Fig. 1) were targeted for detailed cryptotephra analysis, since it currently provides the most precisely dated Holocene sedimentary record from Japan (see Staff et al., 2011; Nakagawa et al., 2012). The objectives of this research were to: i) verify the successful application of cryptotephra analysis from a lake located along the highly productive volcanic arc, ii) chemically characterise and date identified tephra isochrons in order to correlate them to their volcanic source and, where possible, specific eruptions, and iii) use the Holocene tephrostratigraphic record from Lake Suigetsu to develop an integrated framework for the East Asian/Pacific region."

    "text": "Over 130 volcanic centres are distributed along the length of the Japanese arc (Fig. 1). These centres have been highly productive during the Late Quaternary, with numerous large caldera-forming eruptions (particularly on Hokkaido and the Kyushu Islands; Fig.1) producing widespread tephra dispersal across the East Asian/ Pacific region (Machida and Arai, 2003). Due to the prevailing westerly winds, ash from the explosive back-arc/intraplate volcanism in South Korea (Ulleungdo volcano) and North Korea/China (Changbaishan) has also blanketed Japan and the surrounding seas numerous times over the Quaternary (Machida and Arai, 2003; Lim et al., 2013, Fig. 1).\nDuring the Holocene three key widespread marker beds are commonly identified in sedimentary sequences in and around Japan, and are named using their source volcano and distal tephra type-site, a common practice in Japanese tephrostratigraphy studies. These include the Baegdusan-Tomakomai (B-Tm), KikaiAkahoya (K-Ah) and Ulleungdo-Oki (U-Oki) ash (Machida and Arai, 1983). The B-Tm is the tephra deposit from the ‘Millennium’ eruption of Changbaishan, and has been recently dated to AD 946 (Hakozaki et al., 2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2017). The K-Ah tephra was dispersed from the now largely sub-marine Kikai caldera, located 50 km south of Kyushu. The most precise date for this eruption (7303e7165 cal yrs BP) was obtained from the Lake Suigetsu SG06 sediment core (Smith et al., 2013). The U-Oki tephra is from Ulleungdo Island (South Korea), which is located in the Sea of Japan, and corresponds to the U-4 proximal eruptive unit (Smith et al., 2011b). Lake Suigetsu, situated in central Japan, is the only archive to currently record all three of these key Holocene marker beds (Fig. 1; Smith et al., 2011b, 2013; McLean et al., 2016).\nIn the past, the majority of tephra correlations in and around Japan are based on the physical characteristics of the deposit, i.e. refractive indices, layer thickness, grain-size andmodalmineralogy. However, it is essential that tephra layers are geochemically characterised as accurately as possible to ensure unequivocal correlations across the proximal and distal settings. Volcanic glass compositions are routinely employed for robust tephra correlation around the world, including New Zealand (e.g., Froggatt, 1983; Shane and Smith, 2000), Europe (e.g., Tomlinson et al., 2015), North America (e.g., Smith and Westgate, 1968; Sarna-Wojcicki et al., 1987) and South America (e.g., Fontijn et al., 2016), but are only recently being utilised in Japan (e.g., Moriwaki et al., 2011; Okuno et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016). Comprehensive glass datasets are yet to be obtained from many eruptive centres in this region, particularly those in central and southern Japan, which means that many distal correlations remain unconfirmed (e.g., Smith et al., 2013)."

    "heading": "1.2. Constraining Holocene climate intervals using tephra layers",
    "text": "Palaeoenvironmental change during the Holocene can provide an improved perspective upon the causal mechanisms and drivers of climate change across the globe (Wanner et al., 2008). In the East Asian/Pacific region, the Holocene climate has been shown to vary considerably, with several abrupt (centennial-scale) warming and cooling phases, likely caused by fluctuations in the behaviour of the East Asian Monsoon (EAM; Wang et al., 2005; Sagawa et al., 2014; Tada andMurray, 2016). Despite the regional and global importance of this climate system, its causal relationship to both external (e.g., orbital, solar and volcanic) and internal forcing remains poorly understood (Morrill et al., 2003; Park, 2017). This is partly due to the inherent difficulties in precisely comparing the distant and diverse palaeoclimate archives across the monsoon region.\nTephra layers can be used to precisely integrate disparate\npalaeoenvironmental records across the migration paths of the EAM, and develop a more comprehensive picture of the spatiotemporal changes of this system. Visible ash layers are commonly recognised in key marine (e.g., Furuta et al., 1986; Park et al., 2003; Chun et al., 2007; Aoki et al., 2008; Ikehara et al., 2011; Sagawa et al., 2014) and terrestrial (e.g., Domitsu et al., 2002; Kumon et al., 2003; Nagahashi et al., 2004; Okuno et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2013) sedimentary archives across this region, but very few have thus far been detected over wide areas, prohibiting the synchronisation of these records, and few are adequately dated to\nimprove site-specific age models. No detailed cryptotephra investigations have been undertaken to explore the true dispersal potential of key ash layers in Japan, however tephra from East Asia has been transported and deposited as isochrons across the northern hemisphere, with recent discoveries in the Greenland ice cores (Sun et al., 2015; Bourne at al. 2016), and possibly as far as the North American east coast (Mackay et al., 2016). This provides substantial encouragement that additional cryptotephra investigations in the East Asian/Pacific region will resolve new isochrons suitable for regional and hemispheric-scale correlations."

    "heading": "2.1. Lake Suigetsu sediment record",
    "text": "The Lake Suigetsu sedimentary archive, central Japan (Fig. 1) has numerous characteristics that make it suitable for detailed cryptotephra analysis and to provide a comprehensive Holocene tephrostratigraphic framework for the East Asian/Pacific region.\n1. The visible tephrostratigraphic record (spanning ~150 ka) confirms that the lake is ideally situated to record explosive eruptions from multiple volcanic sources from across Japan, South Korea and North Korea/China (Smith et al., 2011b, 2013; McLean et al., 2016). 2. Suigetsu is a tectonic lake, adequately situated away from the large calderas in Hokkaido and Kyushu, so is unlikely to be inundated with locally sourced volcanic products (i.e. background glasses) that could obscure the cryptotephra record. 3. No rivers flow directly into Lake Suigetsu, which mean that the basal sediments are rarely disturbed by inflows from the immediate lake surroundings. The sedimentation is relatively fast with the accumulation of ~12m of fine-grained sediment through the Holocene (Nakagawa et al., 2012; Yamada et al., in revision), which is ideal for high-resolution tephra investigations and palaeoenvironmental proxy analysis. 4. A detailed Bayesian age-model has been generated for the Holocene section of the sediment sequence (Staff et al., 2011; Yamada et al., in revision) from a high-resolution radiocarbon dataset (124 measurements of terrestrial plant macrofossil remains), and provides precise and well-constrained age estimates for identified eruption events. Since the Holocene sediments do not contain visible varves and the chronology is reliant on the 14C dating, identifying precisely dated tephra layers can help improve the Lake Suigetsu chronology at their respective depths. 5. The lake is located in the mid-latitude western Pacific region where the EAM front annually migrates, and thus records the past behaviour of this sensitive climate system. 6. The archive is a key global palaeoenvironmental record (e.g., Nakagawa et al., 2005, 2012), with the lake currently recognised as an auxiliary stratotype for the onset of the Holocene (Walker et al., 2009)."

    "heading": "2.2. Geology of the Lake Suigetsu catchment",
    "text": "Lake Suigetsu, Honshu Island (35 350000N, 135 530000E) is located in a small tectonic basin situated on the western side of the Mikata fault line, adjacent to Wakasa Bay (Fig. 1). It forms the largest of the ‘Mikata Five Lakes’ and is located in the Wakasa Wan QuasiNational Park. Lake Suigetsu covers an area of ~4.3 km2 (with a perimeter of ~10 km and diameter of ~2 km) and has an average water depth of ~34m (Kitagawa and Van der Plicht, 1998a).\nThe lake has a small catchment area that is vegetated by warm mixed-forest and is surrounded by a ring of Palaeozoic hills (maximum elevation 400m) (Kitagawa et al., 1995; Nakagawa et al., 2005). The main tributary feeding the five Mikata lakes is the River Hasu (~10 km in length), which enters on the southeast side of Lake Mikata (Fig. 1b). Water subsequently flows through the Seto Channel into Lake Suigetsu. This channel is particularly shallow (~2m in depth), meaning coarse sediment is deposited or trapped in Lake Mikata before reaching Lake Suigetsu (Nakagawa et al., 2005). This natural filter, means that sediments entering Lake Suigetsu comprise of autochthonous and authigenic material (Schlolaut et al., 2012). These sediment characteristics and the\ngeomorphic protection of the lake mean the sedimentary environment is particularly stable and allows for continuous fine-grain deposition."

    "heading": "2.3. Coring campaigns",
    "text": "The Suigetsu lake sediments have been studied for over two decades, with significant interest sparking with the ‘SG93’ campaign, which obtained a 72.4m piston core from the basal lake sediments (Kitagawa and Van der Plicht, 1998a). This revealed that much of the sequence contained varves (‘nenko’ in Japanese) i.e. seasonal laminations, with alternations of siderite/diatom-rich (lighter coloured) and clay-rich (darker coloured) layers (Fukusawa, 1995; Kitagawa et al., 1995; Kitagawa and Van der Plicht, 1998a). The lake was re-drilled in the summer of 2006 as part of the ‘Lake Suigetsu Varved Sediment Project’ with the aim of obtaining a complete overlapping ‘master’ sedimentary sequence by recovering overlapping cores from four parallel boreholes (A, B, C and D, situated ~20m apart; Fig. 1b) (see Nakagawa et al., 2012). This coring campaign successfully obtained a 73.19m-long composite core (‘SG06’), providing a continuous record of sedimentation spanning the last ~ 150 ka (Nakagawa et al., 2012). The sequence has been extensively radiocarbon (14C) dated and is varved between ~10 and 70 ka, which provides a very high-resolution chronology for this palaeoenvironmental record (Staff et al., 2011; Bronk Ramsey et al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2012; Schlolaut et al., 2012).\nA new coring campaign was undertaken during the summer of 2014 to obtain another continuous core sequence to: i) generate thin-sections for a display at a purpose-built Lake Suigetsu museum, and ii) provide more material for scientific analysis (see Yamada et al., in revision). The coring site was located ~320m east of the SG06 boreholes (Fig. 1b) and was similarly obtained using a hydro-pressure piston sampler, and also a triple sampler for deeper parts. This campaign retrieved a composite overlapping sedimentary sequence again from four boreholes (E, F, G and H) and it spans ~98m, which records ~25m of extra sedimentation compared to SG06, reaching a thick basal gravel. This composite master sequence, named ‘Fukui-SG14’ (‘SG14’ in short), was used for this Holocene cryptotephra investigation. The SG14 sequence (correlation model 30 May '17) has been precisely tied to the SG06 composite core (correlation model 08 May '16) using 361 common marker layers (which include visible tephra layers), permitting the high-precision SG06 chronology to be transferred to the SG14 core (see Yamada et al., in revision)."

    "text": "Hitherto, 31 visible tephra layers from SG06 have been identified and characterised (using major element geochemical analysis), providing a detailed record of East Asian eruption events over the past 150 ka (Smith et al., 2011b, 2013; McLean et al., 2016). These include some of the most widespread tephra layers from southern Japan and South Korea, including the B-Tm, K-Ah, U-Oki, AT, Aso-4, K-Tz, Aso-ABCD and Ata tephra layers.\nFour visible layers were identified from the Holocene section of the SG06 sediments. These include the following tephra layers: SG06-1288 that has been correlated to the U-Oki (U-4) eruption; SG06-0967 which has been correlated to the K-Ah tephra; SG060588 from an unknown eruption source; and SG06-0226 that is correlated to the B-Tm tephra (Smith et al., 2011b, 2013; McLean et al., 2016). During the 2014 coring campaign, several new visible tephra layers were identified (Yamada et al., in revision), including two in the Holocene sediments (SG14-1091 and SG140781) that are characterised and dated herein.\n3. Materials and methods\n3.1. Tephra identification\nThe master SG14 core (composite sequence) was contiguously sub-sampled at a ~5 cm resolution, from the U-Oki tephra to the core top, avoiding the known high-energy event layers (e.g., flood horizons) defined by Yamada et al. (in revision) (see Section 4.1). If elevated shard concentrations were observed in the ~5 cm sample, the sediment was resampled at a 1 cm resolution to determine the precise stratigraphic positioning of the peak. All samples were wet sieved through a 25 mm mesh, and processed using the heavy liquid floatation method outlined by Turney (1998) and Blockley et al. (2005). These samples were prepared alongside blanks to test for possible laboratory contamination. The extraction residues were mounted on slides using Canada Balsam, and glass shards were counted via microscopic examination to quantify the number of shards per gram of dried sediment (shards/gram). The following characteristics were also recorded for the glass shards (Fig. 2):\n(i) Colour (e.g., clear, brown or green) (ii) Size (length of the longest axis of shards in the fraction\nextracted, i.e. >25 mm) (iii) Morphology (e.g., blocky, platy, cuspate or fluted) (iv) Vesicle size (small/microvesicular or large) and density (rich\nor poor) (v) Microlite density (rich or poor)"

The accuracy and precision of these data were assessed using analyses of the MPI-DING reference glasses (Jochum et al., 2006), which were run as secondary standards during all runs of the Lake Suigetsu tephra samples. Analyses of these secondary standards lie within a standard deviation of the preferred values. Data were filtered to remove non-glass analyses, and those with analytical totals <93%. The raw values were normalised (to 100%) for comparative purposes and to account for variable hydration, and are presented as such in all tables and figures.\nProximal glass data from several eruptive units at Mashu, Towada and Kawagodaira volcanoes were analysed using the same procedure to validate tephra correlations. Details of these sampling localities and glass datasets are provided in the Supplementary Material."

SG06 event-free depth(s) (EFD, ver. 29th Jan '11) were used within the age model, which excludes instantaneous deposits >5mm in thickness, i.e. event layers, e.g., floods, and tephra deposits (Staff et al., 2011; Scholaut et al., 2012). The software package developed to handle the correlation of parallel core sections, ‘LevelFinder’ (ver. 7.5.5, http://polsyems.ritspalaeo.com), was used to linearly extrapolate between the common marker layers and determine any given composite depth (CD) or EFD from the individual SG06 and SG14 cores (see Nakagawa et al., 2012; Yamada et al., in revision).\nThe composite Suigetsu sedimentary sequencewas modelled on to the IntCal13 timescale (Reimer et al., 2013) implementing three successive cross-referenced Poisson-process (‘P_Sequence’) depositional models using OxCal (ver. 4.3; Bronk Ramsey, 2008, 2017). These include 775 AMS 14C dates obtained from terrestrial plant macrofossils from the upper 38m (SG06-CD) of the SG93 and SG06\nLake Suigetsu sequence. Glass shards from an individual layer (i.e. primary isochron) both blocky and microvesicular are referred to as pumiceous.\ncores (Kitagawa and Van der Plicht, 1998a; 1998b, 2000; Staff et al., 2011, 2013a, 2013b) and varve counting between 12.88 and 31.67m SG06 CD (Marshall et al., 2012; Schlolaut et al., 2012).\nThe uppermost Holocene sediments, from the core top down to the SG06-1288 (U-Oki) tephra (12.88m SG06 CD, ~10200 cal yrs BP), are not composed of clearly defined and countable varves, and the chronology is instead constrained by 124 14C dates. Several additional chronological constraints are incorporated within the Holocene section of the age model, including a calendar age for the Urami Canal construction (AD 1664± 5 yrs positioned at 87.8 cm SG06-CD; as determined by an influx of marine diatom species into Lake Suigetsu; Saito-Kato et al., 2013), a calendar age for event layer A-01-01c (AD 1976± 2 positioned at 32.5 cm SG06-CD; as determined by varve counting of the uppermost sediments; Suzuki et al., 2016) and a constrained age for the core top (which cannot postdate AD 2006). Three precise tephra-based ages are also included following the findings of this study (see discussion), including a remodelled tree-ring wiggle-matched 14C age for the Kawagodaira Pumice (KGP) tephra (3151e3126 cal yrs BP, 95.4% confidence interval; Tani et al., 2013) imported as a ‘Prior’ within the model (spanning the cryptotephra sampling interval of 484.0e485.0 cm SG06-CD), a historical age for the Izu-Kozushima-Tenjosan (Iz-Kt) eruption (AD 838; spanning the cryptotephra sampling interval 239.1e240.1 cm SG06-CD; Tsukui et al., 2006) and a tree-ring wiggle-matched age for the B-Tm tephra (AD 946± 1; Hakozaki et al., 2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2017) positioned at 225.5 cm SG06-CD.\nCryptotephra layers are usually inserted into age models using the sub-sampling mid-point instead of the depth range and therefore, the date may not be accurate and the precision is overestimated. In this study, we have included this cryptotephra sample depth uncertainty into our age modelling. Our results indicate that the effect on the chronology in this case is negligible, but this modelling approach should be applied in other such cryptotephra studies to account for the full age uncertainty."

    "heading": "4.1. Discriminating primary tephra layers",
    "text": "When interpreting the visible and cryptotephra record, it is necessary to consider the possibility of syn- and post-depositional processes which may: i) obscure the original stratigraphic positioning of the eruption event, and ii) incorporate older or background volcanic glasses that have been reworked and redeposited in the sediments (Davies et al., 2007; Pyne-O’Donnell, 2011).\nSome sedimentary sequences, especially those located too close to a volcanic source, may be unsuitable for cryptotephra analysis, as they might be continuously inundated with ash. High concentrations of tephra shards are often observed following a large explosive eruption that has previously blanketed the catchment with ash, and can produce a large and persistent background of volcanic glass in the lake sediments after the event (e.g., Matsu'ura et al., 2016; Zawalna-Geer et al., 2016). As expected, high concentrations of glass shards are observed in the Lake Suigetsu core sediments following the visible ash layers, for example, after the ~3 cm thick K-Ah tephra (SG06-0967) distinctive platy shards were continuously observed, in excess of 5000 shards/gram, for several metres. However, these concentrations did not obscure the stratigraphic positioning of all primary ash layers deposited during this period, due to contrasting shard morphologies (e.g., peaks in cuspate or vesicular glass shard populations) or colour of subsequent primary ash layers.\nOther peaks in shard concentrations may not always represent in-situ or primary ash input, as shards from older eruptions may be\nreworked from the catchment or local geology during high-energy events (e.g., MacLeod and Davies, 2016). Such high-energy events may be caused by heavy rains or earthquakes, which can erode sediments and thus remobilise older volcanic material from the catchment. These events can usually be visually identified within the core, since they deposit a distinct detrital layer that is typically clay-rich, which contrasts to the authigenically-produced, organicrich sediments that are commonly deposited (Katsuta et al., 2007; Bussmann and Anselmetti, 2010; Swierczynski et al., 2012; Corella et al., 2014).\nSeveral lines of evidence can also be used to distinguish between primary and secondary ash layers that are not accompanied by an obvious high-energy event deposit within the sediment core (Gudmundsd ottir et al., 2011; Abbott et al., 2016). A high-energy or reworking event will typically incorporate volcanic glasses from several older eruptions, meaning the shards will often consist of several morphologies, sizes and geochemical affinities. In the Lake Suigetsu sequence peaks in shard concentrations were ultimately evaluated using a set of criteria outlined in Fig. 3. Glasses from flood horizons, and other positions where shard concentrations were largely constant, were geochemically analysed to establish the background compositional range. Peaks in volcanic glass concentrations were considered to be primary tephra if the shards possessed a consistent morphology, size and geochemical affinity that was different from the known background compositions."

Newly identified ash layers are herein labelled using their SG14 composite depth in cm (SG14-CD, correlation model 30 May '17) that is rounded to the nearest integer. For continuity, SG06 codes are used for the visible tephra layers that were previously identified in the Holocene sections of the SG06 core; SG06-1288 (U-Oki ash), SG06-0967 (K-Ah ash) SG06-0588 and SG06-0226 (B-Tm ash) (Table 1; Smith et al., 2011b, 2013; McLean et al., 2016).\nThe Holocene tephrostratigraphy is described in three zones for simplicity (Fig. 4), and are demarcated by the variable concentrations of background glasses through the core."

    "text": "Zone 3 covers the Early Holocene sedimentation at Lake Suigetsu, spanning from the visible (~2 cm thick) U-Oki tephra (SG06-1288; 13.0m SG14-CD) to the visible (~3 cm thick) K-Ah tephra (SG060967; 9.7m SG14-CD) (Fig. 4). The age-model for the Lake Suigetsu sediments constrains the age of these tephra layers and sediments between ~10.2 and 7.3 cal yrs BP. Within Zone 3, two visible and two cryptotephra primary ash layers are identified and labelled by their SG06/SG14-CD: SG06-1288 (visible layer that was correlated to the U-Oki tephra by Smith et al., 2011b), SG14-1185, SG14-1091 (visible) and SG14-1058. These are dated to 10230e10171 cal yrs BP, 9372e9301 cal yrs BP, 8455e8367 cal yrs BP, and 8166e8099 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval), respectively (Table 1).\nGlass shards in SG06-1288 (U-Oki tephra) are generally ~ 60 mm in length and are clear to medium brown in colour (Fig. 5). The UOki shards have a characteristic pumiceous, microvesicular morphology, which are seen in high concentrations for ~2m (~2 ka) after the primary deposition of the visible layer.\nSG14-1058 is positioned above a known event layer (Yamada et al., submitted), but is deemed a primary tephra isochron since all observed shards possessed a consistent morphology (highly cuspate, with very large elongated vesicles), size and a\nD .M cLean et al./ Q uaternary Science Review s 183 (2018) 36 e 58\n44\nhomogeneous geochemical composition which is distinct from the underlying visible tephras layers. Furthermore, these shard characteristics were not observed in the subsequent 2 metres of older sediments.\nWithin Zone 3, platy shards were observed between ~10.0e10.5m SG14-CD and some clear cuspate glasses were observed between ~11.0 and 13.0m SG14-CD. There is no clear peak in these glass concentrations, suggesting either: i) the primary input is obscured within the background glass concentrations, or ii) the isochron is positioned below the U-Oki tephra layer."

Within Zone 2, three visible and six cryptotephra layers are recognised: visible layer SG06-0967 (previously correlated to the K-Ah tephra by Smith et al., 2013), SG14-0840, SG14-0803, visible layer SG14-0781, SG140704, visible layer SG06-0588 (previously characterised by Smith et al., 2013), SG14-0513, SG14-0490 and SG14-0433.

These shards are seen in high concentrations (>5000 shards/gram) for ~1m of sedimentation following the deposition of the K-Ah visible layer. Since these background glasses are very distinctive, other primary tephra layers with distinctive shard morphologies, such as SG14-0840 (highly cuspate and fluted in shape), were easily identified (Fig. 5)."

    "text": "Late Holocene sedimentation in Zone 1 extends from ~3.7m SG14-CD (2.2 ka) to the core top (Fig. 4), and contains considerably lower concentrations of background glasses than observed in Zone 2. One visible and six cryptotephra layers are found within Zone 1. The visible layer is the previously identified B-Tm tephra associated with the ‘Millennium’ eruption from Changbaishan volcano in China/North Korea (SG06-0226; McLean et al., 2016). Newly identified cryptotephras, labelled using their SG14 composite depths, are: SG14-0373, SG14-0317, SG14-0239, SG14-0221, SG14-0058 and SG14-0024, and are dated to 2192e2117 cal yrs BP, 1815e1735 cal yrs BP, 1183e1111 cal yrs BP, 990e959 cal yrs BP, 204e48 cal yrs BP, 30 to 13 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval), respectively (Table 1).\nThe lower levels of background glasses observed during this period are probably because the majority of the K-Ah tephra has worked its way through the catchment. Since there are lower concentrations of background glasses, small peaks (<2000 shards/ gram) in shard concentrations could be more easily identified. Several further peaks in shard concentrations had shards with variable sizes, morphologies and heterogeneous glass compositions (spanning both typical Kikai and Aira glass chemistries). These peaks (labelled B and C on Fig. 4) are not deemed primary tephra layers and likely represent flood or secondary reworking events."

SG140513, SG14-0373, SG14-0317 and SG14-0058 glass shards could not be analysed as they were too small or had too many microlite inclusions (Fig. 5). Geochemical analyses of background shards were\nexcluded from the presented datasets but are included in the Supplementary Material.\nThemost abundant oxides, SiO2, K2O, CaO, Al2O3 and FeOT (all Fe as FeO) are predominantly used to characterise and discriminate the tephra layers since they can be precisely measured by the electron microprobe. The glass compositions of the Holocene tephra layers in the Lake Suigetsu record range from phonotrachytic to rhyolitic, with the exception of the dacitic SG14-1185 and SG14-0024 tephra layers (Fig. 6). As illustrated in the major element bi-plots and Fig. 6e, the glass compositions of the tephra layers are generally homogenous with narrow compositional ranges, with the exception of those from SG14-1185, SG14-0781 and SG06-0588. Some of these tephras have very similar or indistinguishable major element glass compositions, for example, SG061288, SG14-1091 and SG14-0803.\nThe glasses range from low-K (tholeiitic) through to high-K (calc-alkaline and shoshonitic) compositions (Fig. 7), which can be used to discriminate between the different volcanic regions in East Asia. Back-arc volcanoes in South Korea (Ulleungdo) and North Korea/China (Changbaishan) erupt K2O-rich (>3wt %) glasses, which contrast with eruption deposits fromHokkaido and northern Honshu that typically have <1wt % K2O (Machida and Arai, 2003; Smith et al., 2013). Tephra layers with different ages that possess similar or identical geochemical compositions are likely to represent eruptions from the same or closely located volcano (e.g., Shane, 2000; Smith et al., 2005; Albert et al., 2012, 2017).\nThe glass morphology, relative stratigraphy, geochemical compositions and precise chronology of the tephra layers, were used to correlate the SG14 Holocene isochrons to their volcanic sources and specific eruptions. The glass compositions of the SG14 tephra layers were compared to new (Supplementary Material) and published\ncompositions obtained from proximal outcrops with known eruption deposits. These compositions indicate that the SG14 tephra layers are from the following volcanoes or regions:\n1. North Korea/China: Changbaishan - SG14e1058 and SG06-0226. 2. South Korea: Ulleungdo - SG06e1288, SG14-1091, SG14-0803\nand SG14-0433. 3. Northern Japan: Towada - SG14-0840, and Mashu - SG14-0221. 4.

    "text": "Changbaishan (also referred to as Baitoushan, Baekdusan, Paektu and Hakutosan) volcano is situated on the border of North Korea and China (128 030E, 41 000N), and almost 1000 km NW of Lake Suigetsu (Fig. 1). Despite evidence of numerous highly explosive episodes during the Quaternary (Machida et al., 1990; Lim et al., 2013), and recent seismic activity (Xu et al., 2012), the eruptive history of Changbaishan volcano has not been established (Wei et al., 2003; Ramos et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2017). This is largely due to the difficulties in accessing the proximal outcrops, and that successive eruption deposits are geochemically indistinguishable (Lim et al., 2013). Several eruption deposits, potentially of Holocene\n/SG14 composite depths) compared to proximal glasses originating from the back-arc\n(Changbaishan¼ B-Tm; Chen et al., 2016; McLean et al., 2016), and the Japanese arc\nand Mashu¼Ma-b from this study). Glass analyses are plotted on the whole-rock K-\nproduces high-K (shoshonitic) compositions, which contrast to the eruptive products\nal analyses of SG14-0058, SG14-0373 and SG14-0513 could not be obtained due to their\nrd deviation of repeat analyses of the StHs6/80-G MPI-DING standard glass.\nage have been identified proximally, however this stratigraphy and chronology varies considerably across studies (see Pan et al., 2017). Consequently, distal archives are essential to establish the number of eruptions and date past explosive activity from Changbaishan.\nThe B-Tm tephra (AD 946; Hakozaki et al., 2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2017) is the only confirmed distal layer from Changbaishan Holocene activity. This was dispersed during the highly explosive ‘Millennium’ eruption, which was one of the most violent in the past 2000 years (see Sun et al., 2014b). The B-Tm tephra has been identified in numerous marine, lacustrine and archaeological sequences across central Japan, northeast China and coastal regions of Russia (see McLean et al., 2016). Furthermore, B-Tm glass shards have also been identified in the Greenland ice cores (Sun et al., 2014a). Tephra layer SG06-0226 has previously been correlated to the B-Tm tephra (McLean et al., 2016) and currently presents the most southerly occurrence of this isochron. The precise age (AD 946; Hakozaki et al., 2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2017) is incorporated within the Lake Suigetsu age model to constrain the chronology of the upper portion of the core.\nThe Changbaishan compositions can easily be distinguished from the lower alkali glasses produced from the Japanese arc, and the phonolitic glasses from Ulleungdo, South Korea (Fig. 7). The SG14 core contains an additional isochron (SG14-1058) that has glass compositions that are consistent with those erupted at Changbaishan (Fig. 8). SG14-1058 glass compositions overlap on all major elements with the rhyolitic member of SG06-0226 (B-Tm ash), and glasses from the B-Tm distal type-site (Tomakomai Port; McLean et al., 2016), with SiO2 ranging from 74.5 to 75.3wt %, K2O from 4.4 to 4.6 wt% and CaO ~0.2wt % (Fig. 8b and c). This geochemical affinity is consistent with the identical compositions of older eruptions from Changbaishan, observed as thick deposits in the Sea of Japan (Lim et al., 2014). The Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy therefore provides the first evidence for an additional Holocene eruption from Changbaishan at 8166e8099 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval) (Table 1).\n6.2. Ulleungdo tephra layers (SG06-1288, SG14-1091, SG14-0803 and SG14-0433)\nUlleungdo volcano is an island located in the southwest Japan Sea (37 300N 130 520E), ~110 km from the Korean Peninsula and ~500 km NW of Lake Suigetsu (Fig. 1). Ulleungdo is known to have erupted four times during the Holocene, as determined by proximal deposits identified on the island (Machida et al., 1984; Shiihara et al., 2011). These are proximally named (oldest to youngest): U4, U-3, U-2 and U-1, with the K-Ah tephra positioned between the U-3 and U-2 deposits. The largest known Plinian eruption from Ulleungdo generated the Ulleung-Oki (U-Oki) tephra layer (Machida and Arai,1983; Okuno et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2014), which equates to the proximal U-4 of Shiihara et al. (2011). The U-4 eruption is dated using the Lake Suigetsu chronology to have occurred between 10230 and 10171 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval; Smith et al., 2011b; Staff et al., 2011) (Table 1). The U-3 eruption has been dated (14C of charcoal preserved within the proximal eruption deposits) to 8440e8360 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval; Im et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2014) and the U-2 has been dated to 5749e5604 cal yrs BP (Okuno et al., 2010). The youngest U-1 eruption is considered to be from a small strombolian eruption and has not been dated (Kim et al., 2014).\nThe U-Oki (U-4) tephra is a key widespreadmarker bed found in most sedimentary sequences east of Ulleungdo, in the Sea of Japan and central Honshu (Fig. 1). Distal equivalents of the U-3 eruption have also been reported in the Sea of Japan (TRG1 sediment core; Domitsu et al., 2002), Lake Biwa (Nagahashi et al., 2004) and close to Hakusan volcano, central Honshu (Higashino et al., 2005). U-2\nand U-1 have only been found on the flanks of the volcano (Kim et al., 2014).\nGlass compositions from Ulleungdo are distinctively alkali-rich, containing ~6.5wt % higher K2O, and ~15wt % lower SiO2 (~60wt %) compared to eruptive products from the Japanese arc (Smith et al., 2011b, 2013). Ulleungdo glasses are also typically higher in K2O content than the trachytic (lower SiO2) end-member of Changbaishan eruptive products (Fig. 7). Proximal compositions from the Holocene eruptions of Ulleungdo (U-4, U-3 and U-2) straddle the phonolite-trachyte boundary and appear to be indistinguishable on major and trace element compositions (Shiihara et al., 2011). No glass compositions have been published for the U-1 eruption.\nThree tephra layers in the Lake Suigetsu cores (SG06-1288, SG14-1091 and SG14-0803) contain alkali-rich glasses from Ulleungdo (Fig. 8e and f; Smith et al., 2011b), and represent the distal equivalents of proximal deposits of U-4, U-3 and U-2, respectively. The geochemical compositions obtained from the U-4 (SG06-1288) and U-3 (SG14-1091) glasses preserved in Lake Suigetsu are indistinguishable using major and minor element compositions. However, we find the younger SG14-0803/U-2 glasses are more elevated in CaO (by ~0.5wt %) compared to the early Holocene eruptions, SG06-1288/U-4 and SG14-1091/U-3 (Fig. 8f). Furthermore, SG14-0803/U-2 glass shards contain a greater portion of brown, highly vesicular, pumiceous shards (Fig. 5), which may also help to distinguish this layer from the older Ulleungdo deposits elsewhere. Themodelled ages of SG14-1091 (8455e8367 cal yrs BP) and SG14-0803 (5681e5619 cal yrs BP) (95.4% confidence interval) are in agreement with the published chronological information and further constrain the dates for U-3 and U-2.\nSG14-0433 glass compositions also contain ~60wt % SiO2, but have ~2.5wt % lower K2O, and ~2wt % higher CaO compared to the typical compositions erupted during large explosive eruptions from Ulleungdo (Fig. 8e; Table 2). Since no other volcanoes in this region, especially those along the Japanese arc, produce such evolved compositions; it suggests that SG14-0433 is a distal occurrence of U-1. The age of this tephra (2737e2620 cal yrs BP) is consistent with a repose interval of <3 ka throughout the Holocene."

    "heading": "6.3. Towada (SG14-0840) and Mashu (SG14-0221) tephra layers",
    "text": "Towada is a large caldera, situated in northern Honshu (40 280N 140 520E), ~700 km NE of Lake Suigetsu (Fig. 1). Towada has erupted repeatedly throughout the Holocene, the largest of which dispersed the Towada-Chuseri (To-Cu) ash across northern Honshu and the coastal regions of the Pacific (Machida and Arai, 2003, Fig. 1). In proximal localities, three eruptive units are recognised in the To-Cu sequence, an opening Plinian fall (named Chuseri), which is overlain by the Kanagasawa pumice fall and topped by the Utarube ash, a dilute pyroclastic density current (PDC), deposit (Hayakawa, 1983). All three units of To-Cu are predominantly recorded to the east of the volcano (Hayakawa, 1983, Fig. 1).\nThe To-Cu eruption is proximally dated to 6293e6029 cal yrs BP based upon a 14C age of charcoal fragments preserved in the dilute PDC deposits (Hayakawa, 1983). Furthermore, the soil beneath the To-Cu is dated to 6313e6180 cal yrs BP (Inoue et al., 2011), providing a maximum age constraint for the eruption. As observed for other volcanoes situated in northern Honshu and Hokkaido, the tholeiitic glasses from Towada contain low K2O (<1.5wt %) and between 5 and 6wt % total alkalis (Fig. 9). Glass analyses of the three proximal units from To-Cu (Supplementary Material) show that the Plinian Chuseri pumice fall deposits are more homogenous than the overlying Kanegasawa and Utarube eruptive units (Fig. 9d; Supplementary material).\nThe SG14-0840 glasses are geochemically indistinguishable from the proximal compositions of the To-Cu ash (Fig. 9); in\nparticular the glass at Lake Suigetsu sit within the tight geochemical range of the Chuseri Plinian pumice fall (Fig. 9d). This suggests that only ash from the initial Plinian phase of the eruption reached Lake Suigetsu/central Honshu. The Lake Suigetsu age model provides an eruption age of To-Cu of 5986e5899 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval; Table 1), which is marginally younger than proposed by Hayakawa (1983).\nMashu volcano (43 350N 144 310E) is situated on the eastern side of Kutcharo caldera in eastern Hokkaido (Fig. 1) and is 1160 km NE of Lake Suigetsu. The most recent phase of activity (during the cone building) at Mashu volcano produced three widespread distal ash layers: Ma-c2, Ma-c1 and Ma-b, the youngest (Ma-b) was a large eruption with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI; Newhall and Self, 1982) of 5, which ejected 4.6 km3 DRE (dense rock equivalent) of magma (Kishimoto et al., 2009). This Ma-b eruption dispersed ash directly southwards (Machida and Arai, 2003), and forms an isochronous marker in several palaeoenvironmental and archaeological sequences in eastern Hokkaido (Wada et al., 2001; Nakagawa et al., 2002; Nakamura et al., 2009). The Ma-b eruption is dated to have occurred between 976 and 774 cal yrs BP (AD 974e1176; Shoji and Masui, 1974).\nGlasses erupted during the Holocene activity of Mashu are very low in K2O (<1wt %) (Nakamura, 2016) and ~0.5wt % lower than glass compositions from Towada volcano (Fig. 9; Supplementary Material). The proximal deposits of the Ma-b eruption have homogenous glass compositions (~73wt % SiO2, ~13wt % Al2O3 and ~3wt % CaO; Supplementary Material). Geochemically, the tholeiitic glasses of SG14-0221 are indistinguishable from those of the Ma-b tephra, confirming Mashu (Ma-b) is the source of this ash fall event in Lake Suigetsu. The Lake Suigetsu age model provides the most precise age for the Ma-b eruption (due to the chronological constraint imposed on this portion of the Lake Suigetsu record by the B-Tm ash, dated to AD 946; Hakozaki et al., 2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2017), of 990e958 cal yrs BP (AD 960e992; 95.4% confidence interval)."

    "text": "Kawagodaira (34 510N 138 580E) is situated on the northwest slope of Amagi volcano, and forms part of the Izu-Tobu cluster of cones on the Izu Peninsula, 290 kmE of Lake Suigetsu (Fig. 1). The Kawagodaira pumice (KGP) was dispersed during a mid-Holocene eruption from this volcano, and forms a marker layer in sedimentary archives across the central and western parts of Honshu (Ikeya et al., 1990; Shimada, 2000; Takemura et al., 2010, Fig. 1). The KGP tephra layer is very precisely dated by radiocarbon wigglematching of a Japanese cedar timber, which was found charred within pyroclastic density deposits of the eruption (Tani et al., 2013), to 3151e3126 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval).\nGlasses preserved in proximal deposits of the KGP ash span a broad compositional range, with SiO2 from 77.1 to 77.8wt %, CaO from 1.5 to 1.6wt %, and K2O from 2.6 to 2.8 wt % (Fig. 10a and b; Supplementary Material). The SG14-0490 glasses share the same composition, providing a confident correlation to the KGP. The existing Lake Suigetsu age model provides an age of 3227e3129 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval) for the distal KGP tephra (SG14-0490), which overlaps with the wiggle-matched age of the cedar wood from the PDC deposits (Tani et al., 2013). This wiggle-matched age is very precise and therefore, was incorporated into the updated Lake Suigetsu agemodel presented herein to further constrain the chronology of this portion of the core stratigraphy.\nKozushima (34 120N 139 090E), a volcanic island on the Izu arc, 340 kmE of Lake Suigetsu (Fig. 1), has erupted 18 rhyolitic lava\ndomes that have also been accompanied by explosive phases. The youngest dome, Tenjo-san, was last active during AD 838, which dispersed the distal ash Izu-K ozushima-Tenjosan (Iz-Kt) tephra westwards (Machida and Arai, 2003). The age of this eruption is recorded in several historical documents including the Shoku Nihon Koki, an officially commissioned Japanese historical text (Tsukui et al., 2006). Distally, the Iz-Kt is difficult to stratigraphically and geochemically distinguish from the Niijima-Mukai-yama (Iz-Nm) tephra (Sugiuchi and Kukuoka, 2005; Kobayashi et al., 2007; Suzuki et al., 2017; Tsuchiya et al., 2017), which was dispersed during an eruption from Niijima volcanic island (20 km north of Kozushima) and believed to have occurred in AD 886 (Tsukui et al., 2006).\nSG14-0239 glasses overlap the average glass compositions known for both Iz-Kt and Iz-Nm ash layers (Fig. 10a and b; Suzuki et al., 2017; Sugiuchi and Kukuoka, 2005). The existing Lake Suigetsu age model provides an age of AD 839e767 (95.4% confidence interval) for the SG14-0239 tephra, which overlaps with the Iz-Kt historical age, and suggests SG14-0239 is too young to correlate to the Iz-Nm tephra. This precise historical age of AD 838 is now incorporated into the Lake Suigetsu age model herein at the position of the SG14-0239/Iz-Kt tephra to further constrain the chronology of this portion of the core."

    "text": "Kikai caldera (30 470N 130 180E) is an active volcano situated 50 km south of Kyushu (Fig. 1) and was responsible for the most recent VEI 7 Japanese eruption, which dispersed the Kikai-Akahoya (K-Ah) ash over much of Japan, the Sea of Japan, the Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea (Machida and Arai, 1983). This was one of the largest eruptions during the Holocene, alongside the Changbaishan ‘Millennium’, Mazama (Crater Lake; Bacon and Lanphere, 2006) and Minoan (Santorini; Watkins et al., 1978) eruptions. The SG06-0967 layer at Lake Suigetsu is correlated to the K-Ah ash (Fig. 10c and d; Smith et al., 2013) and was deposited between 7307 and 7196 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval).\nThe Lake Suigetsu K-Ah glass compositions are geochemically homogenous, with SiO2 ranging from 72.6 to 74.6wt %, K2O from 2.8 to 3.0wt % and CaO from 1.8 to 2.3 wt % (Fig. 10c and d; Smith et al., 2013). However, glass chemistries obtained by Smith et al. (2013) from medial ash deposits suggests that the K-Ah eruption was more heterogeneous in SiO2, ranging from 70.4 to 77.8wt %. Interestingly, the younger SG14-0704 glass compositions overlap with the less evolved end-member of the K-Ah medial tephra (Smith et al., 2013, Fig. 10c), which suggests that the SG14-0704 tephra could correlate to another eruption from Kikai caldera. SG14-0704 is dated to 4894e4827 cal yrs BP (95.4% confidence interval) via the Lake Suigetsu chronology, which does not correlate to any known eruption events from Kikai (Moriwaki et al., 2016). Many of the Holocene eruptions from in and around Kyushu Island are poorly dated and lack detailed geochemical data, which means it is problematic to robustly correlate these events. Additional geochemical datasets are required from proximal deposits in the south of Japan to strengthen this potential correlation."

Visible tephra layers with similar compositions are also observed in the older SG06 sediments (Smith et al., 2013), suggesting that they are older eruptions from the same volcanic source/s or region. Both SG14-0781 and SG06-0588 contain shards\nwith similar morphologies (i.e. pumiceous and densely vesicular), which are also observed in SG14-0513, SG14-0373 and SG14-0058 cryptotephra layers. Chronologically, SG14-0781 and SG06-0588 are consistent with ages of known Holocene eruptions at Sambe volcano (Fig. 1), the Shigaku S2 and Taiheisan tephra layers (Fukuoka and Matsui, 2002), but there are no proximal datasets for these units. The geochemical assessments of these layers and other pre-Holocene activity at Sambe are further explored by Albert et al., (under review).\nSG14-1185 glass compositions are not consistent with those known from Japan or from Changbaishan or Ulleungdo (Fig. 7), and therefore may originate from a more distal volcanic source. The compositional range is similar to glasses from Kamchatka (Ponomareva et al., 2017), however slight differences in FeOT, Na2O\nand CaO place SG14-1185 on a different evolutionary trend and preclude a correlation at this time. The source of this tephra layer is currently unknown, and it could represent a very far-travelled ash layer."

    "heading": "7.1. An integrated tephrostratigraphic framework",
    "text": "The Lake Suigetsu record provides the most comprehensive Holocene tephrostratigraphy for the East Asian/Pacific region, with twenty isochrons from at least nine different volcanic centres (Fig. 11). This new framework precisely dates and integrates ash layers from across Japan, South Korea (Ulleungdo volcano) and\nNorth Korea/China (Changbaishan volcano), and therefore is a key tephrostratotype for correlating and dating records in this region (Fig. 12). These results clearly demonstrate the potential of cryptotephra analysis, even in a productive arc setting, to identify new isochrons from distal sources and provide new insights into the dispersal characteristics and age of these eruptions.\nThe cryptotephra study from Lake Suigetsu has significantly extended the known ash dispersal of numerous key Holocene marker layers, including the Ma-b, Iz-Kt, To-Cu, U-2 and U-3 tephra layers, and has also identified tephra from eruptions with primary plume dispersals in the opposite direction (e.g., To-Cu; Fig. 1). Previously, the Ma-b ash had only been found in SE Hokkaido, but is now confirmed over 1100 km from its source as a cryptotephra marker in the Lake Suigetsu SG14 core. This establishes the Ma-b tephra as one of the most widely dispersed Japanese Holocene isochrons, and suggests that it may be preserved in more terrestrial and marine sedimentary sequences across East Asia.\nIn this study, we have discovered several new previously unreported ash layers, which have now been incorporated within the master tephrostratigraphic framework for this region. One\npreviously unknown eruption from Changbaishan is now confirmed (dated to 8166e8099 cal yrs BP; 95.4% confidence interval), which provides significant development in resolving the poorly constrained explosive history of this volcano. These previously unreported distal ash layers are either from eruptions that are not preserved in the proximal eruption sequences, or the reported ages from the proximal deposits are incorrect."

    "heading": "7.2. Resolving the tempo of East Asian volcanism",
    "text": "The exceptional chronology of the Lake Suigetsu sediments enables us to provide precise and constrained eruption ages for the tephra layers (Table 1). This chronology has improved the eruption ages for many significant explosive events, such as the large (VEI 5) Holocene eruption of Mashu (Ma-b tephra), which now has a reduced uncertainty of 32 years, as compared to the previous 202 year range (95.4% confidence interval). The improved eruption ages for many of these key widespread ash layers can now be incorporated into other site-specific age models containing these markers, meaning it may be of significant benefit to specifically search for\nsuch isochrons in these records. Furthermore, since many of these marker layers were dispersed across the Pacific and/or the Sea of Japan, like those originating from Ulleungdo, our terrestriallybased ages can be used to circumvent reservoir offsets that result in inaccurate radiocarbon-based marine chronologies (e.g., Ikehara et al., 2011).\nThe detailed Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy has significant importance for hazard assessment studies in the East Asian/Pacific region. For example, Suigetsu is the first distal record to unequivocally contain, characterise and date three successive Holocene\neruptions from Ulleungdo (U-4, U-3, and U-2 tephra layers) and most likely contains the first distal evidence of the U-1 event. The uncertainty of the U-2 eruption has now been significantly reduced (by ~ 25 years), which indicates that there was a repose interval of ~2.8 ka following the U-3 eruption. If SG14-0433 is confirmed as a tephra isochron of the U-1 eruption, a very similar repose interval of ~3.0 ka is also calculated. It is likely that the older sediments of Lake Suigetsu may also preserve a detailed record of Quaternary volcanism from Ulleungdo, which can permit a further understanding of the tempo and frequency of this volcanic centre.\nIn general, the Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy suggests that an ash fall reached the central Honshu region at least once every 500 years throughout the Holocene. We suggest that these must have been at least VEI 4 events to be recorded as cryptotephra layers in Lake Suigetsu. It is clear that cryptotephra analysis in highresolution distal archives can be used to provide additional information on these smaller eruption events that currently appear to be missing from the geological record (Kiyosugi et al., 2015). These findings are of significant importance for risk assessments in East Asia. For instance, the ‘International Atomic Energy Agency’ require a detailed catalogue of past Holocene ash fall events to be compiled (e.g., eruption frequency, tephra thickness and direction of\ndispersal) before power plant construction is considered (Aspinall et al., 2016)."

    "heading": "7.3. Layers for synchronising palaeoenvironmental records",
    "text": "The most valuable tephra layers for palaeoenvironmental research are those which are i) regionally widespread, ii) possess a unique geochemical signature, iii) are precisely dated, and iv) occur at, or bracket a climate/cultural change. A key example from East Asia is the B-Tm ash, since it is identified across the Northern hemisphere (reaching Greenland; Sun et al., 2014b), is precisely dated to AD 946 (Hakozaki et al., 2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2017), is\neasily distinguished by its heterogeneous high-K composition, and occurs stratigraphically close to the onset of the Medieval Warm Period. The updated Holocene tephrostratigraphy from Lake Suigetsu indicates that there are several other widespread, geochemically unique, and now precisely dated isochrons that could be used to test and assess a range of questions relating to palaeoenvironmental change and drivers of the climate. For example, an abrupt cooling transition is known to have occurred ~8.2 ka yrs BP (widely known as the ‘8.2 event’) via proxy records in Greenland (Fig. 11) and across the North Atlantic region (see Alley et al., 1997). The global synchronicity and duration of this event remains widely debated, however a similar abrupt cold event is dated to have occurred at 8.21± 0.05 kyr BP in China (Cheng et al., 2009). The newly identified Changbaishan ash layer, dated to 8166e8099 cal yrs BP (Fig. 12), could therefore offer an important isochron to improve the chronology of palaeoclimate records in Japan, and assess any synchronous environmental changes during this time. It is therefore of significant importance to continue to search for ash layers in other palaeoenvironmental sites in the East Asian/Pacific region, which can permit a new perspective on such long-standing climate questions."

    "heading": "8. Conclusions",
    "text": "This study provides the first detailed Holocene cryptotephra study for the East Asian/Pacific region, and highlights the ability to identify distal ash layers in a productive arc setting. Primary ash layers can be resolved even in lacustrine sediments that contain high concentrations of background glasses, if they contain distinctive shard morphologies and/or unique geochemical compositions. The Lake Suigetsu Holocene tephrostratigraphy provides themost comprehensive record to date of volcanism from East Asia, and is able to integrate twenty ash layers from a range of eruption magnitudes. As a result, these findings have now significantly extended the known ash dispersal of numerous key Holocene marker layers, including the Ma-b ash (Mashu), which is now identified over 1100 km from its source, and thus forms one of the most widely dispersed Japanese isochrons.\nThe Lake Suigetsu chronology is able to provide constrained eruption ages for all twenty ash layers, which offer a new insight into the frequency of explosive events from many of the volcanoes, including more precise repose intervals. These isochrons can now be robustly used to date and synchronise sedimentary records across Japan. Several of these stratigraphically constrain the onset and occurrence of rapid climate anomalies that occurred during the Holocene, and could provide a better understanding of climate drivers in this region. More work is required to robustly constrain the dispersal boundaries of these isochrons, with additional proximal glass geochemical datasets essential to testing future regional and hemispheric scale tephra correlations."

  "abstractText": "Tephra (volcanic ash) layers have the potential to synchronise disparate palaeoenvironmental archives on regional to hemispheric scales. Highly productive arc regions, like those in East Asia, offer a considerable number of widespread isochrons, but before records can be confidently correlated using these layers, a refined and integrated framework of these eruptive events is required. Here we present the first highresolution Holocene cryptotephra study in East Asia, using the Lake Suigetsu sedimentary archive in central Japan. The Holocene tephrostratigraphy has been extended from four to twenty ash layers using cryptotephra extraction techniques, which integrates the deposits from explosive eruptions from North Korea/China, South Korea and along the Japanese arc. This Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy is now the most comprehensive record of East Asian volcanism, and the linchpin site for correlating sequences across this region. Major element glass geochemical compositions are presented for the tephra layers in the sequence, which have been compared to proximal datasets to correlate them to their volcanic source and specific eruptions. This study has significantly extended the ash dispersal of many key Holocene marker layers, and has identified the first distal occurrence of isochrons from Ulleungdo and Changbaishan volcanoes. Utilising the high-precision Lake Suigetsu chronology, we are able to provide constrained eruption ages for the tephra layers, which can be transferred into other site-specific age models containing these markers. This new framework indicates that several isochrons stratigraphically bracket abrupt climate intervals in Japan, and could be used to precisely assess the regional and hemispheric synchronicity of these events. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
