    "text": "In the context of current global warming, reconstruction of climate history based on sedimentary archives, isotope geochemistry, and numerical modeling is of major interest because it allows comparison with current climate change in terms of rapidity, magnitude, origin, and potential consequences. During the past two decades, oxygen and carbon isotope analyses (δ18O and δ13C) performed on wellpreserved marine fossils have highlighted major changes in seawater temperature, carbon cycle, and polar ice volume during the Phanerozoic (e.g., Zachos et al., 2001). For example, δ18O data measured on biostratigraphically welldated bivalves (Brigaud et al., 2008), belemnites (van de Schootbrugge et al., 2005), brachiopods (Suan et al., 2010), ammonites (Wierzbowski and Joachimski, 2007), and fi sh teeth (Dera et al., 2009b; Lécuyer et al., 2003) from European domains have challenged former views of an equable and warm Jurassic climate with a low latitudinal gradient (Frakes et al., 1992). However, paleoclimatic changes inferred from isotopic records data may be questioned because, in spite of noisy δ18O time series, the trends were never statistically tested. In addition, oxygen isotope signals measured on various biological hardparts may be discordant owing to nonequilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation of extinct organisms and/or differences in paleoecological behaviors of taxa (McArthur et al., 2007). Studies embracing the entire Jurassic interval (200–145 Ma) are scarce (Jenkyns et al., 2002), although they are required to identify the processes responsible for long-term δ18O variations during this time period characterized by continental break-up and major volcanic events."

    "text": "We present an extensive δ18O database covering the entire Jurassic and we use statistical methods, rarely applied to geochemical time series, both to test the robustness of warming and cooling events suggested in previous studies and to identify possible longer term climate trends. Our data set is based on an exhaustive compilation of 2809 published oxygen and carbon isotope values measured on various pristine fossil shells (see the GSA Data Repository1). All shells derive from the European realm representing shallow epicontinental seas (<200 m in depth) of the subtropical northwest Tethyan area. The data set was supplemented by 127 new analyses performed on Pliensbachian–Toarcian belemnites and Tithonian oysters from northern and eastern France (see the Data Repository). The geochemical data are constrained to the ammonite biozone resolution (~0.5 to 1 m.y. on average) to generate reliable temporal series calibrated to numerical ages of the time scale of Ogg et al. (2008). For paleoclimate reconstructions, only δ18O data measured on wellpreserved belemnite rostra (n = 1926) and cal-\ncitic bivalve shells (n = 759) were considered, as these data sets constitute the most continuous geochemical records. The “SiZer” statistical approach (signifi cant zero crossings of the derivatives; Marron and Chaudhuri, 1998) is used to compare δ18O patterns of the two organisms and to detect signifi cant climatic trends (see the Data Repository). This method is based on the construction of curves fi tting time series using different levels of smoothing (h). The fi rst derivatives of each curve (i.e., the slopes) are simultaneously computed with their 95% confi - dence intervals, allowing the signs of derivative estimates to be statistically tested. The results of multiple tests are then reported under the form of SiZer maps with different colors that enable simultaneously signifi cant features to be identifi ed at different time scales (Fig. 1). This includes rapid δ18O variations (0.5 < h < 1 m.y.), as well as middle- to long-term trends spanning several million years. Features detected below the temporal resolution boundary (<0.5 m.y.) are not considered."

    "text": "Independently of the smoothing resolution, the SiZer maps based on belemnite and bivalve δ18O values depict signifi cant trends that, despite differences in absolute δ18O values and the amplitude of major variations (Fig. 1A), are fairly concordant during overlap intervals such as the Middle and Late Jurassic (Figs. 1B and 1C). Some divergence can be observed during the late Kimmeridgian and Tithonian, possibly because the data are too sparse. At high frequency (0.5 < h < 1 m.y.), only three short events (periods f, k, m; Fig. 1) are not recorded by belemnite rostra. Except during the Tithonian, belemnites generally display higher δ18O values than bivalves (with an offset varying between 0.5‰ and 1.5‰) and lower amplitudes in δ18O fl uctuations. This difference may be related to the ecological behavior of Jurassic belemnites, which are generally considered as nektobenthic cephalopods that were able to swim in deeper and cooler waters less affected by temperature fl uctuations (e.g., Wierzbowski and Joachimski, 2007).

    "heading": "LONG-TERM CHANGES IN δ18O",
    "text": "The SiZer analysis of both data sets attests to the occurrence of middle- to long-term variations in δ18O (~2–10 m.y.), including a signifi - cant δ18O decrease during the Early Jurassic, a progressive increase during the Middle Jurassic, and a second decrease during the Late Jurassic (Figs. 1B and 1C). These changes are related to two phases with relatively homogeneous δ18O values of −2‰ during the Toarcian (belemnites) and the late Oxfordian–early Tithonian interval (bivalves), separated by steady high δ18O values of ~0‰ during the Middle Jurassic (Fig. 1A). It is interesting that time intervals characterized by negative δ18O values roughly correspond to periods of protracted and intensive magmatism in the Karoo-Ferrar (Jourdan et al., 2007) and northeast Asian igneous provinces (Wang et al., 2006) (Fig. 2E). By promoting high pCO2 levels, repetitive volcanic pulses could have both maintained warmer climatic conditions over relatively long time periods and favored high freshwater runoffs, leading to regional water freshening and low seawater δ18O values refl ected in biogenic calcite δ18O. These increases in riverine inputs are supported by contemporary rises in 87Sr/86Sr ratios, indicating relatively high continental weathering rates during the Toarcian and the Late Jurassic (Fig. 2C). Conversely, high-latitude glacial deposits such as tillites, dropstones, and glendonites are reported during episodes of relative volcanic quiescence (Price, 1999), in conjunction with high δ18O values (Fig. 2D). This congruence points to the possible waxing of polar ice caps over long periods, enriching seawater in 18O. In relation with global temperature modulation, changes in ice volume could in part explain the major shifts in δ18O before and after the Toarcian and late Oxfordian–early Tithonian anomalies. Nevertheless, mechanisms related to the incipient opening of the central Atlantic and Ligurian Oceans at the end of the Toarcian cannot be excluded as an explanation for Middle Jurassic high δ18O values. Enhanced production of oceanic crust may have induced high-temperature alteration processes and hydrothermal venting, and contributed to high seawater δ18O values (Jaffrés et al., 2007). Both scenarios imply that the calculation of absolute paleotemperatures using a constant seawater δ18O for the Jurassic is problematic, owing to the complexity of processes modulating seawater δ18O variations.\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/39/3/215/3540135/215.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\nGEOLOGY, March 2011 217"

    "heading": "SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN δ18O",
    "text": "In parallel, the SiZer maps computed for δ18O time series of both fossil organisms allow a statistical evaluation of 13 rapid δ18O changes (0.5 < h < 1 m.y.) previously reported by different studies (e.g., Jenkyns, 2003) (Figs. 1B and 1C). These include transient decreases in δ18O during the early Pliensbachian (a), early Toarcian (c), early Bajocian (f), Bathonian-Callovian transition (h), early–middle Oxfordian (j), and late Oxfordian (l), as well as rapid δ18O rises during the late Pliensbachian (b), middle-late Toarcian transition (d), Toarcian-Aalenian transition (e), late Bajocian–early Bathonian (g), middle–late Callovian (i), middle Oxfordian (k), and middlelate Toarcian transition. Other changes in oxygen isotopes, such as the decrease in δ18O in the late Toarcian (Gómez et al., 2008), are not statistically validated and require further investigation. Small but signifi cant variations of 0.5‰– 1‰ (i.e., a, b, d, g, h, k) correspond, if solely explained in terms of temperature, to changes in seawater temperature of 1–4 °C (Fig. 1A). In contrast, changes in δ18O recorded during the early Toarcian, Toarcian-Aalenian transition, middle–late Callovian, late Oxfordian, and Tithonian (i.e., c, e, i, l, m) appear more drastic, with calculated temperature variations exceeding 8 °C. Such climatic changes are unlikely for subtropical environments, which are usually less sensitive to temperature fl uctuations than polar areas. As proposed here and in previous work (Saelen et al., 1996; Suan et al., 2010), disturbances of the global water cycle, including enhanced freshwater inputs, strong evaporation, and the waxing and waning of ice caps, could have induced regional or global changes in seawater δ18O, resulting in underestimations or overestimations of temperature fl uctuations. Independent of recorded oxygen isotope fl uctuations, higher abundances of kaolinite, a clay mineral typical of tropical, warm, and humid conditions, have been reported in marine sediments in parallel with transient decreases in δ18O (Dera et al., 2009a). Most of the inferred climatic changes are also mirrored in latitudinal migrations of marine faunas in the northwest Tethys (Dromart et al., 2003; van de Schootbrugge et al., 2005). This correspondence between geochemical, faunal, and mineralogical proxies supports a climatic interpretation for the δ18O variations recorded in the northwest Tethyan domain, therefore excluding major biases related to diagenesis or paleoenvironmental and bathymetric changes. Data from other domains such as the Panthalassa and Arctic seas are, however, crucial to decipher the global versus regional scale of changes (Price and Rogov, 2009), as well as to evaluate paleoclimatic gradients."

    "heading": "ORIGINS OF RAPID WARMING AND COOLING EVENTS",
    "text": "The brief duration of climatic changes (0.5–1 m.y.) in the Jurassic implies relatively short-lived paleoenvironmental disturbances at geological scale. Among the principal causes of warming events, rises both in atmospheric pCO2 and other greenhouse gases have been suggested, mostly in relation with the destabilization of methane gas hydrates (Jenkyns, 2003). These processes were put forward by the identifi cation of transient negative carbon isotope excursions observed in most carbonate reservoirs (e.g., Hesselbo et al., 2007; Padden et al., 2001) during the early Toarcian, early Bajocian, and middle Oxfordian (Fig. 2B; yellow arrows). However, as these anomalies mostly occur at the end of warming trends (i.e., c, f, j), we suggest\nDownloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/39/3/215/3540135/215.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019\n218 GEOLOGY, March 2011\nthat the destabilization of clathrates may rather represent a consequence of previous warming events. As several transient magmatic events occurred during the Jurassic (Fig. 2E), the frequency of volcanic pulses could explain the rhythm of pCO2 increases and related warm episodes, at short and long time scales. To test for this causal relationship, it is crucial to obtain further radiometric dating of volcanic events well calibrated with an improved biostratigraphic framework. However, not all warming events seem to be linked to carbon cycle disturbances as, based on the evidence of neodymium isotope data, variations in oceanic currents linked to the break-up of Pangea could explain changes in seawater temperature at the end of the early Pliensbachian (Dera et al., 2009b) (Fig. 2F).\nThe causes of Jurassic cooling events are still obscure. By analogy with major Phanerozoic glaciations, lowering of atmospheric pCO2 may be invoked. As supposed for the late Callovian cold interval (Dromart et al., 2003), elevated silicate weathering rates, nutrient infl uxes, high primary productivity, and organic matter burial during warm intervals are often considered relevant mechanisms to promote subsequent CO2 drawdown. These feedback models seem convincing, since most Jurassic cold phases were preceded by warm conditions favoring black shale or coal deposition and, as a consequence, positive carbon isotope excursions (Fig. 2B). However, quantifi cation of carbon storage and numerical modeling are required to confi rm this scenario, as well as calculations integrating the role of changes in carbonate production rate."

    "text": "The SiZer method identifi es statistically signifi cant δ18O variations during the Jurassic at various time scales. We interpret these fl uctuations as the result of long- and short-term climate changes, including both temperature and water cycle parameters. We also suggest that protracted magmatic activity in the KarooFerrar and Asian igneous provinces could have promoted prolonged climate disturbances during the Toarcian and the late Oxfordian–early Tithonian interval, refl ected by the absence of polar ice caps."

In relation with global temperature modulation, changes in ice volume could in part explain the major shifts in δ18O before and after the Toarcian and late Oxfordian–early Tithonian anomalies. Nevertheless, mechanisms related to the incipient opening of the central Atlantic and Ligurian Oceans at the end of the Toarcian cannot be excluded as an explanation for Middle Jurassic high δ18O values. Enhanced production of oceanic crust may have induced high-temperature alteration processes and hydrothermal venting, and contributed to high seawater δ18O values (Jaffrés et al., 2007). Both scenarios imply that the calculation of absolute paleotemperatures using a constant seawater δ18O for the Jurassic is problematic, owing to the complexity of processes modulating seawater δ18O variations.
