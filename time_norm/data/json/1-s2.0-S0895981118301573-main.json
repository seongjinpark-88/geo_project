The coordinated study of sediments and paleosols of this unit allows (1) reconstruction of environmental conditions and landscape evolution, and (2) determination of the interplay of the main forcing factors in the evolution of the Kokuel-Kaike Formation. The landscape reconstruction attests to the existence of a loessic rolling plain drained by a subordinate fluvial system, composed of both unconfined and confined flows, with locally ponded areas. Over these, thick stacked cumulative paleo-Ultisols and vertic paleo-Ultisols developed with scarce simple and stacked compound vitric Entisols analogues and compound Inceptisols equivalents. This high-resolution sedimentological-pedological analysis of the Kokuel-Kaike Formation indicates that the interplay between episodic volcaniclastic supply and cyclic climate controlled landscape evolution and soil development."

    "text": "Analysis of paleosols and their various formation processes provides information about ancient environmental conditions, such as parent material, topographic relief, climate, organisms and time (e.g. Jenny, 1941; Retallack, 2001; Buol et al., 2011). Integration of paleopedological and sedimentological data provides a tool for reconstruction of environmental conditions and processes operating at different scales, and also helps to recreate the evolution of the landscape and describe the main forcing factors that control such evolution (e.g. Kraus and Aslan, 1999; Hamer et al., 2007; Varela et al., 2012; Beilinson and Raigemborn, 2013; Flaig et al., 2013; Di Celma et al., 2015; Kraus et al., 2015; Opluštil et al., 2015; Basilici et al., 2016). These studies are mainly based on fluvial or alluvial systems with stacked paleosols, and are most common in Quaternary loess–paleosol sequences (e.g. Kemp, 2001; Muhs and Bettis, 2003; Gocke et al., 2014). As a result, studies of pre-Quaternary paleosols associated with tephric input in eolian-dominated fluvial systems are relatively rare (Parrish, 1998; Bellosi, 2010; Bellosi and Krause,\n2014). At the same time studies on remote fluvial/alluvial systems impacted by distal volcaniclastic materials are currently very few (Smith, 1988; Nakayama and Yoshikawa, 1997; Kataoka and Nakajo, 2002; Kataoka, 2005; Umazano et al., 2008; Kataoka et al., 2009). In alluvial systems distant from the sea, climate and/or tectonics, rather than sealevel fluctuations, are the major controls on sedimentation and paleosol development (e.g. Kraus, 1999; Kraus and Aslan, 1999; Bellosi, 2010). Climate exerts a strong control on changes in fluvial systems and their stratigraphic architecture due to changes in hydrology, which influences the amount of water available for fluvial processes and controls the kind of vegetation cover (Cecil, 2003; Cecil et al., 2003; Kraus et al., 2015; Opluštil et al., 2015). However, volcanic influx plays an important role in controlling distal volcaniclastic successions (Smith, 1991; Kataoka and Nakajo, 2002; Paredes et al., 2007; Umazano et al., 2008, 2012; Kataoka et al., 2009) and associated pedogenesis (e.g. Bellosi, 2010; Bellosi and Krause, 2014).\nThe Koluel-Kaike Formation (KKFm), an early Paleogene distal volcaniclastic succession in Argentine Patagonia, includes different stacked\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsames.2018.07.001 Received 10 April 2018; Received in revised form 4 July 2018; Accepted 5 July 2018\n∗ Corresponding author.

In a previous study, Krause et al. (2010) described paleosol types and their temporal distribution throughout the KKFm in the northern area of the San Jorge Basin (Fig. 1A) and linked them to the tropical climate prevailing during the early Eocene. A fairly detailed reconstruction of these conditions, based on mineralogical assemblages, appears in Raigemborn et al. (2014). In both works, a shift in climate from humid and warm to subhumid and temperate conditions was established from abiotic proxies. However, a detailed landscape analysis—including a complete reconstruction of environmental conditions, sedimentological and pedological processes and their evolution, and the interplay of the main forcing factors—was not attempted. This high-resolution sedimentological and pedological analysis of the KKFm in the southern portion of the San Jorge Basin (Fig. 1A and B) aims at reconstructing sedimentary paleoenvironments and landscape evolution, and establishing the role that the control factors played in the evolution of the paleosol-dominated distal volcaniclastic system (Fig. 1C). These objectives were addressed by conducting analyses of these paleosol-bearing deposits, and performing a high-resolution paleosol study to establish which soil-forming factors and paleopedological processes controlled their formation. This research leads to identification of features and factors that may be used to interpret other distal pedogenically-modified volcaniclastic successions worldwide."

    "text": "The study area is located along the South Flank of the San Jorge Basin (Fig. 1B), an extensional intracontinental basin in southern\nArgentina that developed on Paleozoic continental crust linked to the Gondwana break-up. From the early Paleocene (Danian) to the middle Eocene (Lutetian) (Clyde et al., 2014; Woodburne et al., 2014), the continental systems of the Río Chico Group (Las Violetas/Peñas Coloradas, Las Flores and Koluel-Kaike formations, in stratigraphic order; Raigemborn et al., 2010) were deposited. These units are overlain by marine and continental units that represent the Cenozoic infill of the basin (Fig. 2).\nTwo areas on the South Flank (Fig. 1B) were selected for this paper: a western area that includes the Río Deseado Norte, Río Deseado and Río Deseado Sur localities, and an eastern area represented by the Cañadón Lobo locality. The base of the KKFm is not exposed, and the lower boundary shows a local erosional relationship with the underlying La Flores Formation; meanwhile, the upper boundary with the overlying Sarmiento and El Huemul formations and Rodados Patagónicos is erosional in nature (Figs. 2 and 3).\nOn the North Flank, ∼200 km to the north of the study area, the KKFm (46m thick) is informally divisible into three parts: Lower, Middle and Upper sections. These were defined on the base of dominant paleosol type and temporally constrained using paleomagnetic analysis and U-Pb dating of volcanic ashes to 46.7–42.1 Ma (Krause et al., 2010, 2017). In the Lower section Ultisol-like and subordinate Andisol-like paleosols occur; the Middle section is composed of Ultisol-like paleosols; and the Upper section features Andisol- and Mollisol-like paleosols (Fig. 2). Due to the absence of age constraints for the KKFm on the South Flank, correlation with the North Flank was established on the basis of stratigraphic relationships with adjacent units and presence of the characteristic paleosols. Consequently, we assume that the KKFm on the South Flank correlates with the whole of the unit on the North\n(caption on next page)\nFlank. Although the upper section on the South Flank is only partially preserved due to the erosive upper contact, we assume that the KKFm in the study area spans the same amount of time as the KKFm on the North Flank (Fig. 2)."

    "text": "Four stratigraphic sections representative of the KKFm were\nmeasured in the study area, and each was subdivided into Lower, Middle and Upper sections based on sedimentological and pedogenic features (Fig. 3). The only complete section of the KKFm is at Río Deseado Norte (Fig. 3).\nFacies were described following Miall’s (1996) and Bridge’s (2003) schemes, but adapted to volcaniclastic successions. Facies associations were described following Miall’s (1996) scheme. Since post-depositional processes (pedogenesis) are very important in the studied unit,\nFig. 2. Stratigraphic chart of the study area (South Flank, left) in comparison with the North Flank (right). It extends through continental (white and yellow for the study interval) and marine (gray and shading) sequences, and basaltic rocks (black) from the Eocene to the lower Miocene. The vertical shading indicates a hiatus. Lower (LS), Middle (MS), and, Upper (US) sections are the defined by Krause et al. (2017) on the North Flank and the defined in this work on the South Flank. Tuffs for the Las Flores and Koluel-Kaike formations on the North Flank are the ones dated by Krause et al. (2017); tuff for the lowermost Sarmiento Formation, dated by Ré et al. (2010) and Dunn et al. (2013); the stratigraphic position of the El Huemul Formation on the South Flank follows Paredes et al. (2015). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)\nthis scheme was modified in order to incorporate pedofeatures as well as the architectural characteristics of the deposits. Thus, facies association in this paper represent the association between the depositional processes and the post-depositional ones that affected them after sedimentation (pre-burial). The terms tuffaceous sandstones and mudstones were respectively used for reworked sand- and mud-sized pyroclastic sediments with sporadic reworked epiclastic grains. The geometry of the channel bodies was described according to the width/thickness (W/ T) criteria of Gibling (2006). The well-exposed outcrops and great\nlateral continuity of the tabular beds (several hundreds to thousands of meters wide) of the KKFm allow accurate measurement of the lateral extent of the strata.\nPaleosols were identified in outcrop based on macroscopic pedofeatures, such as structure, mottles, nodules, color, slickensides and rhizoliths (e.g. Retallack, 2001). In paleosol horizons, thickness, contact types, mineral composition, mean grain size, ped structure, type of nodules, and evidence of bioturbation were described (e.g. Soil Survey Staff 1999; Retallack, 2001). Colors were described according to the\nMunsell notation (Munsell Soil Color Book, 2013). Approximately 30 paleosols were identified in the stratigraphic sections (Fig. 3). Based on prevalent pedogenic features, four pedotypes were defined following Retallack (1994). Additionally, a micromorphological analysis was also undertaken. Thin sections of matrix paleosol and nodules were studied in order to establish mean grain size, mineralogical composition, porosity, microstructure, pedofeatures, fine material (groundmass) and microfabrics, applying the criteria of Bullock et al. (1985), Stoops (2003) and Stoops et al. (2010). Paleosol classification was based on macro- and micromorphological features recognized in the constituent horizons, through a comparison with the USDA soil taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1999) and with the paleosol classification of Mack et al. (1993). Selected matrix paleosols and nodules samples from the designed pedotypes were collected to determine geochemistry and clay composition. Geochemical analyses were undertaken on powdered materials using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) at ALS Minerals (Lima, Perú). Geochemical data were used to calculate weathering indices in order to determine base loss and leaching (Retallack et al., 2000; Retallack, 2001). Chemical index of alteration without potassium (CIA-K), where CIA-K= 100 × [Al/(Al + Ca + Na)] (Maynard, 1992), and the paleosol weathering index (PWI), where PWI = 100 × [(4.20 × Na) + (1.66 ×Mg) + (5.54 × K) + (2.05 × Ca)] (Gallagher and Sheldon, 2013), were calculated to estimate the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) linked to the studied Inceptisol- and Ultisol-like paleosols (Sheldon et al., 2002; Sheldon and Tabor, 2009; Gallagher and Sheldon, 2013). MAP was calculated using the relationship MAP (mm)=221e0.0197(CIA−K), while the MAT was calculated using the climofunction MAT (°C) = −2.74 ln (PWI) + 21.39 (Gallagher and Sheldon, 2013). The errors associated with these climofunctions are± 182mm and±2.1 °C, respectively (Sheldon et al., 2002; Gallagher and Sheldon, 2013). A more precise estimation of the MAT can be derived from the Inceptisol-like paleosols using the equations of Sheldon (2006), where MAT (°C) = 46.9C + 4, the error is± 0.6 °C, and C is clayeyness (Al/Si molar ratio). Clay mineralogy was determined from X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. The methodology used for sample preparation and semi-quantification of the minerals follows Raigemborn et al. (2014). Analyses were run on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer (Centro de Investigaciones Geológicas, La Plata, Argentina), using Cu radiation (Kα=1.5 Å) and a Ni filter, and generation settings of 40 kV and 40mA. Routine air-dried mounts were run between 2 and 32 °2θ at a scan speed of 2 °2θ/min. Samples were ethylene glycol-solvated without saturation pre-treatment and heated to 550 °C, and they were run from 2 to 27 °2θ and 3–15 °2θ, respectively, at a scan speed of 2 °2θ/min. Pedogenic nodules were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Samples were air-dried to constant weight and coated with Au, and then analyzed with a FEI Quanta 200 SEM and an EDAX Phoenix 40 (Facultad de Ingeniería, La Plata, Argentina). Their composition was analyzed using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and semi-quantitatively estimated using a Thermo Scientific Ultra Dry Silicon Drift Detector. The processing was done by means of a NORAN System 7 X-ray Microanalysis System (accelerating voltage 20 Kw, spot size from 20 to 50, marker 5–20 μm)."

Four facies and facies associations were identified in the studied sections (Figs. 3–8, Table 1), which are described and interpreted below.

The color of this facies varied between white and light brownish gray. TSt facies is composed of very fine to fine sand-sized particles of quartz with few glass shards and feldspar with moderate to high degree of alteration embedded in a clayey matrix. FA1 occurs as broad (7m wide and 0.60m thick) and narrow (3m wide and 0.60m thick) ribbons with low-relief basal erosive surfaces, planar tops, and lack of internal grain-size variation."

    "heading": "4.1.2. Interpretation",
    "text": "The geometry and the nature of the basal surface of the bodies are indicative of relatively thin channel fill deposits. The trough crossbedding is evidence of deposition by turbulent flow (e.g. Fisher et al., 2007) as three-dimensional dunes. The ribbon geometry and infill style (lack of internal erosion surfaces as reactivation surfaces and uniformity of grain size) suggest shallow single fluvial channels (Gibling, 2006). Lack of lateral accretion surfaces and point bars indicates laterally stable and probably low-sinuosity fluvial channels associated with vegetated floodplain that makes up coherent banks (Bridge, 2003; Paredes et al., 2007). The lack of vertical variation in grain size indicates that hydraulic processes were invariant during channel infilling. Pedogenesis disturbed the primary sedimentary structures. Channel abandonment and subaerial exposure of the channel fill with subsequent pedogenesis are inferred from the presence of pedofeatures. Periods of fluvial inactivity were long enough to allow pedogenesis in the channel fill.\n4.2. Unconfined fluvial facies association (FA-2)"

No grain-size grading is observed internally. This facies shows a color that ranges from white to very pale brown, and it is composed of silt- and mud-sized particles of quartz with few glass shards and feldspar crystals with different degree of alteration, within a clay-rich matrix. The TMb facies is arranged in laterally continuous broad sheet-like bodies (several hundreds to thousands of meters wide and 0.20–2.40m thick). The base is planar or slightly erosive and irregular, and the top is planar."

    "heading": "4.2.2. Interpretation",
    "text": "The fine grain size and large lateral extent of the bodies suggest deposition from unconfined flows (sensu North and Davidson, 2012). Grain size homogeneity indicates rapid deceleration of the flow and consequent deposition from suspension (Fisher et al., 2007; Basilici et al., 2016). Poor stratification and the occurrence of mud clasts at the base may be related to subaqueous upper flow regime. FA-2 corresponds to deposits on broad floodplains mainly composed of volcaniclastic sediments that were frequently inundated by overbank floods or rainfalls, and that reworked volcaniclastic deposits. The presence of intraclasts at the base of the mudstone bodies indicates that part of the underlying deposits was removed and locally transported, most likely by flooding events. Intense pedogenesis prevents identification of any sedimentary structures that might have been present and suggests discontinuous sedimentation."

In this case, TMm facies is white, light gray or very pale brown, and it is composed of siltsized particles of quartz, few glass shards and crystals of feldspar with\nmoderate to degree of alteration, and organic and siliceous remains, embedded in a clayey matrix. When tuffs of TMm facies are unmodified by pedogenesis, they are white and are mainly composed of silt-sized glass shards with blocky, planar and cuspate shapes, and quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar crystals, within a clay-rich matrix. FA-3 is characterized by broad sheet bodies (several hundreds to thousands of meters wide and 0.20–2m thick) with great lateral continuity and little variation in thickness along exposures.

The sheet-like geometry (mantle bedding), massive internal arrangement, and the basal contacts without evidence for erosion result from subaerial deposition in down-wind areas distal to the pyroclastic source (e.g. Umazano et al., 2008; Bellosi, 2010). The occurrence of pedofeatures suggests pedogenic processes on eolian volcaniclastic deposits.

It is characterized by narrow lenticular\nbodies (50–60m wide and 0.7–1.5m thick) with a non-erosive concaveup basal surface and planar top. At the top of these bodies, parallel lamination is generally not observable, there are several types of pedofeatures (Fig. 3), and the colors range from black and brown to white.

Thus, FA-4 is interpreted as the infill of small-scale local depressions of a floodplain mainly composed of volcaniclastic sediments, probably ponds or other small shallow water bodies such as wetlands. The desiccation of these water bodies led to the subaerial exposure of the mudstones, which were then modified by biological and pedological processes. Pedogenesis only disturbed the lamination at the top of the bodies, suggesting that this did not last long enough to affect the entire sequence.\n(caption on next page)"

This is based on the presence of relict sedimentary structures and occasional burrows. These—together with light colors, abundant unaltered glass shards and very scarce signs of illuviation—suggest very weak pedogenic modification (e.g. Bown and Kraus, 1987; Retallack, 2001). The dominance of smectite, the moderate CIA-K and low Ba/Sr ratio suggest weak to moderate hydrolysis and leaching. The Al/bases ratio indicates low to moderate loss of exchangeable bases, while the low levels of Al/ Si suggest low abundance of pedogenic clays (Ashley and Driese, 2000). The features of P1 are similar to modern vitric Entisols (Soil Survey Staff 1999; Buol et al., 2011) and may be classified as vitric Protosols (Mack et al., 1993).

It is defined as a yellow paleosol with red Fe-nodules and well-differentiated, indurated horizons (Fig. 5). Other macrofeatures include rhizoliths, blocky structure, ferriargillans, rhizohaloes, irregular Fe-mottles, and slickensides (Fig. 5D).

The coarse fraction is composed of silt particles of quartz with few glass shards and K-feldspar (both with a moderate to high degree of alteration), woody fragments, phytolithic remains (arboreal and herb components; Zucol et al., 2017, 2018), and intraclasts derived from older paleosols (pedorelicts) or unmodified underlying strata.

There are two representative profiles of P2: Bt-BC and Bt1-Bt2-BC (Fig. 5E). The contacts between the horizons are transitional; however, some well-cemented Fe-nodule-bearing horizons show sharp upper and lower contacts (Fig. 5E). Sharp contacts between the B horizons and the overlying sediments suggest that the A horizon was probably eroded. The main pedofeatures and geochemical and compositional data suggest a deeply weathered and strongly developed soil profile. The occurrence of welldefined Bt horizons, kaolinite in the clay fraction, scarcity of feldspar and other weatherable minerals, clay-coatings and Fe- and clay-coatings, PWI<20, Al/bases ratio> 2, and the Ba/Sr ratio are typical of Ultisols (Retallack et al., 2000; Retallack, 2001; Gallagher and Sheldon, 2013).

    "text": "Pedotype 3 is found in the TMm facies of the Middle section of the KKFm (Fig. 3) with a moderate relative abundance (12% of all paleosol profiles in the measured sections). It is defined as a pale red paleosol with well-defined horizons bearing Fe-mottles and slickensides. Femottles rich in hematite and goethite (Table 2) are irregular or polygonal (Fig. 7A) with a reticulated appearance similar to pattern I described by Krause et al. (2010) (i.e. mottles that define brick-like patterns that extend over tens of square centimeters). Slickensides are large, with a conjugate pattern that separates wedge-shaped peds. Other macrofeatures include blocky or prismatic structure, Fe nodules, and rhizoliths. The main micromorphological features (Fig. 7D–H) are a coarse fraction composed of very fine silt particles of quartz, intraclasts, and clay pellets; speckled, undifferentiated or striated b-fabrics (e.g. parallel striated b-fabrics; Fig. 7D and E); blocky (Fig. 7F) or granular (Fig. 7G) microstructures; clay-coatings, Fe- and clay-coatings (Fig. 7D and E), Fe-coatings, and Fe-rich hypocoatings (Fig. 7H). Kaolinite dominates the<2-μm size fraction of the paleosol matrix (Fig. 7C,\nTable 2). Geochemical analyses (Fig. 7C, Table 2) were used to determine the Al/bases ratio (∼3–6), Ba/Sr ratio (∼0.50–1.20), Al/Si ratio (∼0.07–0.16), the CIA-K (∼82–91), and the PWI (∼7–14).\nFig. 7.

    "text": "A representative profile with two subsurface horizons, Btss and Bv, separated by a sharp contact characterizes P3 (Fig. 7C). The contact with the overlying sediments is also sharp. The Btss horizon is based on clay enrichment (t) and on well-developed slickensides (ss). The Bv designation represents a fossil plinthite or an ironstone (Soil Survey Staff 1999; Retallack, 2001). This is based on the presence of a Fe-rich horizon, represented in this case by red-mottles (redox concentrations) rich in hematite and goethite, with a typical polygonal pattern, within a light-colored matrix rich in quartz and kaolinite (Table 2) that formed by repeated wetting and drying, and changed irreversibly to an ironstone hardpan. Sharp contacts between the B horizons and the overlying sediments indicate that the A horizon was probably eroded. The occurrence of well-developed horizons, a thick argillic one among them, the strength of the ped structure, the scarcity of unstable minerals, the abundance of kaolinite, the very low base cation content, and the high Al/bases ratio (> 3) suggest that P3 corresponds to a strongly to very strongly developed and deeply weathered kaolinitic soil profile. P3 resembles a modern vertic Ultisol (Soil Survey Staff 1999; Buol et al., 2011) and is classified as a vertic Argillisol following Mack et al. (1993). This pedotype is similar to the Ultisol equivalents with ironstones identified in the north of the basin (Fig. 2)."

    "text": "Pedotype 4 is restricted to the Middle section of the KKFm at the Río Deseado Norte locality (Figs. 3 and 8), where it is found in low abundance in the TMl facies. It is in a lateral relationship with P2 (Fig. 8). P4 is defined as a black paleosol with black (Mn-rich) and brown (Fe-rich) concretions (Fig. 8A–D). Poorly preserved lamination, platy structure, slickensides, and rhizoliths are also present in this pedotype (Fig. 8B). At microscale, Mn-rich (Fig. 8E) and Fe-rich (Fig. 8F) nodules have a differentiated fabric with a concentric internal structure (Table 2B). The most diagnostic microfeatures of P4 (Fig. 8G and H) are a coarse fraction composed of silt-sized particles of weakly altered volcanic glass and phytoliths, a groundmass rich in amorphous iron and manganese oxides, an undifferentiated or speckled and striated (e.g. porostriated and reticulated) b-fabric, common chambers and channels, blocky peds, Fe- and clay-coatings, and Fe-hypocoatings. The< 2-μm size fraction of the Bw horizon is dominated by kaolinite with a low proportion of smectite (Fig. 8B, Table 2). The Al/bases is ∼2, the Ba/Sr ratio is ∼3, the Al/Si ratio is ∼0.2, and the CIA-K is close to 79 (Fig. 8B, Table 2)."

    "text": "This pedotype displays a profile composed of three subsurface horizons (Bc1-Bc2-Bw) with transitional contacts among them. The Bc designation reflects the presence of Fe- and Mn-concretions, whereas Bw is assigned because of the poorly developed pedofeatures (platy structure). In the Bc horizons, the arrangement in which the concretions occur (from matrix-supported at the bottom to concretion-supported at the top of the bed) and their lateral continuity make up a crust that can be defined as a hardpan (Retallack, 2001). Sharp contacts between the B horizon and the overlying sediments suggest that the A horizon was probably eroded. Well-defined horizons with a slightly structured B horizon, a low proportion of illuvial clay, poorly developed ped\nstructure, poorly preserved primary lamination, and weakly altered volcanic glass are evidence of limited pedogenesis. An Al/bases ratio slightly higher than 2 and a moderate CIA-K and a high PIW in the Bw horizon suggest a modest degree of chemical weathering. The moderate Ba/Sr and Al/Si ratios in the Bw horizon indicate modest leaching and reflect the slightly clayey Bw horizon. The features of P4 are consistent with modern Inceptisols (Soil Survey Staff 1999; Retallack et al., 2000; Retallack, 2001), and this pedotype is classified as a gleyed Protosol following Mack et al. (1993). P4 has similar features but a higher degree of development than the Andisol analogues that occur on the North Flank (Fig. 2)."

However, the P2 and P3 of the upper part of the Middle section show somewhat lower values of MAT (14–15 ± 2.1 °C), as well as the P4 that overlies them, in the uppermost part of the Middle section that shows values of MAT of 11 ± 0.6 °C, and a MAP of 1057 ± 182mm yr−1 (Fig. 9). The youngest P2 and P3 of the Middle section show a constant MAT of ∼15.5 ± 2.1 °C on average, and a decreasing MAP from ∼1200 to 1032 ± 182mm yr−1 (Fig. 9).\nIn general, the curve of the MAT displays more or less constant values that are more variable towards the top of the unit. However, one peak of increased values in the lower part of the Middle section, and trough of decreasing values in the uppermost part of the Middle section, are observed (Fig. 9). The curve of MAP shows a more irregular pattern. This curve presents two peaks of increased values in the lower and in the middle/upper part of the Middle section, and one trough of decreasing values at the top of the unit (Fig. 9). Thus, a slight stratigraphic tendency is notable, showing somewhat lower values of MAT and MAP estimates up section (Fig. 9)."

    "text": "In the South Flank the KKFm features an association of abundant tephric loessites (FA-3), moderate unconfined sheet floods (FA-2), scarce narrow, shallow fluvial channels (FA-1), and very scarce small ponded areas (FA-4), and represents a distal mixed eolian-fluvial depositional system impacted by fine-grained volcaniclastic materials (Fig. 10). Wind redistributed and accumulated the volcaniclastic sediments derived from the erosion of previous eruptive material (fallout deposits and pyroclastic density currents) in the source area, located ∼400 km to the northwest of the study area (Raigemborn, 2008; Krause et al., 2010; Raigemborn et al., 2014) (Fig. 1C). This dominant depositional mechanism led to the formation of tephric loessite mantles that blanketed the topography. As a subordinated depositional mechanism, fluvial channeled flows and unconfined floods remobilized and reworked these eolian deposits and provided fine-grained material to local topographic depression (ponds). After deposition, the majority of these deposits were pedogenically modified.\nFig. 8. Macro- and microscopic features of Pedotype 4 (P4). A: General appearance at Río Deseado Norte showing the lateral relationship (paleocatena) between P4 (Mn- and Fe-rich zones), developed on TMl facies of the FA-4, and P2 over TMb facies (FA-2), and how these are covered by P1. B: Representative profile, clay mineralogy (S: smectite; K: kaolinite; C: chlorite; CS: mixed layers of chlorite/smectite; S/K ratio: smectite/kaolinite ratio), and geochemical data of the Pedotype 4. See explanation of Fig. 3 for macrofeatures. C: Mn-rich nodules in Bc1 horizon. D: Fe-rich nodules in Bc2 horizon. E: SEM photograph of a micropore in the concretionary matrix of a Mn-nodule. The void is infilled with opal lepispheres (OL) and a coating of massive Mn-oxides (arrow). F: SEM photograph of a Fe-rich nodule showing the internal fabric of a Fe-concretion compound of a nucleus (N) and the concretionary matrix. G: Ferroargillans developed on the wall of a planar void, and iron hypocoating surrounding a blocky volcanic shard (PN, ×16). H: Moderately to strongly developed subangular blocky peds. Note the groundmass rich in Mn- and Fe-oxides (PN, 10×). PN: parallel nicols.\nMacro- and micromorphological features, together with the mineralogical and geochemical data of the studied paleosols, suggest that the main pedogenic processes were lessivage, vertization, gleization, and bioturbation (Table 3; Fig. 9). Laterization was a subordinate and isolated process (Fig. 9), whereas lixiviation, rubefication, hydrolysis, weathering, leaching and alluviation accompanied the pedogenic processes (Table 3). The most developed paleosols (P2 and P3) have the highest CIA-K values and the lowest PWI values, while the less developed ones (P1 and P4) have the lowest CIA-K values, and so they can be used in combination with clayeyness values (Al/Si) within B horizons as a proxy for paleosol development (Fig. 9). Thus, the generalized stacking pattern of the KKFm paleosols shows a stratigraphic progression from very weakly developed paleosols (P1) through strongly and very strongly developed paleosols (P2 and P3, respectively), with local occurrences of weakly to mildly developed ones (P4), to very weakly developed paleosols (P1) (Fig. 9). The significance of the occurrence of vertically stacked paleosols with different degrees of development at the KKFm is discussed below."

    "text": "As paleosols can be used as a paleoclimate proxy—because pedogenic processes mainly depend on climate—, different stacked paleosols at the KKFm attest to particular climatic conditions developed during the pedogenesis of each pedotype.\nModern and ancient Entisols, as P1, cannot be considered as climatic indicators because the climate in which they form vary (e.g. Retallack et al., 2000; Driese et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the weathering of some volcanic shards, the degree of weathering of bases, and the modest Ba/Sr ratios in profiles with poorly preserved sedimentary structures as occur in P1, are compatible with relatively warm and humid conditions. The absence of accumulation of carbonate in P1 implies a subhumid climate (MAP > 800mmyr−1; Birkeland, 1999). The dominance of smectite, although in low proportions, and the presence of microlaminated clay-coatings in this pedotype are evidence of seasonality in water availability. A short dry season is inferred because the banding in clay-coatings in P1 is subtle (Retallack et al., 2000). Accordingly, a temperate/warm and seasonal subhumid climate is assumed for P1 (Fig. 10). This interpretation is in agreement with those made by Krause et al. (2010) and Raigemborn et al. (2014) who estimated a MAT of 11 ± 4.4 °C and a MAP of∼1000 ± 182mm yr−1 for similar paleosols and interpreted seasonal and subhumid conditions for stratigraphically-equivalent smectite-rich paleosols/strata on the North Flank.\nLeaching, hydrolysis, the almost complete weathering of volcanic shards and feldspar, and the abundance of kaolinite in P2 and P3 are compatible with a humid climate. Short periods of seasonality in P2 are also suggested by microlaminated clay-coatings, slickensides, reticulate striated b-fabrics, earthworm estivation chambers, Fe-concretions and mottles. Geochemical paleoclimate indicators in P2 and P3 show an average MAT of ∼16 ± 2.1 °C and a MAP of 1217 ± 182mm yr−1 (P2), and a MAT of ∼15.3 ± 2.1 °C and a MAP of 1212 ± 182mm yr−1 (P3). However, the uppermost P2 and P3 show somewhat lower values of MAT (14–15 ± 2.1 °C) and MAP (1030–1200 ± 182mmyr−1). These values indicated relatively warm and seasonally humid conditions for the Middle section of the KKFm (Fig. 10) with a slight decrease towards the youngest P2 and P3. Comparable conditions, with MATs of 15 ± 4.4 °C and MAPs of 1300–1200 ± 182mm yr−1, were established for analogous Ultisollike paleosols (Krause et al., 2010) and contemporaneous kaolinite-rich strata (Raigemborn et al., 2014) on the North Flank. Similarly, a decrease in precipitation at the top of the Middle section of the unit was detected in the northern area (Krause et al., 2010; Raigemborn et al., 2014; Zucol et al., 2017, 2018).\nModerate chemical weathering and Ba/Sr ratios, the dominance of kaolinite over smectite, and weakly altered volcanic glass in P4 areTa\nbl e 1\nFa ci es\nof th e K K Fm\nan d as so ci at ed\npa le os ol s.\nFa ci es\nco de\nLi th ol og\ny Se\ndi m en\nta ry\nst ru ct ur es\nan d sh ap\ne of\nth e bo\ndi es\nPe do\nfe at ur es\nA ss oc\nia te d\npe do\nty pe\nIn te rp re ta ti on\nR el at iv e ab\nun -\nda nc\ne\nTS t\nV er y fi ne\nto fi ne\n-g ra in ed\ntu ff ac eo\nus sa nd\nst on\nes V er y po\nor ly -p re se rv ed\ntr ou\ngh cr os sbe\ndd in g\nw it h in tr ac la st s at\nth e ba\nse .L\nen ti cu\nal r bo\ndi es\nFe -n od\nul es ,s\nlic ke\nns id es , rh iz ol it hs\nP2 M ig ra ti on\nof 3- D\ndu ne\ns w it hi n fl uv\nia l ch\nan ne\nls .L\now er\nfl ow\nre gi m e.\nSu ba\ner ia l ex po\nsu re\nw it h pe\ndo ge\nne ti c pr oc\nes se s\n6%\nTM b\nTu ff ac eo\nus m ud\nst on e (e qu iv al en t to si lt st on em ud st on e)\nM as si ve\nto po\nor ly\npr es er ve\nd pr im\nar y st ru ct ur es\nw it h in tr ac la st s at\nth e ba\nse .B\nro ad\nsh ee tlik e bo di es\nBu rr ow\ns, sl ic ke\nns id es , Fe\n-n od\nul es ,\nrh iz ol it hs ,m\not tl in g,\nco at in gs ,s\noi l\nst ru ct ur e\nP1 ,P\n2 Fl uv\nia lr\new or ki ng\nof py\nro cl as ti c ev\nen ts\nby un\nco nfi\nne d fl ow s.

Fe- and Mn-concretions, slickensides, and striated b-fabrics attest to seasonality (White and Dixon, 1996; Gasparatos et al., 2005; Jien et al., 2010; Lindbo et al., 2010). Thus, a temperate/warm and seasonal subhumid/humid climate is inferred for P4 (uppermost part of the Middle section of the KKFm; Fig. 10). Krause et al. (2010) estimated a MAT of 13 ± 4.4 °C and a MAP of 950 ± 182mm yr−1 for comparable paleosols in the north of the basin.\nTherefore, the association of data resulting from the paleosols of the KKFm suggests that, during the middle Eocene, pedogenesis at ∼52° south paleolatitude of central Patagonia occurred under a mainly warm and seasonally humid climate. However, intervals with drier conditions occurred at the beginning and end of the KKFm, suggesting a slight and gradual climatic deterioration trend (Figs. 9 and 10). Such drier conditions are in accordance with the paleobotanical interpretations of Zucol et al. (2017, 2018), who argue that the KKFm in the San Jorge Basin holds the record of dry forests."

In the case of the KKFm, sea-level changes are discarded because the Eocene drainage systems of central Patagonia had no direct connection to the sea (e.g. Bellosi, 2010). Tectonism is rejected due to the lack of evidence of tectonic activity in the study area."
  }, {
    "heading": "9.1. Volcanic input",
    "text": "The parent material of the studied paleosols is best preserved in their lowermost subsurface horizons (C). It is a fine-grained volcaniclastic sediment, mostly silt, with abundant angular vitric particles (glass shards) showing variable degrees of weathering. This material was generated at the Pilcaniyeu Volcanic Belt (Rapela et al., 1988) and caldera field of this belt (Aragón et al., 2017), in the North Patagonian Andes, 400 km to the northwest of the study area (Raigemborn, 2008; Krause et al., 2010; Raigemborn et al., 2014) (Fig. 1C). This arc was active during the Paleogene, with a peak in its activity from 50 to 43 Ma. Rhyolitic rocks, including plinian (i.e. tuffs, breccias, diamictites and lava flows), ignimbrite, obsidian and subvolcanic subfacies were recognized in proximal areas and were related to calderas (Rapela et al., 1988; Aragón et al., 2017). These silicic eruptions supplied a large amount of pyroclastic material to several depocenters placed in central and northern extra-Andean Patagonia (e.g. Bellosi and Corbella, 2016). According to sedimentary characteristics, distal volcaniclastic deposits such as those of the KKFm were mainly transported by wind and partially by rivers.\nThe absence of primary pyroclastic deposits and the lack of a defined fluvial style (braided or meandering) in the KKFm prevent us from a direct comparison with Smith's model (Smith, 1991). However, the association of loessic and fluvial reworking facies can be interpreted as a discontinuous volcaniclastic supply during the time of deposition of the KKFm. The occurrence of tephric loessites could be explained by a high input of loessic material and by a greater effectiveness of wind transport (Bellosi, 2010; Bellosi and Krause, 2014). Unconfined flood deposits can be the response to an increased pyroclastic input and, consequently, to an increase in the transport rate by fluvial processes or by heavy rains (e.g. Smith, 1991; Paredes et al., 2007; Manville et al.,\n2009). Also, the low permeability of the fine-grained volcaniclastic material relative to soils of the KKFm reduced the infiltration capacity of the floodplain and could increase the surface runoff (e.g. Smith, 1991; Paredes et al., 2007). Additionally, sheet-flood deposits can suggest channel adaptation to aggrading conditions by increased pyroclastic influx (Manville et al., 2009). Although in the KKFm channelmargin bars into single and low-sinuosity channels are not preserved, it is proposed here that they might have been relatively stable due to vegetated banks. In this sense, the great thickness of the Bt horizons that occur in P2 and P3 (3m-thick) in the Middle section of the unit suggests a high biomass of plants (e.g. Retallack, 2001). The most probable vegetation for these paleosols, based on the presence of phytolithic remains in Bt horizons recorded at the Cañadón Lobo section (Middle section of the KKFm), would be a mixed tropical forest with arboreal and non-arboreal plants (Zucol et al., 2017, 2018) (Fig. 10). However, local paleosols with Mn-nodules as P4 could be associated with shallow root systems and tree stumps of Fe-/Mn-accumulating plant species that tolerate Fe/Mn toxicity (e.g. Retallack et al., 2000; Kraus and Hasiotis, 2006; Varela et al., 2012) (Fig. 10). Although rhizoliths do not occur in P1, modern Entisols typically support an early\nsuccessional vegetation composed of herbs and shrubs (e.g. Retallack, 2001) (Fig. 10).\nThe occurrence of superimposed paleosols in the KKFm indicates that pedogenesis was recurrent and intense, and indicates pauses in deposition or a decreased sediment accumulation rate during periods of reduced sediment supply related to quiescent periods between eruptive episodes (Fisher and Schmincke, 1984). The type of paleosols that formed in the KKFm depended on how rapidly the sediment accumulated, whether that accumulation was steady or discontinuous, and the duration of the pause in accumulation (e.g. Kraus, 1999). Pedofeatures of Entisol-like paleosols (P1; AC horizon) might develop in rather short time spans (102–103 yr; Fig. 10) (Krause et al., 2010; Bellosi and Krause, 2014). In contrast, the formation of argillic (Bt) and plinthitic (Bv) horizons in Ultisol-like paleosols (P2 and P3) takes hundreds of thousands to millions of years (105–106 yr; Fig. 10) (Retallack et al., 2000; Retallack, 2001; Buol et al., 2011; Schaetzl and Anderson, 2013). Inceptisol-like paleosols (P4) have weak textural differentiation (Bw horizon), which generally takes a few thousand years to develop (Retallack et al., 2000). However, the chemical differentiation of the Bw horizon of P4 indicates longer times of formation, probably tens of\nthousands of years (104 yr; Fig. 10), as calculated by Basilici et al. (2016) for Inceptisols. Daniels (2003) observed that if floodplains aggrade faster than 0.5 cm yr−1, recognizable soils do not develop. Concurrently, vertically stacked paleosols with different degrees of development suggest alternating periods of geomorphological instability (sedimentation) and stability (pedogenesis) of variable duration, which are related to the balance between sedimentation and pedogenesis rates (e.g. Marriott and Wright, 1993). In this sense, Krause (2016) estimated the sedimentation rate for the KKFm on the North Flank of the basin between 0.015 and 0.016mm yr−1 for the interval with Ultisol-like paleosols (middle section of the unit) and 0.029mm yr−1 for the interval with Andisol-like paleosols (lower and upper sections of the KKFm). This author assumes a pedogenesis rate higher than 0.029mm yr−1 for the entire unit. The relative degree of pedogenic development is used here as a proxy for the relative sedimentation rate (e.g. Kraus, 1999) (see below)."

    "heading": "9.2. Climate and its implication in the Eocene global reconstruction",
    "text": "Climatic cycles play a major control on sediment supply, sedimentation and pedogenesis (Cecil and Dulong, 2003). The intercalation of eolian (loess) and fluvial deposits, and paleosols in the KKFm are elements of contrasting climatic implications, and consequently indicate climatic cycles (e.g. Parrish, 1998; Cecil and Dulong, 2003; Cecil et al., 2003). The transport of volcaniclastic sediments by wind represent arid conditions and high wind speeds, leading to maximum eolian transport and accumulation during arid conditions (Cecil et al., 2003; Swezey, 2003). Also, in warm and temperate climates, such as those of the KKFm, dry conditions can result in a reduction of plant cover and a consequent increase in erosion of regoliths in the source area. The preservation of eolian sediments in the stratigraphic record of the KKFm could respond to a change to more humid conditions (paleosols) (e.g. Kraus, 1999; Kemp, 2001; Retallack, 2001; Kraus et al., 2015). Thus, the accumulation and preservation of the loessites in the KKFm could be related to climate variability. It is inferred that climate changed repeatedly from dry periods with maximum transport of finegrained volcaniclastic material to more humid periods with sufficient rainfall to supply fluvial sediments and to stabilize eolian deposits by vegetation (i.e. climate during pedogenesis: temperate to warm and subhumid to humid) to a drier climate with mobilization of fine-grained volcaniclastic material. Thus, sedimentological and pedological data of this study provide evidence for variable water availability with relatively wetter and drier phases during the times of the KKFm of the San Jorge Basin. The vertical arrangement of paleosols in the Middle and Upper sections of the unit (P2, P3, P4 and P1; Figs. 3, 9 and 10) reveals that, superimposed on the loessic/fluvial-paleosol cycle, there is a higher order climatic trend towards drier conditions. This climatic tendency was identified before in the northern area of the basin by biotic (Zucol et al., 2004, 2017; 2018; Raigemborn, 2008; Tejedor et al., 2009; Woodburne et al., 2014; Kohn et al., 2015) and abiotic (Krause et al., 2010, 2017; Bellosi and Krause, 2014; Raigemborn et al., 2014) indicators.\nBioitic and abiotic proxy records from the San Jorge Basin provide evidence that central Patagonia's climate was warmer and wetter in the early Eocene in comparison to the long-term Cenozoic average that displayed cooling and aridity since the Eocene–Oligocene transition (e.g. Bellosi, 2010; Kohn et al., 2015). The underlying Las Flores Formation (Fig. 2), in the northern San Jorge Basin, comprises fluvial and lacustrine deposits (e.g. Raigemborn et al., 2010) that supported a subtropical to tropical lowland forests (Brea et al., 2008). This environmental scenery developed under warm and humid conditions related to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (Raigemborn, 2008; Raigemborn et al., 2009, 2014; Krause et al., 2017). Loessites and biological proxies of the overlying lower Sarmiento Formation (Cañadón Vaca and Gran Barranca members; Fig. 2) record loessic rolling plains with tropical savannahs that developed under subhumid-\nsemiarid conditions (Bellosi, 2010; Zucol et al., 2010; Bellosi and Krause, 2014), and indicate the prevalence of arid conditions since 42 Ma with substantial cooling and drying afterwards (Bellosi, 2010; Kohn et al., 2015). Thus, the reconstructed paleoenvironments of the KKFm at the South Flank mark the onset of eolian deposition after ∼47 Ma, and represent an increase of dryness which, considering the underlying La Flores and the overlying Sarmiento formations, represent a trend to drier conditions on a long time scale. Globally, this trend constitutes the lower part of the long-term cooling trend that mark the passage from the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum to the Oi-1 glaciation at ∼33 Ma (Zachos et al., 2001)."

    "text": "Stage 1 represents poorly vegetated areas of a loessic plain drained by episodic unconfined flows where simple (sensu Marriott and Wright, 1993) paleo-Entisols (P1) occurs (Fig. 10). The absence of well-defined pedogenic features means that this section was characterized by rapid deposition (e.g. Kraus et al., 2015; Basilici et al., 2016), probably of the order of 0.029mm yr−1 (following Krause, 2016). This condition, as well as its episodic nature, led to the formation of compound paleosols (Marriott and Wright, 1993; Kraus, 1999) that developed in rather short time spans (102–103 yr) of negligible sedimentation rate under probably temperate/warm and seasonally subhumid conditions (Fig. 10) that limited pedogenic processes and allow only occasional bioturbation. The stabilization of the floodplain by the incipient vegetation cover, together with low pedogenesis rate—probably more than 0.029mm yr−1 (following Krause, 2016)—, allowed the formation of scarce compound paleo-Entisols. Soil development was probably impeded by eolian processes, which occurred very quickly and probably under less humid conditions compared to the intervals of pedogesis. The non-truncated, simple soil profile of P1 suggests a relatively continuous aggrading environment. The sedimentation of eolian silt-sized volcaniclastic material and less commonly unconfined flooding episodes led to the aggradation of the plain, which occurred at a higher rate than at Stages 2 and 3 (see below), as evidenced by the occurrence of compound Entisol equivalents (Fig. 10)."
  }, {
    "heading": "10.2. Stages 2-A and 2-B (middle section of the Koluel-Kaike Formation)",
    "text": "These stages represent a strongly pedogenically modified (P2 and P3) and highly vegetated loessic rolling plain, drained by a subordinate fluvial system composed of unconfined flows and low-hierarchy and low-sinuosity single fluvial channels (Fig. 10). Here, instantaneous to very short intervals of eolian and fluvial deposition took place under relatively dryer conditions compared to the periods of pedogenesis, which were longer (105–106 yr) and relatively warm and seasonally humid, with a slight climatic deterioration from Stage 2-A to Stage 2-B (Fig. 10). This resulted in the occurrence of cumulative Ultisol equivalents (P2 and P3) in which lessivage, vertization, bioturbation and sporadic laterization were the main pedogenic processes. There is evidence of erosion in both the soil profiles (truncated top profile and pedorelicts) and fluvial deposits (intraclasts). A slow, steady and low sediment accumulation rate (0.015–0.016mm yr−1, following Krause, 2016) and a high pedogenesis rate (> 0.029mmyr−1, following Krause, 2016), allowed the development of thick, stacked, cumulative truncated sets of Ultisol analogues. In this environmental context, the\nconstruction of the plains mainly occurred through accumulation of tephric loessites and, to a lesser extent, due to overbank flows or unconfined flows originated by rainfall (Fig. 10). The relative abundance of paleosols during these stages indicates that the aggradation rate was slower than in Stage 1, but higher than in Stage 3 (see below), in which all the deposits are pedogenically modified (stacked Entisol analogues) (Fig. 10). As previously discussed, the single, low-sinuosity configuration of the channels at Stage 2-A could be related to the relative stability of the channel margins by vegetation. Truncated cumulative Ultisol-like paleosols are interpreted as the result of the aggradation of an unstable plain subjected to repeated periods of erosion due to flooding events and surface runoff during rainstorm."

    "heading": "10.3. Stage 2-C (upper part of the middle section of the Koluel-Kaike Formation)",
    "text": "Locally ponded areas of the floodplain in which waterlogged P4 occurs were laterally replaced by unconfined flow deposits in which P2 formed (Fig. 10). The local occurrence of P4 suggests that sedimentation was episodic and moderately slow, probably of the order of 0.029mm yr−1 as suggested by Krause (2016), allowing formation of simple truncated compound Inceptisol-like paleosols in which gleization was the main process. This occurred during temperate/warm, seasonally subhumid/humid conditions which persisted for extended periods of time (∼104 yr) (Fig. 10). Lateral changes between P4 and P2 (Figs. 3 and 8A) at this stage take place over a distance of tens to hundreds of meters. This indicates local topographic irregularities of a rolling plain with locally ponded areas and paleocatenas (Fig. 10). Ponded areas in this landscape were probably vegetated with Mn/Fetolerant plants, whereas the higher areas possibly supported vegetation similar to the one in P2 (Fig. 10). Compound P4 paleosols suggest a relatively higher sedimentation/pedogenesis ratio than in Stages 2-A and B (Fig. 10). Here, the main aggradational mechanism of the plain was deposition by overbank floods or rainfall as unconfined flows, and locally by sedimentation in ponds. The truncated paleosol profiles of P4 and P2 are indicative of an unstable landscape subjected to repeated periods of erosion. Here, the fluctuating water table, temporary saturated conditions, and flat or concave upward landscape (pond deposits) seem to have controlled the weak to moderate degree of development of P4 (e.g. Ashley et al., 2013; Basilici et al., 2016) during an extended period of time (Fig. 10). Although no geochemical data are available for P2 in this catenary sequence, the slight trend towards lower MATs and MAPs occurring in Stage 2-B and also recorded previously in other areas of the basin (Krause et al., 2010; Raigemborn et al., 2014; Zucol et al., 2017, 2018) allows us to interpret that both pedotypes probably developed under similar conditions."

    "text": "Here, there are fluvial sheet-like deposits associated with P1 that resemble the pedogenic and climatic conditions established for Stage 1 (Fig. 10). Therefore, this stage represents poorly vegetated areas of a plain drained by unconfined flows, where a high sedimentation/pedogenesis ratio led to the formation of compound Entisol analogues (Fig. 10). However, non-truncated but stacked paleosols in this stage attest to slower aggradation rates than during Stage 1. Besides, at Stage 3, aggradation occurred only by deposition of unconfined flows as no eolian deposits were identified (Fig. 10)."

    "heading": "11. Conclusions",
    "text": "The middle Eocene Koluel-Kaike Formation in Argentine Patagonia represents a distal, strongly pedogenically modified, loessic rolling plain, drained by a fluvial system. Different stacked paleosols arrange in a trend from very weakly-developed vitiric Entisol-like paleosols (Pedotype 1) through strongly- and very strongly-developed Ultisol-like\npaleosols (pedotypes 2 and 3) and weak/mildy-developed Inceptisollike paleosols (P4), to finally end with weakly-developed paleo-Entisols (Pedotype 1). The vertical arrangement of these paleosols reveals, as explain in the following paragraph, a temperate–warm and seasonal subhumid–humid climate, and a climatic trend towards drier conditions. Paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions of the KKFm (∼47–42 Ma) mark the beginning of the long-term cooling trend after the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum at ∼52° south paleolatitude.\nPaleolandscape evolution of the KKFm provides a high-resolution record of fluctuating environmental conditions and interplaying forcing factors in a continuously aggrading distal volcaniclastic system. The discontinuity of volcaniclastic supply regulated the mechanism of transport and sedimentation (eolian vs fluvial), rate of sediment supply, mechanism of aggradation of the plain (eolian vs flooded by overbank), and duration of landscape stability (sedimentation vs pedogenesis). The interplay of these factors and climate controlled the water balance and the pedogenic processes."

  "abstractText": "The middle Eocene Koluel-Kaike Formation, located in the San Jorge Basin, Patagonia, Argentina, is a strongly pedogenically modified succession associated with volcaniclastic input in an aggrading distal eolian-dominated fluvial system, located ∼400 km downwind of the Eocene Andean volcanic arc. The coordinated study of sediments and paleosols of this unit allows (1) reconstruction of environmental conditions and landscape evolution, and (2) determination of the interplay of the main forcing factors in the evolution of the Kokuel-Kaike Formation. The landscape reconstruction attests to the existence of a loessic rolling plain drained by a subordinate fluvial system, composed of both unconfined and confined flows, with locally ponded areas. Over these, thick stacked cumulative paleo-Ultisols and vertic paleo-Ultisols developed with scarce simple and stacked compound vitric Entisols analogues and compound Inceptisols equivalents. This high-resolution sedimentological-pedological analysis of the Kokuel-Kaike Formation indicates that the interplay between episodic volcaniclastic supply and cyclic climate controlled landscape evolution and soil development.",
