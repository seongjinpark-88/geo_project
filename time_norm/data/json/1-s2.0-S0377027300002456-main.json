    "text": "Llullaillaco is one of a chain of Quaternary stratovolcanoes that de®nes the present Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), and marks the border between Chile and Argentina/Bolivia. The current edi®ce is constructed from a series of thick dacitic lava ¯ows, forming the second tallest active volcano in the world (6739 m). K±Ar and new biotite laser 40Ar/39Ar step-heating dates indicate that the volcano was constructed during the Pleistocene (#1.5 Ma), with a youngest date of 0.048 ^ 0.012 Ma being recorded for a fresh dacite ¯ow that descends the southern ¯ank. Additional 40Ar/39Ar measurements for andesitic and dacitic lava ¯ows from the surrounding volcanic terrain yield dates of between 11:94 ^ 0:13 Ma and 5:48 ^ 0:07 Ma; corresponding to an extended period of Miocene volcanism which de®nes much of the landscape in this region. Major- and trace-element compositions of lavas from Llullaillaco are typical of Miocene±Pleistocene volcanic rocks from the western margin of the CVZ, and are related to relatively shallow-dipping subduction of the Nazca plate beneath northern Chile and Argentina.\nOversteepening of the edi®ce by stacking of thick, viscous, dacitic lava ¯ows resulted in collapse of its southeastern ¯ank to form a large volcanic debris avalanche. Biotite 40Ar/39Ar dating of lava blocks from the avalanche deposit indicate that collapse occurred at or after ,0.15 Ma, and may have been triggered by extrusion of a dacitic ¯ow similar to the one dated at 0:048 ^ 0:012 Ma: The avalanche deposits are exceptionally well preserved due to the arid climate, and prominent leveÂes, longitudinal ridges, and megablocks up to 20-m diameter are observed.\nThe avalanche descended ,2.8 km vertically, and bifurcated around an older volcano, Cerro Rosado, before debouching onto the salt ¯ats of Salina de Llullaillaco. The north and south limbs of the avalanche traveled 25 and 23 km, respectively, and together cover an area of approximately 165 km2. Estimates of deposit volume are hampered by a lack of thickness information except at the edges, but it is likely to be between 1 and 2 km3. Equivalent coef®cients of friction of 0.11 and 0.12, and excess travel distances of 20.5 and 18.5 km, are calculated for the north and south limbs, respectively. The avalanche ascended ,400 m where it broke against the western ¯ank of Cerro Rosado, and a minimum ¯ow velocity of ,90 m s21 can be calculated at this point; lower velocities of ,45 m s21 are calculated where distal toes ascend ,200 m slopes.\nIt is suggested that the remaining precipitous edi®ce has a high probability for further avalanche collapse in the event of\nrenewed volcanism. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The summit stands 6723 m above sea-level, ranking this as the second highest active volcano in the world, second only to the Nevados Ojos del Salado volcano 260 km further south along\nthe Andean Cordillera (6887 m; 27807 0S 68833 0W). Previous studies of the Llullaillaco volcano have been conducted by Gardeweg et al. (1984) and Zappettini and Blasco (1998), who investigated the Chilean and Argentine sectors of the volcano,\nJ.P. Richards, M. Villeneuve / Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 105 (2001) 77±10578\nrespectively. In addition, descriptions based on satellite image interpretations have been given by Wood and Francis (1985), Francis and Wells (1988) and de Silva and Francis (1991). These studies have reported the existence of a large, well-preserved volcanic debris avalanche emanating from the southeastern ¯ank of the volcanic cone, as well as several young, bulbous lava ¯ows.\nIn this paper, we present preliminary ®eld mapping, geochemical, and geochronological results from the eastern sector of the Llullaillaco volcano in Argentina, as part of an on-going study into the controls of deep basement structures on magmatism and oreformation in the Andean orogen. The present-day volcanic edi®ce is shown to have been built during the Quaternary from thick, viscous, dacitic lava ¯ows, which accumulated to form a gravitationally unstable structure. Collapse of part of this structure occurred in the late Pleistocene apparently in response to coeval volcanic activity, giving rise to a large, bifurcating debris avalanche, preserved in exquisite detail in the arid environment of the Central Andes."

    "text": "Fieldwork in northwest Argentina was conducted in July 1999. Navigation in the ®eld was achieved with a hand-held GPS unit (accurate to ^30 m) and topographic maps published by the Instituto GeograÂ®co Militar, Argentina. The geological map shown in Fig. 2 is based on the Argentine grid, and information from Chilean maps and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images (Fig. 3) have been recti®ed to this grid.\nThe area studied ranges in elevation from approximately 3700 m at the Salina de Llullaillaco, to 6739 m on the summit of Cerro Llullaillaco. The arid climate supports minimal vegetation, sparse grass cover being limited to quebradas (dry valleys) and sheltered areas where snow collects. Permanent ice cover is restricted to small hanging glaciers above approximately 6000 m on Cerro Llullaillaco."

    "text": "Seven representative samples of volcanic rocks\nfrom Llullaillaco were analyzed for major-element compositions by XRAL Laboratories, Don Mills, Ontario, Canada. Samples were prepared by crushing and milling in an agate disk mill, and 2-g splits of this material were fused with Li±tetraborate to make glass pellets for XRF analysis. Further aliquots of powder were analyzed for trace elements at the University of Saskatchewan Department of Geological Sciences ICP-MS facility. Samples were dissolved in nitric and hydro¯uoric acid, then diluted to a standard volume in deionized water and analyzed using a Perkin Elmer ELAN 5000 following the method of Jenner et al. (1990).\nReplicate analyses of international standards indicate accuracy to within 10 relative percent of the standard values for reported trace elements analyzed by ICP-MS, and to within 1 and 5 relative percent for major and minor elements, respectively, analyzed by XRF. Results are presented in Table 1 and discussed later."

    "text": "Selected samples of volcanic rocks from the Llullaillaco area were processed for 40Ar/39Ar analysis of biotite or hornblende phenocrysts by standard heavy-liquid mineral separation techniques, followed by hand-picking of clear, unaltered crystals in the size range 0.5±1 mm. Individual mineral separates were loaded into aluminum foil packets along with a single grain of Fish Canyon Tuff Sanidine (FCT-SAN) to act as ¯ux monitor (apparent age 28.03 ^ 0.1 Ma; Renne et al., 1994). The sample packets were arranged radially inside an aluminum can, which was encased in 1-mmthick Cd foil to reduce the build-up of interfering isotopes produced from K during irradiation. The samples were then irradiated for 2 h at the research reactor of McMaster University in a fast neutron ¯ux of approximately 3 £ 1016 neutron/cm2, yielding a Jfactor of ,0.00048.\nLaser 40Ar/39Ar step-heating analysis was carried out at the Geological Survey of Canada laboratories in Ottawa, Ontario. Neutron ¯ux gradients throughout the sample canister were evaluated by analyzing the sanidine ¯ux monitors included with each sample packet and interpolating a linear ®t against calculated J-factor and sample position.

Upon return from the reactor, samples were split into several aliquots and loaded into individual 1.5-mm-diameter holes in a copper planchet. The planchet was then placed in the extraction line and the system evacuated. Heating of individual sample aliquots in steps of increasing temperature was achieved using a Merchantek MIR10 10W CO2 laser equipped with a 2 mm £ 2 mm ¯at-®eld lens. The released Ar gas was cleaned over getters for ten minutes, and then analyzed isotopically using the secondary electron multiplier system of a VG3600 gas source mass spectrometer; details of data collection protocols can be found in Villeneuve and MacIntyre (1997)."

    "text": "Corrected argon isotopic data are listed in Table 2, and presented both as spectra of gas release and on inverse-isochron plots (Fig. 4; Roddick et al., 1980). Each gas-release spectrum contains step-heating data from several aliquots, alternately shaded and normalized to the total volume of 39Ar released. Such plots\nprovide a visual image of replicated heating pro®les, relative gas volumes per heating step, evidence for Ar-loss in the low-temperature steps, and the error and apparent age of each step.\nBecause the error associated with the J-factor is systematic and not related to individual analyses, correction for this uncertainty is not applied until calculation of dates from isotopic correlation diagrams (Roddick, 1988). No evidence for excess 40Ar was observed in any of the samples and, therefore, all regressions are assumed to pass through the 40Ar/36Ar value for atmospheric air (295.5). All errors are quoted at the 2s level of uncertainty. The majority of samples yielded ¯at spectra and well-correlated regression lines (Fig. 4). However, hornblende from sample AR33 shows evidence for minor 40Ar loss and high atmospheric argon content in the earliest heating steps; nevertheless, regression through all data points from six replicate analyses on an inverse isochron diagram results in a well-de®ned date of 11:94 ^ 0:13 Ma (MSWD 2.5; Fig. 4h). Biotite from sample AR25 also displays minor 40Ar loss in the earliest steps, but regression of the hightemperature portions of the spectra yields a precise date of 5:48 ^ 0:07 Ma (MSWD 3.4; Fig. 4g).\nJ.P.

    "text": "In response to a Late Oligocene increase in the convergence rate between the South American and Nazca plates and shallowing of the subduction angle, Andean magmatism spread eastwards from a relatively well-de®ned Eocene±Oligocene arc in the Precordillera of northern Chile, to form a broad Early±Middle Miocene volcanic belt locally over 250 km wide in northeastern Chile, northwestern Argentina, and southwestern Bolivia (Coira et al., 1982; Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Pardo-Casas and Molnar, 1987). From ca. 25 Ma, compressional tectonics with NW±SE-directed shortening (the Quechua event) led to uplift of the Altiplano±Puna plateau (Lahsen, 1982; Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Marrett and Emerman, 1992; Vandervoort et al., 1995; Allmendinger et al., 1997). This plateau is the second largest in the world (the Tibetan plateau being the largest), and extends for ,1800 km from Peru and Bolivia into Argentina, covering an area of ,500,000 km2 at an average elevation of ,3.7 km (Allmendinger, 1986; Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Isacks, 1988). The cause of this extensive and sustained uplift has been suggested to be a combination of crustal thickening and lithospheric delamination (Allmendinger, 1986; Isacks, 1988; de Silva, 1989; Coira et al., 1993; Kay and Kay, 1993; Kay et al., 1994; Allmendinger et al., 1997). Ponding of mantle-derived magmas at the base of the crust during this period of compression led to the generation of intermediate-to-felsic magmas by\nMASH-type processes, which were erupted from the Middle Miocene to the Pliocene throughout the Puna (Sparks et al., 1989; Marrett and Emerman, 1992; Zappettini et al., 1997).\nIn the Late Pliocene (,2 Ma), the tectonic regime in the Puna changed from WNW±ESE shortening to strike±slip faulting with NNW± SSE extension, possibly in response to a decrease in the Nazca±South American plate convergence rate (the Diaguita deformational phase: Allmendinger, 1986; Coira et al., 1993; Marrett et al., 1994). This change in the upper-plate stress ®eld corresponds to a switch from voluminous and extensive felsic volcanism (Lahsen, 1982; de Silva, 1989; Sparks et al., 1989) to the construction of intermediate-composition stratovolcanoes along the western margin of the Puna, and eruption of small volumes of back-arc ma®c and shoshonitic magma along fault zones within the plateau (HoÈrmann et al., 1973; DeÂruelle, 1982, 1991; Schreiber and Schwab, 1991; Marrett and Emerman, 1992; Coira et al., 1993; Kay et al., 1994; Marrett et al., 1994).\nLlullaillaco is one of a string of Quaternary stratovolcanoes that de®nes the Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). Although much of this region is covered by Late Miocene±Quaternary volcanic products, several authors have suggested that the loci of major volcanic centers are controlled by deep-crustal structures that pre-date the Andean event (Lahsen, 1982; Sal®ty, 1985; Gardeweg and Ramirez, 1987).

Because of a change to arid climatic conditions in the Middle Miocene, broadly synchronous with uplift of the Puna plateau, exposure of the basement was not accompanied by extensive erosion. Instead, these rocks were unconformably overlain by thick, late Cenozoic volcanic sequences. In the Llullaillaco area, these volcanic products consist mostly of glacially dissected, Late Miocene, andesitic±dacitic vents and lava ¯ows, locally intercalated with felsic pyroclastic deposits.\nFour samples of andesitic and dacitic lavas from this Late Miocene volcanic episode were dated, and yield 40Ar/39Ar ages of between 11.94 ^ 0.13 Ma (AR33) and 5.48 ^ 0.07 Ma (AR25; Table 2 and Fig. 4). Near Cerro Silla, two lava ¯ows outcropping in a sequence and separated by a few tens of meters vertically yielded ¯at spectra and sensibly identical ages: sample AR20 (hornblende) regression\nage 9.80 ^ 0.29 Ma (Fig. 4e); sample AR21 (biotite) regression age 9.92 ^ 0.12 Ma (Fig. 4f). These results are in broad agreement with a single K±Ar date of 7:1 ^ 3:0 Ma reported by Gardeweg et al. (1993) from the Chilean side of Cerro Silla.\nSuperimposed on this Late Miocene landscape are large Quaternary stratovolcanoes of which Llullaillaco is an example, as well as numerous small monogenetic vents and lava ¯ows. Many of these structures are well preserved, and erosion is restricted to wind action, frost-heave, or avalanche."

An initial stage (Llullaillaco I) was characterized by extrusion of extensive dacitic lava ¯ows from two now eroded centers. These early Pleistocene deposits have been affected by local hydrothermal alteration and glaciation, such that their physiographic form is variably degraded.\nThe second stage of volcanism (Llullaillaco II) is well\nJ.P.

A sample of dacitic lava from the southern ¯ank of the volcano (AR8) yielded a biotite 40Ar/39Ar date of 0:401 ^ 0:006 Ma (Fig. 4b), whereas Gardeweg et al. (1984, 1993) obtained a K±Ar date of 1:5 ^ 0:4 Ma for a dacitic ¯ow 12 km to the northwest of the summit. These oxidized lavas are overlain by young, stubby, lobate, glassy, dacitic ¯ows (couleÂes), which emanate from the present summit of the edi®ce. Gardeweg et al. (1984) reported a single K±Ar date of ,1 Ma (no radiogenic 40Ar detected) for a dacitic lava ¯ow on the northern ¯ank of the volcano, and we have obtained a biotite date of 0:048 ^ 0:012 Ma for a similar ¯ow on the southern side (AR15, Fig. 4d). The latter ¯ow descends almost 2 km vertically, but is only 6 km-long, suggesting that these dacitic lavas were very viscous.\nAt some point during this late Pleistocene eruptive stage, the southeastern quadrant of the volcano collapsed, sending a large debris avalanche downslope to the east±southeast. This avalanche bifurcated to ¯ow around a slightly older volcanic structure (Cerro Rosado), the two limbs of the avalanche eventually halting upon reaching the salt ¯ats of Salina de Llullaillaco, approximately 25 km horizontally and 2.8 km vertically from the top of the scarp (Figs. 2 and 3). The total deposit covers an area of ,165 km2. We have dated biotite from two samples of biotite±phyric dacite occurring as blocks within the distal (AR4) and proximal (AR12) parts of the avalanche deposit, and obtained identical ages (within error) of 0:156 ^ 0:005 Ma; and 0:148 ^ 0:005 Ma; respectively. Because these blocks appear to have been solid at the time of avalanche emplacement, the results provide a maximum age for the avalanche event. A second, smaller debris avalanche also descended the edi®ce to the northeast (Figs. 2 and 3), but we have no information on the timing of this event.\nThe morphology of the main debris avalanche, and the results of geochemical and geochronological analyses of lavas and avalanche materials are described later."

    "text": "Nine samples of dacitic volcanic rock from\nLlullaillaco were studied petrographically. All of the samples are vitrophyric or porphyritic with matrices consisting either completely of glass, or of microcrystalline, weakly trachytic feldspar with interstitial glass. The glass varies from unaltered to weakly devitri®ed, and locally spherulitic. Plagioclase feldspars (typically oscillatory-zoned oligoclase, up to 3 mm long) dominate the phenocryst assemblage, and vary in texture from euhedral to glomeroporphyritic, and fresh to extensively reacted. Melt inclusions are common, either as primary globules de®ning growth zones, or as sieve textured replacements in reacted feldspars. The presence of both fresh and reacted feldspars in some samples suggests mixed phenocryst populations, possibly due to magma mixing (e.g. Matthews et al., 1999). Quartz phenocrysts are rare except in the most felsic samples studied (e.g. AR12, AR13), and are rounded and resorbed where observed.\nMa®c phenocrysts consist of orthopyroxene and minor clinopyroxene, hornblende, and biotite. Pyroxenes (#0.5 mm) are abundant only in more ma®c lithologies, but biotite and/or hornblende are ubiquitous. Hornblende occurs as dark brown bladed euhedra up to 1 mm long, often with strongly oxidized rims grading to complete replacement. Biotite occurs as euhedral to castellated books up to 1 mm in diameter, variably displaying oxidized rims, hornblende overgrowths, and plagioclase inclusions.\nMagnetite and minor ilmenite (0.01±0.4 mm) represent the primary Fe±Ti oxide assemblage, but hematite replaces magnetite locally, particularly in the older, more oxidized lavas of Llullaillaco I. Diamond-shaped pseudomorphs consisting of vermiform magnetite may have replaced titanite. Rare globules of magmatic sul®de, now recrystallized to pyrrhotite±pyrite±chalcopyrite, occur as small (#0.025 mm) inclusions in magnetite microphenocrysts, and minor anhedral pyrite occurs scattered in the matrix of some samples."

Trace-element and rare-earth-element (REE) data are plotted as spiderdiagrams normalized to primitive mantle and C1 chondrite values (Figs. 7 and 8, respectively). The samples are subdivided in terms of Gardeweg et al.'s (1984) two volcanic phases (Llullaillaco I, early Pleistocene; Llullaillaco II, late Pleistocene), plus lava fragments collected from the debris avalanche (,0.15 Ma). All lavas analyzed from Llullaillaco are mediumK dacites, but samples from Llullaillaco II tend to be more felsic than from Llullaillaco I (Llullaillaco I: 2.1±2.9 wt.% K2O, 63.4±67.0 wt.% SiO2, volatile free; Llullaillaco II: 2.7±3.0 wt.% K2O, 65.9±68.1 wt.% SiO2; Table 1 and Figs. 5 and 6). Although these data suggest a trend to more felsic compositions with time during the Pleistocene evolution of the volcano, it is noted that the youngest dated sample (,0.05 Ma) is not the most felsic (AR15; 66.5 wt.% SiO2). Three samples of\nfresh lava (,0.15 Ma) recovered as blocks from the avalanche deposit have the most felsic compositions.\nThe major-element data form well-de®ned linear arrays on Harker-type diagrams, with increasing alkalis, and decreasing CaO, MgO, and Fe2O3 p (total iron as Fe2O3) as SiO2 increases (data for K2O, CaO and MgO are used for illustration in Fig. 6). Given the short period of time over which these lavas were erupted (#1.5 Ma), these trends could re¯ect simple differentiation of a single magma chamber beneath the volcano. However, the fact that the trend of increasing silica content does not coincide perfectly with the measured age progression suggests that fractionation may have been accompanied by periodic magmachamber replenishment with more primitive melts (cf. O'Callaghan and Francis, 1986; Feeley and Davidson, 1994).\nTrace element data for the seven samples analyzed in this study show little variation within the suite, and display primitive mantle-normalized patterns characteristic of other CVZ volcanic rocks (Fig. 7; Kay et al.,\nJ.P. Richards, M. Villeneuve / Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 105 (2001) 77±105 93\n1991). Negative anomalies for Nb and Ti and positive anomalies for Pb and Li are typical of arc magmas (Pearce and Peate, 1995), whereas the relatively high K values re¯ect the distance inland from the trench (,300 km) and a corresponding tendency towards shoshonitic af®nity (Morrison, 1980; Gill, 1981; Pearce, 1982; Meen, 1987).\nWith the exception of sample AR9, C1-normalized REE patterns are tightly grouped, and display lightREE (LREE) enrichments with very weak negative Eu-anomalies (Fig. 8). Weak to absent Eu anomalies are commonly observed in moderately oxidized and hydrous arc magmas in which either Eu is dominantly present as Eu31, and/or plagioclase fractionation is suppressed (Gill, 1981). Heavy-REE (HREE) depletion may re¯ect the presence of residual garnet in the lower crust or mantle source region and/or amphibole\nfractionation (Frey et al., 1978; Hanson, 1980; Kay et al., 1991; Kraemer et al., 1999). Sample AR9 from Llullaillaco I shows the smallest LREE/ HREE fractionation (Lan/Ybn 17.0 compared with 35.4±46.2 for other samples), and is also the least evolved sample in the suite at 64.3 wt.% SiO2. However, data from one sample alone are insuf®cient to distinguish between magmatic fractionation processes and source changes or contamination in producing these differences in REE abundances."

Facies 3 consists of longitudinally-ridged deposits of chaotically mixed materials, including blocks of lava ranging from over 2 m in diameter at the proximal end, to less than 1 m at the distal end. Scattered on the surface of the avalanche are occasional spindleshaped volcanic bombs (typically ,1 m long), but no\nother post-avalanche pyroclastic deposits were observed. The proximal end of facies 3 ¯owed across a broad, shallowly dipping (,38 SE) pediment, which appears to have been ¯oored by Quaternary gravels (Fig. 9b). The avalanche deposits in this section are characterized by shallow boulder-strewn ridges and hillocks, rarely more than 10 m in height. Cerro Rosado and Cerro 5074 rise out of this pediment at the eastern end, however, and presented insurmountable obstacles to the avalanche, the main part of which was forced to ¯ow down the intervening valley. The pass between these volcanoes is narrow (pinching to ,2 km width) and descends relatively steeply (4±58 ESE; Figs. 9c and 10a). Constriction of the avalanche to this valley led to the development of prominent longitudinal ridges up to 20 m high, and distinct leveÂes on the southern margin. These leveÂes are perched on the ¯ank of Cerro 5074 100±200 m above the central part of the ¯ow in perpendicular\nJ.P. Richards, M.

Small lobes project uphill from this ¯ow margin, representing failed attempts by the ¯ow front to surmount the topography. The deposit halted quite abruptly upon reaching the level of the salar, and unlike the northern lobe, does not appear to have run out onto its surface for any great distance. The toe forms a ridge locally up to 10 m above the salar, but a narrow apron of ®ner-grained materials extending up to 1 km beyond this front suggests some on-running of the avalanche matrix.\nA signi®cant proportion of the avalanche failed to negotiate the pass between Cerro Rosado and Cerro 5074.

A smaller lobe projects onto the gravel pediment about 4 km to the northwest, and leveÂes up to 50 m high border the avalanche in this area. The leveÂes are sharply de®ned and very steep (close to the angle of repose for unconsolidated rock) suggesting formation from high yield strength materials (Eppler et al., 1987), and minimal degradation of the deposit since emplacement. Just meters away from the leveÂe edges there is no evidence of the avalanche's impact, and the pediment gravels are undisturbed."

A prominent high-tide mark can be observed along the ¯ank of the entire western sector of the volcano, rising over 200 m above the main level of avalanche deposits at its base (Figs. 9b,c, and 10c). In total, however, the avalanche has climbed nearly 400 m from the lowest point on the saddle between the two volcanoes (,4600 m) to its crest at almost 5000 m on Cerro Rosado. Much of the material that washed against Cerro Rosado was de¯ected downslope to the southeast into the same valley that the main avalanche was descending (facies 4).

(1991), because the blocks are quite coherent and the individual clasts are fused together with glass rather than being separated by fractures. These megablocks, like the breadcrust-textured blocks, are interpreted to be fragments of a dacitic lava ¯ow that was extruded immediately prior to the avalanche event. The breccia-type blocks may represent fragments of the upper ¯ow-brecciated surface, as observed in the late Pleistocene ¯ows descending the southern ¯ank of the volcano.\nFacies 5 material may correspond to the axial-A deposits of Palmer et al. (1991), which are characterized by abundant megablocks deposited closest to the avalanche source. The more distal deposits (axial-B) are characterized by higher matrix:clast ratios, whereas ®ne-grained marginal lithofacies deposits (lahars) are not observed at Llullaillaco due to the absence of water.\nAn attempt was made to investigate the scarp from which the avalanche descended, but the steep slopes and unconsolidated nature of the debris limited ascent to about 5500 m. From the Landsat image, however, it appears that the top of the scarp is at about 6500 m, just below the crater summit.

    "text": "Shreve (1968) introduced the concept of equivalent coef®cient of friction for debris avalanches, de®ning this parameter as tan a H=L; where H and L are the vertical and horizontal displacements of the center of gravity of the avalanching mass. In practice, however, it is dif®cult to determine the locations of the initial and ®nal centers of gravity, and H and L are commonly measured from the crown to the tip of the avalanche (the ªFahrboÈschungº of Heim, 1932; tan21(H/L) is the ªtravel angleº of Cruden and Varnes, 1996). HsuÈ (1975) noted that this calculation, although theoretically incorrect, provides a consistent relative measure of equivalent coef®cient of friction.\nFor a simple rock or dry granular mass sliding under normal circumstances, the coef®cient of friction is expected to be about 0.62 (a travel angle of 328). However, it is repeatedly observed that large avalanches subtend a much shallower angle from crown to tip, with equivalent coef®cient of friction often #0.1 (Ui, 1983; Siebert, 1984). HsuÈ (1975) de®ned the term ªexcessive travel distance,º Le L 2 H=tan 328; and suggested that Le is proportional\nJ.P. Richards, M. Villeneuve / Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 105 (2001) 77±105 99\nto log volume of ¯ow for volumes . 5 £ 106 m3: Ui (1983) later showed that an approximately linear relationship exists between log Le and log volume for dry volcanic debris avalanches with volumes over 0.1 km3.\nEvaluation of these parameters in the case of Llullaillaco is complicated by the fact that the avalanche bifurcated around Cerro Rosado, and in effect behaved as two separate ¯ows. The north avalanche traveled approximately 25 km horizontally L 25 km along a curved path, whereas the south avalanche traveled ,23 km L 23 km : Both avalanches halted at the same level in the Salina de Llullaillaco, at an elevation of ,3700 m. If it is assumed that they both originated from the same scarp on the volcano, the crest of which is located at ,6500 m, then H 2:8 km: Using these estimates, equivalent coef®cients of friction of 0.11 and 0.12 can be calculated for the north and south limbs, respectively, corresponding to excess travel distances of 20.5 and 18.5 km.\nInformation about the thickness and internal structure of the avalanche deposit is sparse because it is undissected, and therefore offers no natural sections. The only information available is from the margins, where leveÂes up to 50 m high were locally built. However, this cannot be a representative thickness because elsewhere (e.g. on the northern edge of the north limb) the margins of the deposit are almost imperceptible, whereas thick deposits are likely to have built up in the constriction zone between Cerros Rosado and 5074. If a value of 10 m is used as an order-of-magnitude estimate of average deposit thickness, then with an area coverage of 165 km2, a total volume of between 1 and 2 km3 is indicated, or ,1 km3 for each of the north and south avalanches. Ui (1983) showed empirically that dry volcanic debris avalanches of ,1 km3 volume are characterized by excess travel distances of 10±20 km, and the estimates of 23 and 25 km calculated above for the Llullaillaco deposits are broadly consistent with this analysis.\nThe ability of avalanches to climb topographic obstacles is well established (Naranjo and Francis, 1987; Francis and Wells, 1988; Stoopes and Sheridan, 1992; Wadge et al., 1995), and an estimate of minimum ¯ow velocity (v) can be obtained from the run-up height attained (h) using the relationship v\n2gh 0:5; where g is the acceleration due to gravity (Naranjo and Francis, 1987; Stoopes and Sheridan, 1992). Avalanche deposits at Llullaillaco show evidence of climbing in three separate locations, with lateral ascent of ,100 m along the northeast slope of Cerro 5074 where the path of the southern avalanche was constrained to curve slightly to the east, ,200 m where a marginal lobe of the ¯ow ascended the northwest face of this same hill, and ,400 m where the main body of the avalanche broke against Cerro Rosado. These values yield minimum velocities of 45±90 ms21, comparable to estimates for volcanic avalanches at Mount St. Helens (USA), Lastarria (Chile), and Colima (Mexico) (Voight et al., 1981; Naranjo and Francis, 1987; Stoopes and Sheridan, 1992)."

    "text": "Llullaillaco is a composite volcano, having been constructed in at least two distinct stages during the Quaternary (radiometric ages range from 1.5 to 0.05 Ma; Gardeweg et al., 1984; this work). The older edi®ce consists of dacitic volcanic materials which have been morphologically degraded by glaciation. Younger dacitic lavas were erupted from a central vent on top of the older edi®ce, their viscous nature resulting in stacking of short stubby ¯ows to form a tall, steep cone.\nThis multistage constructional evolution is typical of many of the larger Quaternary volcanoes in the Andean CVZ [e.g. Tata Sabaya, Bolivia (de Silva et al., 1993); Nevados de Payachata, Chile (WoÈrner et al., 1988); OllaguÈe, Chile/Bolivia (Feeley et al., 1993); San Pedro, Chile (Francis et al., 1974; O'Callaghan and Francis, 1986); Lascar, Chile (Matthews et al., 1999)]. The extended history of these composite vents probably re¯ects a deep lithospheric structural control which acted to focus magma ascent repeatedly over long periods of time (Lahsen, 1982; Sal®ty, 1985; Gardeweg and Ramirez, 1987; Matteini et al., 1997; Acocella et al., 1999).\nCompositionally, the dacitic Llullaillaco lavas are similar to the products of other CVZ volcanoes,\nJ.P. Richards, M. Villeneuve / Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 105 (2001) 77±105100\nalthough K2O contents (2.1±3.0 wt.% K2O) fall in the low range of data summarized by DeÂruelle (1982) and WoÈrner et al. (1988). They are distinctly lower than those of the Quaternary shoshonitic lavas erupted further to the east in the back-arc region (e.g. DeÂruelle, 1991; Schreiber and Schwab, 1991; Matteini et al., 1997), whose origin has been ascribed to lithospheric delamination processes (Kay and Kay, 1993). Rb/Sr ratios of ,0.1 are relatively low compared with other CVZ calc-alkaline lavas (0.05± 0.70; DeÂruelle, 1982), consistent with the relatively low-K composition of the Llullaillaco suite. This observation, combined with the absence of distinct Eu anomalies in normalized REE patterns (Fig. 8), suggests that plagioclase fractionation has not been extensive despite the dominance of plagioclase phenocrysts in the lavas.\nTogether, these geochemical characteristics re¯ect the location of Llullaillaco at the western edge of the CVZ, closest to the trench.

    "text": "The volcanic debris avalanche on the southeast ¯ank of Cerro Llullaillaco is similar in many respects to other dry avalanche deposits described by HsuÈ (1975), Voight et al. (1981), Ui (1983) and Siebert (1984), with the exception that the hummocky terrain recognized in many other deposits is not well developed here (Francis and Wells, 1988). Hummocks are commonly cored by megablocks (Ui et al., 1986) and, although a few megablocks up to 20 m-wide do occur in the Llullaillaco deposit, they are not abundant. Instead, the majority of the material consists of blocks smaller than 2 m, and this material is mostly deposited in longitudinal ridges, as opposed to isolated hummocks. Part of the reason for the lack of superlarge blocks at Llullaillaco may lie in the steep initial descent of the collapsing structure, which fell a maximum distance of approximately 1500 m over the ®rst four horizontal kilometers (an average slope of ,208; Fig. 10a). This initial steep fall may have been suf®cient to disaggregate thoroughly the collapsing\nmaterial, such that blocks larger than ,20 m were not preserved (e.g. Ui et al., 1986; Schneider and Fisher, 1998). It is also interesting to note that the largest blocks were observed in the proximal facies 5 (axial-A) deposits, and consist of fragments of lava that appear to have been hot at the time of emplacement (as suggested by breadcrust textures and radial cooling joints). This lava may have been extruded on top of the pre-collapse structure, and may have ridden the tail of the avalanche, thereby avoiding excessive comminution in the main body of the ¯ow. The material being hot and plastic, it would also have resisted brittle fragmentation better than cold, solidi®ed lava.\nMuch attention has been directed recently to ascertaining the causes of volcanic debris avalanches (e.g. EOS, 1999, vol. 80, pp. 549±550), and suggested mechanisms include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, dyke injection, heavy rains, and melting of glacial ice. These speci®c triggers act on volcanic edi®ces already weakened by hydrothermal alteration, or oversteepened by accumulation of viscous silicic lava ¯ows (Voight et al., 1981; Siebert, 1984; Francis and Wells, 1988; Sowers and Schuster, 1992). At Llullaillaco, there is little direct evidence for the cause of the avalanche, but the presence of hot lava blocks in the proximal deposits and the currently precipitous form of the remaining structure suggest that the extrusion of a dacitic ¯ow from the summit area to the southeast may have caused gravitational collapse of the stacked lava pile. The otherwise relatively symmetrical form of Cerro Llullaillaco and the existence of two young dacitic ¯ows extruded to the north±northwest and southwest tempts the suggestion that a third such ¯ow, extruded to the southeast and preserved as fragments in the deposit, triggered the collapse of this side of the volcano. If this causative eruption was coeval with the southwest dacite ¯ow at ,0.05 Ma, then the bulk of the material in the avalanche appears to consist of slightly older dacitic material from Llullaillaco I (,0.15 Ma). The remaining edi®ce is oversteepened and highly unstable, and it would appear that either of the other two late Pleistocene dacite ¯ows could have caused similar gravitational collapses. Any future volcanism from the summit area should be considered to constitute a severe avalanche risk, although danger to life is small in this uninhabited area.\nJ.P. Richards, M. Villeneuve / Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research 105 (2001) 77±105 101"

    "heading": "9.3. Comparisons with other Neogene volcanic debris avalanches of the Central Andes",
    "text": "Cone or sector collapse is a common feature of composite calc-alkaline volcanoes in the Central Andes (Wood and Francis, 1985; Francis and Wells, 1988), and a number of the resultant epiclastic deposits have been studied in detail (e.g. Tata Sabaya (de Silva et al., 1993); San Pedro (Francis et al., 1974); OllaguÈe (Feeley et al., 1993); Socompa (Francis et al., 1985; Wadge et al., 1995); Lastarria (Naranjo and Francis, 1987)). Of these, the volcanic debris avalanche of Socompa is by far the largest and most spectacular, with an estimated volume and area coverage of 25.7 km3 and 490 km2, respectively (Wadge et al., 1995). The Llullaillaco deposit is typical, however, of intermediate size deposits, its ,165 km2 surface area being comparable to that of Tata Sabaya (,300 km2; de Silva et al., 1993) and OllaguÈe (,100 km2; Feeley et al., 1993), but considerably larger than Lastarria (9.3 km2; Naranjo and Francis, 1987).\nSector collapse in these young calc-alkaline stratovolcanoes appears to be a natural part of their evolution, following the construction of tall, oversteepened edi®ces by vertical stacking of thick, viscous lavas. Triggers for collapse of these gravitationally unstable structures probably vary from volcano to volcano, and clear evidence of the mechanism is rarely preserved. Prismatic jointed and breadcrust textured blocks occur in many of these deposits, however, suggesting coeval extrusion of lavas or intrusion of cryptodomes. Renewed injection of magma into the edi®ce, combined with associated seismic activity, seems a likely cause for periodic sector collapse."
  }, {
    "heading": "10. Conclusions",
    "text": "Llullaillaco is a typical example of a Quaternary composite stratovolcano from the Andean CVZ. The edi®ce was constructed since ,1.5 Ma in two main stages. An early stage of medium-K dacitic volcanism has been degraded by glaciation, but was followed by eruption of slightly more felsic medium-K dacites from the summit during the late Quaternary. These viscous ¯ows built a tall, steep edi®ce, whose SE\n¯ank underwent sector collapse at or shortly after 0.15 Ma. The resulting volcanic debris avalanche covered an area of ,165 km2, and ¯owed in two lobes around an intervening older volcano for 23 and 25 km, respectively. The presence of breadcrusttextured blocks of dacitic lava with radial cooling joints in proximal parts of the deposit suggest that lava eruption or emplacement of a cryptodome may have triggered the avalanche."

  "abstractText": "Llullaillaco is one of a chain of Quaternary stratovolcanoes that de®nes the present Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ), and marks the border between Chile and Argentina/Bolivia. The current edi®ce is constructed from a series of thick dacitic lava ̄ows, forming the second tallest active volcano in the world (6739 m). K±Ar and new biotite laser Ar/Ar step-heating dates indicate that the volcano was constructed during the Pleistocene (#1.5 Ma), with a youngest date of 0.048 ^ 0.012 Ma being recorded for a fresh dacite  ̄ow that descends the southern  ̄ank. Additional Ar/Ar measurements for andesitic and dacitic lava  ̄ows from the surrounding volcanic terrain yield dates of between 11:94 ^ 0:13 Ma and 5:48 ^ 0:07 Ma; corresponding to an extended period of Miocene volcanism which de®nes much of the landscape in this region. Majorand trace-element compositions of lavas from Llullaillaco are typical of Miocene±Pleistocene volcanic rocks from the western margin of the CVZ, and are related to relatively shallow-dipping subduction of the Nazca plate beneath northern Chile and Argentina. Oversteepening of the edi®ce by stacking of thick, viscous, dacitic lava  ̄ows resulted in collapse of its southeastern  ̄ank to form a large volcanic debris avalanche. Biotite Ar/Ar dating of lava blocks from the avalanche deposit indicate that collapse occurred at or after ,0.15 Ma, and may have been triggered by extrusion of a dacitic  ̄ow similar to the one dated at 0:048 ^ 0:012 Ma: The avalanche deposits are exceptionally well preserved due to the arid climate, and prominent leveÂes, longitudinal ridges, and megablocks up to 20-m diameter are observed. The avalanche descended ,2.8 km vertically, and bifurcated around an older volcano, Cerro Rosado, before debouching onto the salt  ̄ats of Salina de Llullaillaco. The north and south limbs of the avalanche traveled 25 and 23 km, respectively, and together cover an area of approximately 165 km. Estimates of deposit volume are hampered by a lack of thickness information except at the edges, but it is likely to be between 1 and 2 km. Equivalent coef®cients of friction of 0.11 and 0.12, and excess travel distances of 20.5 and 18.5 km, are calculated for the north and south limbs, respectively. The avalanche ascended ,400 m where it broke against the western  ̄ank of Cerro Rosado, and a minimum  ̄ow velocity of ,90 m s can be calculated at this point; lower velocities of ,45 m s are calculated where distal toes ascend ,200 m slopes. It is suggested that the remaining precipitous edi®ce has a high probability for further avalanche collapse in the event of renewed volcanism. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
