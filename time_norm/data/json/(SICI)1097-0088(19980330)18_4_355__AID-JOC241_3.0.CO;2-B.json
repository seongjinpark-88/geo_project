    "text": "Variations in climate can be attributed to natural and anthropogenic perturbations of the radiative forcing and to internal variability (Manabe et al., 1991). Predictions of global and regional climate change require the use of three-dimensional coupled models of the land surface and of the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean. However, simpler climate models, some with only one dimension, either horizontal (e.g. Robock, 1979) or vertical (e.g. Hoffert et al., 1980) have been used to simulate the global mean temperature record. These require, as input, estimates of the climate sensitivity—the equilibrium sensitivity of global mean temperature to a given radiative perturbation—which can be derived from the results of the three-dimensional models. Although Robock (1979) obtained a very good fit to the Northern Hemisphere land temperature record since 1881 taking account only of volcanic aerosol, inclusion of ocean and Southern Hemisphere data led to a substantially different global record. The ability of such simple models to represent aspects of the response of the global temperature record to greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulphate aerosols has been further demonstrated by Wigley (1991). However, recent studies of climate change using simple models have been able to fit the global temperature record only by allowing hypothetical contributions, as proposed by Friis-Christensen and Lassen (1991), from perturbations of the solar forcing (Schlesinger and Ramankutty, 1992; Kelly and Wigley, 1992) or by inferring a significant role for internal variations of the climate system (Schlesinger and Ramankutty, 1994). None of these recent attempts included volcanic forcing.\nIn this paper we report on experiments in which forcings by greenhouse gases and by tropospheric and stratospheric (volcanic) sulphate aerosols are all included. We obtain a fit to the observed record which\n* Correspondence to: 25 Bramblegate, Crowthorne, Berkshire, RG45 6JA, UK.\nCCC 0899–8418/98/040355–23$17.50 © 1998 Royal Meteorological Society\nsuggests that the temperature record of the last century can be explained without requiring contributions from variations in solar intensity and internal climate variability."

    "text": "Box models of the climate system have been used widely for predicting climate since their introduction by Hoffert et al. (1980). The model used here is similar to that of Wigley (1985) who combined the atmosphere, land and ocean mixed-layer in a single box. This takes advantage of the rapid coupling between the troposphere and the near-surface layers of ocean and land to combine these parts of the climate system (Figure 1). The relatively rapid horizontal interchange of heat via the atmosphere between the top ‘troposphere–surface’ layers for atmosphere–ocean and atmosphere–land is represented by a simple mixing (described later). The model’s layer boundaries are at 30, 125, 375, 875, 1875 and 3875 m in the ocean, and at 1, 3, 7, 15, 31 and 63 m depth below the land surface.\nThe radiative heat flux, H, at the tropopause is formulated as in the feedback studies of Schlesinger (1986):\nH=SQn−DT× (1− f )/G0 (1)\nwhere DT is the departure of the top layer temperature from the initial equilibrium state and SQn is the sum of the imposed radiative perturbations, Qn, due to perturbations of atmospheric composition. The factor f represents the climate feedback parameter (Schlesinger, 1986). The parameter\nG0=Ts/S(1−ap)\nrepresents the sensitivity of surface temperature to H in the absence of feedbacks other than the negative one due to temperature. Variable Ts is the mean surface temperature, S is the solar constant and ap is the planetary albedo. Taking typical values of Ts=288 K, S=1370 W m−2 and ap=0.3, then G0=0.3 K (W m−2)−1.\nThe equilibrium response to SQn is\nDT={G0 SQn/(1− f )}\nThus for a doubled CO2 perturbation QCD of 4.3 W m−2 at the tropopause the response in the absence of other feedbacks ( f=0) is 1.29 K. This basic response is amplified by positive feedbacks such as those\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\ndue to water vapour increasing and snow and ice extents decreasing as the atmosphere warms, and decreased by negative feedbacks such as the reduced lapse rate with a warmer moister atmosphere. There is considerable uncertainty about the total feedback effect and the related climate sensitivity or temperature increase for a given radiative perturbation, mainly due to uncertainties in the sign and magnitude of the feedbacks associated with cloud (Senior and Mitchell, 1993). The response of 1.5 K to 4.5 K proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; Houghton et al., 1990) corresponds to a range of f from 0.14 to 0.713.\nThe ocean and land are treated separately but using the same equations with the appropriate value of DT being used in Equation (1) for H. The same radiative perturbations have been assumed in these experiments—i.e. no continent–ocean contrast in forcing has been applied. The mixing between the atmospheres over land and ocean is included by addition of terms representing horizontal advective fluxes:\ndTL/dt=CLO× (TO−TL); dTO/dt=COL× (TL−TO)\nUse of the relation\nCLO=COL× (0.735/0.265)× (dz(1)/dzl(1))× ((rcp)/(rcp)L)\nequalizes the fluxes. Here dz(1) and dzl(1) are the effective depths (i.e. including allowance for the heat capacity of the atmosphere) of the top layers of the ocean and land models, respectively. Variables (rcp) and (rcp)L are the heat capacities of ocean and land, respectively. The coefficient COL can be tuned by validating simulations of the seasonal cycle in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes; this led to use of a value of 5 (year)−1.\nThe slow transfers of heat between the surface layers and deeper layers of the ocean and land are represented by vertical diffusive processes with diffusion coefficients k. In most of the experiments, the vertical diffusivity is taken as 10−4 m2 s−1 for the ocean (Hansen et al., 1984). Vertical diffusivity for land is taken as 2.4×10−7 m2 s−1. The globally averaged ocean upwelling compensating a high-latitude bottom-water formation term, included in some more complicated box-diffusion models, is omitted. Inclusion of this upwelling requires at least two additional empirical constants, the mean upwelling rate, and the ratio, p, of the change in temperature of the upwelling water to the change in global mean temperature. The model used by Kattenberg et al. (1996) used p=0.2, and also included three further empirical constants, the equilibrium land/ocean warming ratio, a threshold temperature change at which the upwelling rate approaches a minimum and the value of this minimum. Comparisons by Bretherton et al. (1990) showed results from experiments omitting upwelling lying between those from experiments including it which assume p=0 and p=1, and sufficiently close to the results for p=0 to suggest that results may be near to those for p=0.2.\n3. RADIATIVE FORCING IN THE MODEL\n3.1. Introduction\nThe model as used here includes forcing due to carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols. A number of forcing factors are missing from this list.\n(i) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and stratospheric ozone: the warming effect of CFCs was assumed to be offset in the global mean by the cooling resulting from their depletion of stratospheric ozone (Isaksen et al., 1992; Toumi et al., 1994). Although estimates of the net forcing have been made these have not fully resolved the problem of the strong sensitivity of the net forcing to the location of the ozone loss relative to the tropopause, and the consequent need to include realistically the vertical variations of tropopause height.\n(ii) Tropospheric ozone observations over Europe indicate an increase in tropospheric ozone since the last century. Although these radiative effects are substantial (e.g. approaching 1 W m−2 at Payerne (47°N, 7°E)), models suggest that the globally averaged contribution is likely to be much smaller (C. Johnson, personal communication).\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\n(iii) Variations in solar emissions have been omitted because of lack of knowledge (Isaksen et al., 1992). Observations from satellites show them to be small (of the order 0.1% or 0.2 W m−2 for global mean net top of atmosphere downward flux from peak to trough) over the last 11-year solar cycle; longer term variations which could affect decadal time-scales have been estimated to be about 0.1 W m−2\nsince the late nineteenth century (Foukal and Lean, 1990), which is smaller than the significant effects due to CO2, CH4 and aerosols considered here. (iv) Changes in other tropospheric aerosols, increases in some of which are expected to contribute a positive forcing (e.g. soot). Any such forcing should be included once confidence in its magnitude is adequate.\n3.2. Greenhouse gases\n3.2.1. Carbon dioxide (CO2). Both anthropogenic and biospheric inputs of CO2 are represented. The CO2 input from burning of fossil fuels was defined explicitly by fitting exponential formulae to the data provided by Rotty (1982) (with updated data from Boden et al. (1991)). The fit is generally good; the integrated input over the period from 1860 to 1980 is 162.5 GtC compared with Rotty’s total of 162.2 GtC. For the period from 1750 to 1860, prior to Rotty’s data, the exponential growth rate was assumed to be the same as for 1860–1913. The formulae used for the fossil fuel input (ffi) were as in Table I.\nA simple CO2 model is used to achieve an approximate separation of the fossil fuel and biospheric contributions to changes in CO2. It divides each of these contributions into three unequal parts. Half of each year’s input is added to a transient store, where it is subject to exponential loss with a half-life of 130 years. Of the remaining half, a fraction p is retained permanently, and the residual fraction (1−p) is assumed to be lost immediately to the ocean and terrestrial sinks. We can compare this model with Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann’s multicomponent box model of the carbon cycle in terms of the integrated warming due to CO2 as defined by Schwartz’s greenhouse warming integrals (GWIs) (MaierReimer and Hasselmann, 1987; Schwartz, 1993). Reasonable agreement was obtained with p=0.422, for which the GWIs at 50, 100, 150 and 200 years are 8.0, 15.3, 20.9 and 25.6 mJ m−2 kgC−1, compared with 9.2, 15.5, 20.7 and 25.2 mJ m−2 kgC−1 for Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann’s model.\nThe biospheric input from 1750 was calculated as the residual input required to fit (to within about 1 ppmV) the atmospheric CO2 history as estimated by Siegenthaler and Oeschger (1987) and Boden et al. (1991) based on ice-core and atmospheric data; this implied an input consisting of a linear increase from zero in 1750 to 0.48 GtC year−1 in 1830, a constant value of 0.48 from 1830 to 1920 and then a linear decrease to zero in 1940; after 1940, simulation of the CO2 record to within 1 ppmV was obtainable with zero net biospheric input for the assumptions made here. This implies a balance since 1940 between release of CO2 due to deforestation and opposing changes, possibly associated with afforestation or with ‘fertilization’ of vegetation by increased CO2. The above evolution of biospheric input is similar to that obtained with a box-diffusion carbon-cycle model fitted to CO2 data from ice-cores (Siegenthaler and Oeschger, 1987); the recent net zero input is within the range of estimates in IPCC 1994 (Schimel et al., 1995, table 1.3). The initial (1750) CO2 concentration is taken as 278.4 ppmV.\nThe heating due to CO2 has been modelled assuming that a doubling of CO2 decreases the net upward radiative flux at the tropopause for a given atmospheric structure by 4.3 W m−2 (based on Hansen et al. (1984)) and that this flux scales with ln(CO2), a good approximation despite its neglect of the CO2 hot\nbands. Thus the heating perturbation due to CO2 is\nQCD= (4.3/ln2)(ln(CO2)− ln(CO2)0)\nwhere (CO2)0 is the initial value of CO2.\n3.2.2. Methane (CH4). The changes in methane concentration (CM) have been based on the analysis of ice-core data by Etheridge et al. (1992). They noted the constancy of the temporal gradient over long periods. Their data for 1841–1978 were fitted using the simple functions shown in Table II, based on their estimates of this gradient. Extrapolation to the periods before 1841 and after 1978 used the functions for 1841–1883 and 1968–1978, respectively. As their data were for Antarctica, relative to which global mean estimates in the 1980s were about 3% higher (based on data in Boden et al., 1991), the results of the above calculations were increased by 3%.\nThe contribution of methane to the top of the atmosphere (TOA) longwave radiative perturbation is taken as\nQM=0.0424× ((CM)0.5− (CM)00.5)\nThis formulation (from Wigley (1985) and Hansen et al. (1984)) gives very similar radiative perturbations to those used in the 1990 IPCC Report (Shine et al., 1990); the small difference from Shine et al. (1990) due to omission of overlaps between methane and nitrous oxide is at least partly offset by the omission of indirect effects (due to water vapour according to Shine et al. (1990), and ozone according to the 1992 IPCC Supplement (Isaksen et al., 1992)).\n3.2.3. Nitrous oxide. A simple budget was used to represent the evolution of the concentration (CN, ppbv) of N2O. Thus\nd(CN)/dt=CNE−CN×CNK\nThe lifetime (1/CNK) was taken as 167 years, slightly above the 150 years preferred by Khalil and Rasmussen (1992).\nSpecification of the source (CNE) is difficult given present uncertainties. It has two parts, a ‘natural’ component, which is assumed to balance the pre-industrial sink (CN0×CNK, where CN0 is the pre-industrial concentration), and an anthropogenic component. Here, it was specified so as to simulate the N2O as estimated from ice-core and atmospheric data, using a pre-industrial concentration of 280 ppbv. This is a little lower than the 285 ppbv of Khalil and Rasmussen (1992); note, however, that Leuenberger and Siegenthaler (1992) suggest 260 ppbV. The estimated values since 1980 were within 2 ppb of the observations, sufficiently close given the weak contribution of N2O to total forcing relative to other factors.\nThe heating due to N2O was specified as\nQN=0.14((CN)0.5− (CN)00.5)\nThis formulation is as used in the 1990 IPCC Report (Shine et al., 1990) except for omission of the effect of overlaps between methane and nitrous oxide; this omission leads to a 5% overestimation for current values of nitrous oxide, a small error relative to the total forcing.\n3.3. Tropospheric aerosols\nTropospheric aerosols, represented in the model by sulphates, deplete solar radiation in two ways: a ‘direct’ radiative effects occurs through reflection of solar radiation by the aerosols in the absence of cloud; an ‘indirect’ effect comes from an increase in cloud condensation nuclei, which tends to give more and smaller cloud droplets and a consequent brightening of clouds—cloud water content may also change as precipitation may be delayed by the change in droplet size distribution. Estimates of the recent tropopause radiative forcing for sulphur emissions (as estimated for 1980 by Langner and Rodhe (1991)) of 70 MtS year−1 range between about −0.3 and −1 W m−2 for both direct effect (QSD) (Charlson et al., 1992; Kiehl and Briegleb, 1993) and indirect effect (QSI) (Charlson et al., 1992; Kaufman and Chou, 1993; Jones et al., 1994).\nThe history of tropospheric sulphate forcing has been estimated following Dignon and Hameed (1989). Because of the short lifetime of sulphates in the troposphere, the aerosol concentration was assumed to be proportional to the sulphur emissions (ES). This assumption neglects possible effects on the concentrations of the elevations of the inputs of S (tall stacks or short stacks) and of their geographical distribution; future studies should aim to incorporate these effects. The sulphur emissions were linked to rates of fossil fuel burning by:\nES=Sctrl×Sfrac×Scon× ffi\nHere, ffi is the fossil fuel CO2 input in GtC year−1; Scon=21.4 (MtS/GtC) is a conversion factor for solid fuel; Sfrac is a time-varying factor representing the effect of use of oil and natural gas instead of solid fuels; and Sctrl represents the effect of controls on sulphur emissions.\nThe temporal variations of Sfrac and Sctrl were derived from an analysis of the CO2 emissions data in Boden et al. (1991) and the estimates of sulphur emissions in Dignon and Hameed (1989) and Hameed and Dignon (1992). Table III presents the basic data. It should be mentioned that there are substantial divergences between estimates of S emissions. For example, Möller (1984) estimated the 1980 emission at 80 MtS, and Charlson et al. (1991) used the mean of the estimates by Möller and the Dignon–Hameed estimates used here. The values used in the model are detailed in Table IV.\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nThe constant values of Sfrac and Sctrl in recent years are partly a reflection of a lack of data near the end of the period and should be regarded as provisional and liable to revision. In part, however, they may be attributable to effects of higher oil prices in the 1970s and the increasing dominance in fossil fuel use of solid fuel burning in China.\nThe temporal variation of the radiative effects is expected to be roughly linearly related to sulphur emissions for the direct effect. To reflect the uncertainty in the relation between concentrations and radiative forcing, more than one value was tested for the ratio. To obtain a forcing of −0.5 W m−2 for an input of 70 Mts year−1, the direct effect was specified as:\nQSD= −0.00714 ES\nFor the indirect effect, the increase is less than linear due to the non-linear dependence of the number of cloud droplets on the number of CCN, and a power of 1/3 in the inverse relation between effective radius and number of CCNs (Kaufman and Chou, 1993; Jones et al., 1994; Martin et al., 1994). A series of experiments by A. Jones (personal communication) with aerosol loading half, equal to and double that of Langner and Rodhe (1991) was used to derive a dependence on sulphate emissions:\nQSI=1.826QSI(70)((1+0.1 ES)0.21−1)\nwhere QSI(70) is the heating for an input of 70 MtS year−1. This was chosen to be of similar form to that of Kaufman and Chou (1993), whose equation had an exponent of 0.24.\n3.4. Stratospheric 6olcanic sulphate aerosols\nStratospheric aerosols originating from volcanic eruptions also significantly perturb the radiative forcing of climate (e.g. Russell et al., 1993). Provision of estimates for the period since 1750 poses considerable problems, as discussed in the Appendix. Because of these problems, the estimates made here do not attempt to create a definitive quantitative estimate of the history of radiative forcing by volcanoes. Rather, the aim is to assess the sensitivity of temperature to a range of estimates of the radiative forcing, obtained by diverse approaches.\nThe following estimates were used.\n(i) Lamb (1970, 1984), based on a combination of documentary evidence and surface radiation data, with some dependence on observed temperatures though not if they were the only indicator of an eruption.\n(ii) ‘M, H’ based on ice-core data from Moore et al. (1991) and Hammer et al. (1980), with variations within each decade from Lamb (1970, 1984).\n(iii) Sato et al. (1993), based on a range of documentary, surface radiation, and satellite data. (iv) Ice-core volcanic index (IVI) based on data derived from ice-cores by Robock and Free\n(1995).\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\n(iii) and (iv) provide data only for after 1850, and so they are extended back to 1750 using data set (ii). More detail on the derivation of these estimates is given in the Appendix.\nConversion of the above estimates of optical depth to tropopause radiative forcing (QV) was based on the calculations by Russell et al. (1993) using observations at Mauna Loa Observatory (Hawaii) following the eruption of Pinatubo in 1991. These indicate that an aerosol optical depth of 0.1 gives a reduction in downward flux at the tropopause of about 2.5 W m−2 (3.9 solar less 1.4 longwave). This is adjusted to 2.3 W m−2 to take account of the longwave effect of typical stratospheric warming of approaching 1 K observed following Pinatubo and other recent eruptions (Angell, 1993) (based on calculations by W.J. Ingram, personal communication). This estimate is 23% less than that of 3 W m−2 by Lacis et al. (1992), although they obtained 2.4 W m−2 for size distributions measured soon after the El Chichon eruption of 1982. The results obtained here need only be scaled linearly to indicate the results of using the conversion suggested by Lacis et al. (1992).\nFigure 2 shows the decadal means for the different sources. Before 1850, some of the main differences would be reduced if the Lamb DVI record were adjusted to take account of evidence noted in the Appendix that there was a strong eruption in 1809 and that Coseguina (1835) was less important. After 1850, the most important difference are in the 1910s, when Sato and Lamb give less prominence to the Katmai (1912) eruption, in the 1950s when the IVI suggests more activity than the other techniques, and in the 1960s when the aerosol optical depths associated with Agung are larger according to Sato and the IVI than with the smaller Lamb conversion.\nIt should be noted that there are no radiative observations to support these estimates of the volcanic effects before 1883—and only one until 1892 and at most two and three until 1896 and 1906, respectively (Kimball, 1924)—and that the interpretations of the ice-core data may have significant errors (e.g. Hammer et al., 1980; Robock and Free, 1995).\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\n3.5. E6olution of radiati6e forcing since 1750\n3.5.1. Anthropogenic contribution. Figure 3 shows the temporal evolution of the anthropogenic contributions to radiative forcing according to the specifications above. Except for the sulphate aerosols, the earlier discussion suggests that the main features of the evolution are unlikely to be very different from what Figure 3 shows. The uncertainty in the forcing by sulphate aerosols is of the order of a factor of two in absolute magnitude and also uncertain in temporal development because of the uncertain relative roles of the direct and indirect effects.\nA number of points may be noted as below.\n(i) For much of the period since 1750, the forcing was dominated by biospheric CO2, which contributed more than all the other sources combined until 1920. This feature of the record follows from the CO2 record from ice-cores and also such ground-based data as we have from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the estimates of fossil fuel burning, which are an order of magnitude too small to explain the CO2 increase. On these estimates its contribution has declined since the mid-twentieth century—this feature is less certain, but of less importance because of the increasingly dominating role of the fossil fuel source.\n(ii) The methane contribution is the next largest until after 1910. It has continued to increase although it is now less than half that of fossil fuel CO2. The ice-core record provides strong constraints even before the era of atmospheric observations. Nitrous oxide’s role is relatively small.\n(iii) As noted previously by Wigley (1991) and Isaksen et al. (1992), the role of fossil fuel burning is uncertain even as to sign until the late twentieth century because of the approximate cancellation in the global mean between the CO2 and sulphate aerosol. Figure 4 shows forcings covering a range of sulphate aerosol contributions. The difference between the two forcings (curves (iii), (iv)) with total forcing of 1 W m−2 is due to the tailing off of the indirect response as the emissions and sulphate concentrations increase. Note that the lowest published estimates for direct forcing in 1980 are about 0.3 W m−2 (Kiehl and Briegleb, 1993), whereas at the higher end of the range, indirect forcing estimates have exceeded 1 W m−2 (Jones et al., 1994). However, these estimates are very sensitive to assumptions made, particularly those concerning the natural or background aerosol concentrations.\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nWith aerosol forcing larger than about 2 W m−2 for 1980 sulphur emissions of 70 MtS year−1, it becomes impossible to explain the observational record of the last several decades because the total forcing (including non-fossil fuel sources) is negative.\nAn interesting feature is that, as discussed by Isaksen et al. (1992), the initial response to, say, a decrease in the rate of increase of fossil fuel burning is an increase in positive radiative forcing. This is because the sulphates respond immediately to the change whereas the response of CO2, being cumulative, is small on short time-scales. In mathematical terms, if the total (sulphate and CO2) forcing, F(t), due to fossil fuel burning behaves like\nF(t)=a0 & t\n0\nffi(t %) dt %−b0ffi(t)\nthen balance between the sulphate (second term) and CO2 forcing (first term) requires that the fossil fuel input (ffi(t)) be proportional to exp(a0t/b0) (D.L. Roberts, personal communication). Thus if the sulphate cooling balances the CO2 heating with fossil fuel burning increasing exponentially, then, when the increase of ffi(t) slows, the CO2 heating becomes dominant. For the estimated fossil fuel burning (Table I) and radiative forcing as defined above, (a0/b0) was large enough for sulphates to dominate until 1913 and for part of 1946–1973.\nThis explains the steady growth of negative forcing due to fossil fuel burning, even with the scenarios with weaker S contributions, until the brake to fossil fuel burning applied at the start of World War I; it also explains the decline in combined forcing during the rapid growth of fossil fuel burning after World War II. The calculated history of the decadal increases in selected contributions to the heating (Figure 5) illustrates this; the CO2 increase became dominant during the period of constant a0 before 1973 because b0 decreased as constraints on sulphur emissions increased (Dignon and Hameed, 1989). As discussed by Wigley (1991), even with a balance between sulphates and CO2 forcing in the global mean, climate would still be affected because of the spatial heterogeneity of the sulphate forcing caused by its short lifetime in the atmosphere.\n3.5.2. Combination of anthropogenic and 6olcanic forcing. The total anthropogenic forcing (Figure 6) for a total aerosol forcing of 1 W m−2 grew only about linearly until after 1950, very different to the\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nnear-exponential, mostly twentieth century, growth that dominance by fossil fuel CO2 would have given (Figure 3). With the weaker aerosol forcing of 0.6 W m−2 (Figure 7) there is more increase after 1920. Before the volcanic forcings were included, each was adjusted by a fixed offset to give zero mean volcanic forcing over the period 1750–1979. Addition of any of the volcanic forcings considered here leads to a curve (Figure 7) with variations on time-scales of a few decades that are dominated by volcanoes. Particularly noticeable are the strong negative volcanic forcings of the early and late nineteenth century and the positive forcing of the mid-twentieth century when volcanic eruptions were few. These introduce variations of the order of 0.3 W m−2 on decadal time-scales about a basic forcing that, with the stronger\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\n(weaker) of the aerosol forcings shown, only exceeds 0.3 W m−2 from around 1920 (1900). A clear implication of this is that we should expect well-marked contributions to the global warming record from volcanoes unless internal variations are so large as to obscure all forced variability up to the late twentieth century; estimates from global circulation models (GCMs) (Manabe et al., 1991) suggest that this is unlikely.\n4. TEMPERATURE PREDICTIONS\n4.1. Climate sensiti6ity\nTo interpret the radiative forcing record in terms of temperatures, it is necessary to define the model’s ‘climate sensitivity’ (equilibrium warming on doubling CO2). The values from three-dimensional coupled climate models lie in the range from about 2–4.5 K (Kattenberg et al., 1996, table 6.3). With such a large range, we could define a value on the basis of what gave the observed temperature increase over, say, the last 100 years. Figure 8 illustrates the effects of greenhouse gases alone for sensitivities near the extremes of this range, f=0.2 and 0.7 giving equilibrium warming for CO2 doubling of 1.6 K and 4.3 K, respectively. The lower sensitivity case agrees better with the observed warming than does the higher sensitivity case. Note that the observed temperatures used here are relative to the average for 1950–1979. For the comparison with the model the zero is adjusted arbitrarily by +0.45 K; this adjustment has no effect on statistical assessments made later in the paper. Figure 8 also shows how inclusion of S aerosols totalling 1 W m−2 for 70 MtS year−1 transforms the simulation with similar warming for 1990 with f=0.7 as was obtained in their absence for f=0.2. A problem with the greenhouse-gas-only simulation is that the shape is quite wrong, with no sign of the lack of warming from the mid-nineteenth to early twentieth century, or the similar stagnation after 1950. Inclusion of sulphate aerosols improves both these features and brings the total warming into better agreement with observations (a similar result has been obtained recently from three-dimensional models (Mitchell et al., 1995)). However, there are still large differences with, for example, the warming less than half that observed from the 1920s to the 1940s.\nAs there is also uncertainty attached to the magnitude of the tropospheric sulphate forcing, it is more justifiable to use a climate sensitivity near the middle of the range suggested by three-dimensional models.\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int.

Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nUnless stated otherwise, therefore, the subsequent results reported here use a feedback factor of 0.57, giving an equilibrium warming on doubling CO2 of 3 K.\nFigure 9 compares the results for this sensitivity using sulphate aerosol forcing chosen to give a total forcing of 0.6 W m−2 for 70 MtS year−1 with results using a higher climate sensitivity ( f=0.7) and total sulphate forcing of 1 W m−2; these forcings are chosen to give a similar warming at 1990. The fit of the former to the observed appears in some respects slightly less good, with less slowing of the warming in\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nthe late nineteenth century and after 1945. However, such a validation is not a sound criterion for assessing which is more correct because, as anticipated from its effect on radiative forcing, the inclusion of volcanic aerosols has a considerable impact, as shown for the Robock and Free (1995) scenario in Figure 9.\n4.2. Comparison of runs including 6olcanic forcing to obser6ations\nAlthough the different volcanic aerosol scenarios naturally give a range of responses (Figure 10), they all show improvements relative to the runs without volcanoes. Changes include:\n(i) lack of warming from the 1850s to the 1900s (realistic); (ii) cooling around the 1880s (not supported by Jones and Wigley’s (1991) global data, but the\ndiscrepancies relative to the observed are less than 0.1 K); (iii) strong warming from the 1910s to the 1940s (as observed); (iv) lack of warming from the 1940s to the 1960s (as observed, but the observed stagnation lasts into the\n1970s).\nSome of the differences between the scenarios are of particular interest. These include the maintenance of the lack of warming in the early twentieth century into the 1910s in the scenario based on ice-cores, which gives more emphasis to the 1912 Katmai eruption. This remains closer to the observed in the 1920s and 1930s. Two of the scenarios (Sato and IVI) have smaller warm deviations from the observed in the 1970s. Throughout the 1850–1990 period, there is always at least one curve that differs from the observed by little more than 0.1 K.\nThe departures from the observed record during the absence of observed interdecadal temperature variations from the 1850s to 1920 may be attributable to internal variations of the observed climate, which opposed the volcanic forcing. Ensemble climate simulations, run from different points in a control run, show substantial variations relative to each other (T.C. Johns, personal communication). As we have only one realization in the observed record, differences between the observed and modelled records are to be expected. The interdecadal variations are within the range of about 90.1 K suggested by three-dimensional models (e.g. Manabe et al., 1991).\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nHowever, it is worth considering other possible explanations. These include:\n(i) poor knowledge of the volcanic forcing, particularly before 1892, as noted earlier—however, the occurrence of major eruptions in this period is supported both by observations of the eruptions (Krakatoa in 1883; Tarawera in 1886) and by the ice-core record;\n(ii) incorrect estimation of global mean temperatures at a time with poorer observational coverage than recently—it is interesting that the mostly land-only record of Hansen and Lebedeff (1987) shows a marked minimum in the 1880s, as discussed later in the context of statistical assessments;\n(iii) omission of the uncertain variations in solar luminosity.\nBefore 1850, the two estimates differ substantially from each other. The Lamb DVI suggests lower activity than the ice-core record from about 1780 to 1810; Hammer et al.’s ice-core data for Greenland show a strong peak attributed to the 1783 eruption of Laki which may give too large an impact, both because of its proximity to Greenland and the probably mainly tropospheric location of the aerosol (Stothers, 1996). Lamb includes it but with less intensity. As already pointed out, the 1809 peak, included on the basis of strong peaks in some Antarctic (Legrand and Delmas, 1987; Delmas et al., 1992) and Greenland (Zielinski, 1995) ice-cores, has been attributed to a previously unknown eruption and is absent from Lamb’s record, and Lamb’s estimate of the intensity of the 1835 Coseguina eruption is not supported by ice-core data. Both the ice-core and documentary records emphasize the intensity of the 1815 Tambora eruption.\nAlthough temperature data are too sparse and of uncertain reliability to be useful before the mid-nineteenth century, data on variations in glacier length provide some evidence to compare with the model’s simulations. Table V gives a summary of the thorough analysis by Grove (1988) for 13 major glacial regions. There are interesting similarities between modelled and observed histories. Observed maxima tend to be centered near 1770–1780, 1820, 1850 and 1880–1890, corresponding quite well to the modelled temperature minima. Some lag, varying with the size of the ice sheet, is to be expected because the glacier responds to the accumulated effect of increased snowfall and/or summer cooling on its parent ice sheet. However, the lag of the 1850 glacial maximum is particularly large. The twentieth century retreat, noted by many authors including Grove (1988), and common to most glaciers at least after 1930, with slowing of the retreat and some partial readvance after 1960 is also consistent with the model’s 1960s minimum. The occurrence of major glacial maxima from 1600 onwards reported by Grove may be part of a ca. 2500 year cycle driven by variations in solar intensity (O’Brien et al., 1995). Relaxation from the\na This summary omits glaciers with heavy protective debris covers and irregularly surging glaciers, both of which tend to be atypical. Data for former USSR glaciers and those in the tropics were mostly not long enough to be useful, beyond indicating maxima before and retreat since 1900.\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\ncold phase of such an oscillation might be expected to contribute to a warming of climate for may centuries to come. However, the effect over the last century is not large: if the consequent temperature oscillation were of 1 K amplitude, peak-to-trough, and sinusoidal with a minimum in 1600, its contribution would be about 0.075 K. The possibility that a solar variation of about this period was responsible for onset of the Little Ice Age and earlier glacial maxima (Denton and Karlen, 1973), and that shorter period variations before the industrial era were due to volcanoes is appealing. However, it should be noted that Zielinski (1995) suggests that the more intense volcanic activity of the period since 1400 may also have had a role in initiation of the Little Ice Age.\n4.3. Statistical assessment of the predictions\nThe predicted decadal mean temperatures are compared statistically in Table VI with observed data based on combined land surface screen and ocean surface temperatures (Jones and Wigley, 1991) for the periods 1860–1989 and 1900–1989. The longer period utilizes the full length of Jones and Wigley’s data whereas the shorter period restricts the comparison to a period with both more reliable surface data cover and a less sparse representation of radiative measurements of the volcanic aerosols, avoiding the period before 1896 when at most two observations were available. For the later period we can also use the estimates by Hansen and Lebedeff (1987) based mainly on continental and island screen temperatures with a few ocean weather ships in the later part of the record. The period of record is 1880–1985; data from Wilson and Hansen (1994) were used to extend the record to 1989. Decadal means are used because variations on shorter time-scales are strongly influenced by internal variations of the climate system, such as ENSO (El Nino–Southern Oscillation), which the model cannot represent.\nIn the statistical analysis, the linear trend was derived by regression and removed so that the analysis isolated the skill of the predictions of departures from this trend. This is done because, except for a scenario which cools the climate, it is always possible to select a climate sensitivity that gives the correct long-term trend.\nTable VI shows the following features\n(i) The runs without volcanic aerosols have correlations that are below or near to zero for the shorter period; they correlate better for the 1860–1989 period when, in the absence of short time-scale perturbations in the forcing, they must simulate the low variability in the first part of the record and the subsequent general warming, even though they fail to simulate the major features of the twentieth century for which the data should be more reliable.\n(ii) Different volcanic indices perform best in different periods and against different estimates of the observed. The highest correlations are for the Sato et al. data against Hansen and Lebedeff’s (HL) for 1900–1989. The best all-round performance is from the volcanic index based on Moore et al.’s and Hammer et al.’s data, with correlations of between 0.64 and 0.75.\n(iii) Otherwise only the IVI, based on Robock and Free, has all correlations above 0.5 for runs with k=10−4 m2 s−1. (iv) The magnitudes of variations about the trend tend to be underestimated compared with HL but are more similar to those from Jones and Wigley (JW). Because it is dominated by land data, the HL record is likely to give a variability greater than that of merged land and ocean data.\nThe highest correlations of 0.78 (significant at the 2% level) are obtained with the Sato et al.’s aerosol optical depth (AOD) against HL for 1900–1989, with other volcanic forcings not far behind. The lower correlations for 1860–1989 are due to the absence in JW of any cool period in the 1880s, when all methods of estimation of the volcanic aerosol indicate strong volcanic activity. It is interesting that the Hansen and Lebedeff data give much lower temperatures in the 1880s, 0.17 K cooler than in the 1900s, whereas the JW data for these two decades are within 0.01 K. Correlations for the runs using Sato et al.’s (1993) data exceed 0.8 for 1880–1989 against the HL data (not shown in the table).\nPossible reasons for this difference between land and ocean temperatures, apart from it being a true representation, are that land temperatures were spuriously low or ocean temperatures spuriously high. These possibilities are given some support by the results of Parker and Folland’s comparison of near-surface air temperatures over land and SSTs for island and coastal locations (Parker and Folland, 1991). The (land−ocean) differences, which are for colocated 5° squares, exhibit a marked minimum in the 1880s at about −0.05 K compared with maxima of about 0.2 K for 10-year periods ending about 1865 and from 1910 to 1930. Parker and Folland suggest that tropical errors in land temperatures and real coolness of the land relative to the ocean in middle latitudes are more likely than sea-surface temperature (SST) errors to have been responsible for these variation. However, the differences are of similar magnitude to the globally averaged corrections applied to the SSTs (Folland and Parker, 1995), which increase from 0.11 K in 1856 to 0.42 K in 1941. Although compiled with much care, including use of shipboard night-time air temperatures, there are inevitable uncertainties in the corrections due to sparsity of information on the type of bucket used in the SST measurements, the speeds of ships and the exposure times, all of which could affect the interdecadal variations of SST during this period. A further contributor to the differences between the records is that JW give the same weight to the relatively well-observed Northern Hemisphere (NH) as to the Southern Hemisphere (SH), which has large data gaps, particularly in the early part of the record. Northern Hemisphere temperatures are 0.1 K warmer than SH temperatures in the JW data in the 1870s, 0.08 K cooler in the 1880s and similar in the 1900s, so the use of equal hemispheric weighting will increase temperatures in the 1880s relative to adjacent decades in the JW record. Hansen and Lebedeff give all regions weighting appropriate for the data coverage.\nWe have so far discussed only variations in the results due to different forcing and climate sensitivities. However, the ocean vertical diffusivity (k) is also an adjustable parameter; two of the experiments were rerun with k increased from 10−4 to 2.25×10−4 m2 s−1, as suggested by Schlesinger (1986). Differences\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\ntend to increase during periods of steady rapid warming (Figure 11). The correlations with the observed data were changed by, at most, 0.02 (Table VI).\nOtherwise the main uncertainty attaches to the magnitude of the radiative forcing by tropospheric sulphates. This depends both on the relative role of the direct and indirect effects and on the total response for a given aerosol concentration or sulphur emission. A group of experiments with feedback factor f of 0.7 demonstrate these sensitivities. Eliminating the indirect effect of aerosols, and keeping the same total response to 1990 emissions, leads to a slightly earlier warming because the sulphate cooling is reduced throughout the record until 1990 (Figure 12). This change gives a maximum difference of about 0.06 K in the mid-twentieth century. Increasing the tropospheric aerosol effect to 1.5 W m−2 for 70 MtS year−1 emissions, nearer the upper bound of the direct and indirect estimates, gives only half as much warming. There is a clear need for more evidence on the magnitude of the tropospheric sulphate forcing.\n4.4. Discussion and conclusions\nAnalysis of the radiative forcing from three sources—greenhouse gases and anthropogenic tropospheric and volcanic stratospheric aerosols—shows that all three may be expected to have made major contributions to changes in global mean temperature over the last 250 years. Biospheric CO2 followed by methane were the main contributors to warming for much of the period since 1750. Fossil fuel CO2 played a minor role until the twentieth century, and for a wide range of estimates of tropospheric sulphate aerosols is approximately balanced or even outweighed by these until the last few decades, when reductions in the exponential growth rate of fossil fuel burning, the switch from coal to oil and gas and curbs on sulphur emissions have allowed fossil fuel CO2 to take the dominant role in radiative forcing. The magnitude of the offset of current greenhouse gas forcing by tropospheric sulphate aerosols suggests that future climate change is likely to be very sensitive to the evolution of sulphate emissions.\nIn consequence of the negative contribution of the tropospheric aerosols, the net anthropogenic forcing has been small enough to allow volcanic forcing associated with periods of above and below average activity to be an important modulator of the total forcing throughout the period since 1750. The low level of volcanic activity from about 1912 until the 1960s played a significant part in the warming culminating around 1950. Validations of the simulated temperatures obtained using different estimates of the volcanic\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nforcing against two different sets of observed data show that good agreement can be obtained but do not show that any one estimate of the volcanic record gives a clearly superior fit.\nA reasonable fit to the observed global mean temperature record since the late nineteenth century, and to glacier variations before that time can thus be obtained with a box-diffusion model with a need for only quite small contributions from other factors such as internal variability and variations in solar forcing. The likely role of solar forcing has recently been reviewed by Shine et al. (1995). The weakness of the total anthropogenic forcing until the last few decades implies that variations in the solar intensity only half as large as estimated by Lean et al. (1992) (up to 0.6 W m−2) and Nesmes-Ribes et al. (1993) (up to 1 W m−2) for the time of the Maunder Minimum in the seventeenth century could have made significant contributions to the forcing over the last 250 years; however, Foukal and Lean (1990) estimate only a 0.1 W m−2 increase since 1874. In the absence of more quantitative information on its magnitude, solar forcing has been omitted here. A previous estimate with such a model giving a similarly good fit (Kelly and Wigley, 1992) included variations in solar intensity related to solar cycle length (Friis-Christensen and Lassen, 1991), which they scaled so as to optimize the fit; however, the suggested solar mechanism appears to lack a firm physical basis (Kelly and Wigley, 1992; Folland et al., 1992)."

The simulation from 1750 to the late nineteenth century gives results similar to the glacial record. These results are consistent with the idea that pre-industrial Holocene climate was driven by a combination of an as yet unknown solar forcing and irregular short period variations due to volcanic aerosols. For the twentieth century record, the model provides probably as realistic a simulation of temperatures as can be expected, in view of model estimates of internal climate variability (Manabe et al., 1991). There appears to be no need for contributions from solar variability or regular internal variations of the climate system to explain this recent climate record, although this does not necessarily mean that they have no role.

    "text": "Provision of estimates of the volcanic forcing for the period since 1750 poses considerable problems because of the sparsity of quantitative observations of the impact of the aerosol on reflection and transmission of solar radiation and the heterogeneity of the data available that have been used to make the estimates. There are estimates of volcanic ejecta from ground deposits and from visual observations of the volcanoes and of the optical effects of the stratospheric aerosol, measurements of sulphate content and electrical conductivity from ice-cores, estimates of the aerosol optical depth from ground-based measurements of the solar radiation and, recently, satellite limb-sounding observations of the solar beam.\nAfter 1883, it is possible to use estimates based mainly on ground-based observations of the depletion of solar radiation—as used in the estimates of the volcanic dust veil by Lamb (1970, 1984) and of aerosol optical depth compiled by Sato et al. (1993). However, before 1883, there appear to be no measurements of solar radiation on which to base the estimates (Kimball, 1924). After 1850, the estimates from ice-cores by Robock and Free (1995) have been used as discussed below. Another approach we adopt is to use the Lamb Dust Veil Index (Lamb, 1970) derived from documentary evidence since before 1750. However, there is inevitably substantial uncertainty concerning the documentary data, and a second estimate is desirable for the period before 1850 to indicate the effects of this uncertainly. This second estimate was generated using ice-core data from Greenland (Hammer et al., 1980) to represent the Northern Hemisphere and from Antarctica (Moore et al., 1991) for the Southern Hemisphere. These data suggest some detailed adjustments of Lamb’s year-to-year estimates—e.g. that there was a (previously unknown) eruption around 1809 and that the Coseguina eruption of 1835 was weaker than Lamb suggested (Delmas et al., 1992). In the main, however, I have used these ice-core data for this period to adjust only the decadal means, while retaining the variations within the decade indicated by the documentary data. Decadal means were extracted from the graphical data for Greenland and Antarctica for 1750–1970 and then adjusted so that they had the same mean and interdecadal standard deviation for 1880–1970. The mean of the two was then normalized to have a standard deviation for 1880–1970 equal to that of the Sato et al. (1993) estimates of global mean aerosol optical depth. These data are mostly used in this paper only for the period before 1850. Experiments with the model indicate that they have relatively little (and progressively declining) impact on the simulations after that date.\nAs noted above, after 1850, we have used Robock and Free’s (1995) estimates in addition to those by Lamb (1970, 1984) and Sato et al. (1993). Robock and Free estimated separate Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) high-latitude volcanic indices from means of eight cores in the NH (five from Greenland, two from Ellesmere Island and one from Mt Logan (Yukon)) and five Antarctic ice-cores in the SH. To avoid contamination by slowly varying sources of sulphate such as anthropogenic emissions, they used the departures from long-term trends rather than the original sulphate measurements. They note the rather low consistency even between nearby cores due to several causes (e.g. the stochastic nature of snowfall, mixing due to blowing snow, the existence of other sulphate sources). Nevertheless their indices are probably as good as can be achieved with the present data availability.\nRobock and Free point out that the indices for the Arctic and Antarctic are not in the same units, both being based on normalized data. Therefore, as one step to obtaining a global index, it is necessary to bring\n© 1998 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 18: 355–377 (1998)\nthe indices closer to a common unit. This was done by comparing the 1882–1965 SH/NH ratios for Robock and Free’s indices with similar ratios for the Lamb (1970) Dust Veil Index (DVI) and for the Sato et al. (1993) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data. The SH/NH ratio from the IVIs is 1.71, compared with 0.77 from the AOD data and 1.19 from the DVI data. The Antarctic IVI data were therefore scaled by 0.57, the average of the adjustments implied by these data.\nAnother consideration in using ice-core data is that, as they provide information only on the high-latitude atmosphere, they are not representative of the whole hemisphere. After an equatorial eruption, aerosols are observed usually to be distributed roughly equally between the hemispheres. Temporal peaks in deposition may be expected to occur in both hemispheres. A first approximation to the stratospheric aerosol content for each hemisphere will then be given by the mean of the scaled Antarctic IVI (IVIS) and the Arctic IVI (IVIN). With a high-latitude eruption, however, the aerosol is confined mostly to one hemisphere—indicated by low IVI in the high latitudes of the other hemisphere—and predominantly to the higher latitudes of that hemisphere; the hemispheric mean for that hemisphere will then be lower than the IVI for that hemisphere’s high latitudes, which is biassed towards the high-latitude atmosphere. We have allowed for this in an approximate manner by using the mean of the two high-latitude IVIs for the hemisphere with the greater high-latitude IVI. For the other hemisphere (where if the high-latitude deposition is much lower, it suggests that little aerosol crossed the Equator), we use the IVI for that hemisphere.\nThus the global IVI is obtained as:\nIVIG=0.25× (IVIS+IVIN)+0.5×MIN(IVIS, IVIN)\nAdditionally, to allow for non-simultaneous deposition in the two hemispheres, and to reduce roughness, we have applied a 1-2-1 smoothing to the annual values of IVIS and IVIN before use in the above calculations. To convert the IVIG to aerosol optical depths, we averaged the data for the period 1850–1979 and scaled them to give the same mean as the data from Sato et al. for the same period. This empirical approach is appropriate for this sensitivity study; more sophisticated methods would be needed for a definitive estimate. This would carry more confidence if ice-core data were available from lower latitudes, e.g. the Himalayas and Andes.\nInterpretation of Lamb’s DVI data as optical depths was achieved by comparison of the mean data for the Agung and El Chichon periods (1963–1965 and 1982), for which the observations should be most reliable, with those of Sato et al., which gives a conversion factor of about 0.015 from DVI/100 to AOD. This should be regarded as a lower bound, with earlier periods giving as much as double this factor. Such uncertainties as this in the mean conversion to AOD can be allowed for in interpreting the results by taking account of the linear nature of the model. Additional ice-core data would be useful to clarify the history."

  "abstractText": "Estimates are made for the period since 1750 of the major radiative forcing factors thought to be important in climate change. Analysis of these emphasizes the role of biospheric CO2 release and increasing methane up to the early twentieth century. Fossil fuel burning had a minor role until the mid-twentieth century, with the relatively small effects of fossil fuel CO2 being cancelled by sulphate aerosols from the same source. It is shown that, by using reasonable estimates of the contributions by greenhouse gases and anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols, a simple box-diffusion climate model simulates many features of the observed record of global climate change as estimated from both instrumental and glacier data. This is achieved without including either variations in solar intensity over this period or internal variability—which recent discussions of the topic have suggested are needed—but including forcing by volcanic aerosols, which these studies neglected. Three different estimates of forcing by volcanic aerosols are considered; although the volcanic aerosols substantially improve the model’s fit to the observations, the validation does not show any one estimate to be clearly superior. The temperature record is shown to be consistent with the climate sensitivity obtained with three-dimensional models. © 1998 Royal Meteorological Society.",
