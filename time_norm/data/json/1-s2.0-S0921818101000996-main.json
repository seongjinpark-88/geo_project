    "text": "Atmospheric transport of Icelandic tephra has been simulated using data on atmospheric circulation and a theoretical Ž .model of tephra fallout. Two major features control the trajectories of tephra from Iceland: 1 persistent westerlies in the Ž .lower stratosphere between 9 and 15 km; and 2 a seasonal shift in wind direction above about 15 km that becomes more significant at higher elevations, with strong westerlies during the fall and winter, and relatively weak easterlies during the spring and summer. Model-derived predictions of the distance traveled by Icelandic tephra as a function of particle size have been made for each season, and for eruption columns ranging from 10- to 50-km height. The downwind decrease in grain size appears to be less significant as the eruption cloud rises to higher altitudes where stronger winds prevail. Predictions for fall and winter agree well with observations of historical and post-glacial tephra falls in western Europe, and provide a rough estimate of the height of the related eruption columns. Predictions for spring and summer dispersal may explain why the Greenland ice sheet is relatively barren of tephra fall from Iceland, due to weak stratospheric easterlies. Grain size of submarine tephra fall deposits in the Iceland Basin and on the Iceland Plateau indicates, however, that the present atmospheric circulation may not account for tephra transport during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The coarser grain size of these older deposits may be related to enhanced atmospheric circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic during these epochs or higher eruption columns due to more powerful eruptions in Iceland. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Several tephra transport models have been developed, which relate distance from source to tephra size for volcanic eruptions of varying intenŽsity and for varying atmospheric wind profiles Shaw et al., 1974; Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982; Suzuki, 1983; Hopkins and Bridgmanm, 1985; Carey and .Sparks, 1986; Armienti et al., 1988 . In these models, three parameters are considered: initial height of the eruption column, the particle size distribution and density, and the vertical profile of wind speed.\nThe paper addresses the modelling of atmospheric transport of Icelandic tephra using processed rawinsonde measurements of air temperature, wind speed and wind direction from four meteorological stations in the subpolar North Atlantic and up to 25-km elevation. Atmospheric data for altitudes up to 48 km were additionally obtained for Iceland from the US Ž .National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR . Polynomial regression equations were calculated for Žthe seasonal wind-intensity profiles zonal and .meridional components and incorporated into a preŽviously published tephra fallout model Carey and .Sigurdsson, 1982 . The model incorporates two ma-\nŽ .jor components of tephra transport: 1 ejection of particles into the atmosphere and transport within a Ž .volcanic umbrella plume; and 2 advection of particles in the local wind field once they leave the base of the umbrella region of the volcanic plume. Modelled transport distance and maximum grain size of tephra fallouts are compared with observed historical and prehistorical deposits, giving a first assessment on a possible change in intensity and direction of paleo-atmospheric circulation.\n2.

The heating rate from January to July is constant\nthroughout the troposphere, and does not exceed Ž18Crmonth. Between 300 and 200 mb 9.1–11.7 .km , the atmosphere exhibits a much lower temperature gradient, between y0.68Crkm and y28Crkm. This transition to stably stratified conditions defines the tropopause. Above the tropopause, the lower Žstratosphere, between 11.7 and 23.8 km 200–30 .mb , is characterized by a temperature lapse rate\nclose to zero, between y0.48Crkm and y0.68Crkm from October to March, and is nearly isothermal for Ž .the rest of the year Fig. 2a . In the upper stratoŽ . Žsphere, from 23.8 km 200 mb to around 48 km 1 .mb , the temperature increases with height by 1.68Crkm to 2.18Crkm.

Among the numerous tephra\nfalls recorded in lake sediments and peat bogs, two serve as examples of tephra distribution over long distance, and to assess the speed of atmospheric transport. In 1877, Norwegian meteorologist H. Mohn was the first to establish a map of a tephra fallout Ž .Fig. 6 . The map illustrates the path of the ash plume from the 1875 Askja eruption over the Norwegian Sea, towards the west coast of Norway. The plinian eruption of Askja on 28–29 March 1875 was one of the major explosive rhyolitic eruptions in post-glacial time in Iceland. The proximal pyroclastic deposits recorded the evolution of the major eruptive phases, with a plinian phase that lasted Ž .about 6.5 h Sparks et al., 1981 . Owing to strong\nŽ .westerly winds )25 mrs; Thorarinsson, 1963 , the volcanic plume was transported to the east, and on the same day tephra began to fall 80 km away, on Ž .the east coast of Iceland Fig. 6 . The Askja fall deposit in this region is characterized by a narrow and highly elongated depositional pattern that reŽsulted from the high wind speed Sparks et al., .1981 . Based on models of the dispersal and fallout\nof the tephra, a maximum column height of 26 km Žand a wind speed of 43 mrs were estimated Carey .and Sparks, 1986 . About 15 h later, tephra fall was observed on the west coast of Norway, 110 km away, and the next morning in Stockholm, Sweden, Ž .1900 km from the volcano Fig. 6 . The mean velocity of airborne transport of tephra over the Norway Ž .Basin can be estimated about 73 kmrh 20 mrs , similar to the mean wind speed recorded between 25 Ž .and 30 km height for March Fig. 5b . The 29 March 1947 Hekla eruption also spread\ntephra over northern Europe. During the night between 30 and 31 March, Hekla tephra reached central Sweden by west–southwest air currents above the 500 mb level, at an altitude of 5000–9000 m Ž .Thorarinsson, 1981 . Approximately 52 h after the beginning of the eruption, on March 31, the tephra fall began in Helsinki, Finland, 2200 km from the volcano.

Only the largest of these historical eruptions were recorded as tephra in the Greenland ice: Laki ¨Ž .1783–1784 Fiacco et al., 1994 , Oræfajokull 1362¨ Ž .Palais et al., 1991 and the Settlement Tephra 871 Ž .AD Gronvold et al., 1995 .

    "text": "Dispersal of tephra was simulated using a model that evaluates two principal components of transport Ž .Carey and Sigurdsson, 1982 . The first involves ejection of particles into the atmosphere and transport within a volcanic plume. Large-scale explosive eruptions are assumed to produce a mushroom-shaped plume that spreads out in the atmosphere as a lateral Žintrusion, referred to as the umbrella region Sparks, .1986; Sparks et al., 1991 . Particles are carried within\nthis intrusion, which spreads downwind as a gravity current until they leave from the base. The second component of transport involves advection of particles in the local wind field once they leave the base of the umbrella region. Total transport distance is evaluated using an iterative process that evaluates vertical variations in particle settling velocity, wind speed and wind direction. Thus, the total transport represents the summation of lateral plume advection and dispersal of the particles once they leave the base of the umbrella region. In the late stage of its path, transport may be affected by surface winds that reflect the weather system occurring at the time of Ž .eruption e.g., a low or a high pressure system . The model was evaluated using two well-docu-\nmented examples of tephra transport where eruption column height and wind speed were known. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines serves as an example of large magnitude explosive eruption with long-range tephra transport. Ash fallout occurred over a large area of the South China Sea to the southwest of the volcano. Wiesner et al.

A 35-km column height was chosen, in order to simulate transport at a level that is significantly influenced by a seasonal shift in stratospheric Ž .wind direction Fig. 5a . Airborne trajectories are displayed from the base of the umbrella region for 100-, 200- and 500-mm particles.

Once the upwind and downwind tephra transport by horizontal gravity current is maximum at the base of the umbrella region, the particles are advected in the local wind field and settle to lower elevations, where the stratospheric easterlies no longer dominate.

These wind profiles integrate the maximum wind speed recorded at each atmospheric level. They\ndefine an upper limit for the airborne transport of Icelandic tephra in a standard atmosphere and on basis of the fallout model. Dashed curves in Figs. 11, 12 and 13 illustrate the influence of the strongest winds affecting the subpolar North Atlantic region, for eruption columns of 20, 30, 40 and 50 km height.

Only limited additional data of maximum grain size of distal tephra fall deposits were found in the literature. These measurements were made using a variety of analytical techŽ .niques SEM, optical microscopy, image analyser , and some may not be representative of the tephra fall deposit, due to the limited number of measurements. The observed maximum grain size data should therefore be interpreted with some caution.\nŽ .Fig. 13.

They both occur in peats in Scandinavia and north and north¨east Iceland. The Oræfajokull tephra was also found¨ Ž .in a Greenland GISP2 ice core Palais et al., 1991 .\nThe two tephra falls in Scandinavia can be accounted for by airborne transport, either by permanent west-\nerlies in the lower stratosphere or by westerlies in Žthe upper stratosphere during the winter or fall Fig. .5a . The Askja eruption occurred in late March 1875. Therefore, the maximum grain size of its tephra in Ž .Scandinavia G100 mm; Table 1 can be directly compared with predicted winter downwind transport, indicating an eruption column between 25 and 30 km Ž .in height Fig. 11a . This is in good agreement with a model column height of 26 km estimated by Carey Ž .and Sparks 1986 . ¨The Oræfajokull eruption is believed to have oc-¨ Žcurred in the middle of June, 1362 AD Thorarins.son, 1958 , which is confirmed by the position of the\ntephra layer in early summer relative to the seasonal variations of the oxygen isotope profile of the GreenŽ .land GISP2 ice core Palais et al., 1991 . Maximum grain size of the tephra in Greenland can be comŽ .pared with the spring and summer model Fig. 12 . The deposit of a 30-mm clast at 1300 km from Ž .source Table 1; Palais et al., 1991 indicates a minimum column height of 35 km and a net predicted upwind transport by easterlies to the west Ž .Fig. 12b . On the other hand, summer downwind transport of a 95-mm tephra to Scandinavia, 1200 Ž .km from source Table 1; Persson, 1971 , can only be accounted for by the permanent westerlies in the lower stratosphere, between 9 and 15 km, as shown Ž .by the isopach contours on land Thorarinsson, 1958 . Model transport of a 95-mm tephra under these Ž .conditions predict stronger winds Fig. 12a . The ¨example of Oræfajokull eruption indicates that, for a¨ Ž .high column )30 km , atmospheric transport in a\nsummer-sheared wind environment can display two opposite directions, i.e., eastward to Scandinavia between 9 and 15 km height, and northwestward to Ž .Greenland above 20 km height Fig. 5a , depending on the height distribution of tephra within the column.\nGlass shards from the AD 1783–1784 Laki fissure eruption were also identified in the summer 1783 layer of the GISP2 ice core from Summit, Greenland, whereas the main acidity peak was Žrecorded in the summer and early fall of 1784 Fiacco .et al., 1994 .

These tephra are found in peat bogs and lake sediments in northern Europe, Iceland, as well as in the Greenland ice sheet and sediments of the Žadjacent seas Mangerud et al., 1986; Long and Morton, 1987; Bjork et al., 1992; Merkt et al., 1993;¨ Gronvold et al., 1995; Birks et al., 1996; Wastegard¨ . Ž .et al., 1998 Table 1 . Ash Zone 1 is attributed to a co-ignimbrite tephra fallout from Katla volcano Ž .Lacasse et al., 1995 . Much of its dispersal is derived from tephra fall on sea ice to the north and east of Iceland, followed by ice-rafting to the south–west and south. However, its correlation with the Vedde Ash, found in marine sediments in the southern part of the Norwegian Sea and on the Norwegian shelf, as well as in lacustrine sediments in western Norway, suggests that the tephra was also dispersed eastward from Iceland by westerly winds Ž .Mangerud et al., 1984 . Tephra as large as 100 mm, Ž .at least 1200 km away from source Table 1 , can be accounted for by the dispersal of an eruption column,\nbetween 20 and 30 km height, by fall and winter Ž .stratospheric westerlies Figs. 11a and 13a . Tephra\nfall in north Iceland, 280 km from source, indicates an eruption column height of 30 km under the same wind conditions. Summer transport can only be enŽdorsed if maximum wind speeds are assumed Fig. .12a . The Saksunarvatn Tephra was derived from a\nlarge basaltic eruption from the Grımsvotn caldera´ ¨ Žbeneath the Vatnajokull ice cap Petursson and¨ ´ .Larsen, 1992; Lacasse et al., 1998a . Its distal fallout east of Iceland was first discovered in lake sediment Ž .in the Faeroe Islands Mangerud et al., 1986 . The tephra was investigated in Early Holocene sequences in northern Iceland, western Norway and northwestŽern Germany Bjork et al., 1992; Merkt et al., 1993;¨ .Birks et al., 1996 . The maximum grain size of the\nproximal and distal tephra fall deposits likely resulted from an eruption column of at least 15 km Ž .height Figs. 11a and 13a . By analogy with the present atmospheric circulation, its dispersal to the east was most likely due to prevailing westerly winds in the troposphere and lower stratosphere during the fall and winter seasons.\nThe fall of Ash Zone 1 and Saksunarvatn Tephra both on the Greenland ice and over Scandinavia, may also indicate that these prehistoric eruptions spanned several seasons yielding disparate dispersal directions like during the AD 1783 Laki eruption. However, paroxysmal eruption episodes leading to the ascent of columns to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere generally last only a few hours to Ž .several days Carey and Sigurdsson, 1989 .\n( )5.4. Ash Zone 2 marine isotopic stage 3\nAsh Zone 2 is a marine silicic tephra that was primary dispersed southward from Iceland by iceŽ .rafting Lacasse et al., 1996a .

Ice coring in Ž .the Greenland ice sheet Dye 3, GRIP, GISP2 also revealed evidence of a correlative tephra layer that\nforms multiple visible bands and aggregates, spanŽning several centimeters in thickness Ram and Gay-\nley, 1991; Gronvold et al., 1995; Ram et al., 1996;¨ .Zielinski et al., 1997 . The occurrence of Ash Zone 2\nas tephra fallout in marine sediment at Site 919 of Ž .ODP Leg 152 Ocean Drilling Program confirms its\nwidespread atmospheric dispersal over the East ŽGreenland margin and the Irminger Basin Lacasse .et al., 1998b . Ash Zone 2 also occurs in sediments of the Reykjanes Ridge as a discrete tephra fall layer Ž .Lackschewitz and Wallrabe-Adams, 1997 . This southwestward airborne dispersal cannot be accounted for by the persistent westerlies in the lower stratosphere or by the winter and fall upper stratoŽ .sphere westerlies Fig. 5a . Upper stratosphere easterlies in late spring and summer must be considered. Glass shards from Ash Zone 2 up to 300 mm were found in the Dye3 ice core from southern Greenland, Žabout 1190 km west from source Ram and Gayley, . Ž .1991 Table 1 . Their fallout cannot be accounted\nfor by the model even though more vigorous winds Žand higher eruption columns are considered Fig. .12b . Although the size frequency curve of Ash Zone 2 in the GISP2 core, approximately 1260 km north– northwest from source, displays a maximum grain Ž .size of about 40 mm Table 1 , few shards as large Ž .as 100 mm were found Ram et al., 1996 . These\nshards could have been transported only by summer easterlies and from an eruption column of at least 40 Ž .km height Fig. 12b . The discrepancy between observed and predicted values becomes even more significant when we consider the maximum grain size of Ash Zone 2 closer to source, at ODP Site 919 Ž . Ž .910 km Table 1 and Fig. 12b . These results call into question whether the deposit of Ash Zone 2 at ODP Site 919 may be of ice-rafting origin rather than fallout, or a combination of both as suggested Ž .by Lackschewitz and Wallrabe-Adams 1997 for its occurrence in sediments of the Reykjanes Ridge.\n(5.5. Eastern Volcanic Zone marine isotopic stages )5-2\nBasaltic glass composition of tephra layers in marine sediments of the Iceland Basin indicate that the Katla–Eldgja and Grımsvotn–Lakagıgar volcanic´ ´ ¨ ´ systems were active during the last 120,000 years Ž .Lacasse et al., 1998a . Maximum grain size of the\ndeposits indicates the influence of northeasterlies, as for the airborne dispersal of Ash Zone 2. A comparison with the model values of tephra transport for the spring and summer season suggests 25- to 35-km high eruption columns, which are unlikely for basaltic Ž .eruptions Fig. 12b . The same figure shows that westward transport simulations, using mean or maximum wind speeds, do not differ much. The coarse grain size of the basaltic tephra fall layers may result from the influence of strong surface winds or storm systems in the region.\n(5.6. Off-rift and rift Õolcanic zones Early )Pliocene–Late Pleistocene\nThe discrepancy between predicted atmospheric transport of tephra and observed distribution of preHolocene tephra appears to be persistent over time. Coring at Site 907 of ODP Leg 151 on the Iceland Plateau extended our knowledge of Icelandic tephra Ž . Žfall to the last 6 Ma Early Pliocene Lacasse et al., .1996b; Lacasse and Garbe-Schonberg, in press . Most¨ of the tephra are derived from unknown or extinct central volcanoes of the off-rift and rift zones in Iceland, making difficult the estimate of the distance of tephra transport. Potassium content and normative components of the rhyolitic tephra were used to infer potential sources. They suggest sources in the alkali and transitional silicic extrusives from the Southeastern Volcanic Zone and the Snæfellsnes Zone, and Ž .from the volcanic rift zones Table 1 . A mean distance between ODP Site 907 and these volcanic sources was estimated by averaging the distance from the nearest and most distant central volcanoes of each volcanic province.\nWinter and fall are the more realistic seasons to disperse Icelandic tephra over the Iceland Plateau. If we consider the mean wind speeds, maximum grain size data indicate columns of 35 to 45 km for the Ž .Plio-Pleistocene eruptions Figs. 11a and 13a , higher than any eruption column of post-glacial age the model has inferred. The coarse grain size of the tephra cannot be accounted for by eruption dynamics alone, and requires more vigorous atmospheric circulation. For a given eruption column of 30 km, an increase in mean wind speed by a factor of 2 to 3 is required. Plate motion and ice-rafting can be ruled out as mechanisms that may have affected the origi-\nnal distance between the tephra deposition at ODP Site 907 and their volcanic sources in Iceland. The Ž . Žmean direction east–west and low rate 1 to 2 .cmryear of spreading of the Kolbeinsey Ridge had\nlimited effect over the 6-Ma period considered. Sedimentology and lithology of the tephra layers do not Žsupport transport of the tephra by ice-rafting Lacasse .et al., 1996b . In addition, the sea-surface circulation\nin this region tends to convey sea ice southward reducing, instead of increasing, the distance from source. Modern atmospheric circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic region cannot therefore explain the dispersal of the coarse fraction of tephra fall on the Iceland Plateau."

    "heading": "6. Discussion",
    "text": "The simulations reported here indicate that the airborne transport and the fallout patterns are strongly dependent on season, height distribution and grain size of tephra in the eruption column. Model-derived predictions of the dispersal of Icelandic tephra as a function of particle size were made for each season Žfor eruption columns from 10 to 50 km height Figs. .11, 12 and 13 . The upwind and downwind decrease\nin maximum grain size becomes less significant as plume height increases to levels influenced by stronger winds. Predictions for fall and winter eruptions indicate that tephra as large as 100 mm can be transported more than 1000 km eastward from erupŽ .tion columns higher than 20 km Figs. 11 and 13 . These predictions are in good agreement with observed winter dispersal from historic eruptions to the Žeast, over the Norway Basin e.g., Askja 1875, Hekla .1947 . They are also consistent with the maximum\ngrain size of post-glacial and historic tephra falls observed in Scandinavia. Predictions for spring and summer indicate, in contrast, that tephra larger than 100 mm are unlikely to be transported more than 400 km to the north–northwest, for eruption columns less Ž .than 30 km height Fig. 12b . Weaker stratospheric circulation occurs during late spring and summer. This may explain why the Summit Greenland ice is almost barren of historical tephra from Iceland. The shortest distance between the GRIP and GISP2 coring sites and the westernmost volcano in Iceland Ž .Snæfellsjokull is about 1050 km. If we take 50 km¨\nas the upper limit for an eruption column, only tephra smaller than 300 mm can reach the two coring sites with the modern summer atmospheric circulaŽ .tion Fig. 12b . However, maximum grain size of tephra fallout in\nAsh Zone 2 both in ice cores and marine sediments plots above the predicted upper limit of airborne transport of tephra using the present spring–summer Ž .atmospheric circulation model Fig. 12b . These results raise the question of the applicability of the modern atmospheric circulation to model airborne transport of tephra during earlier periods, especially during glacial periods. The grain size of Pliocene and Pleistocene tephra fall deposits in the Iceland Basin and on the Iceland Plateau indicates that they cannot be reproduced by the simulation of modern atmoŽ .spheric transport Figs. 11, 12 and 13 . The observed coarse grain-size of these deposits may therefore result from stronger winds due to a change in ambient atmospheric conditions or higher eruption columns due to more powerful eruptions."

    "text": "As noted earlier, the model used does not take into account the possible effects of tephra diffusion Žby atmospheric turbulence Suzuki, 1983, 1985; .Armienti et al., 1988; Glaze and Self, 1991 . Eddies\nin the atmosphere can have the effect of increasing Žthe residence time of fine tephra particles -100 .mm beyond that predicted by simple settling through an atmosphere characterized by laminar flow. Turbulence is more effective at the tropopause and in the troposphere as a result of higher wind shear and air density, whereas it tends to be inhibited at higher elevations due to the stratification and low air density of the stratosphere.\nMost of the tephra reported here, however, have Žmaximum diameter of medium to coarse sand )250 .mm; Table 1 , implying a limited residence time in the atmosphere. Further, the influence of particle shape does not seem to be great, given that the maximum grain size of the samples examined encompasses a wide range of morphologies, from thin bubble wall to highly vesicular shards. In addition, estimates of the speed of atmospheric transport of the Askja 1875 and Hekla 1947 eruption clouds,\nprior to fallout over Scandinavia, are in good agreement with the present atmospheric circulation, and do not require any significant delay in tephra fall or increase in atmospheric residence time due to turbulent diffusion."

    "heading": "6.2. Enhanced atmospheric circulation in glacial periods",
    "text": "Enhanced tephra dispersal by more vigorous atmospheric circulation during Pleistocene glacial Ž .stages was first suggested by Sigurdsson 1990 . When the atmospheric transport of tephra from Holocene and Pleistocene explosive volcanic erupŽ .tions is compared, the Toba 75 ka and Campanian Ž . Ž .38 ka eruptions during Pleistocene glacial stages display wide tephra dispersal over distances exceeding 2000 km, whereas the tephra dispersal of Ž .Holocene eruptions of Mount St. Helens 1980 and Ž .Santorini Minoan, 3500 year BP is less than 600\nkm from source. The observed discrepancy in atmospheric transport of tephra is unlikely to be due to eruption dynamics alone, and may reflect a change in the vigor of atmospheric circulation. Lower-latitude eruptions may also be influenced by weaker stratospheric flow and stronger convection which are highly variable in place and time. Therefore the difference between Holocene and glacial periods may not be due so much to a more vigorous circulation for the latter but to a different distribution of the zones of most vigorous circulation over the globe.\nCoincidence of the timing of global episodes of volcanic ash accumulation with episodes of deposition of eolian dust in Cenozoic deep-sea sediments also suggests that they are likely to be due to climate-related fluctuation in atmospheric circulation. Eolian dust accumulation rates in deep-sea sediments exhibits a sharp increase at about 3 Ma correspondŽing to the onset of Quaternary glaciation Rea et al., .1985 . This increase most likely reflects periods\nduring which there is a greater availability of dust due to glacial erosion, andror intensified atmospheric circulation. The synchronous increases in both dust and sea salt levels in the Greenland GISP2 ice core during stadials or cold periods for the last 41,000 years, argue for the intensification of the circulation system that transported air masses to Ž .Greenland Mayewski et al., 1994 . Kutzbach and\nŽ .Wright 1985 developed a general circulation model Ž .GCM to simulate the January and July patterns of wind for the Last Glacial Maximum, 18 ka BP. The GCM model results for January indicate a more vigorous anticyclonic surface circulation over Greenland than in modern simulation. Strong surface Ž .northeasterlies 10–20 mrs are predicted above Iceland as the corridor between the Greenland and European ice sheets is a major route for channeling ŽArctic air masses in the North Atlantic Fig. 4; .Kutzbach and Wright, 1985 . In contrast, there is no Ž .increase in wind at 500 mb 5.5 km as the intensi-\nfied jet stream along the North Atlantic sea-ice marŽ .gin has shifted to mid latitude 458N . The GCM\nmodel results for July indicate surface circulation above Iceland that is not as well defined and strong as in January. On the other hand, there is an increase in the strength of the overlying westerly flow at Ž .about 12 km 190 mb . This increase in tropospheric winds is consistent with the increased surface temperature gradient along the North Atlantic sea-ice edge south of Iceland, at about 608N. Kutzbach and Ž .Wright 1985 simulated glacial atmospheric circulation for surface and tropospheric levels, with, however, wind direction and intensity that are not well quantified. Stratospheric circulation was not considered in their GCM model. Comparison with paleowind intensity inferred from the atmospheric transport of tephra thus remains difficult. It was observed nevertheless that the polar night stratospheric circulation reflects in certain aspects the land–sea distribution, with a substantial difference between the Holocene and the glacial state due to the influence of Žlarge ice sheets in the circumpolar region Holton, .1992 .\nA rough estimate of paleo-wind intensity can be made by assigning an eruption column height to the Žmaximum grain size of observed tephra falls Figs. .11, 12 and 13 . If we consider the windy winter and\nfall as the seasons to disperse the Early Pliocene and Pleistocene Icelandic tephra over the Iceland Plateau, an increase in mean wind speeds by a factor of 2 to 3 Žis required for a given column height of 30 km Figs. .11 and 13 . Occurrence of the Late Pleistocene\ntephra in the Iceland Basin sediments suggests airŽborne transport to the south–southwest Lacasse et .al., 1998a , in a direction that is not reflected in the Ž .modern atmospheric circulation Fig. 5a . Any at-\ntempt to estimate paleo-wind intensity using the model is therefore not relevant, due to the absence of northerly winds above Iceland. A possible explanation for the dispersal and coarse grain size of these basaltic tephra may lie in the strong surface northeasterlies simulated above Iceland in January for the Ž .18 ka level Kutzbach and Wright, 1985 , or in the influence of more frequent storms. This also can be applied to the dispersal of Ash Zone 2 over southern Ž .Greenland Dye 3 and the Irminger Basin."

    "heading": "6.3. Atmospheric cooling and eruption column height",
    "text": "The present-day atmospheric profiles such as the temperature gradients, the temperature inversion at the tropopause, and the decrease in density and hydrostatic pressure with altitude are illustrated in\nFig. 2. Any change in these parameters especially during cold stadials may have modified the ascent and height of convecting eruption columns in the atmosphere. Much of the height of a volcanic plume is dominated by buoyancy effects. A slight density increase of the atmosphere could raise the neutral Ž .buoyancy height of eruption columns Sparks, 1986 . The base of the umbrella region corresponds to the height of neutral density where the column has a bulk density equal to the surrounding atmosphere. In Ž .a colder atmosphere glacial , the atmospheric density may shift to higher values causing an eruption column to attain greater height. However, the seasonal temperature decrease above Iceland, between Ž . Ž .summer June and winter December , leads to an upward shift of the atmospheric density profile by Ž .less than 1 km Fig. 2b . This shift is maximum at low elevation because of the relative high density of the lower air. The average surface temperature difference between a modern August and August 18,000 Ž .year BP Last Glacial Maximum at high latitude is Žof the same order about 68C; CLIMAP Project .Members, 1976 as the seasonal variation of modern Žsurface temperature observed above Iceland about .118C; Fig. 2a and, therefore, cannot be accounted for a rise of the atmospheric density profile and the neutral buoyancy height of eruption columns by more than 1 km.\nIn addition, for a given temperature of the erupting material, any decrease in the atmospheric tem-\nperature at sea level would increase the height of the Žvolcanic column Morton et al., 1956; Wilson et al., . Ž .1978 . Glaze and Baloga 1996 demonstrate that the neutral buoyancy height of a volcanic plume and subsequently its ability to transport ash to the stratosphere depends in part on the structure of the atmoŽ .sphere e.g., temperature gradient . This sensitivity is also due to the small density difference between the plume and the ambient atmosphere. For a given initial eruption thermal flux of 3.2=1012 J sy1, the predicted neutral buoyancy height in a standard atŽ .mosphere at high latitude 608 increases by about Ž . Ž .10% between July 8.0 km and January 8.7 km .\nThis is due to an increase in the temperature gradient of the first kilometer, from y8.7 to 3.0 Krkm Ž .Glaze and Baloga, 1996 . No predictions have been made for much higher eruption columns that reach the stratosphere but it is suggested that the temperature inversion above the tropopause has a small Ž .inhibiting role on column height Sparks, 1986 . As it was mentioned before, the average surface\ntemperature difference between the Holocene and a Ž .glacial period at high latitude 608 is of the same\norder as the seasonal variation of modern surface temperature observed above Iceland. Consequently, the increase in eruption column height due to glacial cooling and atmospheric density increase at low elevation appears to be very small and unlikely to explain the grain size of the Pliocene and Pleistocene tephra fall layers on the Iceland Plateau. Assuming unchanged atmospheric circulation and considering the mean wind speeds, these deposits require columns, between 35 and 45 km, that are too high Ž .for Icelandic explosive eruptions Figs. 11a and 13a . Atmospheric temperature and density changes between glacial and interglacial stages have therefore little effect on eruption column height and tephra dispersal."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions",
    "text": "A theoretical model of tephra fallout from explosive eruption columns was used to simulate airborne transport of Icelandic tephra in the subpolar North Atlantic region. The model incorporates present-day profiles of wind speed and direction from 0 to 48 km\nŽelevation above Iceland, for three seasons winter, .spring–summer, and fall . The airborne transport and\ndispersal of tephra differ according to the season of the eruption, and the column height. Dispersal of Ž .high eruption columns )20 km is influenced by Ž .1 persistent westerlies prevailing in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, between 9 and 15 Ž .km, and 2 either by strong westerlies during the fall and winter, or by weak easterlies during the spring and summer, above 20 km in the stratosphere. Lower Ž .eruption columns -15 km are essentially dispersed by the persistent westerlies.\nModel predictions for fall and winter transport of tephra agree well with observations of historic and post-glacial tephra falls in Scandinavia. Predictions for spring and summer may explain the low occurrence frequency and fine grain size of Icelandic tephra in the Greenland ice, due to weak stratospheric easterlies.\nThe present-day atmospheric circulation cannot account for the airborne transport of tephra during earlier times. The generally coarser grain size of submarine Pliocene and Pleistocene ash deposits suggest stronger winds, due to change in ambient atmospheric conditions, most likely due to steeper temperature gradients during glacial periods. On the other hand, density increase due to atmospheric cooling does not significantly influence the height of eruption columns, and cannot account for the coarser grain size of these older tephra deposits."

  "abstractText": "Atmospheric transport of Icelandic tephra has been simulated using data on atmospheric circulation and a theoretical Ž . model of tephra fallout. Two major features control the trajectories of tephra from Iceland: 1 persistent westerlies in the Ž . lower stratosphere between 9 and 15 km; and 2 a seasonal shift in wind direction above about 15 km that becomes more significant at higher elevations, with strong westerlies during the fall and winter, and relatively weak easterlies during the spring and summer. Model-derived predictions of the distance traveled by Icelandic tephra as a function of particle size have been made for each season, and for eruption columns ranging from 10to 50-km height. The downwind decrease in grain size appears to be less significant as the eruption cloud rises to higher altitudes where stronger winds prevail. Predictions for fall and winter agree well with observations of historical and post-glacial tephra falls in western Europe, and provide a rough estimate of the height of the related eruption columns. Predictions for spring and summer dispersal may explain why the Greenland ice sheet is relatively barren of tephra fall from Iceland, due to weak stratospheric easterlies. Grain size of submarine tephra fall deposits in the Iceland Basin and on the Iceland Plateau indicates, however, that the present atmospheric circulation may not account for tephra transport during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The coarser grain size of these older deposits may be related to enhanced atmospheric circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic during these epochs or higher eruption columns due to more powerful eruptions in Iceland. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.
