    "text": "The largest known volcanic eruptions of the Holocene include those of Kikai, Japan (early 6th millennium BC; Machida and Arai, 1983), Mt Mazama, USA (ca 5677 BC; Bacon, 1983; Zdanowicz et al., 1999), and Tambora, Indonesia (1815; Sigurdsson and Carey, 1989; Oppenheimer, 2003), with estimated magnitudes (total erupted mass) exceeding 1014 kg. Kuwae, Vanuatu (ca AD 1459; Monzier et al., 1994), Baitoushan, China/North Korea (late 10th–early 11th century AD; Horn and Schmincke, 2000), the ‘Minoan’ eruption of Santorini, Greece (mid-17th century BC; Sigurdsson et al., 1990; Druitt et al., 1999), and Taupo, New Zealand (ca AD 181; Walker, 1980; Wilson, 1985) are in the next rank in terms of size, falling in the range 5 × 1013 to 1014 kg. However, many other eruptions would be added to such lists if we were able to identify the volcanoes responsible for the abundant, prominent horizons in the ice-core sulphate records of the polar regions. Among the most striking examples of an unidentified eruption is that responsible for the largest sulphate anomaly in the past 7000 years of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core record, which is dated at ca AD 1259 (Zielinski, 1995). My aim here is to integrate available information pertaining to this event and to evaluate the nature, climatic impact, and possible location of the eruption."

Since then, several others have observed the anomaly in\n* Correspondence to: Clive Oppenheimer, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Downing Place, Cambridge, CB2 3EN, UK; e-mail: co200@cam.ac.uk\nCopyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society\nboth Arctic (Figure 1; Zielinski, 1995; Clausen et al., 1997) and Antarctic ice cores (Langway et al., 1988; Moore et al., 1991; Delmas et al., 1992). Rhyolitic-composition (SiO2 ≈ 70 wt%; Na2O + K2O ≈ 8 wt%) glass shards have been filtered out of the acid horizon from Greenland and South Pole cores (Palais et al., 1990, 1992). Dating accuracy is reported variously as ±1 year, ±2 years, or 0.5%. Allowing for up to a year time delay for polar fallout of a stratospheric aerosol veil, the ice cores provide clear evidence for a major explosive eruption in the second half of the AD 1250s. Closer inspection of the GISP2 record for the past 110 kyears further emphasizes the significance of this eruption. Figure 2 suggests that events of this magnitude, at least in terms of sulphur yield, recur with a frequency below one in 5000 years. By the same standard, the Tambora 1815 and Krakatau 1883 eruptions are around one in 500 year and one in 100 year events respectively (the former event is the largest identified historic eruption).\nThe global climatic impacts of large eruptions are known to scale, in a non-linear way, to the mass and distribution of sulphate aerosol formed in the stratosphere as a result of the atmospheric injection of sulphur gases (e.g. Robock, 2000). In order to determine the mass of sulphur delivered to the stratosphere by equatorial eruptions, the strength of the volcanic signals in the ice cores has been calibrated against the deposition record of radionuclides from 1960s atmospheric weapons tests (of known yield). The mean of eight estimates of the stratospheric sulphur mass of the mystery eruption cloud (from Hammer et al., 1980; Langway et al., 1988; Delmas et al., 1992; Zielinski, 1995; Clausen et al., 1997) is 130 ± 30 Tg (as sulphur), more than double the equivalent figure for the Tambora 1815 eruption of 60 ± 30 Tg (summarized in Oppenheimer (2003)), which produced an estimated 1.4 × 1014 kg of tephra (for clarity and consistency here, all estimates of SO2, H2S, Copyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 23: 417–426 (2003)\nH2SO4, or hydrated H2SO4 yields are converted to equivalent teragrams of sulphur, and eruption magnitudes to kilograms of erupted magma)."

    "heading": "3. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MYSTERY ERUPTION",
    "text": "Eruption characteristics can be estimated by comparing the magnitudes of known eruptions with estimates of their sulphur yields (Figure 3). Unfortunately, definitive assessment of the magnitude of unknown eruptions in this way is complicated by the wide observed range of sulphur yield per unit mass of erupted magma. This is readily apparent in Figure 3 from examination of the distribution of points for individual eruptions with respect to the steeper set of curves, which represent iso-lines of sulphur content per unit mass of erupted magma. If we consider only the correlations between estimated sulphur yield and eruption magnitude for known events, for different ice cores (three such calibrations are shown in Figure 3), then the estimated sulphur yields of the mystery eruption correspond to total erupted masses in the range of ∼5 × 1014 –2 × 1015 kg. The dense rock equivalent (DRE) volume (at 2500 kg m−3) corresponding to this range is 200–800 km3, which coincides with the ‘super-eruption’ class (the term super-eruption is not well defined in the literature, but it has been\nCopyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 23: 417–426 (2003)\napplied to eruptions exceeding bulk volumes of 1000 km3, and hence DRE volumes of around 300–500 km3; for comparison, the Tambora 1815 eruption had a DRE volume of ∼56 km3).\nAn alternative scenario is that the AD 1259 ice-core layer resulted from a much smaller eruption, greatly enriched in sulphur. This is generally believed to occur for intermediate to silicic composition eruptions when a vapour phase enriched in sulphur has accumulated at the top of a magma reservoir prior to its eruption (e.g. Luhr, 1990; Wallace et al., 1995; Scaillet et al., 1998), though other mechanisms are possible (Oppenheimer, 1996). The source of this vapour could be mafic composition magma intruded into the lower parts of the chamber, which is not subsequently erupted but which, over centuries or millennia, has contributed its complement of volatiles to the overlying magma (see Wallace (2001) for a penetrating account of the origins, extent and time scales of pre-eruptive exsolved volatiles in magmas). Following this reasoning,\nCopyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 23: 417–426 (2003)\nPalais et al. (1992) suggested that the mystery eruption could have taken place at El Chichón volcano in Mexico, known for its high-sulphur yield explosive eruptions in March–April 1982. They highlighted a tephra sequence radiocarbon dated at <625 ± 75 years BP by Tilling et al. (1984), and described by the latter authors as ‘several times’ larger than the 1982 eruptions (whose total magnitude was about 3 × 1012 kg according to Carey and Sigurdsson (1989)). The case for this identification is not strong, however. Firstly, it appears that the radiocarbon age was not calibrated. Using the OxCal 3.5 program (http://www.rlaha.ox.ac.uk/orau/06 ind.htm) yields a calendrical date for the El Chichón eruption of between AD 1290 and 1400 at the 1σ confidence level and AD 1260 and 1440 at the 2σ level, suggesting a younger event. Secondly, combining the estimates of the sulphur yield of the April 1982 eruptions (3.5 Tg, based on satellite observations and reported by Bluth et al. (1997)) with the eruption magnitude (2.3 × 1012 kg, from Carey and Sigurdsson (1989), which includes a lesser amount of material from pyroclastic flows that could have contributed sulphur gases to the eruption column) indicates an eruption supplying a very considerable 1500 ppm by mass of sulphur per unit mass of erupted magma. Dividing the estimated sulphur yield of the mystery eruption (130 Tg) by this concentration indicates an eruption magnitude of 9 × 1013 kg (about 40 km3 DRE), which is 30 times larger than the 1982 eruptions. Although the mediaeval eruption of El Chichón has not been well characterized, this seems far greater than the magnitude implied by Tilling et al. (1984).\nAnother well-known sulphur-rich eruption was that of Pinatubo in 1991. Unlike the 1982 El Chichón eruptions, which involved trachyandesite magma, Pinatubo erupted more evolved dacitic magma. Following the same arguments as for El Chichón, the concentration of sulphur yielded by Pinatubo per unit mass of erupted magma was about 625 ppm. If the mystery eruption had the same sulphur content then its magnitude would have been about 2 × 1014 kg (a DRE of 80 km3).\nFor the time being, it is not possible to distinguish between these two scenarios, i.e. a ‘typical’ 1015 kg eruption versus a 1014 kg sulphur-rich eruption. Consideration of Figure 3, however, suggests that a smaller, even more sulphur-rich eruption is not likely. As eruption magnitude increases, the sulphur delivery per unit mass of erupted magma tends to decrease (compare the small, 5000 ppm sulphur eruptions of Mt Spurr, Alaska, with the <500 ppm sulphur super-eruptions at the top of the magnitude scale). This is also reflected in the gentler gradients for the ice-core sulphur yield–eruption magnitude calibrations compared with 1 : 1 relationships for sulphur content shown by the steeper theoretical curves in Figure 3. Wallace (2001) explains this phenomenon by vertical gradients in exsolved volatiles that exist in magma reservoirs prior to eruption, and the increasing draw-down into the reservoir by larger and larger eruptions. Most gas is at the top of the magma chamber, so that a small eruption will tap this gas and a comparatively small volume of magma, whereas a larger eruption will not tap proportionally more gas, as the deeper parts of the magma chamber that are drained do not contain as much exsolved gas as the upper parts. The data available and presented in Figure 3 are sparse and subject to considerable errors, but they show no evidence for 1013 kg magnitude eruptions having sulphur contents above that of El Chichón’s 1982 magmas (i.e. around 1500 ppm). A 1013 kg eruption would, however, need to supply 5000 ppm of sulphur per unit mass of erupted magma to yield a total atmospheric burden of 130 Tg of sulphur. If the mystery eruption is not the largest of the historic period, it is certainly up there with those of the Tambora 1815 class.\nIn his review of calderas, Lipman (2000) summarized the eruption magnitude and crater diameter statistics of a number of well-documented examples. Plotting these up against each other yields an empirical relationship between caldera diameter D km and eruption magnitude M (kg) of\nD = 0.0002M0.35 (1)\nThe eruption magnitude ranges discussed above for the mystery eruption can then be crudely converted into possible caldera sizes. The high range of magnitude (1015 kg) corresponds to caldera diameters of up to ∼30 km (cf. Tambora 1815 with a caldera diameter of 6 km). A 1014 kg eruption would have a typical collapse caldera diameter of over 10 km.\nCopyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 23: 417–426 (2003)"

    "heading": "4. IMPACTS AND TIMING",
    "text": "Although Zielniski (1995) originally puzzled over a lack of evidence for significant climate forcing as a result of the mystery eruption, Stothers (2000) has since revealed passages in various mid-13th century chronicles that are consistent with a major stratospheric aerosol veil causing anomalous weather patterns in Europe in 1258–59, and highlight various demographic, political and cultural disturbances across Europe and the Middle East. Several composited tree-ring data and climate reconstructions covering the period have also been published recently (Jones et al., 1998; Briffa, 2000; Briffa et al., 2001; D’Arrigo et al., 2001) that help to quantify a volcanic cooling signal. Figure 4 presents two of these proxies for Northern (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) summertime temperature anomalies. The NH summers of 1258 and 1259 stand out amongst the coldest in the 1000 year record, i.e. seventh (−0.46 K) and 29th (−0.31 K) respectively (Table I; I have subtracted, year-by-year, the nine-point running average of the annual data from the raw annual anomalies in order, crudely, to high-pass filter the data set). The SH summer of AD 1257–58 is also one of the very coldest in the tree-ring reconstructions (Jones et al., 1998) and AD 1258–59 is not far behind, i.e. the third (−0.69 K) and 34th (−0.39 K) coldest respectively. These compare with rankings of second (−0.64 K) and seventh (−0.57 K) coldest in the NH and SH records respectively for the year following the AD 1600 Huaynaputina eruption, Peru (Table I; Briffa et al., 1998). By these standards, the mid-13th century eruption appears responsible for a longer period of observable climate change (2 years) compared with Huaynaputina (1 year).\nConsidering references to pronounced temperature decreases in England in contemporary chronicles, Stothers (2000) speculated that the eruption occurred in January 1258. However, if the SH summer temperature\nCopyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 23: 417–426 (2003)\nreconstructions do indeed register the same event (the possibility that the anomaly results from interannual noise cannot be discounted), then the eruption may have occurred in 1257. Interestingly, a similar temperature pattern is apparent from spaceborne microwave measurements of lower tropospheric temperatures following the Pinatubo 1991 eruption. These reveal SH summer cooling of Australasia and southern South America in the austral summer of 1991–92 (see plate 8 in Robock (2000)), i.e. the first summer cooling occurred in the SH. A mid-1257 eruption, therefore, is consistent with the summer cooling patterns apparent in both hemispheres, and the optical phenomena witnessed in Europe in 1258 that suggest the presence of a stratospheric aerosol veil (including a dark lunar eclipse in May 1258; Stothers, 2000)."

    "heading": "5. LOCATING THE ERUPTION",
    "text": "There are no obvious candidates for the volcano responsible for the mystery eruption. We have already discounted the suggestion of El Chichón, Mexico (Palais et al., 1992) on the grounds of timing and magnitude. A proposed link to an eruption of Okataina, New Zealand, can also been discounted, as its age is demonstrably younger (Lowe and Higham, 1998). To summarize, we expect the AD 1257 eruption to have produced at least ∼40 km3 (and possibly up to several hundred cubic kilometres DRE volume) of intermediate to silicic composition tephra, and be associated with a collapse caldera anywhere between 10 and 30 km in diameter. The volcano is probably located in the tropics, given the global dispersion of the aerosol cloud, though a subtropical/mid-latitude eruption cannot be entirely discounted. That we do not know its identity is, at first, surprising given the magnitude of the event, but the very uncertainty provides some clues regarding its location. Also, there are more recent eruptions evident from ice core records that have not yet been identified\nCopyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 23: 417–426 (2003)\n(e.g. a large, probably tropical eruption in 1809; Dai et al., 1991). The kinds of sensible phenomena associated with the AD 1257 eruption can be gauged from the contemporary records of eruptions such as Tambora 1815 and Krakatau 1883. These include audible detonations over distances of up to ∼2000 km from source, daytime darkness beneath ash clouds (<500 km away), pumice rafts (>2000 km distant), and tsunami (fatalities from the Krakatau 1883 tsunami occurred up to 800 km from the volcano).\nUnfortunately, the 13th century literary record for most of the tropics is sparse, and it is difficult to exclude any volcanic regions as candidates for the eruption on this basis. However, the lack of known tephra deposits and calderas of appropriate ages and volumes argues against more comprehensively studied volcanic regions (e.g. Mexico, Central America, and the Andes). The strongest candidate provinces are the island arcs, including remoter parts of Indonesia, Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia. An island, or even submarine, eruption would be among the most effective ways to camouflage a ≥10 km caldera and tephra volume. In such a case, the marine core record could well preserve the ash fallout from the AD 1257 eruption."

    "heading": "6. OTHER NOTABLE ERUPTIONS",
    "text": "The glaciochemical and palaeoclimate records highlight several other known and unidentified major eruptions (Zielinski, 2000). The ∼5 × 1013 kg Baitoushan eruption has tentatively been identified as the origin of the sulphate spike at AD 1027 (Zielinski, 1995). Horn and Schmincke (2000) estimated a sulphur yield of the eruption of only 2 Tg based on petrological work, but they acknowledge that this approach can greatly underestimate true yields (Wallace, 2001). Zielinski (1995) calculated a higher output of ∼10 Tg for the AD 1027 ice horizon. There are two candidate anomalous years in the NH summer temperature reconstructions (Jones et al., 1998) at AD 1029 and AD 1032 (Table I). The latter is, in fact, the coldest (−0.79 K) in the 1000 year record. Horn and Schmincke (2000) preferred a calibrated radiocarbon date for the eruption of AD 969 ± 20 but referred to another laboratory’s calibrated date of AD 1039 ± 18. The later date, the AD 1027 ice layer and AD 1029 temperature anomaly (−0.38 K) are the most consistent in terms of timing, but, allowing for up to 0.5% uncertainty in the ice-core date and the comparatively high latitude of the volcano at 42 °N, AD 1028–32 conservatively brackets the Baitoushan eruption year.\nThe comparably sized Kuwae eruption has been associated with a cool NH summer in AD 1453 (Briffa et al., 1998) and a sulphate anomaly in the GISP2 core at AD 1460. This would require a >1% error in the ice-core date for the two ages to correspond, which is greater than that reported. Combining and calibrating six published radiocarbon dates (from Monzier et al. (1994)) using the OxCal 3.5 program yields an age for the eruption of AD 1410–44 at the 2σ confidence level. AD 1414 and 1422 are the most notable excursions in the NH summer temperature sequence of Jones et al. (1998) for this period, though neither is as pronounced as the AD 1453 event, and there are no corresponding sulphate anomalies in the GISP2 record. The correspondence between ice core, palaeoclimatic and tephrochronological indicators for this eruption is not good, therefore (Table I), and the proposed AD 1452 date for the Kuwae eruption is questionable unless a +7 year error in the ice-core date is permissible. Table I lists several other probable and known eruptions apparent from the glaciochemical and paleoclimate records, e.g. in ca AD 1100, 1171, 1229 and 1341."

    "heading": "7. CONCLUSIONS",
    "text": "The largest eruption of the historic period, possibly of the past 7000 years, probably occurred in AD 1257. Its estimated magnitude (1014 –1015 kg) and caldera diameter (10–30 km) make it surprising that the volcano responsible has not been identified, but investigations of candidate young calderas, and the marine core record, may ultimately reveal the source. Palaeoclimate reconstructions indicate austral and boreal summer cooling in AD 1257–59, consistent with a high sulphur yield, low-latitude explosive eruption occurring in AD 1257. The 5 × 1013 kg Baitoushan eruption probably took place ca AD 1030. Other large, unidentified, climate-forcing eruptions occurred in ca AD 1100, 1171, 1229 and 1341.\nCopyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society Int. J. Climatol. 23: 417–426 (2003)"

  "abstractText": "Ice cores from both the Arctic and Antarctic record a massive volcanic eruption in around AD 1258. The inter-hemispheric transport of ash and sulphate aerosol suggests a low-latitude explosive eruption, but the volcano responsible is not known. This is remarkable given estimates of the magnitude of the event, which range up to 5 × 1014 –2 × 1015 kg (∼200–800 km3 of dense magma), which would make this the largest eruption of the historic period, and one of the very largest of the Holocene. The associated collapse caldera could have had a diameter up to 10–30 km. Palaeoclimate reconstructions indicate very cold austral and boreal summers in AD 1257–59, consistent with known patterns of continental summer cooling following tropical, sulphur-rich explosive eruptions. This suggests an eruption in AD 1257, producing a stronger climate forcing than hitherto recognized. Copyright  2003 Royal Meteorological Society.",
