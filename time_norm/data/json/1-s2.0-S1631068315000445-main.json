The high-resolution palynological analysis presented here concerns two specific levels (main lithological changes) of a well-dated Holocene core, Tfer06, collected from Emaotfer Swamp, Efate Island (Vanuatu). Our aim is to understand the role of climatic variability and human activities in shaping vegetation during these changes. Between 3790–3600 cal yr BP, the development of vegetation marked by disturbance is a marker of an increase in sustained El Niño events, also observed in many Asian-West Pacific areas. Between 1500–900 cal yr BP, the increase in introduced taxa and in microcharcoal particles is interpreted as human impact. In a forthcoming paper, the ongoing high-resolution palynological analysis of the whole core will be compared and integrated into regional palaeoecological data.\n© 2015 Académie des sciences.

    "text": "During the Late Holocene, environmental conditions have principally been impacted by abrupt climate changes, volcanic eruptions, tectonic uplift and/or human activities (Goudie, 2013; Wanner et al., 2008). Palynology has the potential to be an effective tool to understand how the vegetation responds to these events. Although the majority of palaeoenvironmental studies principally concerns Europe and North America (Clement et al., 2001; Mackay et al., 2003), the amount of palaeoecological research across the Pacific has continuously increased in the last decade (Cabioch et al., 2008; Donders et al., 2007; Haberle et al., 2012; Hope et al., 2009; Rowe et al., 2013; Stevenson and Hope, 2005). The first humans (Lapita culture) settled Remote Oceania (Southeast of the Solomon Islands archipelago), ca. 3000 cal yr BP (Petchey et al., 2014; Sand, 2010, for a review). These human groups have probably been affected by climate changes (Anderson et al., 2013; Brázdil et al., 2005; Field and Lape, 2010), but have also certainly impacted the natural environment of pristine islands in many ways (Anderson, 2009; Fall, 2005; Horrocks et al., 2009; Prebble and Wilmshurst, 2008; Stevenson, 2004; Summerhayes et al., 2009).\nMost research in the Vanuatu region have focused on submarine geology (Lecolle et al., 1990; Pineda and Galipaud, 1998; Woodroffea and Horton, 2005), volcanology (Ash et al., 1978; Robin et al., 1993; Witter and Self, 2007), archaeology (Bedford et al., 2006; Galipaud et al., 2014; Valentin et al., 2010) and palaeoclimatic changes based on models and marine data (Asami et al., 2013; Corrège et al., 2000; Donders et al., 2008). However, the relation between climate, vegetation and human activity still remains unclear.\nWirrmann et al. (2011a) conducted one of the first terrestrial multi-proxy analyses of mid-Holocene environmental changes in Vanuatu, based on the study of the core Tfer06 retrieved from Emaotfer Swamp (Efate Island, central Vanuatu). The results indicate environmental changes, correlated with climatic variations over the last 6670 cal yr BP. Three main vegetation groups were observed, based on the preliminary pollen analysis. In order to understand the pattern of vegetation change, our high-resolution palynological study covers specific sections of the core Tfer06, at ca. 3790–3600 and 1500–900 cal yr BP, respectively. These sections, characterized by proxies variations (lithology, microfauna-flora) indicate high environmental transformations. In this paper, our aim is to distinguish the role of climatic changes from human activities in shaping vegetation during these particular periods, to further comparing our data with results obtained across the Southwest Pacific area.\nes sciences.

    "text": "The Vanuatu Archipelago is located between the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates, at the eastern margin of the Vanuatu Arc (Fig. 1). It comprises both subaerial and submarine volcanoes (Ash et al., 1978), some of which are still active. These islands consist of lava formed by basalt volcanoes dating from Late Miocene to Holocene. Efate Island, located in the central part of Vanuatu, consists mainly of volcanic rocks levelled by erosion, and limestone terraces issued from tectonic uplifts. Emaotfer Swamp, located on the southern coast of Efate, lies on a Pleistocene limestone terrace (Ash et al., 1967–1970). It is close to the Teouma Graben, on the left side of Teouma River. The water depth is currently less than 1 m throughout the swamp. During the wettest season (December through April), the water level rises and decreases during the drier season (July through September).\nThe oceanic context and the oceanic-atmosphere coupling (West Pacific Warm Pool, WPWP and South Pacific Convergence Zone, SPCZ) mainly influence the subtropical climate of the archipelago (Vincent, 1994). The location and the magnitude variability of WPWP and SPCZ control the alternation of wet (summer) and relatively dry (winter) season, the wet season being often marked by strong cyclones. Annual rainfall on Efate Island varies, on average, between 2400 mm on the western coast and 3000 mm on the eastern coast (Cillaurren et al., 2001). The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Wyrtki, 1975), the primary cause of long-term climate variability in the western Pacific (Kilbourne et al., 2004; Moy et al., 2002), influences rainfall and sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The wind-driven ocean currents move warm water in the ocean, eastward during the warm phase (El Niño) and westward during the cool phase (La Niña). The strengthening of El Niño-like conditions causes the northward shift of the SPCZ, consequently Vanuatu becomes relatively drier; conversely, under La Niña-like conditions, the SPCZ is shifted southward and precipitation increases on Vanuatu. Palaeo-ENSO records throughout the tropical Pacific region identify the onset of modern ENSO periodicities after 5000 yr BP, with abrupt increases in ENSO magnitude around 3700 and 3300 yr BP (Brijker et al., 2007; Donders et al., 2007, 2008; Gagan et al., 2004; Griffiths et al., 2010).\nDuring Late Quaternary, sea-level changes have occurred in relation to tectonic uplifts and eustatic variations. In Vanuatu, the sea-level has risen by 120 m since\ntions, with a sudden acceleration after 11.3 ka (Cabioch et al., 2003). Important forearc tectonic effects vary with\nC. Combettes et al. / C. R.

Its shores consist of wooded reas, rich in creepers, and dominated by Barringtonia dulis, Pandanus tectorius and Hibiscus tiliaceus. Cyperaceae, oaceae, Nymphaeaceae and ferns cover the flooded zones f the swamp. The surrounding plateau is an anthropogenic avannah, composed principally of Urticaceae, Moraceae, urseraceae and Flacourtiaceae, as a result of cattle grazing.\n.2. Archaeological settings\nAs on other south Pacific archipelagos, Vanuatu abounds n archaeological sites (Bedford, 2009; Galipaud, 2004;\nues, leur âge de formation (d’après Ash et al., 1978 ; Witter et Self, 2007), ion du marais d’Emaotfer (rectangle rouge) sur la rive droite de la rivière de la zone autour du marais, et localisation du site archéologique et du\nGaranger, 1972; Shutler et al., 2002; Valentin et al., 2011). Bearers of the Lapita culture began to settle Efate Island around 3000 cal yr BP, and one archaeological Lapita site have been uncovered on Efate, on the western side of Emaotfer Swamp (Bedford et al., 2006): nearly 70 burials features and remains of just over 100 individuals, some accompanied with pots, as well as a contemporary midden constitute the Teouma cemetery. Burial use of the site continued for up to 200–300 years, beginning ca. 3100–2900 cal yr BP or even slightly later ca. 2880–2800 cal yr BP (Petchey et al., 2014). The Teouma cemetery is an outstanding Lapita archaeological site due to the significant number of burials, which represents an early phase of Lapita migration into Remote Oceania (Bedford et al., 2009). The settlement expanded across the cemetery area during the late Lapita-Erueti transitional period (2700–2300 cal yr BP). But there are no traces of human occupation after 2300 cal yr BP, until the development of a coconut plantation, about one century ago.\nLanguages, material cultures and social practices remained similar during Lapita period, whereas the post-Lapita period was characterized by varied cultures, depending on time and geographic positions (Bedford, 2009). Subsistence behaviour also changed in the\nR. Palev 254 C. Combettes et al. / C.\nSouthwest Pacific Islands: Lapita people consumed a large range of food items, taken from the reef, inshore and terrestrial environment, while post-Lapita people favoured lower trophic level terrestrial resources, suggesting the intensification of horticulture (Field et al., 2009; Kinaston et al., 2013, 2014; Valentin et al., 2014). However, to stimulate tuber growth of introduced plants (taro and yam), the settlers consistently cut their flowers: hence, the paucity of these introduced taxa pollen may skew the palynological results."

    "text": "Four cores were retrieved from the southwest shore of Emaotfer Swamp (Wirrmann and Sémah, 2006). The longest one, Tfer06, sliced into continuous 1-cm width sections was sampled along its longitudinal axis. Three lithological sequences were identified from the base to the top of the core:\n• unit I (from 480 to 431 cm) is composed of a homogenous clay-rich organic sediment, and has the slowest sedimentation rate of 0.14 mm/year; • unit II (from 431 to 151 cm) is composed of pinkish to red-brown or white patches in a compact mud. Its sedimentation rate rose from 1.4 to 2.1 mm/year; • unit III (from 151 cm to the top) corresponds to peat deposits, with a sedimentation rate of 1 mm/year.\nHereafter, we present a detailed palynological study of 16 samples, 8 from each section 433–426 cm and 151–108 cm.\nEach sample of 1 g was prepared by cleaning with KOH (this cleaning was repeated twice for rich organic samples), and by elimination of the mineral phase, with a standard method using hot HF and HCl (adapted from Sittler, 1955). The residue was then mixed with a known volume of glycerol, and 50 l of this mixture was used to prepare pollen slides. On average 150–200 pollen grains and 30 taxa were identified on each slide, except for the barren samples (< 50 pollen grains counted). A total of more than 100 taxa were identified. The diverse pollen flora was determined by comparison with the collection of over 2000 slides held at the IRD (France), also with photographs and descriptions in Bulalacao (1997), Erdtman (1966), Ledru and Sémah (1992) and with regional reference collections currently held at the Department of Archaeology and Natural History of the Australian National University (http://www.apsa.anu.edu.au). Charcoals, (black, opaque and angular particles ≥ 10 m), as fire indicators (Whitlock and Larsen, 2001), were also counted. For each sample, the microcharcoal surface was estimated according to the Clark method (Clark, 1982). However, this method only indicates changes in small microcharcoal particles abundance (< 160 m), and does not fully represent fire patterns, due to the lack of coarser particles.\nol 14 (2015) 251–261"

    "text": "The chronology is based on AMS radiocarbon ages obtained on 18 samples: bulk disseminated organic matter, vegetal remains, wood fragments and gastropod shells (Wirrmann et al., 2011a). The samples were prepared in the LMC14 Laboratory (UMS 2572, CEA-CNRS-IRD-IRSN-MCC) at Saclay (France), under the laboratory’s routine quality control procedures (Cottereau et al., 2007). For charcoal and wood, the classical acid-alkali-acid pretreatment was applied to remove any CaCO3, humic acid contaminants and to ensure the removal of the modern atmospheric CO2.\nRadiocarbon ages, including those taken from the literature, were calibrated using Oxcal 4.2.2 with the Southern Hemisphere data set (Bronk Ramsey and Lee, 2013; McCormac et al., 2004; Stuiver and Pearson, 1993) and the two-sigma probability ranges, noted cal yr BP (Table 1). The 14C division between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere is represented by the ITCZ (Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone). Even if the SPCZ, with merges with the ITCZ, moves over Vanuatu half the year, we chose to use the Southern Hemisphere calibration curve, in order to provide comparable results between the whole core Tfer06 and palaeoenvironmental data from the Southwest Pacific area, especially New-Caledonia, located at 22◦S. The curve of the age-depth model was deduced by fitting a smoothed curve to the age by applying a Stineman function to the data (Fig. 2). The curve of the age-depth model generated on the same dates by Bayesian statistics (P sequence model, Oxcal 4.2.2) matches the curve obtained from the smooth: that is why we kept the smooth polynomial model to present the interpretation of the palaeoenvironmental data obtained on core Tfer06.\nThe seven dates asterisked in Table 1 are considered as presenting sediment reworking (signs of transportation and/or allochthonous material, mostly roots), and thus were not taken into account in the age-depth model."

However, the following slight changes occur:\n• Chenopodiaceae sometimes reach more than 50% of the total pollen sum; • Nymphaeaceae appear, and herbaceous taxa (particularly Cyperaceae) increase; • fern spores show their higher content (50 to 70%), arboreal taxa the minimum content (4 to 10%).\nWith the development of the peat unit, a microcharcoal peak, coeval with a palynological richness peak, is noticed. Introduced taxa, dominated by Musaceae, appear, and rise toward the end of the zone.\nDue to this relative stability of the vegetation, we also studied two younger samples (1200 and 990 cal yr BP), from peat section (unit III – Fig. 3, Fig. 4), to assess environmental changes. Around 1200 cal yr BP, an increase in rainforest taxa (15%), especially Geissois, Weinmania (Cunoniaceae) and Peperomia is observed.

Period 3790–3600 cal yr BP\nAn obvious change in the pollen record over this interal is observed. There was a rapid drop in the rainforest nd mangrove/coastal vegetation, which were replaced by ndicators of disturbance. This pollen signal, in conjuncion with sedimentological and micro-faunal/floral studies Wirrmann et al., 2011a) suggests drier conditions at this ime. The barren pollen zone, volcanic ash-free, is probaly due to the sediment oxidation from exposure of the ubstratum.\nThe palynological variations correlate with ENSO varibility documented by previous works (Donders et al., 008; Gagan et al., 2004; Moy et al., 2002). The replaceent of rainforest by seasonal forest in 80 years could e linked to peak in sustained El Niño dated from 3700 r BP (Brijker et al., 2007). The rainforest supported he first notable El Niño events until 3700 yr BP and hen decreased. The Indonesian-Australian summer monoon (IASM) decline from 4200 yr BP (Denniston et al., 013, 2014) could also favour drier conditions in the rea. A similar palaeoenvironmental pattern is observed n many Asian-West Pacific areas (Cabioch et al., 2008;\nllison, 1994; Haberle and Ledru, 2001; Haberle et al., 001; Sémah and Sémah, 2012; Shulmeister and Lees, 995; Wirrmann et al., 2011b), although in some trop-\ncal Pacific islands, changes in the pollen record, coeval\nre de la carotte Tfer06.

The relative sea level-change across the Pacific can be summarized as a post glacial eustatic rise until 6000–4000 yr BP (Cabioch et al., 2003), followed by a Late Holocene hydro-isostatic drawdown (Dickinson, 2001). In Vanuatu co-seismic uplift, due to the subduction of the D’Entrecasteaux Ridge, has also to be taken into account (Lecolle et al., 1990, Neef and Veeh, 1977). Around 3700 yr BP, the end of the eustatic rise was coeval with tectonic uplift rate close to 1 mm/yr in the South of Efate which in turn induced a sea-level decrease, marked by the loss of mangrove forest. The occurrence of former rolled-coral in several archaeological sites (Bedford et al., 2007; Dickinson, 2001; Pineda and Galipaud, 1998) confirms that the sea level was higher than today when the first settlers arrived.\nThe emergence of the Lapita culture on Mussau (Papua New Guinea) is dated around 3400 cal yr BP (Denham et al., 2012). The dispersal of Lapita people occurred after the onset of regional drier conditions. Moreover, during El Niño phase, the easterly winds decline, facilitating the sailpowered transport from New Guinea to the eastern islands (Anderson et al., 2006). If the precise causes of this eastward\n258 C. Combettes et al. / C. R.

    "text": "Except increases in Cyperaceae, Chenopodiaceae, fern spores and microcharcoal particles, there are little significant variations in the pollen record between 1500 and 1450 cal yr BP. The vegetation remained broadly stable, while Wirrmann et al. (2011a) show lithological, microfaunal and -flora changes during this period: peat replaced poor-organic sediments and acidophilus diatom species replaced species of high conductivity water. The occurrence of these deposits, associated with an increase of fern spores and Cyperaceae, may correspond to a hydroseral succession. Adapted plants invade open water, reducing water flow, trapping sediment and contributing to the invasion by emergent vegetation. As peat accumulates, made up of the remains of this vegetation, the water body becomes progressively shallower. The high percentage of Chenopodiaceae pollen grains, often found in clumps, indicates close proximity of this vegetation type, and shows a decrease in water level, in agreement with the peat development. An increase in vegetation cover could prevent important runoff, resulting in a decline of sedimentation rate. However, the decrease in diatom species characteristic of saline conditions is inconsistent with shallower water (Van Dam\no the age-depth model (see Section 3.2 and Fig. 3).\nhantillon présenté dans ce papier (voir Section 3.2 et la Fig. 3).\net al., 1994). It could be explained by an increase in humic compounds, due to higher-level vegetation decomposition.\nThe peak in microcharcoal particles shows an increase in fire intensity and/or quantity. This was possibly because of further sustained El Niño events, from 2000 to 1400 yr BP, peaking at 1500 yr BP, associated with a period of IASM rainfall minimum (Denniston et al., 2013, 2014; Gagan et al., 2004). But Cyperaceae, Chenopodiaceae and fern variations more certainly mark local environmental change, likely variations in water level, than a climate event. Hence, ENSO and IASM rainfall variations seem to have a low impact on the vegetation. We propose that human populations took advantage of these local drier conditions, or even favoured them by setting fires too, to cultivate different Musaceae (bananas). The occurrence of Phyla is an additional evidence of human influence on vegetation: this plant has presumably been cultivated for ornamental and medicinal use, and is now considered as a weed (Smith, 1979).\nA significant change in the pollen record is observed around 1200 cal yr BP. There is a sharp decline of seasonal forest taxa, coeval with an increase in rainforest taxa, suggesting relatively wetter conditions, as observed at the same time in New-Caledonia (Wirrmann et al., 2011b). This could be linked to the decline in El Niño events after 1500 yr BP (Denniston et al., 2013, 2014; Gagan et al., 2004; Moy et al., 2002). But rainforest taxa values increased only 250 years after the onset of decline in El Niño events. One\nR.

Combettes et al. / C.\nould explain this fact by a rapid growth and reproduction f light-tolerant species (disturbed vegetation) compared o rainforest species (Chave, 1999, Prévost, 1983). Morever, the increase in taxa such as Geissois and Weinmania, haracteristic of higher altitudes, suggests lower regional emperatures compared to 3790 cal yr BP. At 990 cal yr P, the significant rise in introduced taxa, coeval with a ecrease in rainforest taxa, is interpreted as human impact; hich suggests a more permanent settlement in this area, erhaps longer than during the Lapita period.\n. Conclusions\nOur high-resolution palynological study shows:\nbetween 3790–3600 cal yr BP, the vegetation change presents a good covariance with sea-level change and ENSO phenomenon. These natural events certainly affected the mangrove forest and the rainforest, respectively; between 1500–990 cal yr BP, climatic variations had less influence on vegetation. Intensive agriculture could have prevented a return of the primary rainforest after 1200 cal yr BP, even if conditions became wetter; furthermore, human influence on vegetation has been demonstrated for the first time in Efate.\nIn summary, the vegetation dynamics details the timng of environmental changes already published. However, iscriminating with certitude the climatic impact from the ydrologic, ecological and human activities on the vegetaion is complex; these factors could occur at the same time.\nThe whole analysis of the core Tfer06, which covers the ast 5 millennia, will allow us to study vegetation dynamics efore and after the Lapita colonization. These results will e compared with other palaeoecological data obtained cross the Southwest Pacific, to expand our knowledge of he relation between climate changes, human activities and egetation dynamics during the Late Holocene.\ncknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the team of the Herbarium f Vanuatu (Port Vila) and especially Chanel Sam for the elpful discussions, during our stay in Vanuatu and by ails afterward.

  "abstractText": "Climate changes, sea-level variations, volcanism and human activity have influenced the environment of the southwest Pacific Islands during the Holocene. The high-resolution palynological analysis presented here concerns two specific levels (main lithological changes) of a well-dated Holocene core, Tfer06, collected from Emaotfer Swamp, Efate Island (Vanuatu). Our aim is to understand the role of climatic variability and human activities in shaping vegetation during these changes. Between 3790–3600 cal yr BP, the development of vegetation marked by disturbance is a marker of an increase in sustained El Niño events, also observed in many Asian-West Pacific areas. Between 1500–900 cal yr BP, the increase in introduced taxa and in microcharcoal particles is interpreted as human impact. In a forthcoming paper, the ongoing high-resolution palynological analysis of the whole core will be compared and integrated into regional palaeoecological data. © 2015 Académie des sciences.
