    "text": "The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a dramatic increase in temperature and the loss of ca. 14,000 km2 of ice-shelf area in recent years. During this time George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) has remained relatively intact, but it is now reaching its theoretical limit of viability. Epishelf lakes, formed when ice shelves dam the mouths of marine embayments, accumulate sediments that can be used to constrain past ice-shelf behaviour. They are stratified water bodies with an upper layer of fresh meltwater overlying amarine layer of water. Multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core fromMoutonnée Lake, an epishelf lake dammed byGVIIS on the east coast of Alexander Island, has recently shown that it retreated to at least the Ablation Point area in the earlyHolocene, ca. 9600–7500 years BP, demonstrating its vulnerability to periods of atmospheric and oceanic warmth. This study tests this interpretation of ice-shelf collapse through detailed analyses of granulometric, geochemical and Sr and Nd isotope provenance data for N8 mm clasts from the same cores. Clast data from Moutonnée Lakewere comparedwith geological reference data from two further lakes onAlexander Island (Ablation Lake andCitadel Bastion Lake) and an extensive archive of rocks and isotope-geochemical provenance data from the Antarctic Peninsula region. Underpinning this provenance analysis is the contrast between the plutonic/igneous outcrops in Palmer Land on the western side and the predominantly sedimentary strata of Alexander Island on the eastern side of George VI Sound, and the different patterns in their deposition that would be expected at Moutonnée Lake during periods of ice-shelf presence and absence. Results show that changes in clast distribution and provenance reflect the early Holocene retreat and reformation of George VI Ice Shelf at Moutonnée Lake. The period of ice-shelf retreat was marked by the onset of marine conditions in the basin followed by a rapidly deposited zone of clasts whose provenance, distribution, varied lithology and larger than average clast size are indicative of a period of lake ice disintegration and ice-rafted debris deposition between ca. 9600–8450 years BP. Igneous clasts in the ice-rafted debris have a close affinity with the plutonic provinces of western Palmer Land suggesting transport to the site by icebergs or recycling through Alexander Island strata/ moraines. When epishelf lake conditions returned after ca. 7500 years BP, the clasts were smaller, the number of lithologies more limited and the assemblage dominated by olive-green vitric tuff and pale-green rhyolitic clasts that isotope data link to Early Cretaceous volcanic activity in Palmer Land.

    "text": "Recent atmospheric warming across the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region has been substantially greater than both the current global mean and the natural temperature variability of the Holocene (Scambos et al., 2000;\nVaughan et al., 2003; Domack et al., 2005). As a result, substantial volumes of ice have been lost from unconfined ice shelves (Fig. 1) (King et al., 2004). This process has led to an accelerated glacier flow into the ocean, which contributes to raising global sea-levels (De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003; Scambos et al., 2004). Assessing the past\ne and Citadel Bastion Lake on Alexander Island, Antarctic Peninsula. heir most recent collapse events.\n260 S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\n261S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\nstability of ice shelves on the AP improves our understanding of how the remaining ice shelves will respond to continued warming of the region predicted by many climate models (Houghton et al., 2001; De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2003).\nGeorge VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) is the largest remaining ice-shelf on the western side of the AP (Fig. 1). It is ca. 500 km long, 20–60 km wide and 100–500 m thick and confined within George VI Sound (70°–73° S, 68°–72° W) by Alexander Island to the west and Palmer Land to the east. Unlike most AP ice shelves that have recently disintegrated, its confinement provides additional stability (Smith et al., 2007a). On the eastern coast of Alexander Island, GVIIS impounds two epishelf lakes, Moutonnée Lake and Ablation Lake (Fig. 2). In Antarctica, epishelf lakes form when ice shelves dam marine embayments. Moutonnée Lake is a tidal, stratified water body with a lower marine layer that extends under the ice-shelf to the ocean and an upper fresh meltwater layer whose maximum thickness is determined by the draught of the ice-shelf (Heywood, 1977; Smith et al., 2006). Smith et al. (2006) proposed that when the ice-shelf is absent, Moutonnée Lake would become a marine embayment (Fig. 3). Therefore, epishelf lakes can be used to constrain past ice-shelf behaviour because when the ice-shelf retreats marine sediments with a distinctive biological and isotopic signature are deposited.\nThe recent loss of the Larsen Ice Shelf B (LIS-B) is unique in the present Holocene interglacial (Domack et al., 2005). However, other ice shelves are behaving, and have behaved differently, with evidence for retreat events in the middle and early Holocene (Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Brachfeld et al., 2003; Bentley et al., 2005; Cook et al., 2005). For example, Bentley et al. (2005) and Smith et al. (2006) showed that GVIIS retreated to at least the Ablation Point area in the early Holocene, ca. 9595– 7495 years BP, immediately post-dating the early Holocene climatic optimum identified in ice-core records (Masson et al., 2000; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2004), and occurring at the same time as an influx of warmer ocean water onto the AP continental shelf (Domack et al., 2001; Bentley et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2006). It is thought that structural instability and collapse of unconfined ice shelves such as Larsen Ice Shelf B and C followed a build up of superficial meltwater ponding, with increased\nFig. 2.

Lo outcrops mapped by Elliott (1975).\nlateral stress leading to rapid removal of large sections of the ice-shelf (Doake et al., 1998). In contrast, superficial ponding has been observed for decades on GVIIS, and although regional temperatures have risen to its hypothesised viability limit, it has remained relatively stable with only minor retreat recorded at its northern margin since 1985 (Fig. 4) (Vaughan and Doake, 1996). Thus, a combination of oceanic melting of the under-side of the ice-shelf and increases in atmospheric temperature at the surface may be necessary for further retreat of GVIIS beyond present-day limits (Shepherd et al., 2003; Bentley et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2006).\nThe aim of this study is to examine the geological evidence for past retreat of GVIIS through detailed analyses of granulometric, geochemical and Sr and Nd isotope provenance data for clasts retained on an 8 mm sieve (i.e., the N8 mm fraction) in a sediment core from Moutonnée Lake. We compare the data from Moutonnée Lake with geological reference data from two other lakes on the eastern side of Alexander Island, Ablation Lake and Citadel Bastion Lake, and an extensive archive of rocks and geological provenance reference data from the AP region. Specific objectives are to determine if the granulometric and geochemical characteristics of the clasts can be used: (1) as an indicator of initial and/or final provenance, (2) as a proxy record for GVIIS collapse and/or reformation, and (3) as an indicator of major changes in glacial activity in the lake catchment.\nUnderpinning this provenance analysis is the contrast between the plutonic/igneous outcrops in Palmer Land on the western side of George VI Sound and the predominantly sedimentary strata of Alexander Island on the eastern side of George VI Sound, and the different patterns in their deposition that would be expected at Moutonnée Lake during periods of ice-shelf presence versus periods of ice-shelf absence. At present, locallyderived clasts enter Moutonnée Lake mainly by glacial erosion of catchment bedrock or moraines, and possibly even aeolian transport (cf. Lewis et al., 2002; Gilbert and Domack, 2003). A smaller number of exotic clasts are also transported englacially through GVIIS from Palmer Land and become embedded in the lake ice margin or deposited via a local lake ice conveyor along the lake shoreline (Clapperton and Sugden, 1982; Potter and Paren, 1985; Hendy, 2000; Bentley et al., 2005; Smith\nke and Moutonnée Lake showing where the ice of George VI Ice Shelf trating the relative lack of lake-proximal glacial activity in Moutonnée the coring site and its separation from George VI Ice Shelf.

When the ice-shelf was absent in the early Holocene, the lake would have become a marine embayment. The main conclusion from this study is that during this period of ice-shelf absence a greater number of exotic clasts were deposited in the embayment by lake ice disintegration and iceberg rafting processes."

    "text": "Moutonnée Lake (70°52.123′ S, 68°19.635′ W) is an epishelf lake impounded by GVIIS and located in a valley on the east coast of Alexander Island (Fig. 2a). The geology and geomorphology of the area are well-mapped, with catchment glaciers currently located ca. 2 km up the valley (Fig. 2) (e.g., Horne, 1968; Elliott, 1975; Clapperton and Sugden, 1983; Butterworth, 1991; Browne, 1996). At Moutonnée Lake, GVIIS is grounded on a partially submerged bedrock bar damming the embayment (Figs. 2b, 3). However, the lake retains a limited hydraulic connection to the sea water in George\nVI Sound as revealed by the offset tidal regime that occurs in the lake (Pearson and Rose, 1983). At present, fresh water overlies sea water with a halocline at ca. 30 m depth (Heywood, 1977; Smith et al., 2006). We examined the principal core, ML, extracted from the deepest point of the main basin with a water depth of 51 m.\nA conceptual model has shown that when the ice-shelf is present exotic clasts can be transported across George VI Sound from the igneous provinces of western Palmer Land by becoming incorporated into the ice-shelf and then the lake ice (Fig. 3) (Smith et al., 2006). Bishop and Walton (1981) and Pearson and Rose (1983) demonstrated the existence of a strong south-east to north-west flow regime from the region south of the Bertram Glacier in western Palmer Land in the direction of Ablation Point (Fig. 4). Clapperton and Sugden (1982) and Smith et al. (2006) also noted the presence of granitic clasts in the moat surrounding Moutonnée Lake, showing that transport of material across GVIIS had occurred at some point, likely due to the existence of a lake ice conveyor similar to that described in Hendy (2000). The ice-shelf at both Moutonnée Lake and Ablation Lake\n263S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\n(AB) is not continuously grounded. Processes similar to those occurring at Moutonnée Lake are likely to have occurred at Ablation Lake."

    "text": "Ablation Lake (70°48.974′ S, 68°27.143 W) has a similar setting to Moutonnée Lake, but differs in that GVIIS is only partially grounded across the entrance to the embayment. This results in a continuous hydraulic connection to the sea water in George VI Sound as revealed by an in-phase tidal regime occurring in the lake (Smith et al., 2006). Due to the absence of a bedrock\nbarrier, GVIIS penetrates into the basin forming an iceshelf tongue (Fig. 2b: H) and can directly deposit coarse sediments into the lake. We examined the principal Ablation Lake core, henceforth referred to as AB, extracted from a water depth of 65 m.\nCitadel Bastion Lake (72°00.549′ S, 068°27.708′ W) (Fig. 1) is located on the eastern side of Alexander Island, south of and further inland than Moutonnée and Ablation Lakes. It is enclosed on three sides by Citadel Bastion and Corner Cliffs and dammed along its northern edge by the Saturn Glacier (Fig. 2c, d), which isolates it from George VI Sound. Therefore, it provides useful reference data for modes and types of local clast deposition that would be expected on Alexander Island at a site beyond the\n264 S.J.

There is no sub-glacial hydraulic connection to George VI Sound and the Saturn Glacier prevents sea water encroaching into the embayment. We examined the principal core (CIB) extracted from a water depth of 89 m."

    "text": "To best interpret the provenance signals of clasts identified in the ML, AB and CIB cores, we examined previously collected rocks and geological data from across Alexander Island and western Palmer Land. The AP is composed of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous calcalkaline igneous rocks and fore-arc and back-arc volcaniclastic sedimentary sequences. The latter were formed by subduction of the Pacific and proto-Pacific beneath the AP along an active continental margin of Gondwana (Suarez, 1976; Saunders et al., 1980; Pankhurst, 1982; 1990; Leat et al., 1995; Howe, 2003). Vaughan and Storey (2000) proposed a terrane model to explain the formation and geology of the AP and the distinct geological contrast that exists between the predominantly volcanic and plutonic bedrock of western Palmer Land and the sedimentary deposits of eastern Alexander Island (Fig. 4). The three principal terranes are: (1) the Western Domain, an accretionary, predominantly sedimentary terrane covering Alexander Island, (2) the Central Domain, a magmatic subduction-related arc terrane exposed along the west coast of Palmer Land dominated by plutonic and volcanic outcrops, and (3) the Eastern Domain, a cratonic margin terrane covering the east coast of Palmer Land, not relevant to this study. The Western Domain of Alexander Island is separated from the Central and Eastern Domains by a rift zone that runs the length of George VI Sound (Pearson and Rose, 1983; Bell and King, 1998).\nThe plutonic and volcanic provinces of western Palmer Land and southern Graham Land were formed by magmatic activity during the Mesozoic (Suarez, 1976; Leat et al., 1995; Storey et al., 1996; Howe, 2003). The Western Domain of Alexander Island formed in a fore-arc basin setting and is either a subduction/accretion complex of the Central Domain or a separate crustal fragment (Elliott, 1974; Vaughan and Storey, 2000). The bedrock in the catchment areas of the three lakes examined belongs to the Himalia Ridge Formation (Fig. 2b), part of the Fossil Bluff Group (FBG). The FBG is a fore-arc sedimentary sequence, deposited during the Late Jurassic–Late Albian (ca. 100 Ma) and outcropping along the eastern coast of Alexander Island (Macdonald et al., 1993; Moncrieff and Kelly, 1993). It is predominantly sedimentary, and characterised by interbedded black mudstone/siltstone, conglomerate,\nsedimentary breccia and arkosic sandstone strata (Doubleday et al., 1993; Macdonald et al., 1993; Moncrieff and Kelly, 1993; Miller and Macdonald, 2004). The Himalia Ridge Formation, which outcrops around the Ablation Point area, is a 1100-m-thick sequence dominated by mudstone and sporadic conglomerate beds (Doubleday et al., 1993; Doubleday, 1994). Thick fluvial and deltaic sequences and interspersed volcanic deposits are exposed in and around the catchments of the three lakes examined. These were deposited unconformably during the Cretaceous on older metasediments of the Lemay Group and later uplifted, compressed and inverted during a mid-Cretaceous compression event. The FBG is largely devoid of igneous strata because volcanic activity migrated northwards, away from the Fossil Bluff area (McCarron and Millar, 1997; Howe, 2003)."

    "text": "In marine core studies, granulometric investigations are commonly undertaken on the N2 and/or b2 mm fractions that define the boundary between sand and gravel (e.g., Pudsey et al., 1994; Pudsey, 2000; Ó Cofaigh et al., 2001; Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Anderson et al., 2002). The assumption that the N2 mm fraction is primarily ice-rafted debris (IRD) is valid in these studies because marine cores are often extracted far enough from terrestrial inputs to rule out other depositional mechanisms (Andrews and Principato, 2002).\nIn this study, the N2 mm fraction was subdivided into 2–8 mm and N8 mm fractions because:\n(i) Research on modern lacustrine environments in Antarctica suggests that coarse sand, fine gravel and coarser sediments are commonly found embedded in floating lake ice, while silts and fine sands rain out onto the lake floor after melting through the ice. For example, Hendy (2000) noted that clasts b10 mm in thickness will pass through the lake ice and rain out because the rate at which they absorb and retain radiation, and, therefore, the rate at which they melt through the lake ice, is greater than the ablation rate of the lake ice surface. That is, most individual clasts and clast aggregates N8 mm will remain embedded in the lake ice. Since few clasts of this size melt through the ice before break-up, increased concentrations of clasts N8 mm in size and/or changes in their lithology in the lake sediment should represent periods when lake ice break-up and ice-rafting events occur.\n265S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\n(ii) Catchment glaciers probably calved periodically into the lakes (Clapperton and Sugden, 1982), allowing numerous 2–8 mm and N8 mm clasts to be transported into the lake by glacial and/or glaciofluvial processes. At Ablation Lake and Citadel Bastion Lake, catchment glaciers feed directly into the lake (Fig. 2b and c). In contrast, at Moutonnée Lake there are no direct inputs from the glaciers in Moutonnée Valley (Clapperton and Sugden, 1983) and any increase in N8 mm clast abundance and change in lithology would be most likely due to lake ice break-up and/or icerafting. (iii) N8 mm clasts can be readily classified into specific lithological groups whose granulometric and geochemical characteristics are more diagnostic of transport mechanisms and provenance than finer fractions. (iv) The N8 mm fraction is sufficiently abundant in all three cores for statistical analysis and clasts in this fraction provide sufficient material for standard analytical procedures (e.g., XRF, ICP-MS)."

Following a series of routine descriptions and sedimentological analyses, sub-samples from each 1 cm of the cores were dried, weighed, re-suspended in water, placed in an ultrasound bath for 45 min and wet-sieved through 8 mm, 2 mm and 63 μm meshes. This paper concentrates on the N8 mm fraction. Detailed results of other sedimentological analyses including biological analyses of foraminifera, diatoms, geochemical and isotopic (δ18O, δ13Corg, TOC, NOC, C/N) and physical analyses (magnetic susceptibility) are described in Bentley et al. (2005) and Smith et al. (2007b).\nClasts retained on the 8 mm sieve were grouped into lithological types on the basis of hand specimens and the representative geochemical and isotopic analyses. In total, more than 1000 clasts were grouped, weighed, and their long, intermediate and short axes measured. The number of clasts examined from each lake is approximately three times greater than the number of gravel clasts examined in comparable studies (e.g., Kuhn et al., 1993). Similarly, many of the lithological-group and core-zone divisions contain more than the 117 grains recommended for reliable statistical analysis in single-grain geochronology/ provenance studies (Vermeesch, 2004).\nFollowing recommendations in similar studies (Jones et al., 2000; Hodgson et al., 2004), mono-specific marine\nforaminifera (Globocassidulina sp. and Cibicides sp.) and other macrofossils (e.g., plant remains and organic matter) were handpicked, cleaned and radiocarbon dated (see Table 1 for full experimental details). When macrofossils were absent, bulk surface sediments were dated on an exploratory basis to test the suitability of bulk sediment dating elsewhere in core (Table 1). Radiocarbon ages from marine organisms were calibrated to a calendar time scale using CALIB v4.4 (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and a ΔR value of 900 years (Table 1)."

    "text": "Major, trace and Nd and Sr isotope analyses were undertaken on 35 representative clast types from the Moutonnée Lake core (ML) and the Ablation Lake core (AB). At the outset, major- and trace-element and isotope data were thought to be good provenance indicators because of the macro-scale differences in geology between Palmer Land and Alexander Island. Criteria for sampling were: (1) best representation of lithological diversity, (2) lack of significant visible alteration, and (3) suitable size of clast. Most of the clasts analysed come from the ML core, reflecting the greater diversity of clast types found in this core. Thin sections were made from all clasts prior to chemical analysis. For geochemical and isotope analysis, the outer/weathered surfaces were removed by grinding, the remaining sample crushed in a mini-rock splitter and ground by hand to a fine powder in a clean agate pestle and mortar. All crushing/grinding equipments were rigorously cleaned between samples with acetone in an ultrasonic bath. Geochemical procedures are summarised in relevant table captions.\nIt was not possible to date the clasts directly due to their limited size and/or lack of suitable or sufficient phenocrysts. Clast age estimates used in εNd calculations were obtained from isochron analysis of bulk 87Sr/86Sr versus 87Rb/86Sr data, which was analysed using Isoplot (Ludwig, 2003). εNdi values, representing the difference between the initial 143Nd/144Nd ratio of the clasts and that of the chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR) at the time of clast formation, were calculated using age estimates from 87Sr/86Sr versus 87Rb/86Sr isochron analysis and compared with Palmer Land datasets of known age. Initial hand specimen groupings were improved by agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis of selected REE and isotopic data. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to compare new data with published Sr and Nd isotope data from Palmer Land. To aid interpretation of clast data, additional geochemical and isotope analysis was undertaken on the potentially far-travelled clay/silt (b63 μm) sediment fraction from the ML core.

The principal sedimentary facies in ML and AB are unstratified matrix- and clast-supported diamictons, fine mud with sporadic clasts, and sandy gravels. Clast-supported diamictons are more prevalent in the AB core than the ML or CIB cores, and are more common in the bottom half of the AB and ML cores. The upper 30 cm of Zone 4 and the near surface 15–20 cm of all cores are dropstone muds/fine muds. Macrofossils were only found in the ML cores.\nML core: The ML core is divided into five principal units defined by the presence/absence of marine organisms (Fig. 5). Zone 1 is devoid ofmacro- andmicrofossils. Above this, Zone 2 (522–490 cm) is well-defined by the appearance of marine organisms (forams, diatoms,\nspicules and brachipod shell fragments). Zone 3 is devoid of biogenic organisms, but characterised by a greater-thanaverage number of randomly deposited clasts of various sizes and rock type. Organisms indicative of marine conditions reappear in Zone 4 (302–236 cm). In the uppermost unit of the core, Zone 5 (236–0 cm), marine fossils are replaced by sporadic terrestrial organic matter and sparse moss fragments.\nAMS 14C ages from discrete macrofossils (monospecific forams) in the ML core are in stratigraphic order (within 2σ error). Calibrated AMS 14C foram ages from top of Zone 2 (9400±40 and 9260±110 cal years BP) and the lower half of Zone 4 (9400±30; 9470±30; 9430± 40 cal years BP) are essentially coeval (Table 1; Fig. 5). This means that the clast-dominated Zones 2 and 3 and the lower half of Zone 4 were deposited rapidly, with Zones 2 and 3 deposited not long after the onset of marine conditions. Zone 5 remains undated due to insufficient macrofossils and problems with ‘old’ radiocarbon ages from bulk sediments. Exploratory radiocarbon dating of bulk surface sediments from the ML core produced a clearly erroneous age of 15,100±50 14C years BP (Table 1).

Doran et al., 1999; Hendy and Hall, 2006). For these reasons we do not use bulk-sediment 14C ages in constructing chronologies for lake sediments from Alexander Island.\nAB core: The reference core, AB was subdivided into five principal lithofacies units (Fig. 5) using criteria in Evans and Pudsey (2002). The core consists of a matrixsupported diamicton (Unit I), gravelly mud and muddy gravels with interbedded diamicton layers (Unit II), dropstone sandy mud and gravel (Unit III) and a matrixsupported diamicton (Unit IV) fining upwards into a virtually dropstone-free sandy mud near the surface (Unit V). An impenetrable deposit at ca. 2.4 m prevented deeper coring, and, as a (likely) consequence, there is no evidence of the marine zones found in the longer ML core. The absence of macro- and microfossils or extractable organic fractions and compounds prevented reliable dating of the AB core. Humin and bulk sediment ages from this core are considered unreliable due to the likelihood of contamination from POC in the Fossil Bluff Group and/or old carbon in glacial meltwater (Table 1).\nCIB core: The reference core, CIB consists of a silty– sandy mud with repetitious gravel deposits. It has been divided into five units (A–E) defined by the principal changes in physical characteristics (grain size and magnetic susceptibility) and organic content. Some bulk and humin radiocarbon ages are stratigraphically consistent, but the ‘old’ bulk surface ages suggest that contamination from old carbon sources also occurs at this site. Studies to refine this chronology using optically-stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic-intensity dating methods are ongoing. Until then, we assume that the core post-dates the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) because the Citadel Bastion area was most likely inundated by ice at the LGM."

A further reduction in clast density to 0.0151 g/cm3 of sediment between 268–236 cm suggests IRD deposition ceased approximately half way through this zone. Interestingly, the top 17 cm of Zone 5 is similarly devoid of clasts. Indeed, the most notable similarity across all three cores is the near complete absence of clasts from the upper 15–20 cm. This could relate to a more recent reduction in clasts deposited from catchment glaciers that have receded beyond the lake margins (Figs. 2, 5).\nThe clast assemblage in ML differs from that in AB and CIB in several ways. First, the AB core has the greatest mean clast density (0.1921 g/cm3) and mean clast mass (6.12±0.58 g). The overall mean clast mass of the ML core is similar to the AB core, but the clast density is significantly less, due to the lack of larger clasts (defined here as clasts N10 g) between 236–0 cm depth (Fig. 5). In contrast, the smaller proportion of glacially remoulded and striated clasts in the ML core of 8%, compared to 31% in the AB core, indicates that input of material from a sub-glacial or entrained glacial source (e.g., basal iceshelf transportation) is more limited in the ML core. The greater proportion of striated mudstone and siltstone (Group 14) clasts in the AB core most likely reflects the larger size and higher number of active glaciers present in Ablation Valley compared with the Moutonnée Valley (Fig. 2b). Third, as might be expected, the AB core is dominated by clasts from proximal catchment glaciers and direct inputs from the ice-shelf tongue that protrudes into the lake. Fourth, due to its isolation from GVIIS, the mean clast density of the CIB core (0.0213 g/cm3) is an order of magnitude smaller than the AB and ML cores. This is primarily because the clasts are smaller (Fig. 5), but there is also a marked reduction in the number of clasts per cm (ML=0.960, AB=1.580, CIB=0.75 clasts per cm) and clast density (ML=0.110 g/cm3, AB= 0.192 g/cm3, CIB=0.0213 g/cm3). The overall mean clast mass in CIB is 1.43±0.34 g (cf. ML=5.73±0.87 g, AB=6.12±0.58 g) and only five clasts have a mass greater than 10 g. Zone D is the only zone with a clast density N0.1 g/cm3. This zone is characterised by variable inputs of coarse/fine sediments that are thought to reflect fluctuations in the position of the calving front of the catchment glaciers.\n269 S.J.

Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\nClast shape and weathering characteristics in the ML core differ from the AB and CIB cores. Clasts in the ML core are angular to sub-angular (mean shape=1.8±0.1; scale=0–6 where 0 = very angular and 6 = well-rounded) (Pettijohn et al., 1987), i.e., less well-rounded than the average clast fromAB (2.5±0.1) andCIB (2.6±0.1) cores. This is because the first 25 cm of Zone 3 has a large number of angular clasts, possibly representing clasts that were embedded in lake ice and dumped into the lake at the first opportunity with little or no recycling/reworking through Alexander Island moraines. The higher degree of angularity in Zone 5 is due to the large number of very angular/angular olive-green vitric tuff (Group 1) clasts (n=124;mean shape=1.2±0.1). Clasts in AB and CIB are sub-angular to sub-rounded and have a roundness index greater than average (2.5±0.1 and 2.6±0.04, respectively), possibly indicative of proportionately greater reworking or erosion from previously reworked deposits in the catchment strata (e.g., Fossil Bluff Group conglomerates).\nOverall, the proportion of potentially sub-glacially/iceshelf entrained, derived and/or remoulded clast shapes (i.e., bladed or prolate clasts) remains fairly constant at 40–60% for all three cores and zones within the ML core. Clast shapes that might represent significantly longer periods of basal entrainment, or perhaps through ice-shelf transport commonly constitute 20–40%, with the largest percentage in all cores in marine Zone 4 of the ML core. There are more bladed clasts in the CIB core compared to the overall mean shape and the mean shapes for each core (CIB=21% versus ML=13%, AB=16%, All cores= 16%). This is indicative, perhaps, of greater deposition of sediment entrained in the basal layers of catchment glaciers.\nIn the ML core, 29% of mudstone clasts have multidirectional striations, suggestingmultiple phases of glacial reworking before final deposition into the lake. The number of striated clasts is greatest in the AB core (31%) reflecting the dominance of Group 10/14 mudstones/ siltstones (61% of all clasts) on which striations are more readily visible. Nevertheless, a greater than average number of Group 10/14 clasts are striated in the AB core (44% in AB compared 33% overall, 28% in ML and 18% in CIB) (Table 2). The most significant pattern in the iron-oxide weathering statistics (Table 2) is that only 1% of clasts in the CIB core have visible iron-oxide weathering, far fewer than the ML and AB cores."

    "text": "Thirty-five clast groups were identified in the three sediment cores with significant lithological and distribu-\ntional differences between them (Fig. 6; Table 2). To aid descriptions of provenance, we have presented clast data in three main categories: i) primary igneous (plutonic and volcanic clasts), ii) secondary igneous (volcanic clasts only), and iii) non-igneous (sedimentry/meta-sedimentary clasts) (Table 2). Primary igneous clasts are defined by N50% crystralline or tuffaceous composition. Tuff in this category contain b10% lithic fragments. Secondary igneous clasts are lithic tuffs or tuffaceous sandstones with N50% reworked lithic component. Non-igneous clasts are sedimentary and/or metamorphosed/reworked sedimentray clasts. These are dominated by black mudstones, and dark-grey and grey-white sandstones commonly found in the bedrock strata of the Fossil Bluff Group.\nThere are 31 lithological groups represented in the ML core, with a maximum of 11 in any single 10 cm interval. The proportion of igneous and sedimentary clasts is almost equal when averaged over the whole core (50% and 45%, respectively). The number of plutonic clasts is ca. 3–5% throughout, perhaps indicating input from a constant, but restricted source. However, general statistics mask significant differences in the distribution of clast types in the marine (Zones 2–4) and epishelf lake sediments (Zone 5). The majority of the clasts in marine zones (2 and 4) and in the marine IRD Zone 3 are sedimentary or meta-sedimentary. ML Zone 3 has the largest number of clast types (17 in total). The volcanic clast component of N30% in Zones 2 and 3 rises significantly to N80% in Zone 5.\nThere are three main shifts in clast distribution (Fig. 6: circled points 1–3). The most important of these is the shift in clast lithologies between Zones 3 and 5 (Fig. 6: circled points 1–2). In Zone 3, the clast assemblage is a mixture of fresh to highly weathered crystal and lithic tuffs and sedimentary clasts. Zone 4 comprises a dropstone mud deposit with a low proportion of volcanic clasts (21% volcanic clasts compared to a core average of 50%). The clast assemblage in epishelf lake sediments of Zone 5 is dominated (63%) by Group 1/7 fresh olivegreen vitric tuff clasts until ca. 60 cm depth when they, and all other igneous deposits, disappear abruptly (Fig. 6). There is also a significant shift in the type of rhyolitic clasts deposited in Zone 3 compared to Zone 5. Group 2 green rhyolites, 89% of which are found in Zones 3 and 4, are replaced by Group 3 light-green rhyolites, 88% of which are found in Zone 5. This change occurs at the same point in the core as the increased abundance of Group 1/7 clasts. As with Group 1/7 clasts, Group 3 rhyolites dominate the rhyolitic clast assemblage until ca. 60 cm depth when they also disappear abruptly (Fig. 6).\n271 S.J.

Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\nComparedwithML, the composition of the shorter AB core is dominated by Group 13/14 sandstones/siltstones/ mudstone clasts (87%), with only 13 volcanic clasts present (out of 366). The high proportion of plutonic clasts (9%) relative toML (3%) andCIB (1%) is due to the presence of seven highly weathered and three fresh granitic clasts (Fig. 7). The highly weathered clasts are likely to have been eroded from moraines and/or conglomerate deposits in the catchment (cf. Clapperton and Sugden, 1983). It is likely that weathered plutonic clasts in the core are derived from the moraine deposits along the lake shore and the margins of the ice-shelf. Possible shifts in rhyolite and tuffaceous clast distribution occur, but the paucity of clasts makes it difficult to judge whether these are significant and/or related to erosion from catchment deposits or transportation through the iceshelf. Interestingly, the lack of volcanic deposits on the\nfloor of Ablation Valley (Elliott, 1975) appears to be reflected in the general lack of volcanic clasts in the AB core (Figs. 6 and 7).\nDue to its isolation from ice-shelf transport processes, the clast diversity in the CIB core is low, with only four major clast types present (Fig. 6). There are no obvious shifts in clast type and the clasts appear to have been deposited in well-defined pulses (e.g., in Unit D). The majority of the clasts are sedimentary (Fig. 7), with Group 13/14 sandstone/mudstone clasts dominating (Fig. 6). The number of Group 23 light-grey tuff clasts is significant (19%) and proportionately greater than in the ML and AB cores. The lack of variety in the volcanic clasts present in the CIB core reflects the general lack of volcanic outcrops in the catchment strata. Tuffaceous outcrops of similar composition to Group 23 tuffs have been found in the CIB lake catchment (Fig. 2c). The only clast that might not\n273S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\ncome from a CIB catchment source is the single Group 22- I granodiorite clast at 176 cm (Fig. 6: circled point 4)."

The following section details geochemical and isotopic characteristics of the key lithological groups that constrain provenance and depositional processes in Moutonnée Lake. In summary, εNdi values for primary igneous clasts range from −3.37 to 5.18 (Fig. 8). All the values, except for C142 (εNdi=5.18), lie within the range of previous analyses from granites and grandiorites from the Palmer Land (Fig. 8) (Millar et al., 2001).

Nevertheless, clast compositions provide useful marker points for comparison with more numerous volcanic clasts and are the most directly compatible with existing Sr and Nd isotope reference data. Three plutonic clasts were analysed: two granites (C68B and C18D), which represent all granites found in the core, and one foliated diorite (A13), a rock type that is known to outcrop in NW Palmer Land (Vaughan and Millar, 1996; Vaughan et al., 1997). Extensive superficial iron-oxide staining on C18D suggests it has been recycled through Fossil Bluff Group strata or catchment moraines. Moreover, C18D can be distinguished geochemically from C68B (i.e., unweathered granites) by its characteristically large negative Europium anomaly (Table 3), indicative of plagioclase fractionation and/or weathering. The granitic and dioritic clasts analysed have contrasting Sr and Nd isotope compositions. HREE versus LREE\n274 S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\ndata suggest the heavily weathered granite clast, C18D, is derived from a continental/intraplate magma source (Table 3), whilst its low negative εNdi and high 87Sr/86Sri values are compatible with existing Late Triassic or Late Jurassic data (Fig. 8). Clast A13 (foliated diorite) has low positive εNdi and very low\n87Sr/86Sri values, firmly associated with data from NW Palmer Land Cretaceous plutonic outcrops (Fig. 8).\nThe granite clast found at 176 cm the CIB core is similar to sample KG.871.2 (hornblende granite sample) from Alexander Island. Furthermore, some of the weathered granitic clasts in the AB core have a similar composition/external appearance (i.e., well-rounded, iron-stained) to weathered granite pebbles from conglomeratic outcrops in Ablation Valley in the BAS archives. With mean roundness of 2.4±0.4 and 43% equant clasts they are distinct from the more angular weathered granite\nclasts (1.5±0.6; 0%; Table 2) found in the ML core, and perhaps indicative of a different mode of transport, for example, multiple-phase reworking from local moraines rather than first-phase input from local outcrops (Elliott, 1975; Bishop and Walton, 1981; Clapperton and Sugden, 1983; Smith et al., 2006)."

InML, they occur throughout marine zones 2–4 in roughly equal proportions to sedimentary clasts and dominate the epishelf Zone 5\n276 S.J.

Group 2 and 3 rhyolites. Two clasts, one from each group, were analysed. Both are medium-K subalkaline tholeiites of the calc-alkaline series. Major/trace and REE compositions and Eu/Eu⁎ values of Groups 2 and 3 rhyolites are similar (Table 3). Sr and Nd isotope data show that they have a different eruption age and/or source (Fig. 8; Table 3). Group 2 rhyolites (e.g., C71) are characterised by low negative εNdi and high\n87Sr/86Sri values, typically associated with Late Triassic or Mid– Late Jurassic igneous rocks from Palmer Land (Fig. 8) (Millar et al., 2001). In contrast, Group 3 rhyolites (e.g., C83) have low positive εNdi and low\n87Sr/86Sri values more typically associated with Late Cretaceous igneous complexes of NW Palmer Land (Fig. 8). No Group 3 rhyolite specimens from the Ablation Point area were found in the BAS archives, suggesting a restricted, but as yet undiscovered, outcrop in the Moutonnée Valley area or transportation through George VI Ice Shelf.\nSeveral factors indicate that Group 3 rhyolites are most likely eroded from the ML catchment: (i) the simultaneous input of Group 3 rhyolites and Group 1/7 clasts in Zone 5 of the ML core; (ii) their lack of striations, less well-rounded shape, the small proportion of Group 3 weathered rhyolites (10% versus 18%) relative to Group 2 rhyolites (Table 2); (iii) a possible shift from Group 2 to Group 3 rhyolites in the AB core; and (iv) an absence of Group 2 rhyolites in all but the basal 5 cm of the AB core. Moreover, if both types of rhyolite were eroded directly from Alexander Island outcrops or moraines, it is likely that both types would be represented in the epishelf lake sediments of Zone 5 of the ML core.\n5.1.2.2. Group 1/7 vitric tuffs. Group 1 tuff clasts are dark olive-green volcanic tuffs with 1–3 mm black ash/ scoraceous deposits. In thin section, much of the groundmass is fine-grained/unidentifiable or composed of plagioclase and/or glassy fragments. The presence of secondary flow patterns and a well-preserved hyaloclastite texture that has not been recrystallised suggest a subglacial eruption or thermal shocking in contact with water, both compatible with a magmatic-arc REE source classification.\nSr and Nd isotope analysis that shows the original source of Group 1/7 clasts has a strong affinity with Palmer Land Cretaceous plutonic data (Fig. 8). However, their final source, prior to deposition into the lake, during the Holocene was probably local, i.e., Alexander Island. Group 7 tuff clasts are distinguished from Group 1 clasts by higher proportions of plagioclase phenocrysts and their\nassociated positive Europium anomalies (Table 3). Combined, group 1/7 clasts form an evolutionary trend within the transitional alkaline series and exhibit negative relationship between Eu/Eu⁎ and silica content, reflecting increasing plagioclase fractionation from the melt (Fig. 8). They are clearly distinct from alkaline (C124: Grp. 19) and sub-alkaline (tholeiitic) (C270A: Grp. 28) dark-green lava clasts, but have εNdi and\n87Sr/86Sri values that are similar those of the foliated diorite clast A13, suggesting a well-defined NW Palmer Land source. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis of all igneous clast εNdi,\n87Sr/86Sri and Rb/Sr data produces nine distinct cluster groups. Overall, no relationship exists between the different clast types in each cluster group, but it is interesting to note data fromGroup 1/7 clasts, C124, a trachyandesitic dark-green lava, and A13 are closely related statistically.\nThe evolutionary relationships between Group 1/7 clasts could reflect a single eruption event, or a similar eruption source. The low to medium positive εNdi and low 87Sr/86Sri values indicate that olive/dark-green tuffs and lava clasts are primarily derived from mantle sources with relatively little assimilation of older crust compared to other igneous clasts (Table 3). Their isotopic composition is compatible with Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous plutonic rocks from NW Palmer Land (Fig. 8) (Wareham et al., 1997; Millar et al., 2001) and outcrops with similar petrology in northern Palmer Land (Smith, 1987).\nRock specimens of Group 1/7 vitric tuffs and darkgreen lavas from Moutonnée and Ablation Valley are well represented in the BAS archive collection. For example, the green vitric lava clast C124 is similar in hand specimen to sample KG802.1, a dark-green finegrained lava with dark chlorite-filled amygdales, from the Himalia Ridge (Fig. 2b). Unlike AB and CIB, unidirectional glacially-striated volcanic rocks (e.g., KG.853) and till deposits outcrop extensively on the gravel-covered valley floor around Moutonnée Lake and volcanic deposits are common in adjacent screes and moraines (Elliott, 1974; Clapperton and Sugden, 1982, 1983).\nThe presence of tuff deposits similar to Groups 1/7 in agglomerate sample KG.804.1 suggests Group 1/7 tuffs were syndepositionally emplaced then reworked into the sedimentary deposits of Alexander Island. Moreover, substantial iron-oxide weathering on specimens equivalent to Group 1/7 clasts (e.g., KG.877.1, KG.853.2 and KG.801.1) suggests derivation from conglomerate/agglomerate beds of the Fossil Bluff Group and/or moraine depositswithin or at the entrance toMoutonnéeValley (cf. Clapperton and Sugden, 1983).\n278 S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283"

REE data from for Group 14 mudstones show that this lithology is characterised by a significant positive Europium anomaly (Table 3). The distribution of sandstones analysed in this study is similar to those from the Pluto and Neptune Glacier Formations (cf. Browne, 1996).

The two exceptions are C18D (Group 22 granite) and C13A (Group 1 olive-green crystal tuff).

Late Jurassic– Early Cretaceous (141–127 Ma) granitoid rocks of the western Palmer Land Central Domain are derived from the mantle, or by melting of underplate, and have low initial Sr ratios and high εNdi values, while older rocks, which have assimilated continental crust, have higher initial Sr ratios and lower/negative εNdi values (Millar et al., 2001).

    "text": "Based on detailed on-site investigation, Smith et al. (2006) have proposed a combined biological, geochemical and lithological conceptual model for detecting periods of ice-shelf loss from the analysis of epishelf lake sediments (Fig. 3). In this model, periods of ice-shelf presence are defined by a restricted range of clast lithologies and clast provenance (mainly catchment-derived rocks plus some input from specific locations upstream of\n279S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\nthe main ice-shelf flow lines). In contrast, periods of iceshelf absence would result in a wider range of clast lithologies sourced from a wider region incorporating both rocks from Alexander Island and rock from further a field transported to the site as ice-rafted debris.\nLithological and clast-isotopic provenance analyses allow us to develop this model further. Six modes of clast deposition inMoutonnée Lake are summarised in Table 4. These reflect: (i) clast source areas; (ii) erosion and depositional processes; (iii) the relative influence/depositional potential of catchment glaciers versus ice-shelf transport; and (iv) changes in the strength and/or direction of ice-shelf flow pathways into the lakes.\nSome caution has to be exercised, however, when assigning specific provenance locations and modes of deposition. Absolute determinations of source remain elusive for many clast types for the following reasons:\n(i) The principal difficulty in identifying provenance of the sedimentary clasts is the bimodal provenance signal from the accretionary complex and volcanic arc that was active in Palmer Land at the time. The petrography of sediments in the Alexander Island megabasin sequence reflects coeval arc volcanism, and\nerosion of older Palmer Land volcanic outcrops. Volcanic deposits in the Fossil Bluff Group or along Moutonnée Valley were derived from the rocks of the Central Domain, but could be related to ash/tuffs that were deposited synformationally (Horne, 1968). In both cases, the isotopic signature will be the same as near source igneous outcrops in Palmer Land. Similarly, the lower Cretaceous sandstones and conglomerates of the Alexander Island sediments were thought to have been derived from an elevated source area composed of granodioritic, parametamorphic and volcanic rocks (Butterworth, 1991; Browne, 1996). (ii) Relative to Palmer Land, there are few volcanic outcrops in the lake catchment strata. Tuff and ash deposits in the top of the Himalia Ridge and Spartan Glacier Formations are most likely products of Late Cretaceous/Early Tertiary eruptions from Alexander Island and/or coeval volcanism in Palmer Land. (iii) Reworked AP erratics (primarily granites) and granitic rocks associatedwith theHimalia Formation of Alexander Island have been found in conglomerate and moraine sequences of the Ablation Point massif and along the Moutonnée Lake shoreline (Clapperton and Sugden, 1982; 1983; Smith et al., 2007a). Reworked\nthe ML, AB and CIB cores\n280 S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\nclasts were distinguished from freshly eroded/exotic clasts to some extent by their highly weathered, rounded and/or iron-stained appearance. This is not entirely diagnostic and it is possible that clasts could be from unweathered or unexposed parts of such deposits. (iv) Major/trace and REE data from the Fossil Bluff Group is limited. Further isotopic work that might tighten clast source areas is in progress and it may be possible to pinpoint source outcrops more accurately in the future (e.g., Flowerdew et al., 2003). (v) Palmer Land analyses were undertaken on granites, granodiorites and tonalities. GVIIS analyses were undertaken on available clast types. These were dominated by tuffs and rhyolites and sedimentary clasts that may not be directly related to the Palmer Land crustal evolution. This study is different tomost geological investigations because it was not possible to select, a priori, the most suitable rock types for analyses. Certain volcanic clasts (e.g., tuffs) and bulk compositions are not necessarily diagnostic of a particular source.\nNevertheless, there is a clear difference in lithology and geochemistry of the clasts deposited in the marine ML Zones 2–4 compared with clasts from the other zones in the ML core and from the reference cores (CIB, AB). Specifically, the melange of clast types of predominantly medium (10–50 g) to large (N50 g) mass in Zone 3 follows the first incursion of marine water (Zone 2) and suggests that the ice-shelf dam and lake ice had disappeared allowing icebergs from George VI Sound to drift into the newly formed marine embayment and deposit ice-rafted debris. The assemblage in Zone 4 is initially dominated (to ca. 270 cm depth; ca. 8500 ka BP) by local Group 14 mudstones/siltstones of the FBG, but the fine sediments deposited in the latter half of this zone suggest ice-rafting was not the dominant sedimentary process ca. 8500–7500 years. BP. The switch to an assemblage dominated by Group 1/7 olive-green vitric tuff clasts in Zone 5 suggests IRD/marine deposition processes ceased at this time and instead were replaced by local glaciers from Moutonnée Valley, calving directly into the newly formed marine embayment, and depositing locally-sourced volcanic material."

    "text": "Clapperton and Sugden (1982) constructed a preliminary Holocene glacial history for George VI Sound from geomorphological relationships between till deposits, moraines, radiocarbon and amino-acid racemization ages from barnacles in moraine deposits. Their radiocarbon ages suggested open-water conditions existed in\nGeorge VI Sound at least until ca. 6500 14C years BP (ca. 6000 cal years BP—2σ median probability, using same input factors as Bentley et al., 2005) with four phases of valley-glacier advance including an advance phase prior to ca. 6000 years BP.\nWithout accurate age constraints in the upper half of the ML core it is not possible to categorically assign gaps in the down-core distribution of olive/dark-green rhyolitic and tuffaceous clasts between 236–44 cm to climaticallyinduced changes in glacial activity. Nevertheless, six phases of increased Group 1/7 clast density exist. This suggests up to five phases of increased glacial activity, some of which could be contemporaneous with the four phases of valley-glacier advance proposed by Clapperton and Sugden (1982). Phases of increased Group 1/7 clast density are indicative, perhaps, of pulsed deposition from stagnating lake ice, calving-related deposition in the nearshelf area of the lake and/or fluctuations at its margin related to retreat of catchment glaciers, perhaps during periods of precipitation decline.\nShifts in clast data associated with the transition from marine embayment to epishelf lake conditions support our previous conclusion (Bentley et al., 2005) that GVIIS was absent from the Ablation Point area between 9595 and 7945 cal years BP. This retreat occurred immediately after a period of maximum Holocene warmth documented in the EPICA Dome C ice-core record (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2004) and at the same time as an influx of warmer Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf (Domack et al., 2001; Bentley et al., 2005). Not long after the initial ice-shelf break-up, ice-rafted debris was deposited into ML. Subsequent reformation of the iceshelf occurred at the same time period as the Holocene climatic minimum in the EPICA Dome C ice core (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2004). There is no clear evidence of substantial phases of retreat or a return to marine conditions during the well-documented, and prolonged, ‘mid-Holocenewarm period’ (Hodgson et al., 2004), when conditions were warm enough to cause significant retreat of ice shelves across the northernAP (Domack et al., 1999, 2001; Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Taylor et al., 2001; Hodgson et al., 2004)."

    "text": "– Clasts N 8 mm in cores from three lakes on eastern Alexander Island can provide a proxy measure of changes in the configuration ofGVIIS. TheMoutonnée Lake core has significant changes in clast type and density that are coupled to retreat phases of GVIIS and, most likely, re-advance phases of local catchment glaciers in Moutonnée Valley.\n281S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258–283\n– The early Holocene retreat of GVIIS in the Ablation Point area (Bentley et al., 2005) is marked by a distinct depositional shift from a more ‘ordered’ assemblage and low number of clast types when the ice-shelf is present to a more chaotic distribution of clasts and more numerous clast types during the period when the ice-shelf was absent. During periods of ice-shelf loss, the lithological assemblage is dominated by a range of exotic clasts. Iceberg rafting of material is likely to be the dominant sedimentary process during periods of ice-shelf loss. Sub-glacial flow through the ice-shelf is relatively minor compared to the input of material from local catchment glaciers and iceberg rafting. – Further isotopic and age analyses of volcanic outcrops on Alexander Island and NW Palmer Land are necessary to determine provenance more precisely. This is a substantial undertaking, beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, data presented in this paper have identified six modes of clast transport highlighting the complex provenance and depositional processes in Moutonnée Lake and the GVIIS epishelf lake sedimentary system along the eastern coast of Alexander Island."

  "abstractText": "The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a dramatic increase in temperature and the loss of ca. 14,000 km of ice-shelf area in recent years. During this time George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) has remained relatively intact, but it is now reaching its theoretical limit of viability. Epishelf lakes, formed when ice shelves dam the mouths of marine embayments, accumulate sediments that can be used to constrain past ice-shelf behaviour. They are stratified water bodies with an upper layer of fresh meltwater overlying amarine layer of water. Multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core fromMoutonnée Lake, an epishelf lake dammed byGVIIS on the east coast of Alexander Island, has recently shown that it retreated to at least the Ablation Point area in the earlyHolocene, ca. 9600–7500 years BP, demonstrating its vulnerability to periods of atmospheric and oceanic warmth. This study tests this interpretation of ice-shelf collapse through detailed analyses of granulometric, geochemical and Sr and Nd isotope provenance data for N8 mm clasts from the same cores. Clast data from Moutonnée Lakewere comparedwith geological reference data from two further lakes onAlexander Island (Ablation Lake andCitadel Bastion Lake) and an extensive archive of rocks and isotope-geochemical provenance data from the Antarctic Peninsula region. Underpinning this provenance analysis is the contrast between the plutonic/igneous outcrops in Palmer Land on the western side and the predominantly sedimentary strata of Alexander Island on the eastern side of George VI Sound, and the different patterns in their deposition that would be expected at Moutonnée Lake during periods of ice-shelf presence and absence. Results show that changes in clast distribution and provenance reflect the early Holocene retreat and reformation of George VI Ice Shelf at Moutonnée Lake. The period of ice-shelf retreat was marked by the onset of marine conditions in the basin followed by a rapidly deposited zone of clasts whose provenance, distribution, varied lithology and larger than average clast size are indicative of a period of lake ice disintegration and ice-rafted debris deposition between ca. 9600–8450 years BP. Igneous clasts in the ice-rafted debris have a close affinity with the plutonic provinces of western Palmer Land suggesting transport to the site by icebergs or recycling through Alexander Island strata/ moraines. When epishelf lake conditions returned after ca. 7500 years BP, the clasts were smaller, the number of lithologies more limited and the assemblage dominated by olive-green vitric tuff and pale-green rhyolitic clasts that isotope data link to Early Cretaceous volcanic activity in Palmer Land. Their dominance in the upper part of the core most likely relates to increased ⁎ Corresponding author. Fax: +44 1223 362616. E-mail address: sjro@bas.ac.uk (S.J.
