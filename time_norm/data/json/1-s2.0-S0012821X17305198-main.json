Yin\nKeywords: Farallon slab rollback Elko Formation lacustrine Eocene δD values evaporation\nHinterland basins can accumulate high resolution archives of orogenic processes and continental climate, but are challenging to reconstruct due to tectonic overprinting and the inherent complexity of their lithofacies assemblages. The Cordilleran hinterland of northeast Nevada has been interpreted to have overlain a flattened Farallon slab from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene. Slab removal and advection of asthenospheric mantle beneath Nevada have been invoked to explain a southwestward migrating wave of Eocene to Oligocene volcanism and proposed as a driver for topographic uplift. However, the timing of slab removal and possible subsequent delamination of North American lithospheric mantle can only ambiguously be related to the surface record. Subsequent Neogene extension and basin filling has complicated the correlation and interpretation of strata that record these events. Here we apply single crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to 26 ash beds in northeast Nevada to reconstruct Paleogene geographic and hydrologic evolution. We use these ages and legacy geochronology to compare lithofacies and isotope proxy records of meteoric waters to regional tectonics and global climate, and assess competing tectonic interpretations for lake basin formation. Lakes formed locally prior to ca. 48.7 Ma in northeast Nevada, coeval with foreland lakes of the Green River Formation. The most expansive phase of lacustrine deposition resulted in onlap onto locally derived fluvial deposits and folded Paleozoic bedrock, and occurred between ca. 43.4 and ca. 40.8 Ma. Elko Formation strata exhibit a basin-wide transition from fluvial-lacustrine to fluctuating profundal lithofacies at ca. 42.7 Ma, suggesting a shift towards regional hydrologic closure. The stromatolitic upper Elko Formation is intercalated with ash fall tuffs and several partially welded to unwelded ignimbrites from increasingly proximal volcanism. Elko Formation deposition ended by ca. 40.4 Ma. 40Ar/39Ar ages for seven ash beds in the Dead Horse Formation at Copper Basin in northern Elko County indicate intermittent ash bed deposition between 45.2 Ma and 38.6 Ma, and an episode of lacustrine deposition between 39.8 Ma and 38.6 Ma that post-dates the main phase of Lake Elko. δD values of volcanic glass sampled from dated ash beds reflect changes in the hydrogen isotope compositions of local Eocene waters, and systematically vary by 80–102 according to their depositional environment. The Elko Formation and overlying volcanic strata are overlain regionally by a pronounced unconformity of ∼20 m.y. In the Copper Basin area, deposition continued locally into the Oligocene in the hanging wall of a ductile detachment. The geochronologic and isotopic framework presented here permits reanalysis of the Piñon Range carbonate proxy record that was previously interpreted to record both regional uplift and the middle Eocene climatic optimum. New data suggest instead that isotope values of hydration waters within the Elko Formation were strongly influenced by evaporation, and a change from lacustrine to non-lacustrine conditions can account for the δ18O shift that was interpreted to reflect regional uplift. Moreover, the end of Elko Formation deposition predated the middle Eocene climatic optimum. We interpret the overall record of drainage ponding and paleovalley inundation, progressively more evaporative lacustrine conditions, increasingly proximal\n* Corresponding author.

    "text": "Hinterland lakes can accumulate archives of orogenic landscapes that are otherwise largely erosional and thus rarely preserved in the geologic record. Lacustrine lithofacies in particular can be sensitive indicators of local and regional basin hydrology, and can record subtle deformation caused by dynamic or isostatic processes (Carroll and Bohacs, 1999; Smith et al., 2014; DeCelles et al., 2015). Due to structural deformation in orogenic belts and the often dynamic paleogeography of terrestrial depositional environments, hinterland lake strata are often difficult to reconstruct using traditional stratigraphic correlation (i.e., Umhoefer et al., 2010). The hinterland of the North American Cordillera underwent contraction from the Triassic through Late Cretaceous due to viscous coupling between the subducting Farallon plate and North American lithosphere (DeCelles, 2004). Beginning at approximately 80 Ma, volcanism in the Sierra Nevada ceased due to flattening of the slab, and deep-seated contractile deformation occurred across the Laramide foreland (Erslev, 1993; Copeland et al., 2017). The stratigraphic record after 80 Ma of the Cordilleran hinterland is much less complete than the record of the foreland to the east. Isolated exposures suggest surface deformation and the incision of paleovalleys from the Late Cretaceous through early Eocene (Smith and Ketner, 1976; Druschke et al., 2009; Long, 2012; Henry, 2008), but provide scant regional kinematic or paleogeographic details. In contrast, a robust collection of middle Eocene terrestrial strata occur across a 30,000 km2 region of the central hinterland of the North American Cordillera in northeast Nevada (Fig. 1), between the Cordilleran divide and the Sevier fold-thrust belt (Fig. 1). This hinterland is interpreted to have been an orogenic plateau during the Paleogene that sustained elevations of at least 2–3 km (Best et al., 2009; Cassel et al., 2014; Snell et al., 2014). Pre-Eocene structural relief and orogenic exhumation in the study area of northeast Nevada is relatively modest compared to the Luning-Fencemaker, central Nevada, and Sevier fold and thrust belts (DeCelles, 2004; Long, 2012). Paleovalleys filled with Paleogene strata are cut into gently folded late Paleozoic carbonates (Henry, 2008; Henry et al., 2012). The lacustrine Elko Formation and related terrestrial strata onlap this paleotopography and record a major long-lived lake system. These deposits provide an important record of the presumed regional transition from Triassic through Paleogene contraction to the Neogene extension that dominates the region’s kinematics and topography today.\nCenozoic crustal extension across the hinterland has been broadly attributed to gravitational instability due to orogenically thickened lithosphere. Extensional structures fall into three general classes: enigmatic isolated Cretaceous–Paleogene faults with normal displacement (Drushke et al., 2009), detachment faults related to middle Cenozoic metamorphic core complexes (McFadden et al., 2015), and high-angle Neogene normal faults that bound modern basins (Colgan et al., 2010). Metamorphic core complexes are areas of crystalline rocks that were uplifted along detachment faults with a net normal sense of displacement (Dickinson, 2009; McFadden et al., 2015). Ductile deformation along detachment faults exposed above metamorphic core complexes in northeast Nevada is typically cut by steeper, brittle faults that also offset Oligocene ignimbrites and coincide with modern Basin and Range topography (Colgan et al., 2010; Henry et al., 2011).\nGeochronology, thermochronology, paleobarometry, and provenance indicators collectively indicate that metamorphic core com-\nplex footwall rocks in northeast Nevada underwent considerable post-Cretaceous vertical advection from middle crustal levels (McGrew et al., 2000; Hallett and Spear, 2015), presumably along deeply-rooted detachment faults. These features occur in a north–south-trending line along the center of the hinterland, and Eocene lake strata occur near several of them (Fig. 1A). The most deeply exhumed rocks in northeast Nevada occur in the greater Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills–Pequop Mountains (R–EH–W–P) metamorphic core complex, and have interpreted peak paleodepths of 35–40 km (Hodges et al., 1992; Hallett and Spear, 2014). Zircon and monazite yield U–Pb ages for associated peak metamorphism of 97–77 Ma (Camilleri and Chamberlain, 1997; Hallett and Spear, 2015). Zircon U–Pb ages from a pluton exposed in the southern Ruby Mountains suggest at least 10 km of exhumation since its emplacement from 37.3–36.3 Ma, near the end of an episode of intense regional volcanism (Brooks et al., 1995; Henry, 2008; Henry et al., 2012; Lund Snee et al., 2016). Multi-crystal biotite and muscovite 40Ar/39Ar cooling ages (350–400 ◦C) range between 50 Ma and 17 Ma, with the majority 33–21 Ma, generally younger to the west (McGrew and Snee, 1994; Henry et al., 2011). Apatite (U–Th)/He and fission track ages of 17–10 Ma from the southern Ruby Mountains indicate Miocene exhumation from temperatures above 60 ◦C along a west-dipping detachment that bounds the western edge of the R–EH–W–P metamorphic core complex (Colgan et al., 2010). Clasts of lower plate crystalline rocks also first appear in basins adjacent to the R– EH–W–P structure during Miocene deposition of the Humboldt Formation (Colgan et al., 2010), although there is no depositional record from the Oligocene. The oldest evidence for exumation of lower plate crystalline rocks occurs at Copper Basin, 50 km north of the R–EH–W–P structure. There, a detachment fault has exhumed Cretaceous-aged plutonic rocks along a ductile shear zone, and sediments sourced from the structure are Oligocene, based on multi-crystal biotite 40Ar/39Ar ages of 32.7 ± 0.4 Ma and 29.5 ± 0.8 Ma for ashes interbedded with the Meadow Fork Formation (Rahl et al., 2002; Henry et al., 2011).\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest high average surface elevations in the Cordilleran hinterland during the Paleogene: plant fossils of upland conifers (Axelrod, 1968; Wolfe et al., 1998); low δ18O values in hydrothermal fluorite (Seal and Rye, 1993); low δ18O values in hinterland proxies relative to those from the Great Plains (Chamberlain et al., 2012); low δ18O values in lacustrine carbonates from waters delivered to foreland lakes from hinterlandsourced streams (Carroll et al., 2008); and low clumped-isotopederived temperatures in the Utah hinterland (Snell et al., 2014). Recently obtained hydrogen isotope values from hydrated volcanic glass (δDglass) indicate elevations in central to eastern Nevada of at least 2.6 km during the Eocene, increasing to 3.5 km during the Oligocene (Cassel et al., 2014). These studies have identified two primary potential mechanisms for the generation and evolution of hinterland high topography, including 1) Late Cretaceous surface uplift due to contractile thickening (Ernst, 2010; Snell et al., 2014), and 2) a mid-Cenozoic north-to-south progression of uplift due to dynamic topography driven by asthenospheric upwelling (Chamberlain et al., 2012) or delamination of the mantle lithosphere of North America (Porter et al., 2016). Despite regional elevation constraints suggesting high topography, a lack of systematic geochronology for Paleogene strata in northeast Nevada introduces substantial uncertainty concerning the relative timing of basin development and metamorphic core complex formation,\nwhich in turn limits our ability to understand Cenozoic extensional kinematics.\nEocene strata in northeast Nevada were originally assigned by the King survey (1876) to the early Eocene Green River Formation that fills the broken foreland to the east of the Sevier fold and thrust belt, then later renamed Elko Formation by Winchester (1923). They range from 0–1 km in thickness (Fig. 1) and onlap a regional erosion surface cut into deformed late Paleozoic siliciclastic and carbonate strata. In some areas, Eocene strata occupy paleovalleys with up to 1.6 km of topographic relief (Henry, 2008). In other regions, they fill broad basins (Fig. 1; cf. Cassel et al., 2014). The Elko Formation, Dead Horse Formation, and related alluvial and volcanic strata record progressive regional ponding and volcanism (Smith and Ketner, 1976; Solomon et al., 1979; Henry et al., 2012), contain a diversity of paleoflora (Axelrod, 1966, 1996), and provide an important terrestrial isotopic record from the middle Eocene (Horton et al., 2004; Mulch et al., 2015). Lake strata in Nevada have been variably interpreted to have been deposited in a broad, deep perennial freshwater lake(s) (Smith and Ketner, 1976; Solomon et al., 1979), within discrete, disconnected paleovalleys (Henry, 2008), and within structural basins induced by the onset of early surface-breaking normal faults (Rahl et al., 2002; Haynes, 2003). Paleoflow measurements from fluvial strata and the aerial distribution of ignimbrites suggest the Elko lake system occurred east of the primary Cordilleran paleodivide (Henry et al., 2012; Cassel et al., 2014; Fig. 1A). Additional Eocene hinterland lakes (cf. Fig. 1A) occurred in the Challis volcanic field of Idaho and Montana (Janecke et al., 1999), at Copper Basin, ∼100 km north of Elko, Nevada (Rahl et al., 2002), the White Sage Basin of western Utah (Dubiel et al., 1996), and near Ely, Nevada (Druschke et al., 2011). Overprinting by mid-Cenozoic metamorphic core complexes and numerous late-Cenozoic normal faults have disrupted the stratigraphic continuity of Paleogene strata (Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000; Colgan et al., 2010; Lund Snee et al., 2016). Here we use 40Ar/39Ar geochronology to construct a time stratigraphy for Eocene strata in northeast Nevada, and to investigate the timing and geography of hydrologic closure, and its impact on the stable isotope composition of ancient waters. More broadly, the resulting record of surface topography and accommodation from Eocene strata to provides key constraints on the timing and relationships between slab removal, mantle lithosphere delamination, and magmatism."

    "text": "The following represents a synthesis of published Cenozoic stratigraphy of northeast Nevada (Fig. 1B, Table 1; Supplementary Table 1), including surface sections (Smith and Ketner, 1976; Moore et al., 1983; Rahl et al., 2002; Haynes, 2003; Henry, 2008; Henry et al., 2011; Cassel et al., 2014), well logs and cores (Moore et al., 1983), and seismic reflection surveys (Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000). Paleogene terrestrial lithofacies in the Elko Basin range from fluvial pebble to cobble conglomerates and cross-stratified sandstones to a wide variety of fine-grained lacustrine facies (cf. Data Repository in Cassel et al., 2014). Lacustrine facies are typically included in the Elko Formation and range from fluvial lacustrine to fluctuating profundal in character (Smith and Ketner, 1976; Solomon et al., 1979; Moore et al., 1983; Haynes, 2003), suggesting that Lake Elko experienced overfilled and balanced filled lake-type conditions, respectively (Carroll and Bohacs, 1999). The lowermost Elko Formation (including the basal ‘cherty limestone’ interval) consists predominantly of massive to laminated micritic carbonate and marl containing mollusk fossils and abundant plant debris which are characteristic of the fluvial-lacustrine (freshwater) lithofacies. In contrast, the upper Elko Formation consists predominantly of laminated mudstone and marlstone that is in some cases extremely organic-rich (>80 gal/ton; Moore et al., 1983) and exhibit synaeresis cracks. These predominantly laminated facies are interbedded with microbialitic carbonate beds, and are largely lacking in trace fossils (Cassel et al., 2014). These characteristics suggest that Lake Elko contained saline, anoxic to disoxic bottom waters during deposition of the upper Elko Formation, which is consistent with the fluctuating-profundal (saline to brackish) lithofacies association. Intercalated with the Elko Formation and related units are numerous volcanic and volcaniclastic horizons ranging from thin (1–50 cm) ash beds to >10 m thick partially welded ignimbrites (Cassel et al., 2014). Near the top of the Elko Formation, volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits sourced from the Tuscarora caldera complex (Henry et al., 2011), Robinson Mountain volcanic field (Lund Snee et al., 2016), and Northeast Nevada Volcanic Field (Brooks et al., 1995) increase in abundance. When altered, volcanic glass in ash beds within the fluvial-lacustrine lithofacies of the lower Elko Formation have been altered to clay minerals, whereas glass in ash beds within fluctuating profundal upper Elko Formation deposition lithofacies have typically been altered to zeolite minerals, suggesting that lake waters became more alkaline in the end stages of Lake Elko (Goodwin\nand Surdam, 1967). Volcanic and volcaniclastic strata that overlie the Elko Formation were included with the Indian Wells Formation by Smith and Ketner (1976), however, recent radioisotopic geochronology by Mulch et al. (2015) and Lund Snee et al. (2016) suggests that only the lowermost ignimbrites and fluvial strata of the Indian Wells Formation are Eocene in age (Fig. 2). At Copper Basin in northern Elko County, Paleogene strata consist of the lacustrine and volcaniclastic Dead Horse Formation and overlying sandy conglomeratic Meadow Fork Formation (Rahl et al., 2002; Supplementary Fig. S1), ∼50 km to the north of the Elko Formation depocenter (Fig. 1B). Similarly fossiliferous but unnamed strata equivalent to the Dead Horse Formation also occur in the nearby Bull Run Basin (Henry, 2008). Plant fossil-rich strata from both basins contain upland floras that were documented by Axelrod (1966) and provided the first indication that the Cordilleran hinterland had been high in elevation. Coarse conglomeratic strata of the overlying Oligocene Meadow Formation contain clasts derived from nearby crystalline basement rocks in the footwall of de-\ntachment fault (Rahl et al., 2002). The Miocene Humboldt Formation unconformably overlies Eocene strata regionally and contains clasts derived from the lower plate of the Ruby Mountains metamorphic core complex. Humboldt Formation strata locally exceed 2 km in thickness, and fill basins formed by late Cenozoic normal faulting across northeast Nevada (Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000; Colgan et al., 2010; Lund Snee et al., 2016).\n3.

    "heading": "3.2. Stable isotope geochemistry",
    "text": "Terrestrial carbonate stable isotope values provide important records of uplift (Garzione et al., 2000), but are often complicated by evapotranspiration (Jasechko et al., 2013), seasonal bias of soilformed carbonates (Quade et al., 2013), and alteration (Morrill and Koch, 2002). Hydrogen isotope ratios of hydrated volcanic glass (δDglass) sampled within ash beds and ignimbrites are used here to assess the degree of evaporation of lacustrine waters. Because these units blanket the paleolandscape or fill entire fluvial valleys, the δDglass method is uniquely capable of measuring δD val-\nues of ancient waters across multiple depositional environments synchronously. δDglass values from dated ash beds show profound systematic differences between lacustrine and non-lacustrine environments (Cassel and Breecker, 2017), which likely reflects the isotopic fractionation of lacustrine waters during evaporation, a process that enriches deuterium in the residual liquid (e.g., Craig et al., 1963; Cappa et al., 2003).\nHydrated volcanic glass over 104 years old can be used to reconstruct changes in the δD values of meteoric waters on geologic timescales (Cassel and Breecker, 2017). Freshly erupted volcanic glass hydrates with ambient water within 103–104 years after deposition (Anovitz et al., 2009; Cerling et al., 1985; Friedman et al., 1993). This process includes a series of reactions at the solutionglass interface, over which hydration rates slow by at least six orders of magnitude, and a subsequent structural transformation within the glass that increases the long-term chemical durability and significantly limits further isotopic exchange (cf. Cassel and Breecker, 2017). Separates of >99% pure 70–150 μm volcanic glass shards were isolated from bulk samples following the methods described in Cassel and Breecker (2017) for analysis of all δDglass values reported here. Cassel et al. (2014) reported δD values of ancient hydration waters in volcanic glass for seven ash beds that were dated for this study. Eight new δD values, means of 3–4 replicate analyses, are included in this study (Table 2).\n4. Results\n4.1. 40Ar/39Ar geochronology\nSingle sanidine laser fusions yielded largely concordant age populations for 26 ash beds (Fig. 3), the weighted means of which we interpret to represent the eruptive and depositional age for these beds (Fig. 2A). Six samples yielded older apparent ages which are interpreted to represent contamination by xenocrysts or detrital grains. These analyses were excluded from the age calculations for ash beds when their inclusion in the weighted mean exceeded the Student’s-t MSWD criteria (cf. Smith et al., 2008a; Jicha et al., 2016). A small subset of sanidine from three of the ash beds yielded younger grains, which we interpret to reflect daughter loss, potentially due to weathering. We note that two of the samples measured using the Noblesse single collector yielded subpopulations ∼250 Ka older than the interpreted eruptive age, which were excluded from the weighted mean age. These grains would likely not be considered outliers if analyzed using the MAP 215-50 spectrometer due to its lower resolution, which could result in bias towards ages older than deposition. When considered together with published U–Pb ages (Haynes, 2003) and 40Ar/39Ar ages (see Supplementary Table 3; Brooks et al., 1995; Mueller et al., 1999; Haynes, 2003; Henry, 2008; Henry et al., 2011; Mulch et al., 2015), the new ages make Lake Elko one of the most temporally resolved lake systems on Earth (Fig. 2A), on par with the Green River Formation in the foreland to the east (Smith et al., 2008a). These data indicate that the majority of Elko Formation deposition occurred between 43 Ma and 41 Ma, and was regionally synchronous. During this period, over 20 felsic ash falls and ignimbrites blanketed the landscape. Single crystal 40Ar/39Ar ages for ash horizons in the Piñon Range section show that several of the biotite incremental heating ages of Mulch et al. (2015) underestimate the age of deposition outside of the 2σ confidence limit. This finding is consistent with a daughter-loss-origin of the largely discordant age spectra produced by Elko Formation biotite (Mulch et al., 2015). We have consequently adopted a 100% concordancy criteria (Min et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2008b) for integration of biotite 40Ar/39Ar ages into the chronostratigraphy shown in Fig. 2. We caution against the future use of biotite in timescale-grade 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, particularly when sanidine is available.\nNot shown in Fig. 2 are legacy biotite 40Ar/39Ar ages for the Northeast Nevada Volcanic Field (Brooks et al., 1995), the White Sage Basin (Dubiel et al., 1996), and Copper Basin (Rahl et al., 2002; Henry et al., 2011). These pioneering efforts largely employed incremental heating experiments on large multi-crystal aliquots of biotite, which produced partly discordant plateau ages that could significant errors resulting from integrate inheritance, recoil, and/or daughter-loss (cf. Smith et al., 2008b). The reader is referred to Supplementary Table 3 for more details."

Within this single bed, tephras deposited in lacustrine environments record δDglass values that are 80–102 higher than δDglass values from nearby fluvial deposits (Fig. 4).

    "text": "New 40Ar/39Ar geochronology indicates prolonged ponding of continental drainage and terrestrial sediment accumulation across the Cordilleran hinterland from ca. 49 Ma to 38 Ma in northeast Nevada (Fig. 2). Lacustrine deposition in the Elko Basin began locally before 48.7 Ma, near Coal Mine Canyon (Fig. 1B), coincident with deposition of Bridgerian-aged strata of the Green River Formation in the foreland (Smith et al., 2008a), lacustrine strata of the Challis volcanic field (Janecke and Snee, 1993; Janecke et al., 1999), and the Sheep Pass Formation near Ely, Nevada (Emry, 1990). The thick local succession of lake strata at Coal Mine Canyon suggests that ponding may have continued locally at until ca. 41.2 Ma, which is the age of the eruption of the tuff of Coal Mine Canyon, which caps the succession (Moore et al., 1983; Henry, 2008). Outside the Coal Mine Canyon local depocenter, the earliest dated sediment accumulation in northeast Nevada began at ca. 46 Ma (Haynes, 2003). In most locations, the basal Eocene consists of coarse fluvial strata that occupy a series of paleovalleys, as well as a broad area in the center of the Elko Basin (Fig. 2A). These locally derived sandstones and conglomerates were deposited by paleorivers that drained east away from the Cordilleran divide (Henry, 2008; Henry et al., 2012; Fig. 1A). Beginning at ca. 43.5 Ma, a freshwater lake inundated lowland areas and deposited microbialitic, mollusc-bearing freshwater lacustrine deposits of the ‘cherty limestone’. After ca. 42.8, Lake Elko developed stratified, disoxic bottom waters that favored the accumulation of finely laminated, organic-rich mudstones. Stratification may have been promoted by the occurrence of a chemocline (Renaut and Tiercelin, 1994), which is consistent with evaporative enrichment and the increase in δDglass values at that time. After ca. 40.5 Ma, Lake Elko became progressively filled by voluminous volcanic products erupted from the Tuscarora caldera complex (Henry et al., 2012) and other nearby volcanic centers (Fig. 2A). Thick ignimbrites are intercalated with thin laminated stromatolitic limestone beds in\nthe uppermost Elko Formation, suggesting that Lake Elko remained evaporitic during the final infill of the basin. Stromatolite occurrence could also have been promoted by increased alkalinity and solute concentrations derived from hydrothermal waters that accompanied magmatism (e.g., Lowenstein et al., 2016).\nAfter ca. 40 Ma, following the final infill of Lake Elko, a separate and slightly less evaporative lake formed 50 km to the north in the Copper Basin area. The deposits of this lake overlie a thick succession of ash beds and reworked ash that had accumulated intermittently since ca. 45.2 Ma (Henry, 2008; Supplementary Fig. S1). This lake persisted for at least 1 m.y., and its deposits are overlain by the coarse clastic Oligocene Meadow Fork Formation, which is preserved in the hanging wall of a basement structure (Rahl et al., 2002). Outside of Copper Basin, approximately 20 m.y. of time is missing regionally in northeast Nevada after ca. 37 Ma. This lacuna is represented by the unconformity at the base of the Miocene Humboldt Formation. The Oligocene Meadow Fork Formation and Miocene Humboldt Formation both contain clasts of lower plate crystalline rocks, providing evidence for unroofing of local metamorphic core complexes (Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000; Colgan et al., 2010; Lund Snee et al., 2016)."

    "text": "New 40Ar/39Ar ages permit temporal comparison of stable isotopic proxy records from northeast Nevada (Mulch et al., 2015) to the global marine record for the middle Eocene (Zachos et al., 2008; Sluijs et al., 2013; Fig. 2B). The middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO) is recorded in marine core, and is a significant transient global warming event that interrupts the slow secular decline in global temperature following the early Eocene greenhouse. It straddles the reversed to normal boundary within magnetic polarity chron 18, between ca. 40.2 Ma and ca. 39.8 Ma (Sluijs et al., 2013; Fig. 2C). Mulch et al. (2015) hypothesized that the MECO event is represented by a 14–15 decrease in δ18O values in the upper Elko Formation within the Piñon Range section, however, 40Ar/39Ar geochronology presented here indicates instead that the top of the sampled Piñon Range section predates the MECO by ca. 1 m.y. (Fig. 2). The MECO instead corresponds to either a lacuna, or possibly to deposition of one or more of a series of ignimbrites that overlie the Elko Formation. It is possible that the MECO warming is recorded by δDglass values for the tuff of Nelson Creek, which show the largest difference ( δD = +102 ) between contemporaneous lacustrine and non-lacustrine δDglass values. The age for this bed is ca. 40.45 ± 0.25 Ma (full uncertainties), which overlaps the GPTS-based age for the MECO interval (40.3–39.8 Ma) at the 2σ level.\nδ18O and δ13C values for Elko Formation terrestrial carbonates record substantial variation across the middle Eocene. Mulch et al. (2015) report a −9.3 shift in δ18O values over approximately 4.4 m.y., from ca. 42.2 Ma and ca. 37.8 Ma within the Piñon Range section (Fig. 2). They attributed a significant fraction of this change to regional uplift, with some influence from a cooling global climate. Mulch et al. (2015) also identify a large short-term change of −14.7 in δ18O values from ca. 40.2 to ca. 39.4 Ma (Fig. 2B), which they attribute to changes in both inflow water δ18O values due to regional uplift and a decrease in 18O enrichment due to diminished lake water evaporation. The large systematic variations we observe between lacustrine and terrestrial δDglass values, including variations within a single ignimbrite, however, suggest that caution is advised when using carbonate δ18O values (and glass δD values) from multiple depositional environments to measure surface uplift. This is because the differences in evaporative enrichment within lakes (Abruzzese et al., 2005) and between lacustrine and terrestrial carbonate-forming environments\n(Cassel et al., 2014) could account entirely for the observed isotopic changes. Mulch et al. (2015) interpret high δ18O values as the result of persistent strongly evaporative lake conditions, but do not control for the differences in evaporative enrichment and carbonate-formation temperature within lakes (Abruzzese et al., 2005), or between lacustrine and pedogenic environments (Cassel et al., 2014). The δD value of −102 from lacustrine to fluvial environments within the tuff of Nelson Creek approximates to a δ18O value of −11.5 using the global meteoric water line (GMWL: δD = 8 × δ18O + 10), which is a minimum estimate as most modern lake waters exhibit shallower δD/δ18O slopes than the GMWL (Jasechko et al., 2013). Differences between carbonateforming environments could thus entirely account for the observed change in δ18O values (−9.3 ). We consequently conclude that mid-Cenozoic uplift of northeast Nevada likely occurred after, not during deposition of the Elko Formation. This finding is more consistent with regional late Eocene–Oligocene unconformity, and with δDglass values for late Eocene–Oligocene ash beds across central Nevada, which suggest that regional uplift of less than 1 km occurred by the middle Oligocene, coincident with the southwestward migration of felsic magmatism from northeastern Nevada to that region by ca. 27 Ma (Cassel et al., 2014)."

    "heading": "5.3. Mechanisms for hinterland ponding",
    "text": "Several basin forming mechanisms can be invoked to explain the ponding of continental drainage in hinterlands: (1) subsidence in the hanging wall of a high or low angle normal fault (Janecke et al., 1999; Haynes, 2003); (2) landslide or volcanic damming (Henry, 2008; Maza et al., 2014); (3) regional ponding of drainage by dynamic subsidence at the slab hinge followed by uplift during and after flat slab rollback (Smith et al., 2014); and (4) subsidence above a Rayleigh–Taylor instability at the base of the lithosphere (DeCelles et al., 2015). The spatial extent and longevity of Lake\nElko make it unlikely that ponding resulted from passive infilling due to landslide damming of local paleovalleys (Maza et al., 2014). Though northeast Nevada is now a classic extensional terrain, the Elko Formation lacks evidence for major surface breaking normal faults, growth strata, or coarse-grained footwall-generated alluvium proximal to basin-bounding structures. In contrast, the overlying Humboldt Formation contains well-developed growth strata and coarse alluvium with clasts sourced directly from the footwall (Colgan et al., 2010). These data collectively suggest that normal faulting, if developed at all, did not substantially influence depositional facies in the Elko Basin, and if present must have deviated markedly in style from the widespread, high-angle normal faulting that dominates contemporary Basin and Range extension. Nonetheless, Eocene strata thin internally towards the western edge of the Piñon Range and over the LaMoille paleohigh (Fig. 1B), and thicken towards the western edge of the Ruby Mountains (Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000), suggesting that broader wavelength surface deformation, or at the minimum high-relief paleovalleys, predated the current Basin and Range extensional configuration.\nSyn-metamorphic and syn-plutonic U–Pb ages crystallization ages (Camilleri and Chamberlain, 1997; Colgan et al., 2010; Hallett and Spear, 2015), 40Ar/39Ar mica thermochronology (McGrew and Snee, 1994; Gifford, 2008), and apatite thermochronology (Colgan et al., 2010) provide the primary current constraints on the time– temperature path for rocks that make up the R–EH–W–P metamorphic core complex (Fig. 5). Syn-metamorphic monazite, zircon, and titanite U–Pb ages suggest peak metamorphism occurred between 97 and 77 Ma (Camilleri and Chamberlain, 1997; Hallett and Spear, 2015), at maximum mid-crustal depths of approximately 35–40 km (Hodges et al., 1992; Henry et al., 2011; Hallett and Spear, 2014). Cenozoic plutons with U–Pb ages ranging from 41 to 29 Ma intruded at depths ranging from 5 km to as much as 20 km in the most deeply exhumed parts of the core complex (Wright and Snoke, 1993; McGrew and Snee, 1994; Colgan\net al., 2010). Significantly, Hallett and Spear (2015) report U–Pb ages for Y-rich rims on metamorphic zircons in the East Humboldt Range that range from 40–32 Ma, suggesting regional reheating by Eocene plutonism. The oldest reported muscovite cooling 40Ar/39Ar ages (49.6 ± 3.6 Ma and 44.0 ± 5.3 Ma; Gifford, 2008) for lower plate rocks in the Elko region are from the Wood Hills. However, most mica cooling ages range between 33 and 21 Ma (McGrew and Snee, 1994; Gifford, 2008), with a general trend toward older ages moving east from the western edge of the preserved detachment. Finally, Colgan et al. (2010) reported apatite fission track and (U–Th)/He thermochronology that suggests rapid cooling and uplift of the southern Ruby Mountains from 17 to 10 Ma. These age constraints suggest considerable pre-Eocene advection during Sevier contraction, and indicate that the most rapid exhumation of the R–EH–W–P metamorphic core complex likely occurred after 40 Ma, but extension could have begun as early as 49 Ma. Substantial uncertainty therefore remains over whether associated surface-breaking faults were active during lacustrine sedimentation between 49 and 39 Ma. We envision two end-member scenarios could account for the observed stratigraphic record of ponding and basin formation. We stress that hybrids of the two end members are entirely possible. In scenario 1, ponding coincided with initial motion on the R–EH–W–P metamorphic core complex, whereas in scenario 2, motion began subsequent to plutonism and post-dates Lake Elko (cf. Fig. 5).\nIn scenario 1, Elko Formation strata were deposited atop the active hanging wall of the R–EH–W–P metamorphic core complex detachment (Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000), leading to subsidence and ponding of Lake Elko. This detachment is hypothesized to have originated to the east of the Ruby Mountains near the Pequop Range (Camilleri and Chamberlain, 1997; Fig. 1B), which may explain the absence of locally-sourced Eocene lower plate clastic detritus to the west of the Ruby Mountains. However, clastic detritus sourced from the lower plate is also absent adjacent to the Pequop Range at Nanny Creek (Brooks et al., 1995; Henry et al., 2011).\nAlternately, in scenario 2, metamorphic core complex detachment faulting began after the main phase of lacustrine sedimentation had ended and coincident with local arrival of magmatism. In this scenario, cooling ages older than 41 Ma reflect exhumation of a preexisting partial retention zone formed during middle Eocene plutonism (i.e., Colgan et al., 2010). This scenario is notably most consistent with thermodynamic models for metamorphic core complex formation that stress the importance of heating in lowering crustal viscosity and introducing low density melts (Bendick and Baldwin, 2009). It is therefore important to consider mechanisms other than detachment faulting as important drivers of middle Eocene ponding (cf. Fig. 6): (1) Migrating northeast to southwestward migrating subsidence at the slab hinge followed by post-removal uplift upon intrusion of asthenosphere could have dammed streams that flowed east to the foreland, and provides a driver for the observed stratigraphic succession of ponding, volcanism, and regional unconformity. This pattern is similar to the early Eocene succession in the Laramide foreland that Smith et al. (2014) attributed to Farallon slab removal, where eclogite formation in the flat slab is thought to have driven its removal (Humphreys, 2009), and induced dynamic subsidence above the slab hinge (O’Driscoll et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2014). Eclogitization of the slab in such settings is favored by heating (Gutscher et al., 2000; van Hunen et al., 2002), and would thus be self-sustaining as hot asthenosphere advected into the space vacated by the detaching slab. Following slab removal, hydrated North American mantle lithosphere would have come in contact with hot asthenosphere, triggering isostatic surface uplift (Jones et al., 2015), melting, and magmatism (Best et al., 2009) which acted to induce regional ponding by blocking northeast-flowing rivers (i.e., Smith et al., 2014). (2) At\na more local scale, intrusions of felsic magmas could have caused isostatic surface uplift (Perkins et al., 2016) and aggradational volcanic topography, which could also have acted to block northeastflowing rivers and cause ponding. Finally, (3) slab removal would have generated space and induced heating and melt generation that would have favor the occurrence of Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities, or ‘drips’ of eclogitized lithosphere. Drips are promoted by the formation of dense eclogitic restite due to melt generation and migration from the mantle lithosphere (Ducea, 2001; DeCelles et al., 2009), and could have provided the dynamic impetus for the 50–100 km-radius symmetrical bullseye of subsidence and lake formation (Göğüş and Pysklywec, 2008; Jones et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015), moreover, drip removal would have been accompanied by rapid uplift and unconformity. The Elko Formation\nshares many characteristics with strata of the Arizaro Basin of Argentina, which has been attributed to a drip from the base of the South American lithosphere by DeCelles et al. (2015). These characteristics include local onlap of paleovalleys incised into deformed hinterland crust, a generally symmetrical aerial distribution of basin fill, and a lack of coarse alluvium proximal to clear basinbounding structures. Drips may reflect the beginning stages of regional mantle lithosphere delamination that has been proposed for the Basin and Range province during the mid-Cenozoic (Porter et al., 2016), and may have coincided closely in time and space with removal of the underlying flat slab as is depicted in Fig. 6. Following drip removal, abrupt localized increases in lithospheric buoyancy could have acted to initiate metamorphic core complex formation, which may help explain the spatial coincidence of lake basins and metamorphic core complexes across the North American Cordilleran hinterland (Fig. 1A)."

    "heading": "6. Conclusions",
    "text": "New 40Ar/39Ar ages constrain the Elko Formation and related strata to ca. 49–38 Ma, making it one of the most well-dated lake deposits on Earth. Isolated lakes formed in northeast Nevada prior to ca. 48.7 Ma in the Coal Mine Canyon area. Regional deposition of freshwater lithofacies in the broader Elko Basin began at ca. 43.5 Ma, and was followed by lake expansion and increasingly saline and alkaline conditions at ca. 42.8 Ma, which resulted in the deposition of organic-rich mudstones across the basin. By ca. 41 Ma, an increasingly evaporitic, stromatolitic Lake Elko frequently received large volumes of volcanic ash and ignimbrites from local sources. Elko Formation accumulation ceased by ca. 40 Ma, reflecting final infill of Lake Elko. δDglass values from tephras within the Elko Formation vary systematically with environment of deposition, with significant enrichment of deuterium in lacustrine versus non-lacustrine settings. δDglass values and geochronology together show that the locus of highest evaporation migrated from south to north from Lake Elko at ca. 41 Ma to a smaller Copper Basin lake by ca. 38 Ma. The Elko Formation likely does not encompass the MECO, but this global warming event may be recorded in the ca. 40.45 ± 0.25 Ma tuff of Nelson Creek. Samples of the tuff taken from lacustrine strata have δDglass values that are 80–102 higher than the δDglass values of samples of the tuff taken from fluvial deposits, reflecting a difference in δD values between evaporated lake waters and precipitation-derived waters. Highly varying δ18O values in the Piñon Range section likely reflect differences in the amount of evaporation and carbonate-formation temperatures between carbonates formed in evaporative lakes, freshwater lakes, and pedogenic environments. Measured maximum Dglass differences between lacustrine and non-lacustrine ash beds would translate to a 18O of 11.5 using the GMWL, which could account for the entirety of the δ18O shift attributed to surface uplift by Mulch et al. (2015). An absence of an uplift signature during the middle Eocene is consistent with the observation by Cassel et al. (2014) that the highest paleoelevations recorded in ignimbrites southwest of the Elko Basin occurred during the Oligocene, subsequent to Elko Formation deposition. The lacustrine portion of the Dead Horse Formation was deposited between ca. 40 Ma and ca. 39 Ma, and marks the final Paleogene lacustrine accumulation in the region. The Eocene lacustrine succession in northeast Nevada is overlain by Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic facies and isolated locally derived siliciclastic facies. These strata are regionally overlain by an unconformity at the base of the Miocene Humboldt Formation which represents a lacuna of ∼20 m.y. We interpret the overall progression of Elko Basin paleoenvironments from alluvial to freshwater lacustrine to saline lacustrine, followed by high volumes of volcanic infill, and then non-deposition to\nreflect to surface subsidence during ecologitization of the Farallon slab and uplift and magmatism subsequent to slab removal. Drainage disruption and ponding of surface waters likely resulted from one or more slab removal-related processes: 1) migrating surface uplift associated with slab removal; 2) thermal and isostatic uplift caused by felsic magmatism; 3) early detachment faulting associated with core complex exhumation; 4) dynamic subsidence triggered by Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities or initial delamination of the mantle lithosphere following slab removal and heating; or 5) some combination of these processes. Further, the spatial coincidence of lake basins with metamorphic core complexes across the North American Cordilleran hinterland may reflect a genetic link between removal of mantle lithosphere by drips and delamination and the initiation of metamorphic core complexes."
