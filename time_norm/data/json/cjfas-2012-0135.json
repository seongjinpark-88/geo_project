    "text": "Résumé : La géologie quaternaire dynamique de la ceinture de feu du Pacifique est à l'origine d'importants défis sur le plan biogéographique. Le cycle biologique des poissons et la variabilité génétique de leurs populations ont été modelés par les changements climatiques, la formation et le retrait répétés de calottes glaciaires, les variations du niveau de la mer, le volcanisme et la tectonique, le relèvement isostatique et, aujourd'hui, l'activité humaine. S'il est largement admis que, chez le saumon quinnat (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), l'évolution parallèle et la plasticité phénotypique ont masqué des patrons de ségrégation des cycles biologiques en fonction de la lignée évolutionnaire à la grandeur de l'aire de répartition, la notion des lignées comme telles persiste toutefois. Nous avons employé un grand ensemble de données de microsatellites normalisées à l'échelle internationale pour explorer la structure des populations à l'échelle de la côte et vérifier s'il y a présence de deux lignées divergentes, reliées ou non au cycle biologique. Nous avons trouvé au moins 27 lignées distinctes. Toutefois, les relations entre groupes étaient mal résolues, définissant essentiellement une phylogénie en forme d'étoile. Nous avons observé un isolement par la distance répandu parmi les groupes qui complique l'analyse topologique. Une bifurcation génétique marquée n'a été observée que dans la partie intérieure du fleuve Columbia (à l'est desmonts Cascade), ce qui appuie tant l'hypothèse de la présence de deux lignées que celle d'une ségrégation des cycles biologiques. Cette perspective facilite le rapprochement d'opinions divergentes concernant la phylogéographie et la répartition des cycles biologiques du saumon quinnat. [Traduit par la Rédaction]"

    "text": "The Quaternary zoogeography of the west coast of North America is especially complicated by the volatile earth history of this region. In particular, euryhaline species such as salmonids, sticklebacks, and others often show complex patterns of morphological and life-history variation that is influenced by selective pressures and historical contingencies as well as phenotypic plasticity and parallel evolution (Taylor et al. 1996; McCusker et al. 2000; Johnson and Taylor 2004). Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) population structure is often characterized as a primary dichotomy between “stream-type” and “ocean-type” life histories (Gilbert 1912, 1922) that were once thought to represent\ndistinct “lineages” or evolutionary “races” (Healey 1983, 1991). It is now widely recognized that this pattern of strict segregation of life-history types with distinct genetic lineage is substantially confounded by parallel evolution and phenotypic plasticity (Waples et al. 2004; Beacham et al. 2006). Fish with stream-type life history generally rear in freshwater streams, undergo smoltification as yearlings, and quickly migrate to sea. By contrast, ocean-type fish migrate downstream almost immediately as subyearling fry or parr but spend an extended period in estuarine habitats. Streamtype fish have an early adult return migration for semelparous spawning (spring or summer run), whereas ocean-type fish return later, in late summer or fall.

For a long time, adult return (or spawn time) was considered synonymous with lineage or race (Mason 1965). Healey (1991) synthesized juvenile and adult life histories to develop a new racial model; stream types were derived from a northern glacial refuge, and ocean types were from a southern refuge. Healey's (1991) inferred contact zone was at latitude 56°N. He also inferred from low harvest rates that the stream-type lineage exhibits a distinct, offshore marine migration (Myers et al. 1987; Trudel et al. 2009; Weitkamp 2010).\nMyers et al. (1998) analyzed Chinook salmon allozyme data from California to western Alaska; the results seemed to support Healey's racialmodel, and subsequent genetic studies supported a genetic dichotomy in British Columbia (Teel et al. 2000; Beacham et al. 2003) and in the Columbia River (Rasmussen et al. 2003; Waples et al. 2004; Narum et al. 2004, 2010). Despite support for two principal lineages, frequent parallel evolution of life history complicated the Healey (1991) hypothesis and led Myers et al. (1998) and Waples et al. (2004) to offer a refinement that emphasized different scales of evolutionary divergence. Their interpretation was strongly driven by the compelling distinctiveness of sympatric lineages in the interior Columbia Basin. The southern– coastal lineage and the northern–interior lineage of Healey (1991) were each thought to have an ancestral predisposition for lifehistory type, but with frequent parallel evolution of adult return time and juvenile outmigration, especially in the southern– coastal lineage. In this view, stream-type and ocean-type represented evolutionary lineages, irrespective of life history of individuals and populations, which might exhibit phenotypic plasticity, parallel evolution, or population-level polymorphism. Despite other examples of life-history parallelism in fishes (Reznick et al. 1996; Colosimo et al. 2005; Duponchelle et al. 2008), many salmon biologists did not adopt the lineage definition of Waples et al. (2004), and most continue to use the terms as life-history descriptors (Buchanan et al. 2009; Copeland and Venditti 2009; MacFarlane 2010), irrespective of geography or genetic affiliation, often citing both Healey (1991) and Waples et al. (2004). Waples et al. (2004) maintained that Chinook salmon were characterized by two (or a few) genetically discrete and distinct lineages, and that idea persists in research and management, particularly in the USA (e.g., “Two distinct types or races among Chinook salmon have evolved.”; NOAAOffice of ProtectedResources, http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/ pr/species/fish/chinooksalmon.htm).\nWaples et al. (2004) found support for Healey's ocean-type – stream-type hypothesis in the interior Columbia Basin, and to a lesser extent the Fraser River, but the authors were less clear about more northern populations. In addition to abundant parallelism, they suggested that on a broader geographic scale, Healey's hypothesis was further complicated for four principal reasons: (i) the extremely divergent upper Willamette River populations suggest that Healey's hypothesis of only two major lineages might be too simplistic, (ii) the genetic affinity between interior Columbia and interior Fraser populations is not as strong as would be predicted assuming a common origin for all streamtype populations, (iii) interior Fraser populations are not as strongly separated genetically from other Chinook salmon in British Columbia as are the stream- and ocean-type populations in the interior Columbia, and (iv) Healey did not include the full range of life-history diversity within the ocean-type populations. Waples et al. (2004) assumed ocean- and stream-type populations derive from separate lineages, perhaps — but not necessarily — related\nto northern and southern glacial refugia (p. 395). Explanation of their results suggested they viewed the lineages as a deep evolutionary feature of Chinook salmon related to range-wide biogeography and postglacial recolonization.\nBeacham et al. (2006) suggested a minimum of two refugia, northern and southern, during the last glaciation, but were referring to Beringia, represented by contemporary populations in the Yukon and the Northern Gulf Coast of Southeast Alaska, versus all populations to the south, including those of the interior Fraser and Columbia basins. They also speculated that existing populations in southeast Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington might be derived primarily from the southern Columbia River refuge, with perhaps some contribution from a coastal British Columbia refuge.\nVarious scenarios have been proposed for two or three principal refugia that might coincide with two or a few major lineages in Chinook salmon. In the current study we address three principal questions: (i) What are the most divergent genetic groupings supported by currently available genetic data? (ii) How do the divergent lineages observed in the Columbia River relate to broader geographic diversity in Chinook salmon? Specifically, how do those populations relate to those of the Fraser River, Central British Columbia, and Southeast Alaska? (iii) Finally, what phylogeographic inferences can be drawn, and what are the limitations? We consider life-history variation in the context of potential predisposition of ancestral lineages that might have arisen from glacial refugia (Waples et al. 2004); however, we recognize parallel evolution and phenotypic plasticity (Beacham et al. 2006) and focus instead on the lineages themselves. Our goal is to provide a framework for understanding patterns of population genetic structure and life-history variation in Chinook salmon with the hope of eventually connecting those patterns with the specific processes that shaped them."

    "text": "Sample collections, shared data, and quality control The genotypic data analyzed here came from multiple laboratories and included both previously published (Beacham et al. 2006; Seeb et al. 2007; Narum et al. 2007b, 2008, 2010) and unpublished data. Our ability to combine these data sets and thus conduct a broader and more geographically balanced analysis than would otherwise be possible is based on the use of standardized markers and allele nomenclature adopted by all the contributing laboratories (Moran et al. 2006; Seeb et al. 2007).\nTissue samples were taken in a variety of ways and included wild adults and juveniles, as well as hatchery brood stocks. We originally examined 302 collections representing 168 sites (putative populations) within 45 regions or previously recognized lineages (Seeb et al. 2007). Our final analyses omitted somemixedorigin hatchery stocks. Ultimately, we examined 19 679 individual fish distributed among 280 collections from 144 sites and 45 regions–lineages (“Regions” hereafter; Fig. 1; Table 1). In most cases, these represent distinct geographic regions; however, in a few cases, distinct genetic groups overlap in distribution, such as the mid- and upper Columbia spring run and interior Columbia Basin late-summer – fall run. In general, sample sizes from each location were greater than 100 individuals (mean 130.5, standard deviation 44.9) and typically included multiple temporal replicates taken in different years between 1985 and 2005.\nWe employed 13 microsatellite loci (Table 2) and the same convention for standardization of genotypic data used by the Genetic Analysis of Pacific Salmonids (GAPS) Consortium (Seeb et al. 2007). The data analyzed here are part of what is now a larger data set used by the GAPS collaborators and regional fishery management agencies for a diverse range of applications, including identification of conservation units, stock-specific harvest impacts, habitat use, predation, and migration. Previous analyses of these micro-\n416 Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. Vol. 70, 2013\nPublished by NRC Research Press\nC an\n. J . F\nis h.\nA qu\nat . S\nci .

Nevertheless, we took several measures to evaluate data quality and test for violations of population genetic assumptions.\nQuality assurance and quality control (QA–QC) of interagency data are detailed in Moran et al. (2006). The current study also included independent QA–QC testing of the combined data set. For example, replicate population samples, taken in different years, were pooled for all the analyses presented here, though we tested the assumption that replicates came from single populations (data not shown). In addition to tests for departures from HWC genotypic expectations, we tested for evidence of genotypic disequilibrium (GD, or compound linkage disequilibrium; Weir 1979) and potential genetic linkage among loci. These tests were done by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods described by Guo and Thompson (1992) and implemented in the program GENEPOP (Raymond and Rousset 1995). We also tested for departures from neutral expectation (loci potentially under selection) by using the FST outlier method of Beaumont and Nichols (1996) as implemented in the software application Lositan (Antao et al. 2008). We removed one locus, OtsG474, from our final data set because of an extreme departure from neutral expectation (most analyses were carried out with and without OtsG474). We used a simulated Fisher's exact test (Raymond and Rousset 1995) of allele-frequency differences between all pairs of collections and sites. Finally, a leave-one-individual-out jackknife pro-\ncedure (MCMC in the ONCOR software package; Kalinowski 2007) was used to evaluate population and regional self-assignment and to identify potential sample quality problems. These procedures provided basic biological information at the same time that they tested for potential laboratory or sampling errors.\nRegions, lineages, and the distribution of genetic diversity To examine population genetic structure and diversity in the context of life-history variation and latitude, we used Weir and Cockerham's (1984) FST estimator, ST, and Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards's (CSE) chord distance (Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards 1967) estimated with the programs FSTAT (Goudet 2001) and PHYLIP (Felsenstein 2005), respectively. Many analyses were conducted usingmultiplemetrics that were found to produce similar results. For reporting purposes, and to allow comparisons, it was essential to be consistentwith previous studies. For example, FST is typically used for isolation by distance (IBD), whereas CSE chord distance is commonly used for cluster analysis. A fundamental problem is to pick an appropriate metric for both fine-scale and higher-order relationships. A mutationally explicit metric for microsatellite loci, such as RST, might be more appropriate for higher order relationships (Goldstein et al. 1995). However, the GAPS allele nomenclature is not consistent with an inferred repeat unit increment for all loci, and in some cases imperfect repeats preclude any repeat-unit inference (see Seeb et al. 2007). For these reasons, and because genotypic data were obtained from multiple laboratories, it was essentially impossible to confidently calculate ametric that incorporated repeat-unit information (Moran et al. 2005). We also applied the G ′ST metric, which effectively normalizes disparate heterozygosities, relative to the untransformed GST (multilocus FST). Although the shape of the curve changed slightly, the overall pattern of IBD was similar (data not shown). For that reason, and because of recent caveats (Meirmans and Hedrick 2011) and criticism regarding the use of G ′ST (Whitlock 2011), we opted for the more traditional and more widely used FST approach. Again, we applied a variety of alternativemetrics with no effect on our central conclusions.\nMultivariate clustering and ordinationwere used for evaluation of barriers to gene flow and IBD. Diversity within sites was estimated as expected heterozygosity (HS). The model-based clusteringmethod in STRUCTURE version 2.3.2 (Pritchard et al. 2000) was used to estimate the minimum number of clusters represented. Five replicates were run for each iteration of K = 1 to K = 21, the estimated log-likelihoods [ln(PrK)] averaged, and K calculated using the method of Evanno et al. (2005) to determine the most likely value of K. STRUCTUREwas designed to sort individuals into populations rather than into groups of populations or lineages (Kalinowski 2010). Nevertheless, there is heuristic appeal to the notion that if the two-lineage patternwere a dominant element of Chinook salmon population structure, then STRUCTURE would probably reveal that pattern. To display STRUCTURE results on a map, ArcMap GIS software (ESRI) was used to perform inversedistance-weighted interpolation with the Geostatistical Analyst extension. Every pixel represents an average of the cluster 1 Q values (STRUCTURE analysis where K = 2) from a minimum of 10 individuals and maximum of 15 individuals within the standard search neighborhood.We used a default option of power = 2, which controls the influence of known values on the interpolated values.We classified interpolated Q values into three categories of assignment to cluster 1 (0%–30%, >30%–70%, and >70%–100%). We then color-coded these categories to visualize underlying data from individual populations on our interpolated map. This analysis represents an heuristicmethod for identifying genetic discontinuities by displaying the geographical distribution of inferred ancestry. We compared the model-based clustering results with estimates of K from 26 distance-based clustering methods (estimates based on the first 10 principle component axes extracted from microsatellite allele frequencies and implemented in the\nFig. 1.

Monmonier's (1973) algorithm, implemented in the Barriers computer program (Manni et al. 2004), used Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi tessellation to infer geographic boundaries, in this case, barriers to gene flow (expressed as the first principle coordinate axis derived from pairwise transformed FST estimates). Landscape connectivity and IBD were explored by plotting FST against waterway distance. We then tested for statistical significance with Kendall's rank correlation coefficient ( ) as implemented in the R statistical package. In contrast with the IBD analysis, Monmonier's algorithmwas unconstrained by waterway paths, potentially revealing prehistoric drainage capture. Monmonier's algorithm infers putative barriers to gene flow by identifying larger-than-expected allele-frequency differences over smaller-than-expected geographic distances (Monmonier 1973). As an alternative ordination procedure, we performed a factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) on the allele-frequency data by using the program GENETIX version 4.03 (Belkhir et al. 2004). Finally, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA, implemented in the software package Arlequin; Excoffier et al. 1992; Excoffier and Lischer 2010) was used to quantify the proportion of variance explained by dividing our samples into two groups based on latitude (56°N), on model-based clustering, and on neighbor-joining analysis. Statistical significance for AMOVA was evaluated by permutation."

    "text": "Quality control studies conducted on an earlier version of the GAPS baseline showed interlaboratory genotyping concordance greater than 0.95 (on average, across all labs and loci, fewer than five scored alleles in 100 differed between laboratories; Seeb et al. 2007). Detailed explanations can be found in Moran et al. (2006) for the QA–QC procedures in individual laboratories and the errors that were observed in blind genotyping tests across laboratories.\nThe loci examined here exhibited between 9 and 71 alleles each (Ots9 and Omm1080, respectively), with a mean of 37.7 alleles per locus (Table 2) and heterozygosities ranging from 0.526 (OtsG474) to 0.946 (Omm1080), with a mean of 0.840. Most pairwise allelefrequency differences between sites were highly significant.\nThose that were not were generally between sites within a river basin (data not shown). This gave us confidence in pooling collections within sites. Significant departures from expected HWC genotypic proportions were observed (uncorrected = 0.05), but for the most part, those departures were broadly distributed among loci and sites. They also represented both heterozygote excesses and deficits (See Table 1 for FIS estimates for all sites), but many more deficits were observed than excesses (40/144 deficits versus 4/144 excesses). We attribute these heterozygote deficits primarily to null alleles and upper allele dropout, the effects of which are commonly observed in microsatellite data sets. This view is supported by the regional distribution of HWC departures, for example, Omy1080 in Northern Oregon Coast sites and Ssa408 on the North Gulf Coast, in southern Southeast (SSE) Alaska, and the Taku River. Despite potential problem loci such as Omy1080, Ssa408, and to a lesser extent, Oki100, we elected not to eliminate any loci due to HWC departures.\nWe also observed some nonrandom segregation of genotypes. Approximately one-third of our sample sites (42/144) exhibited significant GD for one or more pairs of loci. The number of locus pairs per collection site showing GD ranged from 0 to 49 (Table 1). Individual pairs of loci exhibited disequilibrium at between 0 (several pairs of loci) and 22 (Ots201 and Ots208) sample sites. The samples examined here were not collected with the present study inmind and likely varied substantially in howwell they represent all of the individuals and families returning to each site. Because of this limitation and the numerous possible causes for GD, it is not possible for us to make biological inferences based on this result. Nevertheless, finer-scale population studies have examined these same loci and not found evidence of substantial GD (Narum et al. 2008; Smith and Engle 2011), and in the current study, we did not observe patterns in the GD tests that compelled us to remove loci (no apparent linkage) or sample sites (no obvious family effects) from subsequent analyses.\nNeutrality testing among populations suggested that OtsG474 departed significantly from neutral expectation, exhibiting the highest FST (0.202) and the lowest heterozygosity (0.507) of any locus examined. Indeed, the 156 allele at OtsG474 had an estimated FST substantially higher than any other single allele in the study (0.302). Modeling of FST and heterozygosity (Beaumont and Nichols 1996) showed this difference to be highly significant (P< 4 × 10−6), and OtsG474was omitted from further analyses. Ogo2 and Ogo4 were also found to depart from neutrality (P = 1.7 × 10−3 and 1.6 × 10−3, respectively), but were much less extreme than OtsG474, consistent with results of Narum et al. (2008). Neither did Ogo2 and Ogo4 show extreme FST values for individual alleles, and so they were retained.\nDiversity within populations (HS) showed a general decline with increasing latitude, but was slightly bimodal. Results suggested a primary peak at 46°N and another at 56°N (Fig. 2). The latter is driven by relatively high diversity estimates in SSE Alaska populations (Keta and Chickamin rivers and Clear and Cripple creeks, SSE Alaska, Group 4). The southerly peak in diversity derives primarily from three regions: the Washington Coast, the Whidbey Basin in northern Puget Sound, and to a lesser extent, the interior Columbia River late-summer and fall populations. These peaks in diversity did not seem correlated with population boundaries nor to patterns of connectivity at either regional or coast-wide scales (see results for neighbor-joining and Monmonier's analyses below).\nWe observed strong genetic IBD, despite considerable variance in that relationship (Fig. 3; Kendall's = 0.3052, P < 2.2 × 10−16). Genetic similarity decreased quickly with distance, but attenuated between 500 and 1000 km. By about 2000 km, pairwise FST nearly stabilized at 0.1 but continued to increase all the way up to the maximum distances observed in this study, over 11 300 km (from Central Valley, California, to the Yukon; FST = 0.193).\nTable 2.

Previous studies showed similar results, and although they tended to identify the same terminal clusters with high bootstrap support, they sometimes showed substantially different branching order in basal nodes (Fig. 5). The pattern revealed was consistent with the IBD described above. In general, geographically proximate groups of sites clustered together in the neighbor-joining dendrogram. Themost noteworthy exception to this pattern was the near complete genetic isolation of sympatric interior Columbia Basin spring- and early-summerrun (Group 14) versus late-summer- and fall-run populations (Group 21). FCA results might be interpreted as showing two groups separated along FC axis 1, one north and one south, with central populations that are intermediate (Supplemental Appendix S21). Alternatively, one might infer three groups, one north, one interior that includes a few northern populations, and one south. In both cases, Central British Columbia Coast, South British Columbia Mainland, and Lower Fraser are intermediate, as are other populations (central to both axes of the FCA plot, Supplemental Appendix S21).\nIn results of sequential model-based cluster analysis (Evanno et al. 2005), the mean ln(Pr(X/K)) continued to increase steeply with increasing K, reaching an apparent plateau at approximately K = 11 (Supplemental Appendix S31). However, the second-order derivative of that curve ( K) supported an estimate of K = 2, with additional peaks at 11, 14, and 17, and a huge peak at 19, although the variance becomes quite large at that point. When proportional membership (Q) values from model-based clustering (STRUCTURE) were plotted for individuals in populations and genetic groups (where K = 2), there appeared to be a northern group of populations with similar Q values that transitioned into a southern group and extended from southern British Columbia to California (Fig. 6 and 7). Sites in southern British Columbia and the lower Fraser River were intermediate in Q value. General concordance between these results from model-based clustering and\nthe FCA plot (Supplemental Appendix S21) could be observed in the way that populations with intermediate proportional membership (Q values between 30% and 70% cluster 1) were found in an intermediate region of the FCA plot. Populations with Q values at the extreme ranges (0%–30% and 70%–100%) were found in separate FCA clusters. This level of concordance was not observed between results from model-based clustering and the neighborjoining cluster analysis (Fig. 4). Populations with similar Q values often lacked cohesiveness in the tree; however, Q values were generally similar within regions. Distance-based clustering indices gave a wide variety of estimates of minimum K. Of 26 population-level clustering indices, 9 estimated K = 2, whereas 11 estimated more than 20 distinct clusters.\n1Supplementary data are available with the article through the journal Web site at http://nrcresearchpress.com/doi/suppl/10.1139/cjfas-2012-0135.\nFig. 2.

Instead it revealed barriers that correlated with sites, regions, and groups distributed throughout the range examined here (Table 1). The first two barriers, a and b, distinguished Sacramento winter run (Region 43) and Birkenhead Hatchery (Region 21), respectively (Fig. 8). Barrier c, the strongest barrier that separated groups of populations, united the Yukon–Gulf Coast populations (Group 1) and separated them from all other populations to the south. Barrier d distinguished Interior Colum-\nbia Basin spring and early-summer populations (Group 14) from all others, including interior Fraser. Barrier e distinguished the single population King Salmon River in northern Southeast Alaska, and f separated the lower Thompson River (Region 20) from the other Thompson and Fraser River populations. Barrier g isolated Central Valley California fall and spring populations (Group 27) from all others. Barrier h ran down the center of Vancouver Island (separating Group 9 from Group 10), continued south between the Puget Sound (Group 16) and the lower Columbia River (West Cascade Groups 19 and 20), then formed a loop to unite Cle Elum Hatchery (Site 98) and Wenatchee River spring (Site 97). Barrier i separated the Interior Fraser – Thompson (Group 11) from coastal populations, and barrier j, the 10th and final barrier possible with this software implementation, separated Keta River (Site 15) from other sites in Southeast Alaska. It is worth noting that gaps in sampling in the presence of IBD might result in spurious barriers, but not likely false negative results (Manni et al. 2004; e.g., failure to detect the most significant postglacial contact zones).\nMonmonier's and neighbor-joining did, in some cases, reveal genetic differences between life-history types at the smaller geographic scale of individual river basins or localized regions (spring-run versus fall-run populations in Puget Sound, Central Valley California, or lower Columbia River), but did not support deep genetic divisions nor persistent reproductive isolation that might indicate lineages or races such as those seen when comparing interior Columbia River spring-run versus fall-run populations (Narum et al. 2007a). Even if the two groups suggested by model-based clustering (STRUCTURE) represent biologically relevant entities, it is more difficult to infer a deep evolutionary division consistent with “lineages” or “races” (Kalinowski 2010). Moreover, all populations showed a degree of mixed ancestry, consistent with the dominant pattern of IBD. Finally, AMOVA showed that our 27-group model (Fig. 4) described more than two and a half times the variation (4.32%) as that explained by the two-lineage STRUCTURE model (1.56%) or a two-lineage, latitude 56°N model (1.66%)."

    "text": "We found both mutual support as well as contradiction among different methods used to evaluate the genetic structure of Chinook salmon of the west coast of North America. We also found important caveats related to IBD, clustering, and local adaptation. Model-based cluster analysis agreed with neighbor joining (distance-based clustering) in that population Q values were generally similar within the genetic and regional groups that were identified by neighbor-joining and bootstrap analysis. Moreover, all individuals showed a degree of shared ancestry, consistent with IBD. Methods differed, however, with respect to one of our central questions about the number of ancestral lineages that best characterize Chinook salmon and how those lineages were distributed on the landscape. Model-based clustering (STRUCTURE) showed a bimodal distribution of Q values, and K supported two clusters. However, neighbor-joining and Monmonier's analysis conflicted fundamentally with that result. The dendrogram showed no long or well-supported internal branches, and previous studies estimated different sister group relationships among regions. Puget Sound and West Cascade populations were intermediate in Q value (0.3–0.7), yet clustered with other populations in their respective regions and showed high bootstrap support, that is, they were not intermediate in fitted neighborjoining chord distance. Monmonier's triangulation–tessellation analysis also failed to support two divergent lineages except perhaps the Beringian versus Pacific coastal populations (third predicted barrier and the first-order barrier to separate groups of populations). That putative contact zone is in Southeast Alaska,\nFig. 5. Stylized dendrograms depicting genetic relationships among Chinook salmon populations revealed in previous studies as\ncompared with the current study. Different studies tended to identify the same, well-supported terminal clusters. However, branching order among those groups differed among studies and bootstrap values were low on basal nodes.\n11\n01\n02 06\nW Cascades 19/20\nW Cascades 19/20\nW Cascades 19/20\nNass 03/04/05\n02/04\n428 Can.

This Beringian contact zone is a pattern widely observed in fishes of the west coast (McPhail and Lindsey 1986), including sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, Withler 1985; Wood et al. 1994; Bickham et al. 1995), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kitsuch) Small et al. 1998; Smith et al. 2001), and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, McCusker et al. 2000), as well as Chinook salmon (Gharrett et al. 1987; Guthrie and Wilmont 2004). Gharrett et al. (1987) speculated whether genetic similarity in the Yukon and Southeast Alaska was due to colonization of the Yukon from the Gulf Coast and Southeast Alaska or vice versa. Our results showed both similar allele frequencies and patterns of depressed diversity that suggested a small Beringian clade might have been isolated and then later invaded Southeast Alaska through Holocene river capture (see Gharrett et al.'s 1987 figure 3 and associated references).\nBeacham et al. (2006) hypothesized that Chinook salmonmight have had multiple southern refugia (i.e., coastal British Columbia), similar to the scenario Wood et al. (1994) proposed for sockeye salmon. The location and structure of putative coastal refugia is less clear than for Beringia, but the preponderance of evidence from multiple sources, including results of our study, makes the existence of such a refuge nearly indisputable. Parts of Haida Gwaii and Vancouver Island were thought to be ice-free at the height of the Fraser Glaciation and provided refuge for plants (Pojar 1980;Warner et al. 1982) and at least some freshwater fishes (McPhail and Carveth 1992). It seems likely that the genetic complexity and diversity observed in our Southeast Alaska and British Columbia Coast populations are best explained by multiple\ncoastal refugia. This interpretation would be consistent with suggestions of numerous other studies in species such as sockeye salmon (Wood et al. 1994) coho salmon (Small et al. 1998; Smith et al. 2001), rainbow trout (McCusker et al. 2000), as well as Chinook salmon (Beacham et al. 2006; Templin et al. 2011). In contrast, McLean et al. (1999) proposed that eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus) radiated from a single refuge based on low sequence divergence between mtDNA haplotype groups (0.4%) relative to that of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), which dispersed from multiple refugia (0.7%; Bernatchez 1997).\nModel-based clustering and FCA seemed to suggest a contact zone between genetic groups of Chinook salmon populations in Georgia Basin, whereas Monmonier's analysis and neighbor joining suggested a contact zone in the Gulf Coast region of Southeast Alaska. FCA showed a north–south, interior–coastal separation similar to that found with model-based clustering, but the northern group was divided to form a third cluster. Before attempting to reconcile these disparate results, it is important to recognize some caveats. For example, IBD can undoubtedly bias identification of genetic groups (Meirmans 2012) and is a concern for both ordination and clustering. STRUCTURE in particular was shown to produce unpredictable results under IBD. Another important caveat is that STRUCTURE models HWC populations, and its performance with deeper evolutionary lineages can be “pathological” (Kalinowski 2010).\nTemporal scale of phylogeographic processes and life-history divergence\nBeyond genetic modeling, there is even more fundamental uncertainty in our expectations regarding the genetic effects of\nIndividual (Group number)\nP ro\npo rti\non o\nf a nc\nes try\n(Q )\n21 22 23 24 25 26 27\n1.0\n0.6\n0.2\n14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21\n1.0\n0.6\n0.2\n9 10 11 12 13 14\n1.0\n0.6\n0.2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n1.0\n0.6\n0.2\n¯\nPublished by NRC Research Press\nC an\n.

Under the contraction–expansion model of Quaternary biogeography (Hewitt 1996), we expect that (1) the highest diversity should be found in regions that remained ice-free, and (2) the distribution of intraspecific polymorphism in northern regions should be dictated by ice-free refugia and postglacial colonization routes. Implicit in expectation 2 is the notion that divergent lineages will date the glacial periods that caused isolation of different groups in different refugia. However, Taberlet et al. (1998) showed that for many European species, lineages often substantially predate the Pleistocene and the last glacial maximum (see also Aldenhoven et al. 2010). Thus, the structure of divergent lineages is often a simple function of more general coalescent processes rather than Quaternary biogeography and long isolation in glacial refugia.\nThese caveats not withstanding, it seems unlikely that the principal results of any of our analyses can be dismissed as completely artifactual. Instead, we propose that disparate results reveal processes happening at different temporal scales. It might be that some of the patterns we observed are due to pre-Pleistocene processes, followed by IBD and basin–subbasin structure as a result of Pleistocene and Holocene processes, including temporary isolation and postglacial dispersal or differential survival and local adaptation. However, any potential signal there might be from two lineages — whether due to isolation in glacial refugia, simple coalescence, or some other process — has apparently been diminished over much of the range because of subsequent contact and differential mixing (extensive in the Fraser and Central British Columbia, almost nonexistent in the interior Columbia River Basin;Waples et al. 2004). Further, contemporary patterns of gene flow, and perhaps selection and divergence, have resulted in the current pattern of IBD superimposed on basin–subbasin structure. These results suggest that the traditional two-lineagemodel, widely held for Chinook salmon, is less meaningful than the 27-group model we present here. This view of increased diversity\nis further reinforced by the enormous life-history variation that is now evident. Even populations thought to be “fixed” for lifehistory type can exhibit latent or rare life-history variants such as hold-over yearling smolts from interior Columbia fall-run populations (Healey 1991; Connor et al. 2005) and subyearlingmigrants from interior Columbia River spring-run populations (Copeland and Venditti 2009). The success of such alternative strategies might be limited under the current environmental regime (essentially no returning adults in the latter example; Taylor 1990). However, such latent variability could represent an important buffer to environmental change at a larger temporal scale (Slatkin 1974) and could explain the persistence of life-history diversity, despite widespread depression and extirpation of local populations (Gustafson et al. 2007). This diversity also shows differences in the genetic basis of expression. For example, alternative maturation timing, strongly influenced by environment (and probably nonadditive gene-by-environment interaction), is common both within and among Chinook salmon populations (Taylor 1991; Beckman and Dickhoff 1998). Clearly, changing environmental conditions, including anthropogenic change, can alter the selective regime and place constraints on life-history expression (Waples et al. 2004; Crozier et al. 2008) with concomitant loss of diverse ancestral life-history forms (Reimers 1973; Bottom et al. 2005).\nSpatial scale in genetic and phenotypic diversity Chinook salmon life-history types are frequently referred to as “lineages” or “races” in much of the recent literature, which implies the existence of clearly separated, species-wide, ancestral groups. Not coincidentally, these studies almost all focus on interior Columbia River Basin populations, where the Healeymodel is supported by both divergent lineages and strong life-history segregation. Studies outside the interior Columbia use the terms stream type and ocean type to refer to yearling and subyearling juvenile migrants and sometimes relate them to adult return;\nUSA Canada\nLongitude (ºW)\nLa tit\nud e\n(º N\n)\n110\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n115120125130135140145\nN\n2000 km\nPublished by NRC Research Press\nC an\n.

This application of terms is incompatible with the Waples et al. (2004) interpretation ofmarinemigration as a highly conserved trait in the stream-type lineage. In our life-history analysis, only Birkenhead Hatchery in the lower (not interior) Fraser River shares with the interior Columbia spring run the low marine harvest rates that indicate a unique offshore migration pattern (Table 1). Although data are sparse for northern populations, rivers as far north as the Skeena and Nass have marine harvest rates as high as 25%–57%, comparedwith 1% in the interior Columbia spring and early-summer run. Deep evolutionary divergence of just a few lineages is not supported by range-wide genetic data, and extensive life-history diversity within apparent lineages complicates any inference about ancestral predisposition.\nOur results therefore argue strongly against the use of terms “Supra-group” ocean-type and stream-type “lineages” (Waples et al. 2001, I, Section III); even though our results and others (Beacham et al. 2006; Seeb et al. 2007) strongly support the population groupings of Waples et al. (2001). Our most recent compilation of Chinook salmon life-history information (Table 1) reinforces the view that these traits are too plastic or too evolutionarily labile to segregate in a meaningful way with ancestral lineages (Beacham et al. 2006). Agreeing with Utter et al. (1989), however, we do not suggest that genetic differences are lacking between populations that differ in life-history type. We identified many of those differences here, and other work cited above strongly supports such observations at various scales — just not at the broadest, range-wide scale.\nInmore general terms, our results emphasize the importance of spatial scale in sampling to obtain a complete picture of rangewide genetic and phenotypic diversity. Multiple analytical approaches can provide insight into processes acting at different temporal and spatial scales."

    "text": "Glacial events have clearly served to reduce overall molecular genetic diversity across many North American fish species (Bernatchez and Wilson 1998), and our data also suggested reduced intrapopulation diversity in Chinook salmon at the most northern latitudes, consistent with expectation 1 of the contraction–expansion model (Hewitt 1996). However, the high diversity we observed at latitude 46°N, in Whidbey Basin (Group 15), was unexpected, considering this region was covered by more than a kilometre of ice at the height of the Fraser Glaciation (McPhail and Lindsey 1986). Lacking highly diverse potential donor populations, this diversity must be the result of recolonization from multiple sources.\nBiogeographic inference was also complicated by a peak in diversity at 56°N, far to the north of the southern extent of ice sheets at the last glacial maximum. This northern peak in diversity is not consistent with widespread recolonization from the interior Columbia River spring–early-summer-run populations, none of which were particularly diverse themselves (Winans 1989; Narum et al. 2010; the current study, but see Beacham et al. 2006). The interior basins of the Fraser and Columbia rivers must have shared Chinook salmon migrants at some low level, either through former, perhaps early Pleistocene connections (Martin et al. 2010) or via long-distance strays (Ford 1998); however, it is almost certainly not the case that the Fraser Basin and the rest of Cascadia (north to the Stikine River) were extensively recolonized by fish from the upper Columbia, as suggested for most fish species by McPhail and Lindsey (1986). If so, one would expect populations in the Fraser and Thompson rivers (Groups 11 and 12), and in regions further north, to nest within Columbia River populations. Yet much of the genetic data supports the opposite, with all the interior Columbia River spring-run populations nested among groups to the north (Beacham et al. 2006) or at least sister to the Fraser (the current study). It is unclear whether peaks in genetic\ndiversity at latitude 56°N represented the location of a coastal refuge itself or a contact zone between formerly isolated populations. However, even if increased diversity is due to a contact zone, none of our results support the persistence of two deeply divergent genetic lineages coming in contact at latitude 56°N. Monmonier's analysis estimated a barrier farther north, whereas model-based cluster analysis inferred a transition in Q value proportions far to the south, in Georgia Basin.\nIn addition to the historical contingencies of postglacial recolonization and serial demographic bottlenecks, local adaptation and selection almost certainly affect the distribution and structure of these lineages through the success of strays, particularly long-distance strays (Olsen et al. 2010a, 2010b). These forces of demography and selectionmight also drive patterns of postglacial recolonization or confound former patterns of recolonization (Holliday et al. 2010). For example, interior Columbia latesummer–fall populations might also have had access to the Fraser–Thompson along with the spring–early-summer populations, but only the spring–early-summer fish persisted. This would undoubtedly change our impression of directionality of colonization.\nIn addition to the unknown effects of selection and demography, the geologic history of this region is especially complex and dynamic. Waples et al. (2008) reviewed geologic, climatic, and tectonic forces in the Pacific Northwest that have undoubtedly contributed to genetic patterns. Cascadia has experienced repeated catastrophic floods, advance and retreat of continental and grounded, marine ice sheets, isostatic rebound, and changing sea level that profoundly influenced fishes (McPhail and Lindsey 1986). Particularly important were the large proglacial lakes that formed repeatedly and provided the opportunity for invasion and secondary contact among multiple inland river systems throughout Cascadia (McPhail and Lindsey 1986). The lakes themselves might have provided glacial refugia for salmonids. The consequence is that salmon phylogeography is highly susceptible to post hoc hypotheses. There will always be multiple hypothetical explanations for any observed genetic pattern, and although such explanations are often intuitively appealing, they are generally untestable, much like those of the repeated catastrophic events that shaped them (Baker 2002).\nAlthough the Chinook salmon populations of the Interior Columbia Basin spring–early-summer Group 14 (Table 1) were genetically and phenotypically distinct (94% bootstrap support), their ancestral affinities to other Groups were obscured by poor resolution of basal nodes in the dendrogram. Multiple studies show consistent genetic similarities between populations in the interior Columbia River and the Fraser–Thompson River systems; however, bootstrap support is invariably low and sister group relationships vary. In our study, 41.8% of bootstrap replicates united the Fraser–Thompson cluster and the interior Columbia Basin spring–early-summer-run populations. Only 10.5% bootstrap support was observed for the separation of northern and interior populations from the southern and coastal, putatively ancestral, ocean-type populations (Healey 1991). This unresolved “star phylogeny” means that even if one fully accepted microsatellite allele-frequency variation as strongly indicative of historical biogeography, it would not be possible to saywith confidence that northern and interior regions were more closely related to one another than they were to coastal and southern lineages, even if that were the “true” evolutionary relationship (complicated by nonequilibrium conditions and intermittent gene flow). Poor resolution of the basal relationships among Chinook salmon lineages confounded our attempts to test the suggestion of Waples et al. (2004) that a postglacial invasion of the Fraser fromnorthern British Columbia might explain what they saw as lack of genetic affinity with the interior Columbia Basin. Beacham et al. (2006) found interior Columbia spring run to be closer to the central British Columbia and Alaska cluster than to the Fraser, whereas\n432 Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci.

(2007) and our analysis found interior Columbia and Fraser to be sister groups that were joined to a British Columbia – Alaska cluster. Only dense nuclear haplotypes and a better understanding of Earth history events will permit full dissection of the genetic landscape and evolutionary history of Chinook salmon, especially where repeated vicariance and secondary contact events have occurred.\nDespite limited resolution of the basal nodes of our dendrogram, excellent discrimination of terminal groups provided interesting differences between ourmicrosatellite results and previous allozyme studies. For example, Waples et al. (2004, p. 394) noted that interior Columbia populations show some similarities to the upper Klamath River. However, as indicated above, our microsatellite results suggested that the interior Columbia Basin spring– early-summer-run populations were related to populations in British Columbia andAlaska, butwere not at all similar to those in the Klamath (Group 24), which clustered tightly with the Rogue River (98.2% bootstrap support). Although sister to the Rogue River, the Klamath–Trinity system was genetically distinct with microsatellites, although not as divergent as with allozymes (Waples et al. 2004). Previous allozyme data also suggested (albeit with low bootstrap support) that the upper Willamette River population might be sister to interior Columbia and Klamath river populations (Waples et al. 2004). Those results also contrasted with our analysis, which strongly united upper Willamette River with geographically proximate West Cascade spring-run populations (97.9% bootstrap support). Finally, microsatellite data showed a closer affinity than was seen with allozymes between the Interior Columbia Basin spring–early-summer-run (Group 14) and Interior Fraser–Thompson (Group 11) populations. The lack of affinity with allozymes was a principal caveat that Waples et al. (2004) had for the Healey model (see above).\nDifferential sample coverage alone cannot fully reconcile allozyme and microsatellite results, but, non-neutrality might; however, further studies are needed to understand potentially similar selective pressures in the Willamette and Snake rivers. Beacham et al. (2006) found similar differences in British Columbia populations when comparing their microsatellite data with the allozyme data of Teel et al. (2000). Such differences not withstanding, the same regional groups are largely supported by different genetic marker classes, albeit with somewhat different sister group relationships that vary from study to study.\nImplications for fishery management, conservation, and evolutionary biology\nGiven our results, “stream-type” and “ocean-type” Chinook salmon should not be considered distinct “lineages” and are perhaps best abandoned as descriptors. Even their use as life-history designations is confusing. Juvenile life-history diversity based on age at sea entry is better described as “subyearling” and “yearling” migration. Evolutionary lineage is better described as adult return time combined with location (e.g., Interior Columbia spring run.) This might seem like a semantic issue of terminology, yet it has fundamental importance to the way questions about Chinook salmon evolution are framed and how results are interpreted. Explicit recognition of group-specific life-history diversity is essential for effective conservation and recovery because much current habitat restoration targets life-history types rather than the specific populations or lineages that are the legally protected entities. Ultimately, such insight leads to a deeper understanding of rates of phenotypic evolution, gene-by-environment interaction, and the habitat needs of imperiled populations of both Chinook salmon and other fishes."

  "abstractText": "The dynamic Quaternary geology of the Pacific Ring of Fire created substantial challenges for biogeography. Fish life history and population genetic variation were shaped by climate change, repeated formation and subsidence of ice sheets, sea-level change, volcanism and tectonics, isostatic rebound, and now human activities. It is widely recognized in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that parallel evolution and phenotypic plasticity have obscured range-wide patterns of lifehistory segregation with evolutionary lineage, yet the idea of the lineages themselves persists. We employed a large, internationally standardized, microsatellite data set to explore population structure at coast-wide scale and test for two divergent lineages, whether or not related to life history.We found at least 27 distinct lineages. However, relationships among groupswere poorly resolved — essentially a star phylogeny. We found pervasive isolation by distance among groups, complicating cluster analysis. Only in the interior Columbia River (east of the Cascade Mountains) is there a deep genetic bifurcation that supports both the two-lineage hypothesis and the life-history segregation hypothesis. This broad-scale perspective helps reconcile different views of Chinook salmon phylogeography and life-history distribution. Résumé : La géologie quaternaire dynamique de la ceinture de feu du Pacifique est à l'origine d'importants défis sur le plan biogéographique. Le cycle biologique des poissons et la variabilité génétique de leurs populations ont été modelés par les changements climatiques, la formation et le retrait répétés de calottes glaciaires, les variations du niveau de la mer, le volcanisme et la tectonique, le relèvement isostatique et, aujourd'hui, l'activité humaine. S'il est largement admis que, chez le saumon quinnat (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), l'évolution parallèle et la plasticité phénotypique ont masqué des patrons de ségrégation des cycles biologiques en fonction de la lignée évolutionnaire à la grandeur de l'aire de répartition, la notion des lignées comme telles persiste toutefois. Nous avons employé un grand ensemble de données de microsatellites normalisées à l'échelle internationale pour explorer la structure des populations à l'échelle de la côte et vérifier s'il y a présence de deux lignées divergentes, reliées ou non au cycle biologique. Nous avons trouvé au moins 27 lignées distinctes. Toutefois, les relations entre groupes étaient mal résolues, définissant essentiellement une phylogénie en forme d'étoile. Nous avons observé un isolement par la distance répandu parmi les groupes qui complique l'analyse topologique. Une bifurcation génétique marquée n'a été observée que dans la partie intérieure du fleuve Columbia (à l'est desmonts Cascade), ce qui appuie tant l'hypothèse de la présence de deux lignées que celle d'une ségrégation des cycles biologiques. Cette perspective facilite le rapprochement d'opinions divergentes concernant la phylogéographie et la répartition des cycles biologiques du saumon quinnat. [Traduit par la Rédaction]",
