That history is recorded in the upper crust of the planet, which is best exposed along the 4,000- km-long canyon system called Valles Marineris. Previous studies of the stratigraphy of this region have assumed that it consists of megabreccia and fractured bedrock resulting from impacts, overlain by or interbedded with relatively thin layers of lava, and with the layering restricted to the uppermost level of the crust1±6. Here we report new high-resolution images that reveal ubiquitous horizontal layering to depths of at least 8 km in the canyons.\nMegabreccia should be only coarsely layered and fractured bedrock should be unlayered, so these observations indicate that volcanic or sedimentary processes were much more important in early martian history than previously believed. Morphological and compositional data suggest that the layers were formed mainly by volcanic ¯ood lavas. Mars was therefore probably very volcanically active during at least the ®rst billion years and after the period when the heaviest impact bombardment had ended.\nThe Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC: refs 7, 8) acquired north± south-trending image strips over portions of the Valles Marineris canyon system during 16 out of the ®rst 134 orbits of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft9 (Table 1 and Figs 1 and 2). The spatial resolution varies from 4 to 10 m per picture element (pixel), so features larger than about 20 m can be discerned. The dominant morphology of the chasm walls consists of steep branching spurs and intervening gullies1,10. At most locations imaged at better than 10 m per pixel, bright±dark bands 20±100 m wide are seen in the spurs. The bands usually appear to follow topographic contour lines and thus are most likely to consist of horizontal layers varying from ,5 to 50 m in thickness (assuming 10±308 slopes). The banding consists of alternate dark cliffs (or steep slopes) and brighter, shallower intervening slopes (Fig. 1). The brighter slopes may result from coatings of aeolian dust. Layering extends to the deepest bedrock exposures that have been imaged by the MOC, as much as 8 km below the plateau surface (Table 1). We have seen what looks like massive fractured bedrock at only one location (Fig. 1b).\n584 NATURE | VOL 397 | 18 FEBRUARY 1999 | www.nature.com\n© 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd\nMost of this layering has not been seen before the MGS survey. But we note that layering has been seen in Viking and Mariner 9 images of the Valles Marineris interior deposits, formed within the canyons1; and in the pre-existing wall rock, layering has been seen previously in the uppermost level (,1 km deep), and thick or patchy dark layers have been seen in Coprates chasm and the north wall of Ophir chasm11.\nThe layers seen in MOC images of the Valles Marineris probably belong to the Upper Noachian stratigraphic series, thought to have ended 3.5±4.3 Gyr ago2. Geological units on Mars are assigned to one of three main time-rock units: Noachian (earliest, heavily cratered), Hesperian (intermediate) and Amazonian (youngest, lightly cratered). A period of heavy impact bombardment characterized the earliest histories of the planets, perhaps representing the ®nal stages of planet formation. The layers in Valles Marineris underlie surface units mapped as Hesperian and Upper Noachian12,13 (Table 1). In one location they underlie a unit mapped as Middle Noachian (Fig. 2), but the low density of craters on the plateau suggests that the unit is in fact younger. The layers must postdate the heavy bombardment of the early-to-middle Noachian, or they would be extensively disrupted. However, there may be a selection effect in places, whereby large impacts localize regions of collapse so that the high-standing plateau is dominated by intercrater plains.\nWe interpret the strata as probably consisting of volcanic ¯ows. The overlying plains probably consist of volcanic ¯ows, on the basis of their morphology2 and spectral properties14, and the layer thicknesses and cliff-forming topography are typical of continental ¯ood basalts such as the Columbia River Basalt group15 (Fig. 3). Dark layers previously identi®ed have spectral and other properties consistent with ma®c glass11, and the wall rocks in general are rich in pyroxene14,16, a common igneous mineral. Voluminous volcanism is plausible given the high heat ¯ows expected on early Mars17.\nThe presence of the layering under Upper Noachian terrains in the eastern Valles Marineris (see, for example, Fig. 2) suggests that the layers could also contain sediments that were deposited by water because many Noachian terrains are dissected by valley networks18. Studies of degraded craters in the ancient highlands have concluded that only ,200 m of highland material has been eroded and locally redistributed19, so perhaps there are thin layers of sedimentary deposits interbedded with the lava ¯ows. We cannot rule out the possibility that the layers are largely sedimentary rock, but we consider the volcanic interpretation much more likely.\nWhat happened to the megaregolith that we expected to see, especially under the Upper Noachian surfaces? Impacts must have been important, but their contribution to the upper crust depends on competing processes. It seems that the volcanic effusion rate was suf®ciently high for layered lavas to dominate this crustal section, and these lavas must have been emplaced after the period of heaviest bombardment. Presumably megabreccia exists at some depth under the stack of largely undisturbed lavas.\nHow voluminous was this early volcanism? The areal extent of the layered deposits spans at least the entire Valles Marineris, ,4,000 km long. The surrounding plateau surface is covered by volcanic plains from Upper Noachian to Upper Hesperian age2. If all martian plains younger than Middle Noachian are underlain by\nNATURE | VOL 397 | 18 FEBRUARY 1999 | www.nature.com 585\nImage numbers Chasma name Pixel scale (m)\nLat., Long.

The photograph was digitized at a scale of 1.66m per pixel, similar to the resolution achievable by the MOC in a 400-km circular orbit. Continental ¯ood basalts form layers typically 10±100 m thick, each composed of one or more¯ows from a single eruption. Each layer is usually separated by a thin weathered horizon. The ¯ow layers appear to be hundreds of kilometres long. Where exposed on cliffs and hillsides, the basalts form alternate dark cliffs and brighter slopes. Although once thought to be emplaced by rapid, turbulent ¯ow, more recent work15 favours emplacement via prolonged eruptions, with an average effusion rate of ,4,000 m3 s-1.\n© 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd\nlavas 5 km thick, then our estimates of the total quantity of lava erupted over the past ,4 Gyr (including volcanic edi®ces) must be revised from the 7 3 107 km3 calculated previously20 to 5 3 108 km3. Alternatively, the lava could be less extensive if the formation of Valles Marineris was intimately associated with the presence of a thick lava sequence, which thins rapidly away from the canyons. If deep layering is con®ned to the area of a rectangle enclosing the canyons (,4 3 106 km2) and is 10 km thick, then the volume is 4 3 107 km3. This alone greatly exceeds a previous estimate of 8 3 106 km3 of magma extruded in the Late Noachian20.\nWe conclude that volcanism on early Mars was probably much more voluminous than previously documented, and that it must have affected the climate and near-surface environment. Pollack et al.21 proposed that a warm, wet climate on early Mars was sustained by a thick CO2 atmosphere, which must be continuously resupplied or recycled to balance loss of CO2 to carbonates. Two mechanisms for recycling the CO2 have been proposed: extensive volcanism21 and impacts22. If the recycling was mainly from impacts, then the warm, wet conditions corresponded to the time (on Earth) of heavy bombardment and the impact frustration of life23. Extensive volcanism on Mars could have maintained a thick atmosphere for a signi®cant period of time after the heavy bombardment21. The layers seen by MOC provide evidence for voluminous volcanism; but a thick atmosphere could have been sustained only if suf®cient carbonates exist in the crust of Mars, which has not yet been con®rmed16.

They also provide useful constraints on the importance of surface erosion, as such processes will preferentially remove the smaller craters. Earlier studies of martian crater populations revealed that erosion and dust deposition are important processes on Mars1±6. They disagreed, however, on the age of the youngest volcanism7,8. These earlier studies were limited by image resolution to craters larger than a few hundred metres in diameter. Here we report an analysis, using new images obtained by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, of crater populations that extend the size distribution down to about 16 m. Our results indicate a wide range of surface ages, with one regionÐlava ¯ows within the Arsia Mons calderaÐ that we estimate to be no older than 40±100 million years. We suggest that volcanism is a continuing process on Mars.\nThe distribution of crater numbers versus crater diameter on lunar lava plains, called the `production function', represents the shape of the population of craters being produced on the moon in current geological time. Its shape is well determined9±11. Our initial step was to test whether the production function observed on young, well-preserved surfaces on Mars is the same as that found on the Moon. This result has been found for craters larger than 1 km in diameter, but has not been well tested for the steep branch below 1 km (ref. 7) (see ®gures). Dashed reference lines in the shape of the lunar production function are shown in each of the crater count diagrams in this Letter, along with an upper solid line that marks the crater density on the most heavily cratered surfaces in the Solar System, dated about 4.0 Gyr old on the Moon, and believed to mark the saturation equilibrium condition where new craters erase old craters10,12. These reference lines allow the comparison of the Mars counts with the lunar production function.\nHere we report our analyses of images obtained by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) on board the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. Martian crater counts obtained from the MOC images are a signi®cant advance over previously published data, and the images reveal the importance of mobile dust in shaping the martian landscape and softening the pro®le of craters13,14. In general, our procedure is to count all craters but avoid areas with obvious clusters of small secondary ejecta craters. To study the crater size distribution in a relatively young area, we chose a MOC image that crosses a strip of the ¯oor of the summit caldera of the very young Tharsis volcano, Arsia Mons. Figure 1a shows some of this surface, and the crater counts obtained on Arsia Mons and its summit caldera are given in Fig. 1b. The largest crater within the summit caldera is barely 1 km across, and so the counts are extended to larger sizes (using open symbols) with additional counts from the ¯anks of Arsia Mons. These counts (caldera and whole volcano) each appear consistent with the shape of the lunar crater diameter"

  "abstractText": "The relative rates and importance of impact cratering, volcanism, erosion, and the deposition of sediments to the early geological history of Mars are poorly known. That history is recorded in the upper crust of the planet, which is best exposed along the 4,000km-long canyon system called Valles Marineris. Previous studies of the stratigraphy of this region have assumed that it consists of megabreccia and fractured bedrock resulting from impacts, overlain by or interbedded with relatively thin layers of lava, and with the layering restricted to the uppermost level of the crust. Here we report new high-resolution images that reveal ubiquitous horizontal layering to depths of at least 8 km in the canyons. Megabreccia should be only coarsely layered and fractured bedrock should be unlayered, so these observations indicate that volcanic or sedimentary processes were much more important in early martian history than previously believed. Morphological and compositional data suggest that the layers were formed mainly by volcanic ̄ood lavas. Mars was therefore probably very volcanically active during at least the ®rst billion years and after the period when the heaviest impact bombardment had ended. The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC: refs 7, 8) acquired north± south-trending image strips over portions of the Valles Marineris canyon system during 16 out of the ®rst 134 orbits of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft (Table 1 and Figs 1 and 2). The spatial resolution varies from 4 to 10 m per picture element (pixel), so features larger than about 20 m can be discerned. The dominant morphology of the chasm walls consists of steep branching spurs and intervening gullies. At most locations imaged at better than 10 m per pixel, bright±dark bands 20±100 m wide are seen in the spurs. The bands usually appear to follow topographic contour lines and thus are most likely to consist of horizontal layers varying from ,5 to 50 m in thickness (assuming 10±308 slopes). The banding consists of alternate dark cliffs (or steep slopes) and brighter, shallower intervening slopes (Fig. 1). The brighter slopes may result from coatings of aeolian dust. Layering extends to the deepest bedrock exposures that have been imaged by the MOC, as much as 8 km below the plateau surface (Table 1). We have seen what looks like massive fractured bedrock at only one location (Fig. 1b). letters to nature",
