The Macaúbas basin evolved from continental rift settings to an inland-sea basin (a gulf) partially floored by oceanic crust and connected to aulacogens. Its evolution was coeval with at least one of the major Neoproterozoic glaciations. In this paper, we present more than 450 new U–Pb ages on detrital zircon grains from four units of the Macaúbas Group, covering glacial-related to post-glacial sedimentation stages. The results suggest that the main sedimentary supplies of the Macaúbas basin should have come from secondary sources, located in the São Francisco and Congo cratons. The pre-glacial units of the Macaúbas Group are the only ones that show important contribution from 1100 to 1200 Ma sources, and lack Archaean zircons, which are common in younger rocks of the group. These features indicate an important change in the source areas, coherent with the climate change to glacial conditions and with a regional unconformity previously mapped. Sources between 1500–1600 Ma are more significant in the continental rift stages, decreasing in the passive margin stage. This suggests changes driven by the end of a glaciation and/or the breakup of the continental lithosphere. Tonian zircons occur throughout all the basin stages, and significantly increase in the late rift and passive margin successions, recording the most abundant rift-related magmatism yet found in the Araç uaí–West Congo orogen. Detrital zircon grains as young as 750 Ma reveal contributions from Cryogenian sources to passive margin successions, suggesting sedimentary supplies from the South Bahia Alkaline Province and/or Rio Negro magmatic arc, in Brazil, and/or from rocks found in Africa (e.g., La Louila volcanic rocks). The long lasting evolution of the Macaúbas basin (c. 930 Ma to c. 600 Ma) would have involved more than one continental rifting event before the onset of an ocean-floor spreading phase around 660 Ma.\n© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unraveling the tectonic context and timing of such basins is often difficult, and explaining their subsidence mechanisms and filling evolution may be even more complicated. Zircon is an attractive provenance proxy owing to its durability and remarkable chemical stability over a wide range of pressures and temperatures (Fedo et al., 2003). Currently, U–Pb dating on detrital zircon grains provides one of the most powerful tools for basin analysis, since the age spectra of sedimentary deposits may reflect the tectonic setting of the basin, providing important hints for tectonic and\nmbria\np s p ( p r i\nt s ( b l M s s S s b g g m b\nd M t d T a s e\n2\nb S 2 t a c\ni e M o C U o 2 3 q s t\na i (\nc p e ( d\nM.

At the ame time, zircon durability in sedimentary cycles can make interretation difficult, as multi-cycle sedimentation may be masked Thomas, 2011). Therefore, to fully characterize all sedimentary rovenance components, it is essential to have a well-established egional setting, allowing for the recognition of potential sources n time and space for a given sedimentary deposit.\nThe Macaúbas Group represents the precursor basin system of he Araç uaí orogen (Fig. 1), recording continental rift to oceanic ettings, as well as at least one glacial event in the Neoproterozoic Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2011a; Babinski et al., 2012). The Macaúbas asin presents remarkable features, which makes it an excelent target for sedimentary provenance studies. First of all, the acaúbas basin evolved from continental rifting to ocean-floor preading in a singular confined setting, because almost completely urrounded by the São Francisco-Congo palaeocontinent (Pedrosaoares et al., 2001, 2008; Alkmim et al., 2006). In this scenario, edimentary supply could be extremely complex, since there would e multiple potential source areas relatively close to basin marins (Fig. 1). Furthermore, at least one of the major Neoproterozoic lacial events took place during the Macaúbas basin evolution, aking it important to evaluate sedimentary record changes driven\ny glacial-related processes. In this paper, we present more than 450 new U–Pb ages on etrital zircon grains from four metasedimentary units of the acaúbas Group, covering glacial-related to post-glacial sedimenation stages, together with a thorough compilation of about 400 etrital zircon ages available in the literature from the whole group. his robust U–Pb geochronological dataset allowed us to present\ndetailed evaluation of many potential primary and secondary edimentary sources, and to discuss the sedimentary and tectonic volution of the precursor basin system of the Araç uaí orogen.\n. Tectonic setting\nThe Neoproterozoic Macaúbas Group records the precursor asin system of the Araç uaí orogen, located to the east of the ão Francisco Craton in southeastern Brazil (Pedrosa-Soares et al., 011a). This orogen, together with its counterpart located in Africa, he West Congo belt (Fig. 1), evolved from a confined basin system lmost completely surrounded by the São Francisco-Congo palaeoontinent (Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2001; Alkmim et al., 2006).\nThe basin evolution began as a Tonian rifting event that resulted n the opening of the Macaúbas basin around 900 Ma (Silva t al., 2008; Babinski et al., 2012). The last evolution stage of the acaúbas basin resulted in an inland-sea basin partially floored by ceanic crust, a gulf-like embayment shaped in the São Franciscoongo palaecontinent (Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2001, 2008). Zircon –Pb ages from ophiolitic plagiogranites and gabbros constrain the ceanic spreading phase from c. 660 Ma to c. 600 Ma (Queiroga et al., 007; Queiroga, 2010). Indeed, this long-lasting basin history (c. 00 Ma) in such a particular setting (a gulf) put several intriguing uestions (e.g., How many rifting events took place before ocean preading? Was it a long-lived stagnant basin?); some of them we ry to access here.\nBy the beginning of the Ediacaran Period, the Rio Doce magmatic rc marked the onset of a subduction-related convergent stage n the Macaúbas basin, which lasted from c. 630 Ma to c. 580 Ma Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2011b; Gonç alves et al., 2014).\nThe tectonic mechanism for basin closure seems to be rather omplex, and probably involved a series of collisions (e.g., Paranaanema, Amazonia and Kalahari palaeocontinents) against the xternal margins of the São Francisco-Congo palaeocontinent Alkmim et al., 2006). The collisional stage, recorded by regional eformation and metamorphism, as well as the production of a\nn Research 266 (2015) 12–26 13\nhuge amount of peraluminous granites, lasted from c. 580 Ma to c. 545 Ma (Gradim et al., 2014; Peixoto et al., 2015). During the postcollisional stage (c. 530–490 Ma), the Araç uaí orogen underwent gravitational collapse associated with an important late orogenic plutonism (Marshak et al., 2006; Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2011b).\n3. Regional geology\nThis topic presents a synthesis on field studies and analytical data reported by Pedrosa-Soares et al. (2011a), updated by more recent publications and results from our own studies. As PedrosaSoares et al. (2011a) already quoted a great number of references on previous geological mapping projects, thesis and other studies on the Macaúbas Group, we only refer to papers containing U–Pb data. Although the Macaúbas Group rocks underwent regional metamorphism from the greenschist to the amphibolite facies, we mainly refer to their protoliths in the forthcoming descriptions.\nThe Macaúbas Group represents an extensive and up to 10 km thick sedimentary pile cropping out mostly in the northern sector of the Araç uaí orogen (Fig. 2). The group can be subdivided into three major successions: (i) the pre-glacial succession, comprising the Matão, Duas Barras and Rio Peixe Bravo formations; (ii) the glacialrelated succession, including the diamictite-rich packages of the Serra do Catuni, Nova Aurora and Lower Chapada Acauã formations; and (iii) the post-glacial succession, composed of the diamictitefree Upper Chapada Acauã and Ribeirão da Folha formations. The pre-glacial and glacial-related successions show evidence of continental rifting processes, while the post-glacial succession records the evolution to a passive margin stage.\nThe up to 200-m thick Matão Formation comprises breccia, conglomerate and sandstone deposited in a rift transgressive setting, recording fluvial to shallow marine environments. The youngest detrital zircon grains dated at c. 1160 Ma define a maximum depositional age for this formation (Martins et al., 2008).\nThe Duas Barras Formation consists of quartzite, conglomeratic quartzite and rare conglomerate, with variable contents of mica, feldspar, iron oxide and lithic fragments. The maximum thickness is approximately 100 m, and the sedimentary structures suggest fluvial to shallow marine environments. Detrital zircon ages set a maximum depositional age for the Duas Barras Formation at 900 ± 21 Ma (Babinski et al., 2012).\nThe Rio Peixe Bravo Formation is an up to 700 m thick sequence of micaceous, ferruginous and/or feldspathic sandstone, pelite and rare clast-supported conglomerate. Its detrital zircon age spectrum records an outstanding contribution from Rhyacian sources (Babinski et al., 2012), probably located in the neighboring Porteirinha basement block (Fig. 2).\nThe Serra do Catuni Formation, the oldest diamictitic unit of the Macaúbas Group, is a very extensive package of massive diamictite with minor sandstone and pelite intercalations. Glacial features include chaotic boulders and faceted/striated flat-ironshaped clasts. The youngest detrital zircon grains constrain the maximum depositional age at 933 ± 8 Ma (Babinski et al., 2012).\nTo the east of the Porteirinha basement block (Fig. 2), the Nova Aurora Formation overlies the pre-glacial Rio Peixe Bravo Formation and represents a distal correlative of the Serra do Catuni Formation. It comprises diamictite, minor graded sandstone, and rare pelite, as well as thick layers of diamictitic iron formation that represent an important mineral resource (Vilela et al., 2014).\nIn the central sector of the Macaúbas Group, between the Porteirinha and Guanhães basement blocks, the Serra do Catuni Formation gradually passes to the diamictite-bearing lower unit of the Chapada Acauã Formation. This lower unit mostly consists of stratified diamictite, graded sandstone and pelite, composing a cyclic succession of debris flows and sand-pelite turbidites. The\n14 M.

Their ithochemical and isotopic attributes, together with a great amount f inherited zircons from Archaean to Stenian sources, suggest tranitional mafic magmas passing through a thinned continental crust n a late rift stage of the Macaúbas basin (Babinski et al., 2005, 012). To the top, the Lower Chapada Acauã Formation gradully passes to the diamictite-free Upper Chapada Acauã Formation. his upper unit comprises a succession of interbedded sandstone nd pelite, representing a post-glacial unit deposited in a shelf\ns Group in the western Araç uaí orogen (modified from Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2007,\nenvironment during the passive margin stage of the Macaúbas basin. Detrital zircon grains from a quartzite of the Upper Chapada Acauã Formation yielded the first U–Pb SHRIMP data for the Macaúbas Group, suggesting a maximum depositional age around 864 ± 30 Ma (Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2000).\nTo the east, the Upper Chapada Acauã Formation passes to the Ribeirão da Folha Formation, which includes distal passive margin and ocean floor deposits. This formation, the most distal unit of Macaúbas Group, includes fine-grained turbidites with intercalations of chemical sediments (chert, banded iron formations, and rare limestone).

This age together with the U–Pb ziron data from the youngest ophiolite slivers found in the Araç uaí rogen (c. 600 Ma, Queiroga, 2010) suggest oceanic spreading at east from c. 660 Ma to c. 600 Ma in the Macaúbas basin.\nA very probable correlative of the post-glacial Macaúbas Group s the Jequitinhonha Complex, a succession of Al-rich paragneiss,\nnalyzed samples of the Macaúbas Group.

It lacks diamictites and shows detrital zircon age spectra very similar to the typical pattern shown by the Macaúbas rocks, with youngest zircon grains around 900 Ma (Gonç alves-Dias et al., 2011).\nSeveral magmatic episodes, all of them dated by U–Pb analysis on zircon and/or baddeleyite, provide evidence for distinct continental rifting events related to the Macaúbas basin evolution (Pedrosa-Soares and Alkmim, 2011). Records from a first continental rifting event, Tonian in age (c. 930–870 Ma), are the Pedro Lessa mafic dikes (Machado et al., 1989; Dussin and Chemale, 2012), the Salto da Divisa A-type granites (Silva et al., 2008; Menezes et al., 2012) and the Pedra Preta Amphibolite (Gradim, 2012), located in the Araç uaí orogen, as well as the bimodal volcanic rocks of the Zadinian-Mayumbian succession and associated granites of the\nmbria\nW d a ( t 2 l o p (\n4\nf ( m s t s w\nu s U i Z t c a\nl ( p G p\n( a d c s p ( a\nf n t 2\n2\nt t s z 2 a t r z\n( c 2\no\nM.

This ast continental rift event seems to have continuously evolved to cean opening, as the oldest zircon age obtained from an ophiolitic lagiogranite suggests oceanic spreading onset around 660 Ma Queiroga et al., 2007).\n.

Final separation was achieved by hand pickng, to exclude eventual grains of other minerals, such as apatite. ircon grains were mounted in epoxy disks and polished to expose heir centers. Morphological features and internal structures of ziron grains were revealed by electron backscattered electron (BSE) nd cathodoluminescence (CL) images (Fig. 3).\nThe U–Pb analyses were carried out on the Sensitive High Resoution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP II) of Australian National University Samples MG-08-10, MG-08-12) and on a NEPTUNE ICP-MS couled to an Excimer ArF ( = 193 nm) Laser Ablation System at the eochronological Research Center, University of São Paulo (Samles AR-1, SC-1, NA-1, CAS-1).\nSHRIMP analysis followed the procedures described by William 1998). Five scans through the mass stations were made for each ge determination. U abundance was calibrated using the stanard SL13 (U = 238 ppm, William (1998)) and 206Pb/238U ratio was alibrated using the standard Temora (Black et al., 2003). Meaured 204Pb was applied for the common lead correction, and data rocessing was carried out using the Squid and Isoplot programs Ludwig, 2001). The youngest outer zone of each grain was preferbly chosen to analyze, with the support of the CL and BSE images.\nU–Pb analysis carried out on the NEPTUNE LA-MC ICP-MS ollowed the order: two blanks, two NIST glasses, three exteral standards, 13 unknown samples, two external standards, and wo blanks. Each run consisted of 40 cycles with 1 s/cycle. The 04Hg interference on 204Pb was corrected by using 202Hg, where 04Hg/202Hg = 4.2. Both NIST and the external standards utilized he 207Pb/206Pb ratio for their normalization procedures, whereas he 206Pb/238U ratio was used for normalization by the external tandard. Accuracy and precision were monitored by analyses of ircon standards GJ (602 ± 4.4 Ma; Elhlou et al., 2006) and Temora\n(416.8 ± 1 Ma; Black et al., 2003). For the operating conditions nd instrument settings see Sato et al. (2010). The reported uncerainties were propagated by quadratic addition of the external eproducibility (Standard Deviation) obtained from the standard ircons GJ and Temora 2.\nThe histograms were obtained with the software Isoplot/Ex Ludwig, 2001) and only ages with concordance degree >89% were onsidered. U–Pb ages older than 800 Ma are all mentioned as 07Pb/206Pb ages. Younger ones are 238U/206Pb ages, unless referred therwise.\nn Research 266 (2015) 12–26 17\n5. Results\n5.1. Metadiamictite, Serra do Catuni Formation (sample SC-1)\nThe sample SC-1 was collected from a massive metadiamictite exposure along a road cut of the BR-251 highway (UTM 667775/8178509), located on the western slope of the Catuni ridge, which represents the thrust front limiting the Araç uaí orogen and São Francisco craton (Fig. 2). This sample represents the strongly deformed metadiamictite, metamorphosed in the chlorite zone of the greenschist facies, found along the Serra do Catuni thrusting zone.\nThe detrital zircon grains separated from this metadiamictite are rounded to subhedral, measuring 40–240 m in length. Their CL images mostly show oscillatory zoning. Few grains display inherited cores and homogeneous internal structure (Fig. 3).\nSeventy-seven spots on the same number of zircon grains yielded U–Pb ages ranging from c. 1220 Ma to c. 3250 Ma (Fig. 4). Most of them falls in the 1900–2200 Ma interval (56%; Fig. 4), suggesting the prevalence of Rhyacian-Orosirian primary sources. The youngest zircon grains (1227 ± 14 Ma) do not constrain the maximum depositional age of the Serra do Catuni Formation, since younger zircons (c. 933 Ma) have been reported for this same unit (Babinski et al., 2012).\n5.2. Metadiamictite, Nova Aurora Formation (sample NA-1)\nThis sample was collected from the layered metadiamicite with graded quartzite intercalations typical of the Nova Aurora Formation, found in a road cut of the BR-251 highway (UTM 767720/8200868) at the Vacaria River valley (Fig. 2). The sampled rock is a quite strongly deformed metadiamictite, with a garnetbearing-biotite-rich matrix indicating metamorphism in the upper greenshist facies.\nSixty-one zircon grains, ranging from 60 to 270 m in length, were recovered from the sample NA-1 (Fig. 3). They are mostly rounded to minor subhedral, indicating long distance transport. Most of them show oscillatory zoning in CL images, while only a few grains exhibit homogeneous internal structure.\nThe U–Pb ages from this sample range from c. 940 Ma to c. 3190 Ma, and cluster in the 1900–2200 Ma (39%), 900–1100 Ma (20%) and 2600–2700 Ma (10%) intervals (Fig. 4). The youngest zircon age at 939 ± 18 Ma is in good agreement with the youngest ages of zircon grains from other units of the pre-glacial and glacial Macaúbas Group.\n5.3. Metadiamictite, Lower Chapada Acauã Formation (sample AR-1)\nThis sample was collected from the most common metadiamictite of the stratified debris flow to turbidite package typical of the Lower Chapada Acauã Formation (Mato Grosso Member), found on the Araç uaí River shore (UTM 790242/8067975) near the Vargem Funda bridge, NNW of Turmalina city (Fig. 2). This metadiamictite is strongly deformed, showing a prominent stretching lineation marked by many elongated clasts and oriented matrix minerals. Garnet-mica-rich intercalations record metamorphism in the upper greenschist facies.\nMost of the grains recovered from sample AR-1 are wellrounded, ranging from 50 to 300 m in length, and shows oscillatory zoning. Seventy-eight analytical spots reveal six zircon populations, given by statistical age peaks around 1139 ± 10 Ma (3%), 1495 ± 6 Ma (8%), 1904 ± 6 Ma (10%), 2115 ± 3 Ma (68%), 2552 ± 11 Ma (4%), and 2728 ± 8 Ma (7%).

The metadiamictite was eformed and metamorphosed under conditions of the greenschist acies garnet zone.\nThe zircon grains are usually rounded, with a few elongated rains. Their sizes vary from 60 to 250 m in length. The most comon CL features are oscillatory zoning and homogeneous internal tructure (Fig. 3). Seventy one grains yielded U–Pb ages between c. 870 Ma and . 3660 Ma, and the more concordant ones cluster in a prominent eak around 2000–2200 Ma (53% of the population), which likely epresents the age of the dominant source of the sediments (Fig. 4). he youngest concordant zircon age is 953 ± 18 Ma (206Pb/238U).\n.5. Metasandstone, Upper Chapada Acauã Formation (sample G-08-12)\nThe sample MG-08-12 was collected from the sandstoneelite succession that overlies the diamictite-bearing package from hich samples MG-08-10 and AR-1 were taken, thus represent-\nng the glacial and post-glacial units included in the Chapada cauã Formation, respectively. The outcrop is a creek bed (UTM 37227/8115309) located near the Posses village, Leme do Prado unicipality, between the Jequitinhonha River and BR-367 highay (Fig. 2). It is a quartz-rich biotite-bearing metasandstone, and he associated metapelite intercalations reveal metamorphism in he staurolite-kyanite zone of the amphibolite facies.\nThe zircon grains separated from this sample are usually ell-rounded, 55–220 m long, with oscillatory zoning in CL mages (Fig. 3). Seventy-two grains yielded U–Pb ages from 00 Ma to 3310 Ma. The frequency diagram (Fig. 4) shows three ain age peaks at 900–1100 Ma (22%), 2000–2100 Ma (21%), and 600–2800 Ma (22%). The youngest age (903 ± 11 Ma, 206Pb/238U ge) and the zircon age spectrum are in good agreement with the attern shown by samples from the pre-glacial and glacial succesions of the Macaúbas Group.\n.6. Metasandstone, Upper Chapada Acauã Formation (sample AS-1)\nThe sample CAS-1 was collected from the diamictite-free andstone-pelite package of the Upper Chapada Acauã Formation hat covers the glaciogenic Nova Aurora Formation to the west of utcrop NA-1 (Fig. 2). It is a mica-bearing metasandstone cropping ut in a road cut of the BR-251 highway (UTM 758859/8200267), side a gas station. The associated metapelite intercalations record etamorphism in the garnet zone of the upper greenschist facies. Seventy-seven zircon grains from the CAS-1 metasandstone\nere analyzed. The grains are normally 50–280 m long, wellounded, showing oscillatory zoning in CL images (Fig. 3). Rare rains show homogeneous internal structure and thin metamorhic overgrowth rims with width not suitable for spot analysis <15 m).\nThe zircon U–Pb ages range between c. 750 Ma and c. 3380 Ma\nFig. 4), clustering in three main peaks: 900–1100 Ma (58%), 000–2100 Ma (7%), and 2600–2700 Ma (16%). The concordant and ery similar values given by two zircon grains (758 ± 7 Ma and 43 ± 7 Ma) suggest a maximum depositional age for the Upper hapada Acauã Formation at c. 750 Ma. This maximum depositional ge agrees with the youngest ages given by detrital zircons from amples of the post-glacial Ribeirão da Folha Formation (Peixoto t al., 2015). Despite some distinct proportions, the age spectra re similar for both samples collected from the post-glacial Upper\nn Research 266 (2015) 12–26 19\nChapada Acauã Formation (CAS-1 and MG-08-12), as well as for most samples of the Macaúbas Group.\n6. Discussion and conclusions\nWe discuss the sedimentary provenance and timing of the Macaúbas basin filling in the light of our data, together with a thorough compilation of zircon U–Pb data from the literature, including all available U–Pb data from the Macaúbas Group (Figs. 5 and 6).\nUntil now, the available U–Pb (LA-ICP-MS and SHRIMP) dataset for the Macaúbas Group and correlates was limited to about 400 ages on detrital zircon grains (Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2000; Babinski et al., 2005, 2012; Martins et al., 2008; Chemale et al., 2012; Peixoto et al., 2015). In this paper, we present more than 450 U–Pb ages, nearly doubling the available geochronological information about the group. For some of the units, such as the Nova Aurora Formation, no previous data were available, and for others, such as the Lower and Upper Chapada Acauã formations, the number of dated zircons was low. The substantial increase in the amount of data permits a more accurate and reliable interpretation of sedimentary provenance and age constraints of the units. In fact, taking into account statistical approaches (e.g. Fedo et al., 2003), a minimum number of zircons (60 grains) were now reached for all the units (Fig. 5). It might be considered that the loss of information from small grains and the preference for larger crystals during handpicking could be even more important than the number of dated zircons for the reproducibility of zircon age spectra (Slama and Kosler, 2012). We tried to avoid these biases by randomly choosing the grains during both the sample preparation and dating procedures.\n6.1. Provenance assessment\nTaking into account the Macaúbas Group as a whole (Fig. 5), the presence of three main age peaks at 1900–2200 Ma (40% of the total zircon population), 900–1000 Ma (14%), and 2600–2800 Ma (7%) is remarkable. Potential primary sources that may be related to these peaks are, respectively (Fig. 6): (i) magmatic and high-grade metamorphic rocks from Rhyacian-Orosirian complexes, such as those found in the Mineiro-Mantiqueira-Juiz de Fora-Pocrane and Itabuna-Salvador-Curaç á orogenic systems (Teixeira et al., 2000; Noce et al., 2007a,b; Novo, 2013), and the Eburnean and Kimezian basement complexes in the Congo Craton (Maurin et al., 1990; Vicat and Pouclet, 2000), (ii) the Tonian rift magmatism represented by the thick bimodal volcanic pile of the Zadinian-Mayumbian succession and associated anorogenic granites of the West Congo belt (Tack et al., 2001; Thiéblemont et al., 2011), and by the Pedro Lessa (Machado et al., 1989; Dussin and Chemale, 2012) and Salto da Divisa (Silva et al., 2008; Menezes et al., 2012) suites, as well as bodies like the Pedra Preta Amphibolite (Gradim, 2012) of the Araç uaí Orogen; and (iii) the Archaean cratonic nuclei, with several occurrences within the São Francisco and Congo Cratons (Teixeira et al., 2000; Barbosa and Sabaté, 2004; Noce et al., 2007a; Begg et al., 2009).\nAlthough there are many reliable primary sources to have fed the Macaúbas basin, the observed age spectra probably result from the contribution of both primary and secondary sources. There are several sedimentary units within the cratonic and orogenic domains that might be considered as potential sediment sources for the Macaúbas basin (Fig. 6). A very important one is the Espinhaç o Supergroup and its correlatives that form an extensive Statherian to Stenian rift-sag system in the São Francisco domain of the São Francisco-Congo palaeocontinent (Danderfer et al., 2009; Chemale et al., 2012; Dussin and Chemale, 2012). The Espinhaç o Supergroup contains a plethora of detrital zircon grains with an age span from\n20 M. Kuchenbecker et al. / Precambrian Research 266 (2015) 12–26\nF detri C sa-Soa\nc e C s E\nig. 5.

In the northern São rancisco Craton, the Contendas-Mirante supracrustal succession hows zircon ages ranging from c. 1900 Ma to c. 2700 Ma (Nutman t al., 1994).\nWithin the Congo Craton, a potential secondary source is the alaeoproterozoic Francevillian basin (Thiéblemont et al., 2009), hich represents a foreland basin related to the West Central frican belt (Feybesse et al., 1998).\nA peak around 1900–2200 Ma represents the most promient zircon age cluster occurring in all evolutionary stages of he Macaúbas basin. This period encompasses the most important rogenic events that resulted in the assembly of the São Franciscoongo palaeocontinent, recorded in orogenic belts located within he São Francisco (Mineiro-Mantiqueira-Juiz de Fora-Pocrane and tabuna-Salvador-Curaç á orogenic belts) and Congo (Gabon belt) ratons. A great number of zircon grains with such ages are lso found in the Espinhaç o Supergroup, Costa Sena Group and ontendas-Mirante sedimentary sequence, which might have cted as secondary sources.\nWhen analyzed separately, the three evolutionary stages of the acaúbas basin show some remarkable differences. The Tonian ift stage shows an important contribution from Mesoproterozoic ources, with an age peak of 1100–1300 Ma. However, Ectasiantenian (1400–1000 Ma) magmatic rocks, which could represent he primary sources, are quite scarce within the São Franciscoongo craton. Their most expressive occurrences are the A-type agmatism of the Karagwe-Ankole belt (Tack et al., 1994, 2010;\ncon ages range (for secondary sources) of possible sources for the Macaúbas Group Macaúbas Group. The gray dotted line marks the age of the youngest zircon from\nHanson et al., 1988; Ring et al., 1999; Fernandez-Alonso et al., 2012) and the Namaqua-Natal province (Evans et al., 2007; Pettersson et al., 2007). Detrital zircon ages of 1100–1300 Ma are also found in the Espinhaç o Supergroup (Chemale et al., 2012; Lopes, 2012; Santos et al., 2013; Chaves et al., 2013a,b). However, even in these pre-Neoproterozoic units, the Ectasian-Stenian zircon grains also represent a minor contribution so that they are not a reliable major source for the coeval Macaúbas zircon population. Therefore, we should consider a more complex scenario to explain the common presence of Ectasian-Stenian zircons in the Macaúbas rocks. We envisage a complex and extensive fluvial system draining the São Francisco-Congo palaeocontinent and flowing into the main grabens formed during the Macaúbas rift stages. Such a system could bring sediments from the Karagwe-Ankole belt and Namaqua-Natal province to feed the Macaúbas basin. Additionally, the Espinhaç o Supergroup could represent a more proximal source, since its rocks were certainly exposed in horsts and shoulders of the Macaúbas rifts. Moreover, detrital zircon ages of 1200–1300 Ma are also found in sedimentary units of the Brasília belt, such as the Andrelândia (Valeriano et al., 2004; Valladares et al., 2004), Vazante (Rodrigues et al., 2012), Canastra and Ibiá groups (Rodrigues et al., 2010; Dias et al., 2011), and in the Canabravinha Formation of the Rio Preto belt (Caxito et al., 2014). In addition, the presence of Mesoproterozoic zircons in sedimentary rocks on both sides of the São Francisco Craton suggests sources hidden by Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic covers within this craton, as previously suggested by Babinski et al. (2012).\nIn the Cryogenian rift to passive margin stages, an important contribution of 2600–2800 Ma sources take place, although they are virtually absent in deposits of the Tonian rift stage (Fig. 5). This absence represents an important change of source areas, which could be related to distinct factors. One of them is the regional unconformity beneath the glacial succession of the Macaúbas Group (Karfunkel and Hoppe, 1988; Uhlein et al., 1998, 1999; Martins-Neto et al., 2001), related to the Cryogenian rift stage that separates it from the pre-glacial succession deposited in the Tonian rift. Therefore, this regional unconformity would represent a long lasting hiatus, which is coherent with the important provenance\n22 M. Kuchenbecker et al. / Precambrian Research 266 (2015) 12–26\nc c c s p i m t s l t e\ns p t s C L ( r e r b (\nocks; (8) outsized clasts (dropstones); (9) mafic dykes; (10) anorogenic granites; (\nhanges. Furthermore, the Cryogenian rift stage is marked by a limatic change to glacial conditions. Such an important event ertainly implies in severe changes in the palaeogeomorphologic cenario, which can deeply modify the erosion and sediment transort systems, and consequently the provenance pattern. Finally, t should be considered that Archaean primary sources could be ostly covered during the Tonian rifting stage. In fact, seismic secions cutting across the São Francisco Craton reveal sedimentary equences older than the Neoproterozoic Bambuí Group covering a arge area of the craton basement (Coelho et al., 2008). In this case, he Archaean primary sources could have been exhumed by glacial rosion associated with block uplifting in the Cryogenian rift stage.\nThe contribution of Calymmian (1400–1600 Ma) sources is more ignificant during the rift stages, and becomes less so during the assive margin stage. Primary Calymmian sources within the craonic domain are restricted to the Curaç á-Chapada mafic dike warm (São Francisco Craton) and the Humpata sill province (Congo raton, Silveira et al., 2013), which are tentatively correlated to a arge Igneous Province with a plume center in the Siberian Craton Ernst et al., 2014). In the northern Espinhaç o Supergroup, volcanic ocks of the Bomba Formation are also Calymmian in age (Danderfer t al., 2009). Although evidences of Calymmian magmatic rocks are are in the Araç uaí Orogen, they have been reported as orthoamphiolite bodies enclosed by Rhyacian gneisses in the Pocrane Complex Silva et al., 2002; Novo, 2013).\nlcanic rocks. See text for age references.\nThe decrease of the Calymmian sources in the passive margin deposits could be related to the end of the glaciation. As the beginning of the passive margin stage corresponds to the late deglaciation stage, changes in the source areas could be driven by ice melt (flooding of source areas, changes in the drainage network) and/or by the breakup of the continental lithosphere (with significant uplift of former rift shoulders) associated with the onset of ocean spreading.\nThe 900–1000 Ma zircons appear in age spectra since the Tonian rift stage, but become important in the Cryogenian rift to passive margin stages (Fig. 5). Tonian primary sources are more abundant in the West Congo belt than in the Araç uaí orogen, owing to the thick volcanic piles of the Zadinian and Mayumbian groups (c. 930–910 Ma), the Mativa and Bata Kimenga (c. 920 Ma), and Noqui granites (c. 999 Ma, Tack et al., 2001), as well as the Mayumba granites and related mafic rocks of the northern West Congo belt in Gabon (Thiéblemont et al., 2011). In contrast, Tonian igneous sources are much less abundant in the São Francisco Craton and Araç uaí orogen, being limited to the A-type granites of the Salto da Divisa Suite (915–875 Ma; Silva et al., 2008; Menezes et al., 2012), the Ilhéus-Itapebi mafic dikes (c. 1000–900 Ma, Renne et al., 1990), and the mafic dikes from the Pedro Lessa Suite (905–930 Ma, Machado et al., 1989; Dussin and Chemale, 2012). This difference is explained by the model of an asymmetric continental rift, with the thermal axis located in the African counterpart (Pedrosa-Soares\nM. Kuchenbecker et al. / Precambrian Research 266 (2015) 12–26 23\nF xt of t m\ne t m t\nC s e 2 D ( t ( C m w 2\n6\n6 l m o\nig. 8. Sinoptic chart illustrating the evolution of the Macaúbas Basin in the conte agmatic events and basin development stages. (*) West African units or events.\nt al., 2008). The increase of the 900–1000 Ma zircon population in he glaciogenic units can be explained by the exhumation of Tonian\nagmatic rocks during the Cryogenian rifting processes, making hem available to erosion.\nFinally, an input of zircons as young as 750 Ma took place in the ryogenian-Ediacaran passive margin stage. Magmatic rocks with imilar ages are found in the South Bahia Alkaline Province (Rosa t al., 2007) and in the Rio Negro magmatic arc (Tupinambá et al., 012). Furthermore, mafic volcanic rocks intercalated in the Lower iamictite of the West Congo belt were recently dated at 694 ± 4 Ma U–Pb on baddeleyite, Straathof, 2011), and a rhyolitic tuff from he La Louila Formation yielded a zircon U–Pb age at 713 ± 49 Ma Thiéblemont et al., 2011), both in the West Congo belt. These late ryogenian ages for rift-related magmatic rocks are in good agreeent with the next igneous event related to the Macaúbas basin, hich is the formation of oceanic crust at c. 660 Ma (Queiroga et al., 007; Queiroga, 2010).\n.2. Timing of the Macaúbas basin filling\nThe long lasting evolution of the Macaúbas basin (c. 930 Ma to c. 00 Ma) seems to involve more than one rifting event before its evo-\nution to an inland-sea basin partially floored by oceanic crust. The antle-activated rift system that resulted in the Tonian opening\nf the Macaúbas basin, including its counterpart located in Africa,\nhe Araç uaí–West Congo Orogen. Vertical bars illustrate the time span of the main\nwas marked by large volumes of A-type bimodal magmatism with most U–Pb ages suggesting a time span from c. 930 Ma to c. 875 Ma (Figs. 7 and 8; Pedrosa-Soares and Alkmim, 2011, and references therein). This Tonian anorogenic igneous event could have been coeval to the sedimentation of the oldest units of the Macaúbas basin (the Matão, Duas Barras and Rio Peixe Bravo formations), which show detrital zircon ages as young as 900 Ma (Babinski et al., 2012).\nThe next anorogenic magmatic event took place in the Cryogenian, from c. 750 Ma to c. 675 Ma, on both sides of the Araç uaí–West Congo system and neighboring cratonic region. This implies a long lasting paucity (c. 120 Ma) in the anorogenic magmatic activity, from c. 870 Ma to c. 750 Ma, which may be correlated with the regional unconformities observed between the pre-glacial and glacial successions of both the Macaúbas and West Congolian basins (Karfunkel and Hoppe, 1988; Tack et al., 2001; Frimmel et al., 2006; Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2008). The deposition of thick diamictiterich packages (Serra do Catuni, Nova Aurora and Lower Chapada Acauã formations) marked the glacial period in the Macaúbas basin, whereas thin diamictite layers intercalated with c. 700 Ma old mafic volcanic rocks (Straathof, 2011) were deposited in the West Congolian basin. At this time, the continental basement of the basin became increasingly stretched, as marked by the transitional geochemical and isotopic signatures of the submarine volcanism of the Lower Chapada Acauã Formation (Gradim et al., 2005) and its\n2 mbria\nc l t a n 7\nm t r l 2 e r o i d h m\nb m i s t t 2\nA\ni C o a t c\nA\nt 0\nR\nA\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nC\nC\n4 M. Kuchenbecker et al. / Preca\norrelative related to the Lower Diamictite of the West Congoian basin (Kampunzu et al., 1991, Tack et al., 2001). However, he sedimentation timing related to this stage remains uncertain, s the maximum depositional age for the glacial succession is ot well constrained in relation to the magmatic age interval (c. 50–670 Ma).\nThe transition from the Late Cryogenian rift stage to the passive argin setting seems to be gradual and accompanied by a deglaciaion period in the Macaúbas basin. The related magmatic event ecords oceanic floor spreading, attested by the magmatic crystalization of ophiolitic plagiogranites at c. 660 Ma (Queiroga et al., 007). The ocean spreading timing is constrained between the oldst plagiogranite age and the age of the youngest ophiolite body ock ever found in the Araç uaí orogen, the Santo Antônio do Grama phiolite (c. 600 Ma, Queiroga, 2010). The post-glacial succession, ncluding the diamictite-free Upper Chapada Acauã and Ribeirão a Folha formations, as well as their correlatives (the Jequitinonha Complex and Dom Silvério Group), shows a more suitable aximum depositional age younger than c. 740 Ma (Fig. 8).

This\nmplies that, at least between c. 630 and 600 Ma, there was sea-floor preading and closure occurring concurrently in the basin. The final ectonic inversion of the basin took place in the collisional stage of he Araç uaí orogen (580–545 Ma, Gradim et al., 2014; Peixoto et al., 015).\ncknowledgments\nThe authors acknowledge financial support provided by Brazilan research and development agencies (CNPq, FAPEMIG, FAPESP, ODEMIG), the Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM), and the staff f the geochronological laboratories of the University of São Paulo nd Australian National University.

  "abstractText": "The Neoproterozoic Macaúbas Group represents the precursor basin system of the Araç uaí–West Congo orogen (SE Brazil – SW Africa), located between the São Francisco and Congo cratons. The Macaúbas basin evolved from continental rift settings to an inland-sea basin (a gulf) partially floored by oceanic crust and connected to aulacogens. Its evolution was coeval with at least one of the major Neoproterozoic glaciations. In this paper, we present more than 450 new U–Pb ages on detrital zircon grains from four units of the Macaúbas Group, covering glacial-related to post-glacial sedimentation stages. The results suggest that the main sedimentary supplies of the Macaúbas basin should have come from secondary sources, located in the São Francisco and Congo cratons. The pre-glacial units of the Macaúbas Group are the only ones that show important contribution from 1100 to 1200 Ma sources, and lack Archaean zircons, which are common in younger rocks of the group. These features indicate an important change in the source areas, coherent with the climate change to glacial conditions and with a regional unconformity previously mapped. Sources between 1500–1600 Ma are more significant in the continental rift stages, decreasing in the passive margin stage. This suggests changes driven by the end of a glaciation and/or the breakup of the continental lithosphere. Tonian zircons occur throughout all the basin stages, and significantly increase in the late rift and passive margin successions, recording the most abundant rift-related magmatism yet found in the Araç uaí–West Congo orogen. Detrital zircon grains as young as 750 Ma reveal contributions from Cryogenian sources to passive margin successions, suggesting sedimentary supplies from the South Bahia Alkaline Province and/or Rio Negro magmatic arc, in Brazil, and/or from rocks found in Africa (e.g., La Louila volcanic rocks). The long lasting evolution of the Macaúbas basin (c. 930 Ma to c. 600 Ma) would have involved more than one continental rifting event before the onset of an ocean-floor spreading phase around 660 Ma. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
