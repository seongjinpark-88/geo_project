__label__UNRELATED	"The fundamental role of island arc weathering in the oceanic Sr isotope budget Introduction: The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio measured in a marine limestone registers the ocean water composition at the time of the limestone deposition. Limestone 87Sr/86Sr ratios do vary with geological time. The question asked since the pioneeringwork of Veizer and Compston (1974) and Brass (1976) is how to interpret it? How can we extract information relative to ocean geological history? The answer to this fundamental challenge to geochemistry depends on one key question: what is the quantitative explanation of the present-day oceanic 87Sr/86Sr, which is uniform worldwide. For a long time it was admitted that seawater Sr isotopic ratio is inherited from the mixture of continental erosion products and ridgecrest hydrothermal fluids (Brass, 1976; Brevard and Allegre, 1977; Albarede et al., 1981; Chaudhuri and Clauern, 1986; Palmer and Edmond, 1989). This simple interpretation has been challenged recently and unsuccessful efforts have been made to give alternative explanations (e.g. Davis et al., 2003). In the present paper, we give a new interpretation of the oceanic 87Sr/86Sr ratio, using the 87Sr/86Sr measurements on major rivers all over the world accumulated by our group and others. This model shows the fundamental importance of island arc contribution and opens the door to a reinterpretation of the 5. Conclusion: Following studies by Rad et al. (2007) in Lesser Antilles and Reunion that documented the fundamental importance of underground water input to the oceans, we argue that volcanic islands are indeed a major source of Sr in seawater, a scenario similar to Nd isotopes budget where ridge-cresthydrothermal input is negligible. This approach enablesus to refine the models that are based on 87Sr/86Sr evolution of seawater through geological time. During collision of two tectonic plates, island arcs are active prior to the continental collision but with the commencement of the actual collision continental erosion, linked with mountainsbuilding, increaseswhile island arc erosion stopsbecause the arcs are buried in the suture zone. Both effects tend to increase the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio during convergence and canbeused to interpret 87Sr/86Sr record through the Phanerozoic."

Rifting putatively developed as a result of mantle plume activity that initiated under eastern Africa. The mantle activity has caused topographic uplift that has been connected to African Cenozoic climate change and faunal evolution. The rift is traditionally interpreted to be composed of two distinct segments: an older, volcanically active eastern branch and a younger, less volcanic western branch. Here, we show that initiation of rifting in the western branch began more than 14 million years earlier than previously thought, contemporaneously with the eastern branch. We use a combination of detrital zircon geochronology, tephroand magnetostratigraphy, along with analyses of past river flow recorded in sedimentary rocks from the Rukwa Rift Basin, Tanzania, to constrain the timing of rifting, magmatism and drainage development in this part of the western branch. We find that rift-related volcanism and lake development had begun by about 25 million years ago. These events were preceded by pediment development and a fluvial drainage reversal that we suggest records the onset of topographic uplift caused by the African superswell. We conclude that uplift of eastern Africa was more widespread and synchronous than previously recognized."
__label__UNRELATED	"Lava heating and loading of ice sheets on early Mars: Predictions for meltwater generation, groundwater recharge, and resulting landforms  Abstract: Recent modeling studies of the early Mars climate predict a predominantly cold climate, characterized by the formation of regional ice sheets across the highland areas of Mars. Formation of the predicted icy highlands ice sheets is coincident with a peak in the volcanic flux of Mars involving the emplacement of the Late Noachian Early Hesperian ridged plains unit. We explore the relationship between the predicted early Mars icy highlands ice sheets, and the extensive early flood volcanism to gain insight into the surface conditions prevalent during the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian transition period. Using Hesperia Planum as a type area, we develop an ice sheet lava heating and loading model. We quantitatively assess the thermal and melting processes involved in the lava heating and loading process following the chronological sequence of lava emplacement. We test a broad range of parameters to thoroughly constrain the lava heating and loading process and outline predictions for the formation of resulting geological features. We apply the theoretical model to a study area within the Hesperia Planum region and assess the observed geology against predictions derived from the ice sheet lava heating and loading model. Due to the highly cratered nature of the Noachian highlands terrain onto which the volcanic plains were emplaced, we predict highly asymmetrical lava loading conditions. Crater interiors are predicted to accumulate greater thicknesses of lava over more rapid timescales, while in the intercrater plains, lava accumulation occurs over longer timescales and does not reach great thicknesses. We find that top-down melting due to conductive heat transfer from supraglacial lava flows is generally limited when the emplaced lava flows are less than 10 m thick, but is very significant at lava flow thicknesses of 100 m or greater. We find that bottom-up cryosphere and ice sheet melting is most likely to occur within crater interiors where lavas accumulate to a sufficient thickness to raise the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the superposed lavas. In these locations, if lava accumulation occurs rapidly, bottom-up melting of the ice sheet can continue, or begin, after lava accumulation has completed in a process we term deferred melting. Subsurface mass loss through melting of the buried ice sheets is predicted to cause substantial subsidence in the superposed lavas, leading to the formation of associated collapse features including fracture systems, depressions, surface faulting and folding, wrinkle-ridge formation, and chaos terrain. In addition, if meltwater generated from the lava heating and loading process becomes trapped at the lava flow margins due to the presence of impermeable confining units, large highly pressurized episodic flooding events could occur. Examination of the study area reveals geological features which are generally consistent with those predicted to form as a result of the ice sheet lava heating and loading process, suggesting the presence of surface snow and ice during the Late Noachian to Early"

According to the pollen analysis, NAP pollen values are predominantly abundant. Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia and Poaceae were the prevailing plants, and Chenopodiaceae was the dominant paleoflora element during Late Pleistocene. Pollen data indicate halophyte vegetation.

Conclusion: Continuous laminated deep lake sediments in the northern part of Lake Van have potential for high resolution pollen analysis. Pollen analysis results show high NAP pollen values with Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia and Poaceae. The near absence of tree pollen in samples has been controlled by climatic conditions. Chenopodiaceae was the most abundant element of paleoflora, and the landscape was mostly covered by steppe vegetation. The near absence of tree pollen and maximum Chenopodiaceae valuesindicate arid climatic conditions during the Late Pleistocene. The steppe vegetation was halophytic and climate conditions were arid and colder than today based on pollen analysis."
__label__UNRELATED	"Detrital zircon age patterns and provenance assessment for pre-glacial to post-glacial successions of the Neoproterozoic Macaubas Group, Aracuai orogen, Brazil  Abstract: The Neoproterozoic Macaubas Group represents the precursor basin system of the Arac uaiWest Congo orogen (SE Brazil SW Africa), located between the Sao Francisco and Congo cratons. The Macaubas basin evolved from continental rift settings to an inland-sea basin (a gulf) partially floored by oceanic crust and connected to aulacogens. Its evolution was coeval with at least one of the major Neoproterozoic glaciations. In this paper, we present more than 450 new UPb ages on detrital zircon grains from four units of the Macaubas Group, covering glacial-related to post-glacial sedimentation stages. The results suggest that the main sedimentary supplies of the Macaubas basin should have come from secondary sources, located in the Sao Francisco and Congo cratons. The pre-glacial units of the Macaubas Group are the only ones that show important contribution from 1100 to 1200 Ma sources, and lack Archaean zircons, which are common in younger rocks of the group. These features indicate an important change in the source areas, coherent with the climate change to glacial conditions and with a regional unconformity previously mapped. Sources between 15001600 Ma are more significant in the continental rift stages, decreasing in the passive margin stage. This suggests changes driven by the end of a glaciation and/or the breakup of the continental lithosphere. Tonian zircons occur throughout all the basin stages, and significantly increase in the late rift and passive margin successions, recording the most abundant rift-related magmatism yet found in the Arac uaiWest Congo orogen. Detrital zircon grains as young as 750 Ma reveal contributions from Cryogenian sources to passive margin successions, suggesting sedimentary supplies from the South Bahia Alkaline Province and/or Rio Negro magmatic arc, in Brazil, and/or from rocks found in Africa (e.g., La Louila volcanic rocks). The long lasting evolution of the Macaubas basin (c. 930 Ma to c. 600 Ma) would have involved more than one continental rifting event before the onset of an ocean-floor spreading phase around 660 Ma. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conclusion: A light-toned layer is identified in one Chasma of the Noctis Labyrinthus region. Stratigraphy and topography derived from HiRISE and HRSC data show that this light-toned layer is part of a thinly stratified unit that drapes pre-existing hilly bedrock. Spectral data show that the light-toned layer contains minerals whose spectral signatures are consistent with hydrated sulfates or chloride salts, though Ca-sulfates such as bassanite and gypsum provide the best matches. The vicinity of a smooth volcanic plain, similar ages as derived from crater counts, and stratigraphic relationships suggest the alteration layer may have been produced during the same period of volcanic activity that formed the nearby volcanic plain. In agreement with morphology, the light-toned layer and thinly stratified unit may represent ash deposits. Alteration of the lowermost layer, which is now the light-toned layer, may have occurred during interaction of water ice with hot ash, either from pre-existing tropical snow deposits, or snow precipitation shortly after ash deposition, or alternatively by solidgas interactions due to nearby volcanic degassing. The alteration minerals in Noctis Labyrinthus may be different from those observed elsewhere in Valles Marineris because of local differences in volcanic chemistry, abundance and availability of water, and/or emplacement mechanism. The young age of the volcanic plain (Late Amazonian, <100 Myr) implies that recent alteration processes can exist on Mars in relation with recent volcanic activity. Such localized deposits do not require a martian climate that is different than today and may be facilitated by obliquity variations capable of mobilizing water ice to low latitudes."
__label__UNRELATED	"The upper Cenozoic tephra record in the south polar region: a review  Abstract: Tephrochronology studies in the south polar region are reviewed and evaluated. There have been numerous investigations of tephra layers in ice cores, reflecting the continuing importance of ice cores as a principal source of palaeoenvironmental information. By contrast, tephra in marine sediment cores have been largely neglected. Chemical analyses of glass shards are not uniformly available across the region. In particular, they are currently unavailable for the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Few tephras have been dated directly, although potassic glass and minerals are commonly present and should be readily amenable to isotopic dating. Chemical fingerprinting seems to have a high potential for successfully correlating layers and identifying source areas, but only a few studies have considered trace elements as well as major oxides. The effects of within-ash compositional variations and analytical imprecision limit the general utility of fingerprinting. The tephra record is locally much more complete than is preserved in the source volcanoes themselves. However, the effects of frequent eruptions on local depocentres may swamp other environmentally significant indicators and make the environmental record harder to interpret than in tephra-free successions. Linked studies of tephra and volcanically-derived aerosols in ice in the south polar region could be of critical importance for quantitative calculations of the volcanic contribution to atmospheric fluxes and attempts to assess the possible effects of volcanism on global climate. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 8. Conclusions: The study of tephra in the south polar region has advanced significantly over the last 30 years. However, the full potential of tephrochronology to glaciological, environmental, climatic and other problems Zof global concern has yet to be realised cf. Kyle et .al., 1982 . The best, if most time-consuming, wayforward is for linked, multidisciplinary studies, foZcusing simultaneously on glacichemistry in ice sec.tions and on an expanded range of major and trace elements, and morphometric parameters of the parZticulate matter e.g., Kyle et al., 1982; Delmas et al., 1985, 1992; Palais and Kyle, 1988; Palais et al., .1988 . Rigorous control must be exerted on the analytical procedures, and non-subjective statistical methods used in the treatment of the analytical data Z .Stokes and Lowe, 1988; Hunt and Hill, 1993 . By these means, precise and accurate quantification of tephra should be ensured, thus avoiding spurious analyses appearing in the literature and reducing conflicting correlations and interpretations based on Zdoubtful analyses cf. Kyle and Seward, 1984; Shane .and Froggatt, 1992 . Furthermore, it is recommendedthat the use of formal or informal names for ash Zlayers e.g., Allan Ash, Yamato Ash, Vostok tephra; .Kyle et al., 1982; Nishio et al., 1984 should be discouraged unless there are unique characteristics that enable the unambiguous identification of the individual named layers. Existing, named tephra layers are poorly described and they occur in areas of multiple tephra, in which the named layers are virtually impossible to distinguish because of insufficientdistinguishing characteristics. In investigations of tephra sequences, it may be acceptable to use an informal, flexible notation for purposes of local corZrelation e.g., the AP1-14 system adopted by Bjorck Z .et al. 1991b in the northern Antarctic Peninsula Zregion but note that some of the identified tephraare multiple layers at some localities; in itself, this could be a distinguishing characteristic in the defini..tion of a particular tephra . Tephra studies are the most important existingtool for precise correlations between atmospheric Z .ice cores , marine and terrestrial records of global change. For example, it is now possible to make quantitative estimates of fluxes of certain volcanically-derived aerosols to the atmosphere, and concurrent studies of associated microparticles are capable Z .in some cases, at least of identifying the likely Z .

These correlations arelikely to become increasingly important in Upper Cenozoic studies, particularly in enabling fundamental advances in our comprehension of feedbacks, time lags and processes operating in different sysZ .tems especially the climate system . In this context, the environmental record preserved in ice cores remains of premier importance. New European and ZAmerican initiatives the EPICA and WAISCORES .projects are aimed at obtaining deep ice cores atseveral sites in Antarctica. These cores should contain high-resolution glacial records expected to extend back several tens to hundreds of thousand years B.P. and would thus offer a high possibility for Zinterhemispheric correlations personal communicaZ .tions from D.

By comparison, marine tephra are a largely neZglected source of information fewer than 20% of tephrochronology publications for the south polar .region . Studies of south Pacific Ocean tephra sugZ .gest that like the BSIC the record contains numer-ous tephra derived from alkaline volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land and calc-alkaline volcanoes in New ZZealand Kyle and Seward, 1984; Froggatt et al., .1986; Shane and Froggatt, 1992 . Similarly, the RossSea probably contains many tephra layers from the numerous alkaline volcanoes of the McMurdo Volcanic Group, which were also active during much of Z .the Neogene and Quaternary Kyle, 1990 . The po-tential for successfully fingerprinting and correlating these multiple layers has now been tested. Alkalic tephra contain potassic glass and phenocryst phases, and they are relatively easy to date isotopically Z .Barrett et al., 1992; Marchant et al., 1993a,b,c . The Weddell SeaScotia Seasouth Atlantic region is also known to be rich in information on palaeoenviZronmental changes e.g., Kennett and Barker, 1990; .Grobe and Mackensen, 1992 , yet it lacks rigorousage control over large areas, particularly the southernmost areas because of low biogenic productivity Z .and corrosive deep water masses Pudsey, 1992 . Many of the tephra are K-rich and should be isotopically datable, although seawater alteration of samples could create problems. The combination of these characteristics suggest that the Weddell SeaScotia Seasouth Atlantic is a prime location for future tephrochronology studies. Thus, there continues to be a high potential for tephrochronology to provide a firm time framework for future palaeoenvironmental investigations within the south polar region."
__label__SUPPORT	"Tectonic controls on atmospheric, climatic, and biological evolution 3.52.4 Ga  Abstract: This paper presents a speculative scenario for the evolution of the earths surface environment and biological community 3.52.4 Ga based on the geologic record and its interpretation. Available geologic evidence suggests that the earths climate before 3.2 Ga was hot, probably 6073 C, as a result of a CO2 and CH4 greenhouse. The early biological community was probably dominated by anoxygenic photosynthetic thermophiles. Cyanobacteria, if they evolved before 3.1 Ga, would have struggled to survive at such high temperatures. As a result, the atmosphere contained extremely low levels of O2 and 33S shows wide departures from 0 indicating mass independent fractionation of S isotopes in the upper atmosphere. This hot early climate collapsed 3.13.0 Ga due to growth of large new blocks of continental crust (cratons), the weathering of which resulted in the depletion of atmospheric CO2 and eventual drawdown of CH4 due to formation and rainout of methane aerosols. Cooling may have culminated in glaciation about 3.02.9 Ga. This climatic catastrophe and attendant changes in atmospheric composition drove a major biological revolution 3.02.7 Ga characterized by the emergence of new low-temperature taxa, including cyanobacteria, and their spread throughout surface environments at the expense of extreme thermophiles, including methanogens. During a period of general tectonic stability, 3.02.7 Ga, the earths surface was characterized by overall clement conditions with temperatures <60 C, abundant cyanobacteria and the formation of associated three-dimensional stromatolites, and a mild oxygenation of the atmosphere and attendant reduction in mass independent fractionation. As the cratons that had formed 3.13.0 Ga were eroded down and gradually covered by sediments, tectonic recycling and a burst of new greenstone-belt volcanism began to increase atmospheric CO2 after 2.75 Ga and by 2.7 Ga surface temperatures had returned to >60 C. Cyanobacteria were again suppressed, O2 production waned, and atmospheric mass independent fractionation is again indicated by extreme variations in 33S. These conditions persisted, perhaps intermittently, until about 2.52.4 Ga, when weathering and erosion of vast new blocks of continental crust formed about 2.652.6 Ga caused the second, and probably last collapse of a >60 C surface climate. Broad tectonic, climatic, and biological events 3.52.9 Ga are remarkably parallel to those of the Late Archean and Paleoproterozoic 2.752.2 Ga and Neoproterozoic 1.00.50 Ga. These 500-myr long cycles of greenstone volcanism and crustal generation; climatic and atmospheric instability; and biological innovation reflect the long-term interaction of the tectonic, atmospheric, climatic, and biological components of the earths surface system. They suggest that the evolution of the earths interior, expressed through its control on the formation of large blocks of continental crust, has influenced atmospheric composition and climate which in turn have provided a fundamental control on the timing and directions of biological evolution throughout earth history. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The stratigraphy records the positive carbon isotopic excursion that is associated with the major oceanic anoxic event (OAE2). Comparison of TOC and isotopic data in sections from a range of different environments suggests that the positive excursion is a response to increased burial of organic matter in the deep ocean. The lack of coupled negative shifts in yCorg and y Ccarb records at the onset of OAE2 does not support a causal role for volcanism or methane hydrate dissociation. D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 5. Conclusions: High-resolution carbon isotope stratigraphy ofthree sections across the base of OAE2 near theCenomanianTuronian boundary shows the well-documented positive excursion. Comparison withTOC data suggests that the carbon isotopic signalis driven by changes in the burial rates of organicmatter in the deep ocean rather than in shallow marine locations. Small (0.51.0x) changes in y13Corg can be correlated between sections allowing for higher resolution correlation than available using traditional biostratigraphy. Coupled y13Corg and y13Ccarb records do not support input of mantle CO2 or dissociation of methane hydrate at the onset of the event. Thus, our data do not support avolcanic or hydrate trigger for OAE2. It is possiblethat the mantle carbon signal corresponding to theCaribbean LIP was masked by the burial of organicmatter at the onset of OAE2."

__label__UNRELATED	"CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHIC FRAMEWORK FOR UPPER CAMPANIAN-MAASTRICHTIAN SEDIMENTS ON THE BLAKE NOSE (SUBTROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC)  Abstract: A new chronostratigraphic framework is presented for upper Campanian-Maastrichtian pelagic sediments cored at DSDP/ODP Sites 390A/1049, 1050, and 1052, which were drilled across a 1300-m depth transect on the Blake Nose (subtropical western Atlantic Ocean). The planktonic foraminiferal zonation is based on standard global biozones for this interval, but rare and sporadic occurrence of two zonal biomarkers, Gansserina gansseri and Globotruncana aegyptiaca, precludes reliable identification of the nominate zones for those species. The Pseudoguembelina palpebra Partialrange Zone is defined as a means of subdividing this upper Campanian biostratigraphic interval. Planktonic foraminiferal, calcareous nannofossil and paleomagnetic datums are integrated to construct reliable age-depth curves for each of the Blake Nose drill sites. These age models are largely confirmed by Sr-isotopic data and suggest significant unconformities at various positions within the sections. Compilation of stable isotope datasets for this time interval from the Blake Nose sites reveals no significant shifts in dO and dC at the time of the inoceramid bivalve extinction (now dated as 68.568.7 Ma in the Blake Nose sections) and no correlation with proposed Campanian-Maastrichtian glacial intervals. However, benthic warming associated with Deccan volcanism during the late Maastrichtian is supported. CONCLUSIONS: Age-depth models are created for the upper CampanianMaastrichtian interval recovered from DSDP/ODP Holes 390A/1049C and ODP Holes 1050C and 1052E, which were drilled along a middle to upper bathyal depth transect on the Blake Nose in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean.

The revised age models enable greater accuracy in chronostratigraphic correlation, characterization of changes in sedimentation rates, and determination of the stratigraphic position, timing, and duration of unconformities. These refinements provide a much more reliable framework for interpretation of biotic and paleoceanographic changes that occurred during the last 10 m.y. of the Cretaceous Period as observed on the Blake Nose.The relative order and timing of a majority of the planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil datum events identified at the Blake Nose sites show very good agreement among sites. Exceptions among the planktonic foraminifera include the zonal marker species Globotruncana aegyptiaca and Gansserina gansseri, which both have rare and sporadic distributions at the Blake Nose drill sites. Because recognition of the G. gansseri and G. aegyptiaca Zones is deemed unreliable, we define a new Pseudoguembelina palpebra Interval Zone for biostratigraphic subdivision between the Globotruncanella havanensis Partial-range Zone and the Racemiguembelina fructicosa Partial-range Zone. The FAD of P. palpebra is calibrated as 71.64 Ma. Secondary planktonic foraminiferal datum ages that are estimated from mean values obtained from the Blake Nose age models include: (1) the LAD of Gansserina gansseri 5 65.93 Ma, (2) the LAD of Contusotruncana patelliformis 5 66.20, (3) the LAD of Globotruncana linneiana 5 67.86 Ma, (4) the LAD of Globotruncana bulloides 5 68.80 Ma, (5) the LAD of Contusotruncana fornicata 5 68.98 Ma, (6) the FAD of Pseudotextularia elegans 5 69.02 Ma, (7) the FAD of Planoglobulina acervulinoides 5 69.55 Ma, (8) the FAD of Contusotruncana contusa 5 70.5 Ma, (9) the FAD of Pseudoguembelina kempensis 5 71.50 Ma, (10) the FAD of Racemiguembelina powelli 5 70.98 Ma and (11) the FAD of Pseudoguembelina excolata 5 74.40 Ma.Revision of the late Campanian-Maastrichtian chronology for the Blake Nose sites has an important bearing on paleoceanographic interpretations that have been made based on data generated from the drill cores and in correlation with data from other regions. Of particular interest is determination whether reorganization of the sources and patterns of deep- and intermediate-water circulation played a role in biotic changes, particularly the extinction of inoceramid bivalves. The extinction of inoceramid bivalves is now dated between 68.5 and 68.7 Ma on the Blake Nose. Combined stable isotope datasets published for the Blake Nose sites do not show any significant change in foraminiferal, bulk- and finefractioncarbonate d18O and d13C values in this interval.The new chronology also provides reliable constraints on the timing and duration of Late Cretaceous unconformities across the Blake Nose transect. A mid-Maastrichtian unconformity with a duration ranging between 0.7 and 1.9 m.y. is identified at all three sites across the 1300-mdepth transect.

__label__UNRELATED	"Obliquity forcing of organic matter accumulation during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2  Abstract: [1] An analysis of orbitally influenced climate-sensitive sedimentation is conducted across a meridional transect of the proto-North Atlantic, to reconstruct the behavior of the carbon cycle and climate during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2; 94 Ma). Midlatitude to near equatorial sites spanning deep-ocean to shelf environments are evaluated using a new inverse method for the identification and calibration of orbital influence in ancient strata. The results yield consistent independent astrochronologies at each locationcompatible with the recently published radioisotopic/astrochronologic time scale at the Cenomanian-Turonian GSSPand thus provide a unified high-resolution temporal context for evaluation of the event. The proto-North Atlantic astrochronologies document an amplification of obliquity power during OAE 2, indicating that obliquity was the dominant pacemaker of organic matter accumulation by the latter portion of the event. The strong obliquity signal suggests an influence of high-latitude climate processes across midlatitude deep-ocean to tropical shelf environments. Changes in oceanic circulation during OAE 2 represent a likely mechanism for the propagation of a high latitude signal, and proxy data from Demerara Rise reveal the development of a new intermediate water mass source synchronous with the record of obliquity amplification. We hypothesize that a dense high-latitude water mass displaced a pre-existing nutrient-rich anoxic deep-water layer in the proto-North Atlantic (augmented by enhanced volcanism), driving an episode of high productivity that lasted 700800 ka. The development and intensification of the new intermediate/deep water source was potentially driven by eustatic sea level rise, which created expansive seaways in mid to high latitudes."
__label__SUPPORT	"Calibration of chron C29r: New high-precision geochronologic and paleomagnetic constraints from the Hell Creek region, Montana  Abstract: The mass extinction at the CretaceousPaleogene boundary marks one of the most important biotic turnover events in Earth history. Yet, despite decades of study, the causes of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary crises remain under debate. An important tool that has the capacity to greatly improve our understanding of the events around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary is the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS). The GPTS is used for age control in numerous Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary studies, including the timing of Deccan Traps volcanism, a majority of studies in marine sections, and studies on climate and ecological change across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The current calibration of the GPTS for circumCretaceous-Paleogene boundary polarity chrons (C30nC28n) from the Geologic Time Scale draws heavily on astronomical tuning and uses a 40Ar/39Ar age for the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary as a tie point that has since been shown to be 200 ka too old. Furthermore, complex sedimentation has been recorded in marine sections immediately following the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, which can possibly obscure orbital signals and complicate cyclostratigraphic interpretation. An independent test of the cyclostratigraphy for this time period is imperative for confidence in the astronomical time scale. Further, polarity reversal ages given in the GPTS do not include uncertainty estimates, making them unsuitable for quanti- CONCLUSIONS: We calculated a duration of 587 53 ka for C29r based on 14 new magnetostratigraphic sections and 18 new 40Ar/39Ar tephra ages from the Hell Creek region, Montana. This result is consistent with past estimates for the age and duration of this chron based on cyclostratigraphy and U/Pb geochronology. The previous estimate for the duration of C29r of ~350 ka, presented in Sprain et al. (2015), is shown to be incorrect due to errors in reversal placement in two different magnetostratigraphic sections presented in Archibald et al. (1982) and LeCain et al. (2014). These errors are probably due to unremoved normal overprints, likely held by goethite, which cannot be removed by AF-only demagnetization techniques. This result calls for the reevaluation of magnetostratigraphic frameworks developed in central North American basins that were determined using only AF demagnetization techniques (e.g., the San Juan Basin), especially in locations where the placement of NALMA faunas is not consistent with other regional basins. Despite errors found in past reversal placement, our results confirm the previous placement of NALMA fauna into the magnetostratigraphic framework for the Hell Creek region: La: Cretaceous C29r, Pu1: Paleogene C29r, and Pu3: C29n.Using our new calibration for C29r, we can begin to tie records of biotic and abiotic change around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary from both marine and terrestrial sections to records of Deccan volcanism. Tentative first analysis agrees with past assessments that pre Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary ecological decline in the terrestrial realm correlated with the onset of Deccan volcanism and records of global climate change ~400 ka prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.Incorporating ~200 new analyses, we also provide a new pooled age for the IrZ tephra of 66.052 0.008/0.043 Ma, which we interpret as the most reliable age for the CretaceousPaleogene boundary available."
__label__UNRELATED	"Hail formation triggers rapid ash aggregation in volcanic plumes  Abstract: During explosive eruptions, airborne particles collide and stick together, accelerating the fallout of volcanic ash and climate-forcing aerosols. This aggregation process remains a major source of uncertainty both in ash dispersal forecasting and interpretation of eruptions from the geological record. Here we illuminate the mechanisms and timescales of particle aggregation from a well-characterized wet eruption. The 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, incorporated water from the surface (in this case, a glacier), which is a common occurrence during explosive volcanism worldwide. Observations from C-band weather radar, fall deposits and numerical modelling demonstrate that hail-forming processes in the eruption plume triggered aggregation of B95% of the fine ash and stripped much of the erupted mass out of the atmosphere within 30 min. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism of hail-like ash aggregation that contributes to the anomalously rapid fallout of fine ash and occurrence of concentrically layered aggregates in volcanic deposits.

__label__UNRELATED	"Clams as CO2 generators: The Potamocorbula amurensis example in San Francisco Bay  Abstract: Respiration and calcium carbonate production by the invasive Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis, were calculated to assess their importance as CO2 sources in northern San Francisco Bay. Production, calculated using monthly population density and size structure measured at three sites over 7 yr and a shell length/CaCO3 conversion factor, averaged 221 (6184) g CaCO3 m22 yr21. Net calcium carbonate production by this exotic bivalve releases CO2 at a mean rate of 18 (617) g C m22 yr21. Respiration by P. amurensis, estimated from secondary production, releases additional CO2 at a mean rate of 37 (634) g C m22 yr21. Therefore, total net CO2 production by P. amurensis averages 55 (651) g C m22 yr21 in an estuarine domain where net primary production consumes only 20 g inorganic C m22 yr21. CO2 production by P. amurensis in northern San Francisco Bay is an underestimate of the total CO2 supply from the calcified zoobenthic communities of San Francisco Bay, and results from other studies have suggested that this rate is not unusual for temperate estuaries. Global extrapolation yields a gross CO2 production rate in the worlds estuaries of 1 3 1014 g C yr21, which suggests that calcified benthic organisms in estuaries generate CO2 equal in magnitude to the CO2 emissions from the worlds lakes or from planetary volcanism (the net source is determined by the highly variable rate of CO2 consumption by carbonate dissolution). This biogenic CO2 source is increasing because of the continuing global translocation of mollusks and their successful colonization of new habitats. The combination of a unique level of global warming in the late 20th century and narrowed constraints on the role of natural variability provide growing evidence that a greenhouse effect from anthropogenic CO2 emissions can be distinguished from natural variability in the climate system (Crowley 2000). However, there remain large uncertainties in the contemporary global carbon budget and even gaps in our knowledge of the processes contributing to planetary carbon cycling (Schlesinger 1997). We have not yet identified or measured all of the important sources and sinks of CO2, the greenhouse gas that contributes at least 50% to projected global warming (Lashof and Ahuja 1990). Carbon dioxide uptake by photosynthesis and its release by respiration are major processes by which marine organisms alter 1 Corresponding author (laurent.chauvaud@univ-brest.fr)."
__label__UNRELATED	"End member models for Andean Plateau uplift Introduction: The plateaus of Tibet and the central Andes are the largest tectonically active orogens. Despite this, the topographic, tectonic, and geodynamic evolution of orogenic plateaus remain imprecisely known and the focus of significant research. These plateaus are thought to influence local-to-far-field lithospheric deformation as well as global sediment flux, ocean chemistry, atmospheric circulation, precipitation, and climate change (Richter et al., 1992; Molnar et al., 1993; Masek et al., 1994; Lenters and Cook, 1995; Royden, 1996; Ruddiman et al., 1997; Sobel et al., 2003). In particular, numerous geologic observations have constrained the tectonomorphic evolution of the central Andean Plateau (see summaries in Isacks, 1988; Reutter et al., 1994; Allmendinger et al., 1997; Jordan et al., 1997; Kley et al., 1999; Gregory-Wodzicki, 2000; Kennan, 2000; Ramos et al., 2004; Barnes and Pelletier, 2006; Oncken et al., 2006b; Strecker et al., 2007; Kay and Coira, 2009), yet its history of uplift and consequently the associated geodynamic mechanisms of plateau development remain disputed (Garzione et al., 2006; Ghosh et al., 2006; Sempere et al., 2006; Garzione et al., 2007; Hartley et al., 2007; Hoke and Lamb, 2007; Ehlers and Poulsen, 2009). A range of processes have been proposed for Andean Plateau (AP) growth (Fig. 8. Conclusions: We conclude by listing a series of observations and key inferences consistent across many investigations presented in our synthesis. Thislist is presented to identifywhat can be saidwith confidence concerning the Cenozoic structure and geologic evolution of the Andean Plateau, providing a test for evaluating future models of central Andes orogenesis. More specifically, any model that attempts to explain Andean Plateau development must honor the following (Fig. 9):A. Lithosphere (Fig. 9A): a crust exhibiting significant yet variable along-strike shortening (330150 km) with a west-dipping monocline on the western flank and dominantly east-vergent thrust belt involving basement-to-cover rocks in the center to eastern flank (Fig. 2D). A plateau region possessing a positive geoid, a negative Bouguer gravity anomaly, low rigidity, high heat flow, and an isostatically compensated thick crust (8065 km). In contrast, plateau margins exhibiting progressively thinner crust, reduced heat flow, and an increasingly rigid lithosphere away from the center. A lithosphere with an east-dipping high velocity zone down to 660 km corresponding to the subducting Nazca plate, variable velocity zones and high attenuation in the crust and upper mantle, and a high velocity mantle beneath the Eastern Cordillera corresponding to the under-thrusting Brazilian craton (Fig. 2D).B. Deformation and exhumation (Fig. 9B): a mostly continuous Cenozoic deformation, sedimentation, and exhumation history that progresses dominantly eastward since the PaleogeneEocene (6040 Ma). More specifically, initial deformation and exhumation began along the western flank at 6040 Ma with a shift into the Eastern Cordillera 40 Ma. Continued and distributed Eastern Cordillera deformation from 4020 Ma was followed by propagation eastward into the Interandean zone and westward in the Altiplano from 20 Ma until 105 Ma. The modern width of the Andean Plateau is inferred to be reached by 2515 Ma. Deformation and exhumation propagated eastward into the Subandes/ Santa Barbara Ranges/Sierras Pampeanas at 1510 Ma where it continues today. A younger phase of early-mid Miocene to present (230 Ma) exhumation in the Eastern Cordillera was probably the result of enhanced erosion along the northern Altiplano flank and related to deformation along the southern Puna flank. The 3-dimensional deformation field of the AP is characterized by rotation outward from the orocline axis.C. Magmatism (Fig. 9C): Cenozoic volcanism began in the Western Cordillera and continued until35Ma.Widespread back-arc,maficto-rhyolitic volcanism began again at 25 Ma across a 300 km wide (WE) zone within the central Altiplano. Arc productivity has been higher south of20S and has also decreased in age southward since 12 Ma. The widespread volcanism only recently retreated to its present and narrow (50 kmWE) zone in the Western Cordillera 3 Ma. This volcanism infers a) a thin Altiplano lithosphere (<100 km thick) since ~25 Ma and b) a history of changing subduction geometry from normal to flat and back to normal during the Cenozoic. Onset of mafic magmatism at 3 Ma in thePunamaybe the result of recentdelamination and the causeof its higher mean elevation relative to the Altiplano.D. Uplift (Fig. 9D): most surface uplift from an initial elevation of 1 km has occurred since 25 Ma. Within error, paleoaltimetry data are equally consistent with anything from a slow and steady rise of the AP since25 Ma to a rapid rise of 2.5 km at 106 Ma. Much of the paleoaltimetry data can be explained by either surface uplift and/or climate change associated with plateau uplift.E. Incision (Fig. 9E): significant late Miocene incision (2.51 km since 118 Ma) has occurred along the Altiplano western flank with more minor incision both prior to this time and along the eastern plateau flank. The incision mechanism is unclear and could be surface uplift and/or climate change associated with plateau uplift. In contrast, there is no evidence for significant incision along the southeastern Puna margin.F. Modeling: models of Andean Plateau formation suggest that a weakened lithosphere resulting in flow at depth is important in the geodynamic evolution of the plateau.A major interpretation drawn from this synthesis is a synoptic history of Andean Plateau evolution that describes significant, yet variable upper-plate deformation (530150 km shortening) within a weak lithosphere that was protracted (40 Myr since deformationand magmatism began, 25 Myr since the lithosphere was thin in places (<100 km thick)) and more uniform in time along strike (1500 km) than previously appreciated. This synoptic history is more consistent with a geologic model of relatively continuous deformation and an end member model of Andean Plateau uplift that emphasizes a slow and steady rise since the Eocene (40 Ma) or even earlier. Therefore, we suggest the late Miocene (10 Ma) rapid uplift model may be an overestimate and that a protracted Cenozoic uplift history is tenable."

Early in their histories, all three apparently had oceans and extensive volcanism; Mars and Earth, at least, had magnetic fields, and Earth, at least, had life. All three currently have climates determined by energy balance relationships involving carbon dioxide, water and aerosols, regulated by solar energy deposition, atmospheric and ocean circulation, composition, and cloud physics and chemistry. This paper addresses the extent to which current knowledge allows us to explain the observed state of each planet, its planetology, climatology and biology, within a common framework. Areas of ignorance and mysteries are explored, and prospects for advances in resolving these with missions within the present planning horizon of the space agencies are considered and assessed. & 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. 8. Conclusion: glittering prizes: Although a new discipline, comparative planetology has within its reach at least two far-reaching goals of great significance. One belongs exclusively within this disciplinethe detection, or not, of life forms (and/or evidence for past life forms) in water-rich, or formerly water-rich, environments on Mars, and the implications for life as a common or uncommon phenomenon in the Universe. Venus is a less favourable, but still not entirely negligible, site for related investigations that will, like Mars, probably yield some of its secrets to investigations now in the planning cycle. The other prize is the contribution mentioned above that comparative planetology may make to the struggle to understand and ameliorate harmful climate change on the Earth. This is already underway with missions like the Mars and Venus Expresses, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Exploration Rovers on the surface of Mars."
__label__UNRELATED	"Nutrient acquisition by symbiotic fungi governs Palaeozoic climate transition  Abstract: Fossil evidence from the Rhynie chert indicates that early land plants, which evolved in a high-CO2 atmosphere during the Palaeozoic Era, hosted diverse fungal symbionts. It is hypothesized that the rise of early non-vascular land plants, and the later evolution of roots and vasculature, drove the long-term shift towards a high-oxygen, low CO2 climate that eventually permitted the evolution of mammals and, ultimately, humans. However, very little is known about the productivity of the early terrestrial biosphere, which depended on the acquisition of the limiting nutrient phosphorus via fungal symbiosis. Recent laboratory experiments have shown that plantfungal symbiotic function is specific to fungal identity, with carbon-for-phosphorus exchange being either enhanced or suppressed under superambient CO2. By incorporating these experimental findings into a biogeochemical model, we show that the differences in these symbiotic nutrient acquisition strategies could greatly alter the plant-driven changes to climate, allowing drawdown of CO2 to glacial levels, and altering the nature of the rise of oxygen. We conclude that an accurate depiction of plantfungal symbiotic systems, informed by high-CO2 experiments, is key to resolving the question of how the first terrestrial ecosystems altered our planet. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue The Rhynie cherts: our earliest terrestrial ecosystem revisited."
__label__SUPPORT	"A 200-year record of gale frequency, Edinburgh, Scotland: possible link with high-magnitude volcanic eruptions  Abstract: Most research concerned with the relationship between volcanic activity and global climate change has focused on the impacts that volcanoes have on atmospheric temperature. Very little attention, however, has been given to the effect of volcanic eruptions on patterns of storminess. Here we present a historical record of gale-day frequency for Edinburgh, Scotland, extending from AD 1780 to 1988 (the Mossman-Hickey chronology), which we believe represents the longest historical record of gales in Europe. Calculation of galeday frequency for this time interval shows three clear peaks in storminess that follow the volcanic eruptions of Tambora (1815), Krakatoa (1883) and El Chichon (1982). It appears that the greatest periods of storminess evident in the Edinburgh record during the last 200 years have taken place during relatively short intervals following major episodes of volcanism. If correct, the processes linking high-magnitude volcanic eruptions to storminess in the North Atlantic need to be included in IPCC research that presently focuses most attention on linkages between increased storminess and the effects of global warming."

It has its own specific features in global common features of geology and has been paid close attention by scientists from home and abroad for its abundant, typical, and concentrated contents of geosciences. It is a typical and representative continental orogenic belt in the world and contains rich information about current development of geosciences.On the basis of comparative analyses of regional geology, geological sites in Qinling Zhongnanshan World Geopark, this paper has been concluded as follows:1. The Qinling Mountain is famous among all China and the worldbecause of its significance in geological and geographical research. In its middle section, Zhongnanshan region, there are many complicated geological phenomena and important geosites: representative stratigraphic section, magmatic activity remains, structure section and tectonic motion remains, geologicalgeomorphological landscape, special rocks and minerals, special hydrogeological phenomena, human engineering activity remains, disastrous geological process remains, and palaeontological fossils and sites, a total of nine types based on genetic classification.2. The big piedmont fault in the northern margin of Mt. Qinling is amarginal scarpside of the Weihe rift. Since the late Cretaceous period, it has been in active at all times and is still active up to now. It has a fault displacement up to 13 km. In the north side of Mt. Qinling, the Weihe graben is an intracontinental fault basin infilled with thick sediments, which has a global significance in geoscience research.3. The heritage sites of the Cuihuashan Mountain collapseslideranks third in size in the world, with which the landscapes are intact in patterns, including freeing surfaces, collapseslide accumulation, barrier dams, barrier lakes, and caves.4. The landforms of glacial erosion, moraine, and cryergy inTaibaishan Mountain are preserved well, which have an important significance in research of the evolution of the Quaternary climate and glaciations in China and East Asia.5. The unique geological background formed the highest peak andthe broad and prosperous Weihe basin in Eastern China. From the Palaeolithic Age, the Lantian Homo erectus was attracted to the foot area of the Qinling Mountains and began to settle down and multiply the following generations. Hereafter, the Chenjiawo Homo erectus (700,000 years) and the Banpo clan (6,500 years)had their colourful and prosperous life in this area. Thirteen dynasties of ancient China had established their capital cities in Xi'an, which had drove religions of Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianism to prosperity. So the territory of the geopark is one of the most representative areas in harmonious coexistence between human and nature.Geosites are records of geological history handed over through tens up to thousands of millions of years. In their probe into the nature's history, human beings understand gradually the importance of safeguarding geological heritage, and through long practice of conserving the heritage, they have found an optimal approach for this purpose, that is, establishing geoparks, make them special landscape areas for protecting the Earth's legacy and the geologicalecological environment, and furthermore, network them at different levels to form a research base for important geoscientific issues, educational field base for students, and scientific popularization base to the general public. The prominent value is the core content of World Natural Heritage application, protection, and management. Thus, for world geoparks, they also should enhance the ability to protect and manage geological sites. The park should make a scientific decision for implementing planning, exploitation, and construction; it is necessary to assess the whole value from the angle of tourists' demand. In doing so, revenues from geotourism, for example, knowledge tours, science tours, and environmental protection tours, can support the local economy and promote local employment."

This study extends the detailed record of Antarctic, South American, and equatorial volcanism over the last 12,000 years using continuous glaciochemical series developed from the Siple Dome A (SDMA) ice core, West Antarctica. The largest volcanic sulfate spike (280 mg/L) occurs at 5881 B.C.E. Other large signals with unknown sources are observed around 325 B.C.E. (270 mg/L) and 2818 B.C.E. (191 mg/L). Ages of several large equatorial or Southern Hemisphere volcanic eruptions are synchronous with many sulfate peaks detected in the SDMA volcanic ice chemistry record. The microprobe fingerprinting of glass shards in the SDMA core points to the following Antarctic volcanic centers as sources of tephra found in the SDMA core: Balenny Island, Pleiades, Mount Berlin, Mount Takahe, and Mount Melbourne as well as Mount Hudson and possibly Mount Burney volcanoes of South America. Identified volcanic sources provide an insight into the poorly resolved transport history of volcanic products from source volcanoes to the West Antarctic ice sheet."

The first occurrences of this genus are recorded in the sedimentary successions of the Gondwana, both in Australia and South America. However, the geographic and age distribution of Oriocrassatella in Late Mississippian deposits of Australia and Argentina may indicate an earliest Visean or even a pre-Visean origin for the genus.

In complex geologic framework, where the geologichydrogeologic knowledge is limited, the groundwater flow model could not be constructed based solely on borehole data, but geophysical information could aid the model building. The integrated model construction was presented via the case study of the Tihany Peninsula, Hungary, with the aims of understanding the background and occurrence of groundwater-related environmental phenomena, such as wetlands, surface watergroundwater interaction, slope instability, and revealing the potential effect of anthropogenic activity and climate change. The hydrogeologic model was prepared on the basis of the compiled archive geophysical database and the results of recently performed geophysical measurements complemented with geologichydrogeologic data. Derivation of different electrostratigraphic units, revealing fracturing and detecting tectonic elements was achieved by systematically combined electromagnetic geophysical methods. The deduced information can be used as model input for groundwater flow simulation concerning hydrostratigraphy, geometry and boundary conditions. The results of numerical modelling were interpreted on the basis of gravity-driven regional groundwater flow concept and validated by field mapping of groundwater-related phenomena. The 3D model clarified the hydraulic behaviour of the formations, revealed the subsurface hydraulic connection between groundwater and wetlands and displayed the groundwater discharge pattern, as well. The position of wetlands, their vegetation type, discharge features and induced landslides were explained as environmental imprints of groundwater. The highly vulnerable wetlands and groundwater-dependent ecosystems have to be in the focus of water management and natural conservation policy. 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Summary and conclusion: Groundwater flow, driven, controlled and determined by topography, geology and climate, is responsible for several natural surface manifestations and affected by anthropogenic processes. Therefore, flowing groundwater can be regarded as an environmental agent. The concept of gravity-driven regional groundwater flow could aid the understanding of flow pattern in geologically complex (siliciclastic, carbonate and volcanic) area, and interpretation of environmental processes and conditions.Unless the required well data are available, the geological hydrogeological numerical model of the study area cannot be constructed based only on borehole information. In this case, spatiallycontinuous geophysical data can support groundwater flow model building: systematically combined geophysical methods can provide model input. Determining the different electrostratigraphic units and their position, revealing fractures, detecting structures can be carried out by easy-to-use, non-invasive and rapid electromagnetic geophysical methods even in complex geologic framework. Integration of lithostratigraphic, electrostratigraphic and hydrostratigraphic information could aid groundwater flow model construction: hydrostratigraphic units and their hydraulic behaviour, boundaries and geometry can be obtained. Groundwaterrelated natural manifestations can be explained with the help of the revealed flow pattern and field mapping of features.Integrated groundwater flow model construction in a geologically complex area was presented via the case study of the Tihany Peninsula, Hungary. The geophysical results were indispensable to clarify the geometry and hydraulic behaviour of the near-surface formations in the paleo-maar environment and identify the structural pattern. The 3D groundwater flow model, which is based on the scarce geologic information and the electromagnetic geophysical results, could answer the subsurface hydraulic connection between wetlands and also groundwater discharge pattern. Moreover, the gravity-driven regional groundwater flow concept can help to interpret the hydraulically nested flow systems (local and intermediate) even in such a geologically complex and relatively small area (25 km2). Validation of numerical simulation by natural surface conditions and phenomena was performed. Consequently, the position of wetlands, their vegetation type, discharge featuresand induced landslides were explained as environmental imprints of groundwater. Anthropogenic activities and climate change have great impact on groundwater; the highly vulnerable wetlands have to be in focus of water management and natural conservation policy."
__label__UNRELATED	"The Holocene history of George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula from clast-provenance analysis of epishelf lake sediments  Abstract: The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a dramatic increase in temperature and the loss of ca. 14,000 km of ice-shelf area in recent years. During this time George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) has remained relatively intact, but it is now reaching its theoretical limit of viability. Epishelf lakes, formed when ice shelves dam the mouths of marine embayments, accumulate sediments that can be used to constrain past ice-shelf behaviour. They are stratified water bodies with an upper layer of fresh meltwater overlying amarine layer of water. Multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core fromMoutonnee Lake, an epishelf lake dammed byGVIIS on the east coast of Alexander Island, has recently shown that it retreated to at least the Ablation Point area in the earlyHolocene, ca. 96007500 years BP, demonstrating its vulnerability to periods of atmospheric and oceanic warmth. This study tests this interpretation of ice-shelf collapse through detailed analyses of granulometric, geochemical and Sr and Nd isotope provenance data for N8 mm clasts from the same cores. Clast data from Moutonnee Lakewere comparedwith geological reference data from two further lakes onAlexander Island (Ablation Lake andCitadel Bastion Lake) and an extensive archive of rocks and isotope-geochemical provenance data from the Antarctic Peninsula region. Underpinning this provenance analysis is the contrast between the plutonic/igneous outcrops in Palmer Land on the western side and the predominantly sedimentary strata of Alexander Island on the eastern side of George VI Sound, and the different patterns in their deposition that would be expected at Moutonnee Lake during periods of ice-shelf presence and absence. Results show that changes in clast distribution and provenance reflect the early Holocene retreat and reformation of George VI Ice Shelf at Moutonnee Lake. The period of ice-shelf retreat was marked by the onset of marine conditions in the basin followed by a rapidly deposited zone of clasts whose provenance, distribution, varied lithology and larger than average clast size are indicative of a period of lake ice disintegration and ice-rafted debris deposition between ca. 96008450 years BP. Igneous clasts in the ice-rafted debris have a close affinity with the plutonic provinces of western Palmer Land suggesting transport to the site by icebergs or recycling through Alexander Island strata/ moraines. When epishelf lake conditions returned after ca. 7500 years BP, the clasts were smaller, the number of lithologies more limited and the assemblage dominated by olive-green vitric tuff and pale-green rhyolitic clasts that isotope data link to Early Cretaceous volcanic activity in Palmer Land. Their dominance in the upper part of the core most likely relates to increased Corresponding author. Fax: +44 1223 362616. E-mail address: sjro@bas.ac.uk (S.J.

All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: Clasts N 8 mm in cores from three lakes on eastern Alexander Island can provide a proxy measure of changes in the configuration ofGVIIS. TheMoutonnee Lake core has significant changes in clast type and density that are coupled to retreat phases of GVIIS and, most likely, re-advance phases of local catchment glaciers in Moutonnee Valley.281S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258283 The early Holocene retreat of GVIIS in the Ablation Point area (Bentley et al., 2005) is marked by a distinct depositional shift from a more ordered assemblage and low number of clast types when the ice-shelf is present to a more chaotic distribution of clasts and more numerous clast types during the period when the ice-shelf was absent. During periods of ice-shelf loss, the lithological assemblage is dominated by a range of exotic clasts. Iceberg rafting of material is likely to be the dominant sedimentary process during periods of ice-shelf loss. Sub-glacial flow through the ice-shelf is relatively minor compared to the input of material from local catchment glaciers and iceberg rafting. Further isotopic and age analyses of volcanic outcrops on Alexander Island and NW Palmer Land are necessary to determine provenance more precisely. This is a substantial undertaking, beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, data presented in this paper have identified six modes of clast transport highlighting the complex provenance and depositional processes in Moutonnee Lake and the GVIIS epishelf lake sedimentary system along the eastern coast of Alexander Island."
__label__UNRELATED	"Sulphur emissions to the stratosphere from explosive volcanic eruptions  Abstract: Two methods were used to quantify the flux of volcanic sulphur (as the equivalent mass of SO2) to the stratosphere over different timescales during the Holocene. A combination of satellite-based measurements of sulphur yields from recent explosive volcanic eruptions with an appropriate rate of explosive volcanism for the past 200 years constrains the medium-term (F10 years) flux of volcanic sulphur to the stratosphere to be F1 Mt a, with lower and upper bounds of 0.3 and 3 Mt a. The short-term (F10to 20-year) flux due to small magnitude (1010 kg) eruptions is of the order of 0.4 Mt a. At any time the instantaneous levels of sulphur in the stratosphere are dominated by the most recent (03 years) volcanic events. The flux calculations do not attempt to address this very short timescale variability. Although there are significant errors associated with the raw sulphur emission data on which this analysis is based, the approach presented is general and may be readily modified as the quantity and quality of the data improve. Data from a Greenland ice core support these conclusions. Integration of the sulphate signals from presumed volcanic sources recorded in the GISP2 core provides a minimum estimate of the 10year volcanic SO2 flux to the stratosphere of 0.51 Mt a over the past 9000 years. The short-term flux calculations do not account for the impact of rare, large events. The ice-core record does not fully account for the contribution from small, frequent events. Conclusions: Over a timescale of F102 years, the SO2 flux from explosive volcanic eruptions to the stratosphere is F1 Mt a1. We estimate that F0.4 Mt a1 of this flux is accounted for by high-latitude magnitude-three and magnitude-four eruptions, which together have a recurrence rate of 1.2 a1. More than 50% of eruption columns which reach the stratosphere are due to eruptions of magnitude three north of 40oN. However, the long-term stratospheric sulphate budget is dominated by volcanic eruptions of magnitudes four or larger. The record of residual sulphate peaks in the GISP2 Greenland ice core suggests that the minimum flux of volcanic sulphur to the stratosphere during the Holocene has varied between F0.5 and 1 Mt SO2 a1. The sulphate concentration of the ice cores place an upper limit on the sulphur flux into the stratosphere of F1.8 Mt a1. These flux estimates are not intended to be applied on an annual basis, or to describe instantaneous rate of volcanic sulphur emission to the stratosphere. The calculated fluxes are also not intended to be used as predictors of the significance of any particular volcanic event, but might best be used for comparison with marine and anthropogenic sources of global atmospheric sulphur.Acknowledgements We are grateful to Slimane Bekki for discussion, to Greg Zielinski, Bill Rose and Terry Gerlach for vigorous and detailed reviews, and to G.

__label__SUPPORT	"Possible correlation of Oligocene climate changes with Ethiopian Oligocene ignimbrite eruptions  Abstract: The Oligocene Ethiopian continental flood basalt province (ca. 2931 Ma) contains significant silicic pyroclastic rocks (>60,000 km constituting up to 20% of the volcanic stratigraphy). Rhyolitic tephras, synchronous with the Ethiopian silicic pyroclastic rocks, are found in Indian Ocean ODP holes 711A. They are geochemically akin to the Ethiopian silicic pyroclastic rocks. This suggests that the Indian Ocean tephras originated from Ethiopian silicic eruptions and represents more distal fallout of this volcanism. The temporal coincidence of the Ethiopian flood volcanism with the Oligocene global cooling event (Oi2 30.3 Ma) and the emplacement of the Ethiopian silicic pyroclastic eruptions on a near-global scale strongly suggest that the Ethiopian continental flood basalt province may have contributed or at least accelerated the climate change that was already underway."
__label__UNRELATED	"The midCretaceous North Atlantic nutrient trap: Black shales and OAEs  Abstract: [1] Organicrich sediments are the salient marine sedimentation product in the midCretaceous of the ocean basins formed in the Mesozoic. Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are discrete and particularly organicrich intervals within these midCretaceous organicrich sequences and are defined by pronounced carbon isotope excursions. Marine productivity during OAEs appears to have been enhanced by the increased availability of biolimiting nutrients in seawater due to hydrothermal alteration of submarine basalts in the Pacific and proto Indian oceans. The exact mechanisms behind the deposition of organicrich sediments in the midCretaceous are still a matter of discussion, but a hypothesis which is often put forward is that their deposition was a consequence of the coupling of a particular paleogeography with changes in ocean circulation and nutrient supply. In this study, we used a global coupled climate model to investigate oceanic processes that affect the interbasinal exchange of nutrients as well as their spatial distribution and bioavailability. We conclude that the midCretaceous North Atlantic was a nutrient trap as a consequence of an estuarine circulation with respect to the Pacific. Organicrich sediments in the North Atlantic were deposited below regions of intense upwelling. We suggest that enhanced productivity during OAEs was a consequence of upwelling of Pacific derived nutrientrich seawater associated with submarine igneous events. 4. Conclusions: [29] In the midCretaceous, the productivity associated with the formation of black shales was triggered by changes in ocean circulation whereby the Mesozoic ocean basins, the North Atlantic in particular, became estuarine with respect to the Pacific Ocean. This oceanographic regime transformed the North Atlantic into a nutrient trap and promoted conditions of low oxygen, low carbonate, high heavy/trace metals and the accumulation of organicrich sediments on the seafloor below regions of intense wind driven upwelling. [30] The accumulation and preservation of marine organic matter in these sediments was enhanced by midCretaceous warm seawater temperatures, i.e., lower seawater oxygensolubility, and by midCretaceous transgressive pulses which prevented dilution of the neritic sediments by siliciclastics. [31] OAEs occur intercalated with these organicrich sediments and are characterized by higher TOC, important elemental anomalies and globally synchronous perturbations in the carbon isotope record. Furthermore, they are coeval with important submarine volcanic events in the Pacific. For this reason, we suggest that intermediate seawater entering the North Atlantic through the Central American Seaway was more nutrient rich during OAEs even though the oceanographic mechanism leading to the deposition of organicrich sediments essentially remained unchanged.[32] Acknowledgments.

__label__SUPPORT	"Evaluating the link between the sulfur-rich Laacher See volcanic eruption and the Younger Dryas climate anomaly  Abstract: The Younger Dryas is considered the archetypal millennial-scale climate change event, and identifying its cause is fundamental for thoroughly understanding climate systematics during deglaciations. However, the mechanisms responsible for its initiation remain elusive, and both of the most researched triggers (a meltwater pulse or a bolide impact) are controversial. Here, we consider the problem from a different perspective and explore a hypothesis that Younger Dryas climate shifts were catalysed by the unusually sulfurrich 12.880 0.040 ka BP eruption of the Laacher See volcano (Germany). We use the most recent chronology for the GISP2 ice core ion dataset from the Greenland ice sheet to identify a large volcanic sulfur spike coincident with both the Laacher See eruption and the onset of Younger Dryasrelated cooling in Greenland (i.e. the most recent abrupt Greenland millennial-scale cooling event, the Greenland Stadial 1, GS-1). Previously published lake sediment and stalagmite records confirm that the eruptions timing was indistinguishable from the onset of cooling across the North Atlantic but that it preceded westerly wind repositioning over central Europe by 200 years. We suggest that the initial short-lived volcanic sulfate aerosol cooling was amplified by ocean circulation shifts and/or sea ice expansion, gradually cooling the North Atlantic region and incrementally shifting the midlatitude westerlies to the south. The aerosol-related cooling probably only lasted 13 years, and the majority of Younger Dryas-related cooling may have been due to the seaiceocean circulation positive feedback, which was particularly effective during the intermediate ice volume conditions characteristic of 13 ka BP. We conclude that the large and sulfur-rich Laacher See eruption should be considered a viable trigger for the Younger Dryas. However, future studies should prioritise climate modelling of high-latitude volcanism during deglacial boundary conditions in order to test the hypothesis proposed here. 4 Conclusions: We propose that the unusually sulfur-rich 12.880 0.040 ka BP Laacher See volcanic eruption initiated GS-1 cooling and the atmospheric reorganisation associated with the YD event. Recent revisions to the chronological framework of key European climate archives now strongly suggest that the onset of GS-1-related North Atlantic cooling occurred simultaneously with the LSE. We have identified a large volcanic sulfur spike within the GISP2 ion data (Zielinski et al., 1997) on the recent GICC05modelext chronology that coincides with both the onset of GS-1 cooling as recorded within the same ice core and the date of the LSE. Lipid biomarker hydrogen isotope ratios from Meerfelder Maar further corroborate that GS-1 atmospheric cooling began at 12.880 ka BP, coincident with the Laacher See Tephra within the same sediment but preceding the larger dynamical atmospheric response associated with the YD in central Europe by 170 years (Rach et al., 2014). Aerosol-induced cooling immediately following the eruption may have caused a positive feedback involving sea ice expansion and/or AMOC weakening, as previously proposed for other Greenland stadials over the interval 3080 ka BP (Baldini et al., 2015a), the 6th century AD (Buntgen et al., 2016), the Little Ice Age (Zhong et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012), and the Holocene in general (Kobashi et al., 2017). Viewed from this perspective, the YD was simply the latest, and last, manifestation of a last glacial stadial.The strongly asymmetric nature of the sulfate aerosol veil released by the LSE cooled the Northern Hemisphere preferentially, inducing a strong hemispheric temperature asymmetry and potentially triggering a cascade of dynamical climate shifts across both hemispheres, including a southward-shifted ITCZ and Hadley cells. Intermediate ice volume conditions around 13 ka BP, driven by rising insolation during the Last Glacial termination, may have promoted a positive feedback following the LSEs injection of between 6.76 and 104.8 Mt of SO2 into the stratosphere (Textor et al., 2003). This is also consistent with observations that YD-type events were not unique to the last deglaciation but existed during older deglaciations as well (Broecker et al., 2010). At least one high-latitude M6 eruption likely occurred during most deglacial intervals, and therefore GS-1 and earlier YD-type events may simply reflect the convergence of large, sulfaterich high-latitude NH eruptions with intermediate ice volume conditions. NH continental ice sheet decay induced continental lithospheric unloading and may have triggered highlatitude NH volcanism (Zielinski et al., 1997; Sternai et al., 2016), highlighting the intriguing possibility that eruptions such as the LSE were not randomly distributed geographically and temporally but instead were intrinsically linked to deglaciation. This perspective is strongly supported by a previous observation that the three largest eruptions (including the LSE) in the East Eifel Volcanic Field (Germany) were all associated with warming during glacial terminations and the reduction in ice mass in northern Europe (Nowell et al., 2006).The hypothesis that the Laacher See eruption triggered the YD is testable. Detailed tephrochronological studies of the ice containing the sulfate spike identified here could confirm the source of the sulfate, and, if it is confirmed as the LSE rather than a smaller Icelandic eruption, this would provide an important step towards attributing GS-1 and the YD to volcanic forcing (although evidence of GS-1 cooling already seems to occur immediately above the LST in central Europe). Similarly, volcanic sulfate triple isotope ratios of sulfur and oxygen provide information regarding the residence time of volcanic plumes in the stratosphere. The majority of atmospheric processes encourage mass-dependent fractionation; however, rare mass-independent fractionation processes produce isotope ratios that do not behave according to predictions based on mass-dependent processes (Martin et al., 2014). Historical volcanic eruptions where sulfate aerosols reached the stratosphere have been successfully identified in ice cores (Baroni et al., 2008; Savarino et al., 2003), indicating that the technique is effective at distinguishing large explosive eruptions from smaller local ones. This technique could also determine if the sulfate in the potential LSE sulfate spike reached the stratosphere. Although this would not necessarily confirm the LSE as the source, it would strongly suggest that the sulfate was derived from a climatologically significant eruption rather than a smaller Icelandic one. Most importantly, more climate modelling studies of high-latitude, large, and sulfur-rich eruptions under deglacial boundary conditions are needed to constrain the climate effects of volcanism during deglaciation. The role of halogen emissions are particularly understudied, and modelling efforts should also quantify their effects on climate.Clim. Past, 14, 969990, 2018 www.clim-past.net/14/969/2018/Finally, accurate dating of other large volcanic eruptions during intermediate ice volume conditions is key to testing the link between volcanism and other Greenland stadials; this information could eventually also support, or refute, the LSEs role in triggering the YD.More research is clearly necessary to better characterise the sensitivity of Last Glacial climate to volcanic eruption latitude, sulfur content, and magnitude. Due to perceived chronological mismatches, the concept that the YD was triggered by the LSE is vastly understudied compared to both the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis and the meltwater forcing hypothesis. However, the concept that the LSE triggered the YD has clear advantages compared to other hypotheses: (i) there is no disagreement that the eruption occurred, (ii) available evidence suggests that the eruption occurred synchronously with the initiation of YD cooling, (iii) a volcanic trigger is consistent with the relatively high frequency of similar, and often more severe, cooling events during intermediate ice volume conditions, (iv) volcanic aerosol cooling followed by a prolonged positive feedback has been implicated in other cooling events, and (v) events similar to the YD occurred over other deglaciations, supporting a relatively commonplace trigger such as volcanism. Future research may well demonstrate that the Laacher See eruption did not play any role in catalysing the YD, but the coincidence of a large, high-latitude, and anomalously sulfur-rich eruption with the initiation of YD-related cooling merits serious further consideration.Data availability.

__label__UNRELATED	"Glaciochemical evidence in an East Antarctica ice core of a recent (AD 14501850) neoglacial episode  Abstract: [1] Chemical analysis of a shallow (82.5 m) ice core from a location (DT263) in the essentially unexplored area of Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica, has been used to construct a continuous, high-resolution 780-year (AD 12071996) glaciochemical record. During the twentieth century, snow accumulation rates and concentrations of chemical species in snow appear to be stable with short-term variations, indicating relatively stable and warm climatic conditions. The period of AD 14501850 in this record is characterized by sharply reduced snow accumulation rates and decreased concentrations of several chemical species that suffer postdepositional losses linked to very low accumulation rates. These characteristics are consistent with colder climatic conditions and suggest that this is likely a neoglacial episode. The timing of this episode coincides with the Little Ice Age (LIA), a relatively cold period in the Northern Hemisphere between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the end of the nineteenth century. Evidence in ice core and sedimentary records also indicates neoglacial conditions in some Southern Hemisphere locations during the general time frame of LIA. The DT263 record, along with a few published ice core records, points to the existence of an LIA-type climatic episode in Antarctica between the fifteenth century and the twentieth century. However, other Antarctic ice core records show no such evidence. Together, these records highlight the regional differences in Holocene climate variations in Antarctica. The DT263 record suggests that colder and drier conditions prevailed during the LIA time period at the eastern Indian Ocean sector of East Antarctica. 4. Conclusions: [30] A shallow ice core from the Princess Elizabeth Land region of East Antarctica was analyzed for chemical composition. The chemical records from this core cover the last 780 years (AD 12071996). Snow annual accumulation rates calculated from annually dated snow layers and from volcanic time stratigraphic markers indicate that the average accumulation rate during the period between the midfifteenth century and the early or mid-nineteenth century was much reduced compared with those of the earlier period (the early thirteenth century to the mid-fifteenth century) and the later period (the late nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century). For instance, the average accumulation rate between 1450 and 1810 is nearly 80% lower than the twentieth century average. Such sharply reduced accumulation suggests that the climate conditions in this region during this period of 400 years (approximately 14501850) were colder than the earlier and later periods. Further evidence of reduced accumulation and therefore of colderclimate during this period is found in the decreased concentrations of chemical species that are reversibly deposited in snow. [31] This period of unusually cold climate conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean sector in East Antarctica coincides with the time frame of the Little Ice Age, which has been found to be a common neoglacial episode in many Northern Hemisphere locations and in a few places in the Southern Hemisphere. However, evidence from Antarctica ice core records does not consistently support a continent-wide neoglacial episode between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the end of the nineteenth century. Therefore regional differences in Antarctic climate variations during the LIA time period appear to be very important when assessing climate history during the last millennium. [32] Due to the general lack of glaciological information (e.g., ice flow) from this region of Antarctica, the conclusions based on the DT263 record are tentative and will need to be verified by additional information from ice cores and other glaciological archives in this region.[33] Acknowledgments.

__label__SUPPORT	"Thermal erosion of cratonic lithosphere as a potential trigger for mass-extinction  Abstract: The temporal coincidence between large igneous provinces (LIPs) and mass extinctions has led many to pose a causal relationship between the two. However, there is still no consensus on a mechanistic model that explains how magmatism leads to the turnover of terrestrial and marine plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Here we present a synthesis of ammonite biostratigraphy, isotopic data and high precision U-Pb zircon dates from the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) and Pliensbachian-Toarcian (Pl-To) boundaries demonstrating that these biotic crises are both associated with rapid change from an initial cool period to greenhouse conditions. We explain these transitions as a result of changing gas species emitted during the progressive thermal erosion of cratonic lithosphere by plume activity or internal heating of the lithosphere. Our petrological model for LIP magmatism argues that initial gas emission was dominated by sulfur liberated from sulfide-bearing cratonic lithosphere before CO2 became the dominant gas. This model offers an explanation of why LIPs erupted through oceanic lithosphere are not associated with climatic and biotic crises comparable to LIPs emitted through cratonic lithosphere."

They host the largest-known porphyry copper deposits (e.g., Rio BlancoLos BroncesLos Sulfatos, El Teniente, Chuquicamata) as well as many of theworld's largest epithermal AuAg deposits (e.g., Yanacocha, Lagunas Norte, PascuaLama, Veladero: Sillitoe, 2008). The vast majority of Andean epithermal deposits containing N10 Moz Au are of highsulfidation type. These deposits have a close link to a magmatic source for fluids, volatiles and metals (e.g., Deyell et al., 2004; Rye, 1993) but form at depths of typically less than 1 km (e.g. Sillitoe, 2010) and consequentlymineralizingprocesses are influenced by the near-surface physicochemical environment. The main focus of this review is on deposits and districts where the bulk of the precious metal is contained in the epithermal environment, i.e., the shallow part of magmatichydrothermal systems, and concentrates on the physiographic environment of epithermal mineralization. This paper does not discuss major porphyry Cu deposits in detail, although the shallow portions of many of these have been overprinted by epithermal mineralization or alteration (e.g., Masterman et al., 2004; Ossandon et al., 2001). Similarly, the deposits hosting Sn, W, Ag and Au ores in the eastern 15. Conclusions: High-sulfidation epithermal deposits of the Andes formed in predictable geological and geomorphological settings. They are located at high elevation and largely near the crest of the Andean cordillera in segments where volcanism is currently absent or subdued and where subduction angles are shallow. All were emplaced during major periods of contractile deformation and uplift andmost coincidedwith the terminal stages of local arc magmatism. The vast majority of deposits are between ca. 17 and 5 Ma old. Although the tectonic setting in which these deposits form makes them prone to erosion, their restricted age range is not only a function of preservation potential but also attributed to favorable tectonomagmatic settings at the time of hydrothermal activity. Eocene high-sulfidation epithermal deposits are only known from the driest regions of the Atacama Desert but they plausibly formed under similar tectonomagmatic conditions as the Miocene ones.

Fluid boiling and mixing with meteoric water are enhanced near topographic breaks such as the heads of incising valleys or backscarps of pediments, ultimately stimulating mineralization in those locations."
__label__UNRELATED	"Lake level change, climate, and the impact of natural events: the role of seismic and volcanic events in the formation of the Lake Patzcuaro Basin, Michoacan, Mexico  Abstract: In Central Mexico, lake-level change is commonly used as a proxy for climatic fluctuation. Lacustrine sequences are not stable units, however, and have been dramatically impacted by processes related to the evolution of the Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB) and the fragmentation of the southern part of the North American plate including volcanism, tectonic action, landslides, and human activity. One notable example is the Lake Patzcuaro Basin, Mexico, which has one of the most intensively studied paleoenvironmental records in Latin America. Geologic processes have altered the lacustrine sequence in the southwest portion of the lake basin during the last 48,000 years. These include volcanic activity, major uplift, landslides and related tsunamis, and earthquakes. This new record has important implications for interpretations of climatic events in Central Mexico during the Pleistocene, and the impact these may have had on human settlement in the region. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: We consider that the lakes in the Mexican Volcanic Belt in the last thousand years have played an active role in the evolution of humans. The water bodies are the most significant and clear records of the geological events, climatic changes and the impact of human activities. Most of these events have been registered in the assemblage of sediments. To understand the functioning of these variables will give us a clearer vision of the interactions in the lacustrine record. Tectonic and volcanic processes have altered the sedimentation of Lake Patzcuaro in the last 40,000 years. For example, in the zone of Jaracuaro a great uplift of silts took place, caused by two factors; magmatic intrusions and landslide from El Estribo volcano. These two processes caused substantial changes in the sedimentation rate comparable to the one generated by anthropogenic processes. We consider that the problem of erosion into the lake has not been sufficiently studied, since the estimates obtained so far are solely based on models that only give a point of view according to the data used. They will be nearer or distant from reality, depending on the data from which the model was constructed. To solve this problem, it isrequired to extract cores with techniques that will allow us to obtain intact material, because it has been seen that the sediments contain a high percentage of saturation by water. Frozen cores and precise sediment dating are required. The seismic effects in the lake are a part of its evolution and have direct influence on its recharge. An earthquake causes openings in the fractures from which there would be contributions to the lake. However, an earthquake also represents a phenomenon of slope instability that in Patzcuaro caused the landslide of El Estribo, the collapse of El Metate and surely the one on the island of Janitzio. These collapses and earthquakes are manifested in the lake, with the increase in the water level, with the compression of water saturated clays, and the generation of small tsunamis (such as the one in 1858). In earthquakes with similar characteristics to those in 1845 and 1858, it is evident that the region of the lake behaves like an island, resulting in damages of IX degrees in intensity on the modified Mercalli scale. The magnitudes of three known events are higher than 6, which had devastating consequences for the town of Patzcuaro. Tectonic and the volcanic process in the Mexican Volcanic Belt produce significant deformation in lacustrine sequences that must be considered when evaluating the causality of deposition. Seismical studies in progress will elucidate the lakes geometry and the times and mechanism of sediment inputs."
__label__SUPPORT	"A detection of Milankovitch frequencies in global volcanic activity  Abstract: A rigorous detection of Milankovitch periodicities in volcanic output across the PleistoceneHolocene ice age has remained elusive. We report on a spectral analysis of a large number of well-preserved ash plume deposits recorded in marine sediments along the Pacifi c Ring of Fire. Our analysis yields a statistically signifi cant detection of a spectral peak at the obliquity period. We propose that this variability in volcanic activity results from crustal stress changes associated with ice age mass redistribution. In particular, increased volcanism lags behind the highest rate of increasing eustatic sea level (decreasing global ice volume) by 4.0 3.6 k.y. and correlates with numerical predictions of stress changes at volcanically active sites. These results support the presence of a causal link between variations in ice age climate, continental stress fi eld, and volcanism.

__label__UNRELATED	"Fingerprinting facies of the Tuff IF marker, with implications for early hominin palaeoecology, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania  Abstract: The top of Tuff IF marks the upper boundary of the Plio-/Pleistocene Bed I succession exposed in Olduvai Gorge, NE Tanzania, a tephrostratigraphic interval that is well known for remarkable Oldowan archaeological and vertebrate fossil assemblages, including early hominins. Geochemically, Tuff IF is characterized by a relatively consistent silica-undersaturated trachytic to phonolitic composition that relates both in terms of numerical ages (1.79Ma) and compositional constraints toOlmoti volcano, located 2238 kmEofOlduvaiGorge. Measured Tuff IF sections are characterized by a thick unwelded pyroclastic flow in proximal settings and a succession of surges and ashfalls that interfingers with fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the Olduvai Basin in the medial to distal settings. Only in those areas with a relatively low topographic gradient, in distal reaches and beyond the toe of an Olmoti-sourced volcaniclastic fan, did the Tuff IF marker develop a typical threefold subdivision comprising: (1) primary surges andminor fallout, (2) reworked pumice units as lateral correlatives of proximally emplaced pyroclastic flows and (3) a succession of mass flows in conjunction with aeolian and fluvially reworked units. The pyroclastic marker unit is thus highly heterogeneous with regard to its vertical and lateral facies architecture and this has immediate effects on its preservation potential and in situ burial of fossils and stone artifacts. Even though the volcanically-related environmental perturbationswere probablymore severe at the eastern lakemargin, the evidence for at least temporary freshwater sources and trees suggests environments conducive to hominin activities, but not during emplacement of Tuff IF pyroclastic flows and surges. This inference is supported by the presence of rich Oldowan stone artifact assemblages immediately preceding and following the deposition of Tuff IF, but only extremely sparse archaeological traces from one site in Tuff IF, restricted to the upper, fluvially reworked portion of Tuff IF. Tuff IF facies record the maximum of a regressive (drying) cycle that correlates with regional marine arid indicators. An ecological crisis covering 20003500 a of time during Tuff IF deposition resulted not only from the lethal effects of explosive volcanism but also from its coincidence with a pronounced period of climate induced drought. These combined effects appear to have made at least the eastern basin uninhabitable by hominins and other vertebrates for most of the time during which Tuff IF accumulated. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: Tuff IF is the most widespread of the Bed I marker tuffs and resulted from a series of explosive eruptions of its trachytic-phonolitic Olmoti volcanic source, alternating with and finally followed by times of massive tephra reworking. Measured Tuff IF sections are characterized by a thick unwelded ignimbrite in proximal settings and a succession of surges and ashfalls in the medial to distal settings. Only in those areas with a relatively gentle pre-eruptive topographic gradient, on and beyond the toe of the Olmoti-sourced volcaniclastic fan, did the pyroclastic marker unit Tuff IF develop its typical threefold subdivision consisting of: (1) primary surges and minor fallout, (2) reworked pumice units as lateral correlatives of proximally emplaced pyroclastic flows and (3) a succession of mass flows in conjunction with aeolian and fluvially reworked units. The pyroclastic marker unit is highly heterogeneous with regard to its vertical and lateral facies architecture and this has immediate effects on the preservation potential and in situ burial of fossils and stone artifacts, for example Level 1 at FLK-N in uppermost Bed I (Leakey, 1971). The upper, fluvially reworked subunit of Tuff IF may contain redeposited materials from strata lower in the stratigraphy. This is particularly valid for the FLK-N complex where Leakey (1971) documented channelized units of reworked IF tephra that eroded down sufficiently far that the IFbraided fluvial unit comes to sit directly on waxy claystones that underlie the tuff marker bed elsewhere.Facies analysis also shows that saline-alkaline Lake Olduvai was not only fed by fresh-water spring systems of lake-margin wetlands (Deocampo and Ashley, 1999) but also by shallow braided river channels associated with a volcaniclastic fan system draining the Volcanic Highlands at its eastern and southern margins. Moreover, beyond the former eastern lake margins evidence for the existence of temporary water sources such as floodplain pools has been deduced from Tuff IF lithofacies interpretation in the upstream areas of such rivers. In an otherwise inhospitable landscape these may have acted as important freshwater sources for large mammals and hominins. Prior and after emplacement of Tuff IF pyroclastic flows and surges it is the toe of the river-dissected volcaniclastic fan at the eastern lake margin where Bamford (2005), Bamford et al. (2006) and Albert et al. (2006) found evidence for tree vegetation, including palms and where hominin activities appear to be concentrated (Leakey and Hay, 1982; Blumenschine et al., 2003). This is particularly valid for times of low lake level, when Lake Olduvai was contracted to a minimum size and freshwater wetlands could form at the toe of the Olmoti sourced drainages. Flushing of the wetland sediment by meteoric and fluvially sourced waters then favoured rich vegetation, including trees in the eastern lake margin area.In contrast, only a few archaeological sites in upper Bed I sediments have been published from the western lake margin so far (Hay, 1976; Blumenschine et al., 2003) even though proximaldistal changes in facies and thickness of the pyroclastic units, suggest that the volcanically-related environmental perturbations were probably less severe to the west of the lake in contrast with its eastern side. Environments of the western part of the basin were also more stable in terms of lake level fluctuations even though lake transgressions and regressions may be expressed there by variations in salinity.The recognition of a complete drying out of Lake Olduvai during Tuff IF times considerably changes palaeoecological reconstructions of the area and consequently also the assessment of future hominin excavation sites. The drying episode that caused the lake regression near the top of Bed I had not ended by the time Tuff IF was deposited. It was only ended by the onset of Tuff IF fluvial reworking such that the topmost fluvially reworked and frequently rooted part of Tuff IF signals the return of increasingly wetter conditions contemporaneous to lake level rise and the recolonization of the volcanic hazard area by plants and animals.Harris and Van Couvering (1995) have described how a mock aridity is caused by volcanism. However in the case of Tuff IF where volcanism coincided with a real aridity crisis, the volcanically induced mock aridity effects would have superimposed themselves on top of the climatic extreme. Considering that Tuff IF covers a complete transgressive/regressive cycle with an average duration of 4000 a, the resulting ecological crisis caused by the combined effects of Tuff IF volcanism and climate-induced drought would have lasted 2000 3500 a (cf. Fig. 21B). This most probably reduced the abundance and variety of resources for hominins to unsustainable levels."
__label__UNRELATED	"Recent low-latitude freezethaw on Mars  Abstract: Outside polar latitudes, features corresponding to surface thaw have yet to be identified on Mars. The youthful gully landforms observed at mid-high latitude [Malin, M., Edgett, K., 2000. Science 288, 23302335] are the nearest candidate, but the source (and nature) of the gully carving agent remains controversial [e.g., Musselwhite, D.S., Swindle, T.D., Lunine, J.I., 2001. Geophys. Res. Lett. 28, 12831285; Mellon, M.T., Phillips, R.J., 2001. J. Geophys. Res. 106, 115; Knauth, L.P., Burt, D.M., 2002. Icarus 158, 267271; Costard, F., Forget, F., Mangold, N., Peulvast, J.P., 2002. Science 295, 110113; Christensen, P.R., 2003. Nature 422, 4548; Treiman, A.H., 2003. J. Geophys. Res. 108]. At higher obliquity than the present epoch, near-surface ground ice should be present globally [Mellon, M.T., Jakosky, B.M., 1995. J. Geophys. Res. 100 (E6), 1178111799], populated by condensation of atmospheric water vapour in the top few metres of the regolith, or emplaced as dusty ice sheets reaching down towards the equator. The latitudinal restriction of these gullies to regions poleward of 30 appears to argue against a thaw component to their formationsince ground ice is present and stable at all latitudes at high obliquity, the current (low) obliquity regime should result in ground ice thaw at low latitudes, where insolation and daytime temperatures are currently greatest, and this is not observed. A previously undescribed meltwater sequence in the Cerberus plains, at 20 N/187 E, shows that comparable, but much more continuous, and mappable melting and surface runoff have occurred in the geologically recent past at near-equatorial latitudes on Mars. Polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains is seen by the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) to suffer sequential, regional-scale volatile-loss consistent with thaw of near-surface ground ice under periglacial conditions. This degradation is continuously sampled by a single MOC strip, showing an icy landscape undergoing thaw modification and collapse, and may form the first evidence of equatorial wet-based glaciation during late Amazonian time, with indications of melting within the last million years. The dissolution and re-formation of polygonal ground links this landform to freezethaw processes, providing the conclusion to a question that has been the subject of debate for three decadeswhether Mars polygonal grounds require ice to formand a consistent explanation for the fate of the water that carved the great outflow channels, much of which may still reside as ground ice in the regolith. This thaw occurs in the Cerberus Formation; deposits that are considered to be magmatic in origin, and the type formation for late-stage, plains-style volcanism on Mars [Keszthelyi, L., McEwen, A.S., Thordarson T., 2000. J. Geophys. Res. 105, 1502715049]. By superposing large numbers of small impact craters, polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains sustains previous suggestions of a non-magmatic origin for this and other landforms in the region [Page, D.P., Murray, J.B., 2006. Icarus 183, 4654]. Together, these periglacial landforms document evidence of climate change much younger than is currently recognised by crater counts, with important implications for age constraints on young surfaces and absolute age determinations by this method. It is tentatively suggested that this melting may be occurring today, with a striking correspondence between permafrost thaw in the Cerberus plains, the high atmospheric methane flux currently observed over this region [Mumma, M.J., Novak, R.E., DiSanti, M.A., Bonev, B.P., Dello Russo, N., 2004. Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 36, 1127; Krasnopolsky, V.A., Maillard, J.P., Owen, T.C., 2004. Icarus 172, 537547; Formisano, V., Atreya, S., Encrenaz, T., Ignatiev, N., Giuranna, M., 2004. Science 306, 17581761], and the only latitude zone on Marsequatorward of 30 Nwhere melting of ground ice is thought possible in the current climate [Haberle, R.M., McKay, C.P., Schaeffer, J., Cabrol, N.A., Grin, E.A., Zent, A.P., Quinn, R., 2001. J. Geophys. Res. 106 (E10), 2331723326; Lobitz, B., Wood, B.L., Averner, M.M., McKay, C.P., 2001. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98, 21322137]. Low-latitude polygonal ground as transient, and hydrologically active over wide areas transforms our understanding of the recent climatic evolution of Mars, supporting models of atmospheric water-ice migration [Mischna, M., Richardson, M.I., Wilson, R.J., McCleese, D.J., 2003. J. Geophys. Res. 108 (E6). 5062], complex, volatile stratigraphies [Clifford, S.M., Parker, T.J., 2001. Icarus 154, 40 79], and hypothesised, geologically recent ice ages [Head, J.W., Mustard, J.F., Kreslavsky, M.A., Milliken, R.E., Marchant, D.R., 2003. Nature 426, 797802]. The temporal coincidence of glacial epochs on the Earth and Mars during the Quaternary and latest Amazonian would suggest a coupled system linking both [Sagan, C., Young, A.T., 1973. Nature 243, 459]. E-mail address: d.p.page@open.ac.uk. 0019-1035/$ see front matter 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2007.01.005 84 D.P. Page / Icarus 189 (2007) 83117 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: Polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains is dynamic and secondary in origin, its thaw in Marte Vallis linking this landform to thermal contraction processes in ice-rich regolith. Meltwa-ter streams derived from this thaw can be continuously traced for over 15 km [an order of magnitude greater than other geologically recent surface runoff on Mars (e.g., Malin and Edgett, 2000)], pond in an enclosed lake, and connect distinct associations of process-related thaw features. Polygonal ground takes part in this runoff, preserving evidence of freezethaw cyclingthe first such for Mars. This degradation is only partial, so it is possible that a large metastable ground ice mass, in diffusive disequilibrium with the current atmosphere, remains.The spatial arrangement of these deposits parallels those of terrestrial periglacial environments; were a sequence exhibiting these proximal to distal relationships developed on Earth, there would be little hesitation in ascribing an ice-marginal, periglacial origin (e.g., see Baker et al., 2003). This explanation is consistently extended to other examples of patterned ground [i.e., the superposition of putative rootless cones and platy deposits in the Athabasca Valles (Page and Murray, 2006)], as the predicted expression of recognised periglacial phenomena, and questions the view of platy, patterned ground as magmatic the principal evidence for geologically recent flood volcanism on Mars (Keszthelyi et al., 2000; Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Plescia, 2003). This may be why low latitude patterned grounds receive so little attention (e.g., Mangold et al., 2004). Although climatic controls are described for such deposits at higher latitudes, it is at low latitude that they are seen in process of change (as might be expected, for this is where they are least stable).The premise of a periglacial origin for the Cerberus Formation is formed by analogy to the terrestrial environment. This interpretation and the hypothesis proposed for secondary landform generation is inductive in nature and not binding, but the morphological inductions (the association of ice-related landforms) and the stratigraphical inductions (the superposition relationships) are consilient. That is, these differing classes of observations converge in unified periglacial explanation, and are a test of the truth of this hypothesisone that is consistent with observed stratigraphical relationships where volcanism is not. By implication, superposition of large numbers of small impact craters also places these landforms in the appropriate (i.e., geologically recent) temporal settinga prime example of the explanatory surprises that are generated by consilient hypotheses (Gould, 2003; Baker, 2003).The spatial correlation between regions of favourable melting, the high atmospheric methane flux and surface thaw in the Cerberus plains adds a climatic element to this convergence, and while the evidence for ongoing melting is largely inferred, permafrost degradation does effectively reconcile thaw at low latitudes with the preponderance of cold-based features seen at mid-high latitudes (i.e., glaciers, viscous flow lobes and lineated valley fill) elsewhere in the northern plains. Whatever the ultimate control on martian climate, the most recent evidence of ground ice thaw would be expected at low latitude, where insolation and daytime temperatures are currently greatest (and where, at low obliquity, the conditions favour ice melting, not accumulation). Sublimation may produce polygonal ground; it may even produce surface pitting; it cannot produce kilometrescale dendritic runoff and intrusive frost mounds. The conclusion of geologically recent hydroclimatic change at low latitudeis certainly more complex (and problematic) than outlined here, but may help resolve open questions over the nature and source of the agent that carved the youthful gullies at higher latitudes (see Heldmann and Mellon, 2004), and the water-generated landforms and landscapes of Mars (that) have proven especially difficult to unite under a single working hypothesis (Baker, 2001).The platy deposits embayed within the crater lake (E) are clearly intraformational. Their thaw and fracture visibly affect (at GI ), and therefore postdate, the polygonal substrate. Fracturing of these and identical platy deposits in Elysium Planitia do not uniquely identify pack ice, but when this also forms the source of unequivocal meltwater features, then an icy origin becomes harder to dismiss. Unless processes operate on Mars that are able to replicate such cold-climate features, in form and spatial arrangement (with direct, well-understood terrestrial analogues), these cannot be lavas, and a significant episode of martian geological history must be reconsidered. The periglacial origin determined for polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains, and the widespread association of platy, polygonal, thermokarstic terrain in Chryse, Utopia and Amazonis Planitia, have implications of global extent. The designation of glaciomarine facies (at Fig. 2, O) considers the Marte Vallis to be a paleo-seaway connecting the platy deposits of the Elysium and Amazonis plains. MOC E05-03487 is proximal to where this outflow channel empties into the Amazonis basin, and the inner contact considered by Parker et al. (1993) to be the shoreline of a former northern polar ocean.This is no subset of the geomorphological evidence; platy, patterned ground is abundant and easily recognised, planetwide at these latitudes, and this freezethaw visible along the distal length of the Marte Vallis and out into the Amazonis plain (e.g., MOCs E05-03487, E17-00257, M03-06377, E02-01361, R23-00683, M11-01536, M22-01079, R14-01144, R15-00973, S09-02331, R14-00254). The similarity of the thermokarst to pitted, polygonal terrain in Mars south polar region, where there is no doubt of its origin (Malin et al., 2001), is striking. Although the substrates differ substantially, a major volatile component is required for formation in both, and recent climate change, the probable cause.That plains-forming deposits in the northern plains of Mars have suffered geologically recent thaw modification, possibly related to deglaciation, has implications that reach far beyond martian climate change. The evidence from the Cerberus region is that the coincidence of climate change on the Earth and Mars is even closer than suspected (e.g., Head et al., 2003), and may continue to this day. As originally suggested by Sagan and Young (1973), parallel climate change on these two planets an ice age Mars coincident with Earths glacial Quaternary periodwould imply a dominant external influence in longerterm climate change on our own planet."
__label__UNRELATED	"Glacial influence on caldera-forming eruptions Introduction: Volcanic influence on climate is a subject of many studies, but the reverse connection, i.e. climate influence on periodicity, size, volume, and character of volcanic eruptions is a rarely visited topic. Recently glaciated and volcanically active regions such as Iceland, Kamchatka, Alaska, and the southern Andes areas may serve as key areas in answering these questions. It has been suggested that deglaciations have increased volcanism in several areas around the world: e.g. Iceland, (Gudmundsson, 1986; Slater et al., 1998) and Sierra Nevada, California (Glazner et al., 1999; Jellinek et al., 2004). The relationship between ice cap retreat and volcanic activity has been evaluated considering unloading effects on both deep mantle melting zones (e.g. Jull and McKenzie, 1996) and shallow magma reservoirs (e.g. Gudmundsson, 1986; Jellinek et al., 2004). On the one hand, the increased eruption rates during glacial unloading are considered to be related to changes in the state of stress of the crust during deglaciation (Gudmundsson, 1986) and the release of magma stored in crustal chambers during the glacial period (Kelemen et al., 1997). On the other hand, it has been suggested that decompression during deglaciation can produce a large increase in mantle melting rates, causing increase in basaltic 6. Summary and conclusions: In this paper, we have investigated how the presence of ice caps during glacial periods and other secondary processes such as hydrothermal alteration or gravitational failure may modify the local stress field discouraging or favouring ring fault initiation and subsequent caldera collapse. For this, we have run a series of 2D plane strain numerical models simulating different scenarios by varying: (1) the thickness and asymmetric distribution of the existing ice cap, (2) the depth and size of the magmatic reservoir responsible for the subsequent collapse event, (3) the thickness and mechanical properties of the roof rock due to the alteration by hydrothermal fluids, (4) the existence of a deeper andwider magmatic reservoir and (5) possible gravitational failure triggered, in part, by the hydrothermal weakening of the roof rock under the glacial cover.In short, we have seen that the existence of ice caps does not favour directly the initiation of ring-faults and caldera formation, since the load of the ice cap tends to reduce the tensile stresses at surface which may inhibit the initiation of ring faults. In many occasions, the resultant stresses are far of reaching the tensile strength of the rock and even of ice, depending on the size and depth of the magmatic system. Nevertheless, tensile stresses induced by ice caps with dimensions of the same order of the volcanic system (including shallow and deep reservoir) may increase fracture-related porosity in the crustal rocks surrounding deep-seated magma chambers augmenting the effective size of such reservoirs. Continuous magma accumulation in these deeper reservoirs, results in doming of the crustal segment where the reservoir is located and starts to have an effect on the stresses in the upper part of the crust. In these situations, the compressive stresses induced by the ice load and the doming stresses due to the deep-seated reservoir counteract. Thus, an augment of the excess pressure inside the deep-seated reservoir and/or a reduction in size of the ice cap due to ice retreat or melting occurring during interstadials leads to higher tensile stresses at the ice rock contact favouring ring fault initiation.Besides, the ice cap existence may lead to secondary processes such as subglacial volcanicmass build-up followingby gravitational failure or hydrothermal weakening of the roof rock, that have been confirmed to be important parameters prone to favour the initiation of tensional fractures at surface for the sameunderpressure of themagmatic system. Most importantly, the rapid changes of surface topography (ice and rocks it moves) and thus over- and underpressure during interstadial (when the amount of ice widely oscillate on centuries-millennial timescales) may have most profound effects. The influence of ice may have an important role on timing and incrementality of magma discharge; under the ice (and ice-supported surface topography, e.g. Table mountains) more magma can accumulate, and under the glacial overpressure this magma will have greater proportions of volatiles. Some of these volatiles may be inherited from hydrothermally altered roof rocks that fingerprint magmas with low 18O values. Rapid and short-lived deglaciation during the interstadial cause additional amounts of vesiculation, leading to greater underpressures following the initial magma discharge (Fig. 13), leading to greater likelihood of ring fault propagation and caldera collapse. Whether more magma iserupting during the interstadial or intraglacial remains a question for future investigation, it appears that the Kamchatkan glaciations have an effect of eruption clustering, and less frequent but bigger eruptions in pyroclastic, rather than effusive character.Supplementarymaterials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2011.02.001."
__label__UNRELATED	"The volcanosedimentary evolution of a postVariscan intramontane basin in the Swiss Alps (Glarus Verrucano) as revealed by zircon UPb age dating and Hf isotope geochemistry  Abstract: In the aftermath of crustal shortening and thickening due to multiple collisions between Gondwana-derived continental fragments and Laurussia during Middle to Late Palaeozoic times (culminating in the Variscan orogeny in the Mid-Carboniferous, e.g. von Raumer et al. 2013), numerous small intracontinental basins opened all over Europe (McCann et al. 2006). They developed due to crustal re-equilibration processes and/or post-collisional strike-slip movements, which resulted in a Basin-and-Range topography (Lorenz and Nicholls 1976). During the last five decades, age and geologic development of many of these basins was worked out in detail (e.g. Roscher and Schneider 2006; McCann et al. 2006; Pochat and van den Driessche 2011), and this work provides information on, e.g. late to post-orogenic volcanism, basin evolution, or regional climate development at the turn from the Carboniferous to the Permian. Several such basins do occur in the Western and Central Alps and their forelands (Fig. 1), and much sedimentologic and geochronological work has been done in some of them during the last three decades (e.g. Matter 1987, Schaltegger and Corfu 1995, Schaltegger 1997, Capuzzo and Bussy 2000, and Capuzzo and Wetzel 2004). One of the most extensive Swiss examples of such a basin, the Glarus Verrucano Basin (GVB, Figs. 2, 3), played Abstract The Late Palaeozoic Glarus Verrucano basin (GVB, Glarus Alps, eastern Switzerland) formed as an intramontane graben in the aftermath of the Variscan orogeny. Its fill, the Glarus Verrucano, consists of immature alluvial fan and playa lake deposits with intercalated bimodal volcanics (basalts and rhyolites). Despite its importance for local and regional geology, no modern sedimentologic or stratigraphic studies on the GVB exist. By means of sedimentologic and geochronologic studies, we reconstruct the volcano-sedimentary evolution of the GVB: it developed at the Carboniferous/Permian boundary and experienced a first (bimodal) volcanic phase around 285 Ma. For the same time, indications for temporarily humid climate in the otherwise rather arid Early Permian are demonstrated (e.g. pyrite-bearing sandstones). During the Middle and Early Late Permian, increasing aridity is indicated by playa deposits, fanglomerates and subaerial ignimbrites, which mark a second (silicic) volcanic phase at 268 Ma. The detrital zircon age spectra are dominated by Late Variscan ages and thus demonstrate that older sedimentary and metamorphic rocks once forming the Variscan nappe edifice were already mostly eroded at that time. Finally, some larger-scale speculations are given which Conclusions: The following conclusions can be drawn from the present study of the GVB The detrital zircon spectra from the GVB document long-lasting magmatic and volcanic activity from 333 to 285 Ma in the area of the future northern margin of the Tethys ocean (Helvetic shelf). Hence, the youngest reliable ages from a given sample can be used to determine its approximate depositional age in this biostratigraphically poorly constrained basin fill. Volcanic activity within the GVB itself was episodic and restricted to two volcanic phases. A first bimodal phase occurred around 285 Ma and a second silicic phase around 268 Ma. The GVB was a hydrologically closed basin which received sedimentary detritus from its immediate hinterland. The latter was part of the remnants of the Variscan orogen which in Early Permian times must have been considerably worn down and dominated by post-Variscan volcanoes. It did not expose any widespread Variscan sedimentary or crystalline/metamorphic nappes of pre-Variscan origin which could have served as quantitatively important sedimentary sources. An important reorganization of regional palaeogeography of the future Helvetic shelf must have taken place during the time span from the Late Permian to the Earliest Triassic as the detrital zircon age spectra from Early Triassic rocks are considerably different from the spectra from the Permian Glarus Verrucano.Acknowledgments We thank A.

__label__UNRELATED	"Massive volcanism, evaporite deposition, and the chemical evolution of the Early Cretaceous ocean  Abstract: Early Cretaceous (145100 Ma) rocks record a ~5 negative shift in the sulfur isotope composition of marine sulfate, the largest shift observed over the past 130 m.y. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this shift: (1) massive evaporite deposition associated with rifting during opening of the South Atlantic and (2) increased inputs of volcanically derived sulfur due to eruption of large igneous provinces. Each process produces a very different impact on marine sulfate concentrations, which in turn affects several biogeochemical phenomena that regulate the global carbon cycle and climate. Here we present sulfur isotope data from Resolution Guyot, Mid-Pacific Mountains (North Pacific Ocean), that track sympathetically with strontium isotope records through the ~5 negative sulfur isotope shift. We employ a linked sulfur-strontium isotope mass-balance model to identify the mechanisms driving the sulfur isotope evolution of the Cretaceous ocean. The model only reproduces the coupled negative sulfur and strontium isotope shifts when both hydrothermal and weathering fluxes increase. Our results indicate that marine sulfate concentrations increased significantly during the negative sulfur isotope shift and that enhanced hydrothermal and weathering input fluxes to the ocean played a dominant role in regulating the marine sulfur cycle and CO2 exchange in the atmosphere-ocean system during this interval of rapid biogeochemical change. INTRODUCTION The sulfate content of the ocean plays an important role in regulating the global carbon cycle and the chemical composition of the ocean-atmosphere system. For example, in the present sulfate-rich ocean, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) remineralizes as much as 50% of the organic matter in coastal marine sediments (Jrgensen, 1982) and affects phosphorus recycling efficiency and therefore marine primary productivity (Ingall et al., 1993; Van Cappellen and Ingall, 1996; Adams et al., 2010). Moreover, MSR increases carbonate alkalinity via bicarbonate production, which in turn affects the partitioning of CO2 between the atmosphere and ocean (Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001). However, marine sulfate concentrations have varied considerably over geologic time (Lowenstein et al., 2001), affecting the marine carbon cycle, the evolution of Earths climate system, and the long-term redox balance of the ocean-atmosphere system. The relative importance of marine sulfur inputs and outputs through time can be tracked in part by reconstructing the S isotope composition of sulfate phases (i.e., barite, calcium sulfate, and carbonate-associated sulfate) preserved in marine sedimentary rocks. The S isotope composition of marine sulfate (Ssulfate) represents a balance between the input of 34S-depleted S from riverine (continental weathering) and hydrothermal sources and the removal of 34S-depleted S via MSR and associated pyrite burial (Canfield, 2001). An ~5 negative excursion extending from ca.126 to 100 Ma represents the most distinguishing feature of the Ssulfate record spanning the past 130 m.y. (Paytan et al., 2004; Fig. 1). While original interpretations of this event implicated a combination of increased hydrothermal and weathering inputs and decreased pyrite burial rates as possible triggers (Paytan et al., 2004), more recent work postulates that increased evaporite deposition (calcium sulfate) associated with the opening of the South Atlantic during this time dramatically lowered marine sulfate concentrations and facilitated a drop in relative pyrite burial rates (Wortmann and Chernyavsky, 2007; Wortmann and Paytan, 2012). Either of these processes operating in isolation could account for the negative Ssulfate excursion. However, each has a very different impact on marine sulfate concentrations: increased volcanism and continental weathering rates increase sulfate delivery to the ocean, whereas evaporite deposition removes it during calcium sulfate precipitation. Although there is geologic evidence for both massive evaporite deposition (Hay et al., 2006; Davison, 2007; Chaboureau et al., 2013) and extensive volcanism due to the formation of several large igneous provinces (LIPs) during the Early Cretaceous (Chandler et al., 2012; Mills et al., 2014), the relative importance of these factors in regulating marine sulfate levels and attendant biogeochemical change remains unconstrained. The Cretaceous Period (ca. 14565 Ma) is also punctuated by several ocean anoxic events (OAEs), short-term (<1 m.y.) intervals of carbon cycle disruption during which massive amounts of organic carbon were buried in marine sediments (Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976). OAE1a occurred at ca. 125 Ma (Ogg et al., 2012), although its temporal relationship with the negative Ssulfate shift has not been documented unambiguously (Gomes et al., 2016). Given the strong coupling between the geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur, improved understanding of how ocean chemistry and sulfate concentrations evolved over this period could provide insight into the factors that conditioned the oceans for carbon cycle instability (Wortmann and Chernyavsky, 2007; Adams et al., 2010; Gomes et al., 2016). *E-mail: matt@earth.northwestern.edu GEOLOGY, May 2017; v. 45; no. 5; p. 475478 | Data Repository item 2017153 | doi:10.1130/G38667.1 | Published online 15 March 2017 2017 The Authors.

The 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater represents a balance between hydrothermal (relatively unradiogenic, lower 87Sr/86Sr) and terrestrial weathering (relatively radiogenic, higher 87Sr/86Sr) inputs (Palmer and Edmond, 1989). While the relative ratio of these input fluxes largely controls the isotopic composition of the marine Sr reservoir, the output flux of pyrite burial exerts strong control over Ssulfate due to the large kinetic isotope effect associated with MSR and accompanying pyrite formation (Canfield and Teske, 1996). Thus, changes in the input fluxes (either in magnitude or isotopic composition) should be recorded in both isotope systems, while changes in the output flux (e.g., pyrite burial) should only affect the S cycle. If the Early Cretaceous negative S isotope shift was triggered by massive evaporite deposition and an attendant decrease in global pyrite burial rates, S and Sr isotope records should be decoupled. By contrast, if massive volcanism were responsible for driving the S isotope shift, one would expect a sympathetic shift in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater (as recorded in marine carbonate). We present new S isotope data from Resolution Guyot, Mid-Pacific Mountains, that track sympathetically with Sr isotope records through the ~5 negative sulfur isotope shift, and employ a linked sulfur-strontium isotope mass-balance model to identify the mechanisms driving the sulfur isotope evolution of the Cretaceous ocean. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, in conjunction with recent temporal constraints for LIPemplacement and evaporite deposition during the Early Cretaceous, demonstrate that coupled increases in hydrothermal and weathering inputs, followed by a period of massive evaporite deposition, best explain the negative S and Sr isotope shifts recorded in rocks drilled at Resolution Guyot. This indicates that marine sulfate concentrations likely increased through most of the Aptian interval (including OAE1a) before dropping to lower levels via late Aptian evaporite deposition. Furthermore, the simultaneous increases in volcanism and weathering required to reconcile the S and Sr isotope records highlight the importance of feedback mechanisms in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels (Berner et al., 1983; Kump et al., 2000). It has long been recognized that enhanced volcanism could increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations and elevate weathering rates. However, in isolation, the marine Sr isotope record cannot be used to infer simultaneous increases (or decreases) in both hydrothermal and riverine fluxes. We propose the use of coupled S and Sr isotope measurements as a new tool for interpreting isotope records and identifying the processes that affect marine sulfate levels, and therefore the C cycle and the evolution of Earths climate system, particularly during large-scale plate tectonic reorganization."
__label__UNRELATED	"The fundamental role of island arc weathering in the oceanic Sr isotope budget Introduction: The 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio measured in a marine limestone registers the ocean water composition at the time of the limestone deposition. Limestone 87Sr/86Sr ratios do vary with geological time. The question asked since the pioneeringwork of Veizer and Compston (1974) and Brass (1976) is how to interpret it? How can we extract information relative to ocean geological history? The answer to this fundamental challenge to geochemistry depends on one key question: what is the quantitative explanation of the present-day oceanic 87Sr/86Sr, which is uniform worldwide. For a long time it was admitted that seawater Sr isotopic ratio is inherited from the mixture of continental erosion products and ridgecrest hydrothermal fluids (Brass, 1976; Brevard and Allegre, 1977; Albarede et al., 1981; Chaudhuri and Clauern, 1986; Palmer and Edmond, 1989). This simple interpretation has been challenged recently and unsuccessful efforts have been made to give alternative explanations (e.g. Davis et al., 2003). In the present paper, we give a new interpretation of the oceanic 87Sr/86Sr ratio, using the 87Sr/86Sr measurements on major rivers all over the world accumulated by our group and others. This model shows the fundamental importance of island arc contribution and opens the door to a reinterpretation of the 5. Conclusion: Following studies by Rad et al. (2007) in Lesser Antilles and Reunion that documented the fundamental importance of underground water input to the oceans, we argue that volcanic islands are indeed a major source of Sr in seawater, a scenario similar to Nd isotopes budget where ridge-cresthydrothermal input is negligible. This approach enablesus to refine the models that are based on 87Sr/86Sr evolution of seawater through geological time. During collision of two tectonic plates, island arcs are active prior to the continental collision but with the commencement of the actual collision continental erosion, linked with mountainsbuilding, increaseswhile island arc erosion stopsbecause the arcs are buried in the suture zone. Both effects tend to increase the seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio during convergence and canbeused to interpret 87Sr/86Sr record through the Phanerozoic."
__label__UNRELATED	"Initiation of the western branch of the East African Rift coeval with the eastern branch  Abstract: The East African Rift System transects the anomalously high-elevation Ethiopian and East African plateaux that together form part of the 6,000-km-long African superswell structure. Rifting putatively developed as a result of mantle plume activity that initiated under eastern Africa. The mantle activity has caused topographic uplift that has been connected to African Cenozoic climate change and faunal evolution. The rift is traditionally interpreted to be composed of two distinct segments: an older, volcanically active eastern branch and a younger, less volcanic western branch. Here, we show that initiation of rifting in the western branch began more than 14 million years earlier than previously thought, contemporaneously with the eastern branch. We use a combination of detrital zircon geochronology, tephroand magnetostratigraphy, along with analyses of past river flow recorded in sedimentary rocks from the Rukwa Rift Basin, Tanzania, to constrain the timing of rifting, magmatism and drainage development in this part of the western branch. We find that rift-related volcanism and lake development had begun by about 25 million years ago. These events were preceded by pediment development and a fluvial drainage reversal that we suggest records the onset of topographic uplift caused by the African superswell. We conclude that uplift of eastern Africa was more widespread and synchronous than previously recognized."
__label__UNRELATED	"Lava heating and loading of ice sheets on early Mars: Predictions for meltwater generation, groundwater recharge, and resulting landforms  Abstract: Recent modeling studies of the early Mars climate predict a predominantly cold climate, characterized by the formation of regional ice sheets across the highland areas of Mars. Formation of the predicted icy highlands ice sheets is coincident with a peak in the volcanic flux of Mars involving the emplacement of the Late Noachian Early Hesperian ridged plains unit. We explore the relationship between the predicted early Mars icy highlands ice sheets, and the extensive early flood volcanism to gain insight into the surface conditions prevalent during the Late Noachian to Early Hesperian transition period. Using Hesperia Planum as a type area, we develop an ice sheet lava heating and loading model. We quantitatively assess the thermal and melting processes involved in the lava heating and loading process following the chronological sequence of lava emplacement. We test a broad range of parameters to thoroughly constrain the lava heating and loading process and outline predictions for the formation of resulting geological features. We apply the theoretical model to a study area within the Hesperia Planum region and assess the observed geology against predictions derived from the ice sheet lava heating and loading model. Due to the highly cratered nature of the Noachian highlands terrain onto which the volcanic plains were emplaced, we predict highly asymmetrical lava loading conditions. Crater interiors are predicted to accumulate greater thicknesses of lava over more rapid timescales, while in the intercrater plains, lava accumulation occurs over longer timescales and does not reach great thicknesses. We find that top-down melting due to conductive heat transfer from supraglacial lava flows is generally limited when the emplaced lava flows are less than 10 m thick, but is very significant at lava flow thicknesses of 100 m or greater. We find that bottom-up cryosphere and ice sheet melting is most likely to occur within crater interiors where lavas accumulate to a sufficient thickness to raise the ice-melting isotherm to the base of the superposed lavas. In these locations, if lava accumulation occurs rapidly, bottom-up melting of the ice sheet can continue, or begin, after lava accumulation has completed in a process we term deferred melting. Subsurface mass loss through melting of the buried ice sheets is predicted to cause substantial subsidence in the superposed lavas, leading to the formation of associated collapse features including fracture systems, depressions, surface faulting and folding, wrinkle-ridge formation, and chaos terrain. In addition, if meltwater generated from the lava heating and loading process becomes trapped at the lava flow margins due to the presence of impermeable confining units, large highly pressurized episodic flooding events could occur. Examination of the study area reveals geological features which are generally consistent with those predicted to form as a result of the ice sheet lava heating and loading process, suggesting the presence of surface snow and ice during the Late Noachian to Early"

Conclusion: Continuous laminated deep lake sediments in the northern part of Lake Van have potential for high resolution pollen analysis. Pollen analysis results show high NAP pollen values with Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia and Poaceae. The near absence of tree pollen in samples has been controlled by climatic conditions. Chenopodiaceae was the most abundant element of paleoflora, and the landscape was mostly covered by steppe vegetation. The near absence of tree pollen and maximum Chenopodiaceae valuesindicate arid climatic conditions during the Late Pleistocene. The steppe vegetation was halophytic and climate conditions were arid and colder than today based on pollen analysis."
__label__UNRELATED	"Detrital zircon age patterns and provenance assessment for pre-glacial to post-glacial successions of the Neoproterozoic Macaubas Group, Aracuai orogen, Brazil  Abstract: The Neoproterozoic Macaubas Group represents the precursor basin system of the Arac uaiWest Congo orogen (SE Brazil SW Africa), located between the Sao Francisco and Congo cratons. The Macaubas basin evolved from continental rift settings to an inland-sea basin (a gulf) partially floored by oceanic crust and connected to aulacogens. Its evolution was coeval with at least one of the major Neoproterozoic glaciations. In this paper, we present more than 450 new UPb ages on detrital zircon grains from four units of the Macaubas Group, covering glacial-related to post-glacial sedimentation stages. The results suggest that the main sedimentary supplies of the Macaubas basin should have come from secondary sources, located in the Sao Francisco and Congo cratons. The pre-glacial units of the Macaubas Group are the only ones that show important contribution from 1100 to 1200 Ma sources, and lack Archaean zircons, which are common in younger rocks of the group. These features indicate an important change in the source areas, coherent with the climate change to glacial conditions and with a regional unconformity previously mapped. Sources between 15001600 Ma are more significant in the continental rift stages, decreasing in the passive margin stage. This suggests changes driven by the end of a glaciation and/or the breakup of the continental lithosphere. Tonian zircons occur throughout all the basin stages, and significantly increase in the late rift and passive margin successions, recording the most abundant rift-related magmatism yet found in the Arac uaiWest Congo orogen. Detrital zircon grains as young as 750 Ma reveal contributions from Cryogenian sources to passive margin successions, suggesting sedimentary supplies from the South Bahia Alkaline Province and/or Rio Negro magmatic arc, in Brazil, and/or from rocks found in Africa (e.g., La Louila volcanic rocks). The long lasting evolution of the Macaubas basin (c. 930 Ma to c. 600 Ma) would have involved more than one continental rifting event before the onset of an ocean-floor spreading phase around 660 Ma. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conclusion: A light-toned layer is identified in one Chasma of the Noctis Labyrinthus region. Stratigraphy and topography derived from HiRISE and HRSC data show that this light-toned layer is part of a thinly stratified unit that drapes pre-existing hilly bedrock. Spectral data show that the light-toned layer contains minerals whose spectral signatures are consistent with hydrated sulfates or chloride salts, though Ca-sulfates such as bassanite and gypsum provide the best matches. The vicinity of a smooth volcanic plain, similar ages as derived from crater counts, and stratigraphic relationships suggest the alteration layer may have been produced during the same period of volcanic activity that formed the nearby volcanic plain. In agreement with morphology, the light-toned layer and thinly stratified unit may represent ash deposits. Alteration of the lowermost layer, which is now the light-toned layer, may have occurred during interaction of water ice with hot ash, either from pre-existing tropical snow deposits, or snow precipitation shortly after ash deposition, or alternatively by solidgas interactions due to nearby volcanic degassing. The alteration minerals in Noctis Labyrinthus may be different from those observed elsewhere in Valles Marineris because of local differences in volcanic chemistry, abundance and availability of water, and/or emplacement mechanism. The young age of the volcanic plain (Late Amazonian, <100 Myr) implies that recent alteration processes can exist on Mars in relation with recent volcanic activity. Such localized deposits do not require a martian climate that is different than today and may be facilitated by obliquity variations capable of mobilizing water ice to low latitudes."
__label__UNRELATED	"The upper Cenozoic tephra record in the south polar region: a review  Abstract: Tephrochronology studies in the south polar region are reviewed and evaluated. There have been numerous investigations of tephra layers in ice cores, reflecting the continuing importance of ice cores as a principal source of palaeoenvironmental information. By contrast, tephra in marine sediment cores have been largely neglected. Chemical analyses of glass shards are not uniformly available across the region. In particular, they are currently unavailable for the northern Antarctic Peninsula. Few tephras have been dated directly, although potassic glass and minerals are commonly present and should be readily amenable to isotopic dating. Chemical fingerprinting seems to have a high potential for successfully correlating layers and identifying source areas, but only a few studies have considered trace elements as well as major oxides. The effects of within-ash compositional variations and analytical imprecision limit the general utility of fingerprinting. The tephra record is locally much more complete than is preserved in the source volcanoes themselves. However, the effects of frequent eruptions on local depocentres may swamp other environmentally significant indicators and make the environmental record harder to interpret than in tephra-free successions. Linked studies of tephra and volcanically-derived aerosols in ice in the south polar region could be of critical importance for quantitative calculations of the volcanic contribution to atmospheric fluxes and attempts to assess the possible effects of volcanism on global climate. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 8. Conclusions: The study of tephra in the south polar region has advanced significantly over the last 30 years. However, the full potential of tephrochronology to glaciological, environmental, climatic and other problems Zof global concern has yet to be realised cf. Kyle et .al., 1982 . The best, if most time-consuming, wayforward is for linked, multidisciplinary studies, foZcusing simultaneously on glacichemistry in ice sec.tions and on an expanded range of major and trace elements, and morphometric parameters of the parZticulate matter e.g., Kyle et al., 1982; Delmas et al., 1985, 1992; Palais and Kyle, 1988; Palais et al., .1988 . Rigorous control must be exerted on the analytical procedures, and non-subjective statistical methods used in the treatment of the analytical data Z .Stokes and Lowe, 1988; Hunt and Hill, 1993 . By these means, precise and accurate quantification of tephra should be ensured, thus avoiding spurious analyses appearing in the literature and reducing conflicting correlations and interpretations based on Zdoubtful analyses cf. Kyle and Seward, 1984; Shane .and Froggatt, 1992 . Furthermore, it is recommendedthat the use of formal or informal names for ash Zlayers e.g., Allan Ash, Yamato Ash, Vostok tephra; .Kyle et al., 1982; Nishio et al., 1984 should be discouraged unless there are unique characteristics that enable the unambiguous identification of the individual named layers. Existing, named tephra layers are poorly described and they occur in areas of multiple tephra, in which the named layers are virtually impossible to distinguish because of insufficientdistinguishing characteristics. In investigations of tephra sequences, it may be acceptable to use an informal, flexible notation for purposes of local corZrelation e.g., the AP1-14 system adopted by Bjorck Z .et al. 1991b in the northern Antarctic Peninsula Zregion but note that some of the identified tephraare multiple layers at some localities; in itself, this could be a distinguishing characteristic in the defini..tion of a particular tephra . Tephra studies are the most important existingtool for precise correlations between atmospheric Z .ice cores , marine and terrestrial records of global change. For example, it is now possible to make quantitative estimates of fluxes of certain volcanically-derived aerosols to the atmosphere, and concurrent studies of associated microparticles are capable Z .in some cases, at least of identifying the likely Z .

These correlations arelikely to become increasingly important in Upper Cenozoic studies, particularly in enabling fundamental advances in our comprehension of feedbacks, time lags and processes operating in different sysZ .tems especially the climate system . In this context, the environmental record preserved in ice cores remains of premier importance. New European and ZAmerican initiatives the EPICA and WAISCORES .projects are aimed at obtaining deep ice cores atseveral sites in Antarctica. These cores should contain high-resolution glacial records expected to extend back several tens to hundreds of thousand years B.P. and would thus offer a high possibility for Zinterhemispheric correlations personal communicaZ .tions from D.

By comparison, marine tephra are a largely neZglected source of information fewer than 20% of tephrochronology publications for the south polar .region . Studies of south Pacific Ocean tephra sugZ .gest that like the BSIC the record contains numer-ous tephra derived from alkaline volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land and calc-alkaline volcanoes in New ZZealand Kyle and Seward, 1984; Froggatt et al., .1986; Shane and Froggatt, 1992 . Similarly, the RossSea probably contains many tephra layers from the numerous alkaline volcanoes of the McMurdo Volcanic Group, which were also active during much of Z .the Neogene and Quaternary Kyle, 1990 . The po-tential for successfully fingerprinting and correlating these multiple layers has now been tested. Alkalic tephra contain potassic glass and phenocryst phases, and they are relatively easy to date isotopically Z .Barrett et al., 1992; Marchant et al., 1993a,b,c . The Weddell SeaScotia Seasouth Atlantic region is also known to be rich in information on palaeoenviZronmental changes e.g., Kennett and Barker, 1990; .Grobe and Mackensen, 1992 , yet it lacks rigorousage control over large areas, particularly the southernmost areas because of low biogenic productivity Z .and corrosive deep water masses Pudsey, 1992 . Many of the tephra are K-rich and should be isotopically datable, although seawater alteration of samples could create problems. The combination of these characteristics suggest that the Weddell SeaScotia Seasouth Atlantic is a prime location for future tephrochronology studies. Thus, there continues to be a high potential for tephrochronology to provide a firm time framework for future palaeoenvironmental investigations within the south polar region."
__label__UNRELATED	"Tectonic controls on atmospheric, climatic, and biological evolution 3.52.4 Ga  Abstract: This paper presents a speculative scenario for the evolution of the earths surface environment and biological community 3.52.4 Ga based on the geologic record and its interpretation. Available geologic evidence suggests that the earths climate before 3.2 Ga was hot, probably 6073 C, as a result of a CO2 and CH4 greenhouse. The early biological community was probably dominated by anoxygenic photosynthetic thermophiles. Cyanobacteria, if they evolved before 3.1 Ga, would have struggled to survive at such high temperatures. As a result, the atmosphere contained extremely low levels of O2 and 33S shows wide departures from 0 indicating mass independent fractionation of S isotopes in the upper atmosphere. This hot early climate collapsed 3.13.0 Ga due to growth of large new blocks of continental crust (cratons), the weathering of which resulted in the depletion of atmospheric CO2 and eventual drawdown of CH4 due to formation and rainout of methane aerosols. Cooling may have culminated in glaciation about 3.02.9 Ga. This climatic catastrophe and attendant changes in atmospheric composition drove a major biological revolution 3.02.7 Ga characterized by the emergence of new low-temperature taxa, including cyanobacteria, and their spread throughout surface environments at the expense of extreme thermophiles, including methanogens. During a period of general tectonic stability, 3.02.7 Ga, the earths surface was characterized by overall clement conditions with temperatures <60 C, abundant cyanobacteria and the formation of associated three-dimensional stromatolites, and a mild oxygenation of the atmosphere and attendant reduction in mass independent fractionation. As the cratons that had formed 3.13.0 Ga were eroded down and gradually covered by sediments, tectonic recycling and a burst of new greenstone-belt volcanism began to increase atmospheric CO2 after 2.75 Ga and by 2.7 Ga surface temperatures had returned to >60 C. Cyanobacteria were again suppressed, O2 production waned, and atmospheric mass independent fractionation is again indicated by extreme variations in 33S. These conditions persisted, perhaps intermittently, until about 2.52.4 Ga, when weathering and erosion of vast new blocks of continental crust formed about 2.652.6 Ga caused the second, and probably last collapse of a >60 C surface climate. Broad tectonic, climatic, and biological events 3.52.9 Ga are remarkably parallel to those of the Late Archean and Paleoproterozoic 2.752.2 Ga and Neoproterozoic 1.00.50 Ga. These 500-myr long cycles of greenstone volcanism and crustal generation; climatic and atmospheric instability; and biological innovation reflect the long-term interaction of the tectonic, atmospheric, climatic, and biological components of the earths surface system. They suggest that the evolution of the earths interior, expressed through its control on the formation of large blocks of continental crust, has influenced atmospheric composition and climate which in turn have provided a fundamental control on the timing and directions of biological evolution throughout earth history. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

While observational and multi-proxy reconstructed data are available for the mid- and high-latitudes of both hemispheres (dendroclimatology, historical documents,weatherdata), data concerning the tropics are extremely scarce (Jomelli et al., 2008b). Yet the tropical climate has effects that reach far beyond the limits of the tropics (Vuille et al., 2000), and thus anunderstandingof the climate of the tropics is key in understanding world climate (McGregor and Nieuwolt, 1998). Furthermore, this area is the dominant driver of atmospheric circulation, and intermittent tropical phenomena, such as ENSO, influence the climate over very large areas, including the mid-latitudes.

The stratigraphy records the positive carbon isotopic excursion that is associated with the major oceanic anoxic event (OAE2). Comparison of TOC and isotopic data in sections from a range of different environments suggests that the positive excursion is a response to increased burial of organic matter in the deep ocean. The lack of coupled negative shifts in yCorg and y Ccarb records at the onset of OAE2 does not support a causal role for volcanism or methane hydrate dissociation. D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 5. Conclusions: High-resolution carbon isotope stratigraphy ofthree sections across the base of OAE2 near theCenomanianTuronian boundary shows the well-documented positive excursion. Comparison withTOC data suggests that the carbon isotopic signalis driven by changes in the burial rates of organicmatter in the deep ocean rather than in shallow marine locations. Small (0.51.0x) changes in y13Corg can be correlated between sections allowing for higher resolution correlation than available using traditional biostratigraphy. Coupled y13Corg and y13Ccarb records do not support input of mantle CO2 or dissociation of methane hydrate at the onset of the event. Thus, our data do not support avolcanic or hydrate trigger for OAE2. It is possiblethat the mantle carbon signal corresponding to theCaribbean LIP was masked by the burial of organicmatter at the onset of OAE2."

__label__SUPPORT	"CHRONOSTRATIGRAPHIC FRAMEWORK FOR UPPER CAMPANIAN-MAASTRICHTIAN SEDIMENTS ON THE BLAKE NOSE (SUBTROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC)  Abstract: A new chronostratigraphic framework is presented for upper Campanian-Maastrichtian pelagic sediments cored at DSDP/ODP Sites 390A/1049, 1050, and 1052, which were drilled across a 1300-m depth transect on the Blake Nose (subtropical western Atlantic Ocean). The planktonic foraminiferal zonation is based on standard global biozones for this interval, but rare and sporadic occurrence of two zonal biomarkers, Gansserina gansseri and Globotruncana aegyptiaca, precludes reliable identification of the nominate zones for those species. The Pseudoguembelina palpebra Partialrange Zone is defined as a means of subdividing this upper Campanian biostratigraphic interval. Planktonic foraminiferal, calcareous nannofossil and paleomagnetic datums are integrated to construct reliable age-depth curves for each of the Blake Nose drill sites. These age models are largely confirmed by Sr-isotopic data and suggest significant unconformities at various positions within the sections. Compilation of stable isotope datasets for this time interval from the Blake Nose sites reveals no significant shifts in dO and dC at the time of the inoceramid bivalve extinction (now dated as 68.568.7 Ma in the Blake Nose sections) and no correlation with proposed Campanian-Maastrichtian glacial intervals. However, benthic warming associated with Deccan volcanism during the late Maastrichtian is supported. CONCLUSIONS: Age-depth models are created for the upper CampanianMaastrichtian interval recovered from DSDP/ODP Holes 390A/1049C and ODP Holes 1050C and 1052E, which were drilled along a middle to upper bathyal depth transect on the Blake Nose in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. These age models are constructed using published and reinterpreted magneto-, chemo-, and biostratigraphic datums along with new biostratigraphic observations, all ofTABLE 6.

The revised age models enable greater accuracy in chronostratigraphic correlation, characterization of changes in sedimentation rates, and determination of the stratigraphic position, timing, and duration of unconformities. These refinements provide a much more reliable framework for interpretation of biotic and paleoceanographic changes that occurred during the last 10 m.y. of the Cretaceous Period as observed on the Blake Nose.The relative order and timing of a majority of the planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil datum events identified at the Blake Nose sites show very good agreement among sites. Exceptions among the planktonic foraminifera include the zonal marker species Globotruncana aegyptiaca and Gansserina gansseri, which both have rare and sporadic distributions at the Blake Nose drill sites. Because recognition of the G. gansseri and G. aegyptiaca Zones is deemed unreliable, we define a new Pseudoguembelina palpebra Interval Zone for biostratigraphic subdivision between the Globotruncanella havanensis Partial-range Zone and the Racemiguembelina fructicosa Partial-range Zone. The FAD of P. palpebra is calibrated as 71.64 Ma. Secondary planktonic foraminiferal datum ages that are estimated from mean values obtained from the Blake Nose age models include: (1) the LAD of Gansserina gansseri 5 65.93 Ma, (2) the LAD of Contusotruncana patelliformis 5 66.20, (3) the LAD of Globotruncana linneiana 5 67.86 Ma, (4) the LAD of Globotruncana bulloides 5 68.80 Ma, (5) the LAD of Contusotruncana fornicata 5 68.98 Ma, (6) the FAD of Pseudotextularia elegans 5 69.02 Ma, (7) the FAD of Planoglobulina acervulinoides 5 69.55 Ma, (8) the FAD of Contusotruncana contusa 5 70.5 Ma, (9) the FAD of Pseudoguembelina kempensis 5 71.50 Ma, (10) the FAD of Racemiguembelina powelli 5 70.98 Ma and (11) the FAD of Pseudoguembelina excolata 5 74.40 Ma.Revision of the late Campanian-Maastrichtian chronology for the Blake Nose sites has an important bearing on paleoceanographic interpretations that have been made based on data generated from the drill cores and in correlation with data from other regions. Of particular interest is determination whether reorganization of the sources and patterns of deep- and intermediate-water circulation played a role in biotic changes, particularly the extinction of inoceramid bivalves. The extinction of inoceramid bivalves is now dated between 68.5 and 68.7 Ma on the Blake Nose. Combined stable isotope datasets published for the Blake Nose sites do not show any significant change in foraminiferal, bulk- and finefractioncarbonate d18O and d13C values in this interval.The new chronology also provides reliable constraints on the timing and duration of Late Cretaceous unconformities across the Blake Nose transect. A mid-Maastrichtian unconformity with a duration ranging between 0.7 and 1.9 m.y. is identified at all three sites across the 1300-mdepth transect. Several additional unconformities occur within the upper Campanian, and the oldest of these spans the period from 10.2 to 34.4 m.y. The more precise age dating of these unconformities will provide a framework for understanding their cause and regional to global extent.T A B L E 7 .

__label__UNRELATED	"Obliquity forcing of organic matter accumulation during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2  Abstract: [1] An analysis of orbitally influenced climate-sensitive sedimentation is conducted across a meridional transect of the proto-North Atlantic, to reconstruct the behavior of the carbon cycle and climate during Oceanic Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2; 94 Ma). Midlatitude to near equatorial sites spanning deep-ocean to shelf environments are evaluated using a new inverse method for the identification and calibration of orbital influence in ancient strata. The results yield consistent independent astrochronologies at each locationcompatible with the recently published radioisotopic/astrochronologic time scale at the Cenomanian-Turonian GSSPand thus provide a unified high-resolution temporal context for evaluation of the event. The proto-North Atlantic astrochronologies document an amplification of obliquity power during OAE 2, indicating that obliquity was the dominant pacemaker of organic matter accumulation by the latter portion of the event. The strong obliquity signal suggests an influence of high-latitude climate processes across midlatitude deep-ocean to tropical shelf environments. Changes in oceanic circulation during OAE 2 represent a likely mechanism for the propagation of a high latitude signal, and proxy data from Demerara Rise reveal the development of a new intermediate water mass source synchronous with the record of obliquity amplification. We hypothesize that a dense high-latitude water mass displaced a pre-existing nutrient-rich anoxic deep-water layer in the proto-North Atlantic (augmented by enhanced volcanism), driving an episode of high productivity that lasted 700800 ka. The development and intensification of the new intermediate/deep water source was potentially driven by eustatic sea level rise, which created expansive seaways in mid to high latitudes."
__label__UNRELATED	"Calibration of chron C29r: New high-precision geochronologic and paleomagnetic constraints from the Hell Creek region, Montana  Abstract: The mass extinction at the CretaceousPaleogene boundary marks one of the most important biotic turnover events in Earth history. Yet, despite decades of study, the causes of the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary crises remain under debate. An important tool that has the capacity to greatly improve our understanding of the events around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary is the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS). The GPTS is used for age control in numerous Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary studies, including the timing of Deccan Traps volcanism, a majority of studies in marine sections, and studies on climate and ecological change across the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The current calibration of the GPTS for circumCretaceous-Paleogene boundary polarity chrons (C30nC28n) from the Geologic Time Scale draws heavily on astronomical tuning and uses a 40Ar/39Ar age for the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary as a tie point that has since been shown to be 200 ka too old. Furthermore, complex sedimentation has been recorded in marine sections immediately following the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, which can possibly obscure orbital signals and complicate cyclostratigraphic interpretation. An independent test of the cyclostratigraphy for this time period is imperative for confidence in the astronomical time scale. Further, polarity reversal ages given in the GPTS do not include uncertainty estimates, making them unsuitable for quanti- CONCLUSIONS: We calculated a duration of 587 53 ka for C29r based on 14 new magnetostratigraphic sections and 18 new 40Ar/39Ar tephra ages from the Hell Creek region, Montana. This result is consistent with past estimates for the age and duration of this chron based on cyclostratigraphy and U/Pb geochronology. The previous estimate for the duration of C29r of ~350 ka, presented in Sprain et al. (2015), is shown to be incorrect due to errors in reversal placement in two different magnetostratigraphic sections presented in Archibald et al. (1982) and LeCain et al. (2014). These errors are probably due to unremoved normal overprints, likely held by goethite, which cannot be removed by AF-only demagnetization techniques. This result calls for the reevaluation of magnetostratigraphic frameworks developed in central North American basins that were determined using only AF demagnetization techniques (e.g., the San Juan Basin), especially in locations where the placement of NALMA faunas is not consistent with other regional basins. Despite errors found in past reversal placement, our results confirm the previous placement of NALMA fauna into the magnetostratigraphic framework for the Hell Creek region: La: Cretaceous C29r, Pu1: Paleogene C29r, and Pu3: C29n.Using our new calibration for C29r, we can begin to tie records of biotic and abiotic change around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary from both marine and terrestrial sections to records of Deccan volcanism. Tentative first analysis agrees with past assessments that pre Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary ecological decline in the terrestrial realm correlated with the onset of Deccan volcanism and records of global climate change ~400 ka prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary.Incorporating ~200 new analyses, we also provide a new pooled age for the IrZ tephra of 66.052 0.008/0.043 Ma, which we interpret as the most reliable age for the CretaceousPaleogene boundary available."
__label__UNRELATED	"Hail formation triggers rapid ash aggregation in volcanic plumes  Abstract: During explosive eruptions, airborne particles collide and stick together, accelerating the fallout of volcanic ash and climate-forcing aerosols. This aggregation process remains a major source of uncertainty both in ash dispersal forecasting and interpretation of eruptions from the geological record. Here we illuminate the mechanisms and timescales of particle aggregation from a well-characterized wet eruption. The 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, incorporated water from the surface (in this case, a glacier), which is a common occurrence during explosive volcanism worldwide. Observations from C-band weather radar, fall deposits and numerical modelling demonstrate that hail-forming processes in the eruption plume triggered aggregation of B95% of the fine ash and stripped much of the erupted mass out of the atmosphere within 30 min. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism of hail-like ash aggregation that contributes to the anomalously rapid fallout of fine ash and occurrence of concentrically layered aggregates in volcanic deposits.

__label__UNRELATED	"Clams as CO2 generators: The Potamocorbula amurensis example in San Francisco Bay  Abstract: Respiration and calcium carbonate production by the invasive Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis, were calculated to assess their importance as CO2 sources in northern San Francisco Bay. Production, calculated using monthly population density and size structure measured at three sites over 7 yr and a shell length/CaCO3 conversion factor, averaged 221 (6184) g CaCO3 m22 yr21. Net calcium carbonate production by this exotic bivalve releases CO2 at a mean rate of 18 (617) g C m22 yr21. Respiration by P. amurensis, estimated from secondary production, releases additional CO2 at a mean rate of 37 (634) g C m22 yr21. Therefore, total net CO2 production by P. amurensis averages 55 (651) g C m22 yr21 in an estuarine domain where net primary production consumes only 20 g inorganic C m22 yr21. CO2 production by P. amurensis in northern San Francisco Bay is an underestimate of the total CO2 supply from the calcified zoobenthic communities of San Francisco Bay, and results from other studies have suggested that this rate is not unusual for temperate estuaries. Global extrapolation yields a gross CO2 production rate in the worlds estuaries of 1 3 1014 g C yr21, which suggests that calcified benthic organisms in estuaries generate CO2 equal in magnitude to the CO2 emissions from the worlds lakes or from planetary volcanism (the net source is determined by the highly variable rate of CO2 consumption by carbonate dissolution). This biogenic CO2 source is increasing because of the continuing global translocation of mollusks and their successful colonization of new habitats. The combination of a unique level of global warming in the late 20th century and narrowed constraints on the role of natural variability provide growing evidence that a greenhouse effect from anthropogenic CO2 emissions can be distinguished from natural variability in the climate system (Crowley 2000). However, there remain large uncertainties in the contemporary global carbon budget and even gaps in our knowledge of the processes contributing to planetary carbon cycling (Schlesinger 1997). We have not yet identified or measured all of the important sources and sinks of CO2, the greenhouse gas that contributes at least 50% to projected global warming (Lashof and Ahuja 1990).

__label__UNRELATED	"End member models for Andean Plateau uplift Introduction: The plateaus of Tibet and the central Andes are the largest tectonically active orogens. Despite this, the topographic, tectonic, and geodynamic evolution of orogenic plateaus remain imprecisely known and the focus of significant research. These plateaus are thought to influence local-to-far-field lithospheric deformation as well as global sediment flux, ocean chemistry, atmospheric circulation, precipitation, and climate change (Richter et al., 1992; Molnar et al., 1993; Masek et al., 1994; Lenters and Cook, 1995; Royden, 1996; Ruddiman et al., 1997; Sobel et al., 2003). In particular, numerous geologic observations have constrained the tectonomorphic evolution of the central Andean Plateau (see summaries in Isacks, 1988; Reutter et al., 1994; Allmendinger et al., 1997; Jordan et al., 1997; Kley et al., 1999; Gregory-Wodzicki, 2000; Kennan, 2000; Ramos et al., 2004; Barnes and Pelletier, 2006; Oncken et al., 2006b; Strecker et al., 2007; Kay and Coira, 2009), yet its history of uplift and consequently the associated geodynamic mechanisms of plateau development remain disputed (Garzione et al., 2006; Ghosh et al., 2006; Sempere et al., 2006; Garzione et al., 2007; Hartley et al., 2007; Hoke and Lamb, 2007; Ehlers and Poulsen, 2009). A range of processes have been proposed for Andean Plateau (AP) growth (Fig. 8. Conclusions: We conclude by listing a series of observations and key inferences consistent across many investigations presented in our synthesis. Thislist is presented to identifywhat can be saidwith confidence concerning the Cenozoic structure and geologic evolution of the Andean Plateau, providing a test for evaluating future models of central Andes orogenesis. More specifically, any model that attempts to explain Andean Plateau development must honor the following (Fig. 9):A. Lithosphere (Fig. 9A): a crust exhibiting significant yet variable along-strike shortening (330150 km) with a west-dipping monocline on the western flank and dominantly east-vergent thrust belt involving basement-to-cover rocks in the center to eastern flank (Fig. 2D). A plateau region possessing a positive geoid, a negative Bouguer gravity anomaly, low rigidity, high heat flow, and an isostatically compensated thick crust (8065 km). In contrast, plateau margins exhibiting progressively thinner crust, reduced heat flow, and an increasingly rigid lithosphere away from the center. A lithosphere with an east-dipping high velocity zone down to 660 km corresponding to the subducting Nazca plate, variable velocity zones and high attenuation in the crust and upper mantle, and a high velocity mantle beneath the Eastern Cordillera corresponding to the under-thrusting Brazilian craton (Fig. 2D).B. Deformation and exhumation (Fig. 9B): a mostly continuous Cenozoic deformation, sedimentation, and exhumation history that progresses dominantly eastward since the PaleogeneEocene (6040 Ma). More specifically, initial deformation and exhumation began along the western flank at 6040 Ma with a shift into the Eastern Cordillera 40 Ma. Continued and distributed Eastern Cordillera deformation from 4020 Ma was followed by propagation eastward into the Interandean zone and westward in the Altiplano from 20 Ma until 105 Ma. The modern width of the Andean Plateau is inferred to be reached by 2515 Ma. Deformation and exhumation propagated eastward into the Subandes/ Santa Barbara Ranges/Sierras Pampeanas at 1510 Ma where it continues today. A younger phase of early-mid Miocene to present (230 Ma) exhumation in the Eastern Cordillera was probably the result of enhanced erosion along the northern Altiplano flank and related to deformation along the southern Puna flank. The 3-dimensional deformation field of the AP is characterized by rotation outward from the orocline axis.C. Magmatism (Fig. 9C): Cenozoic volcanism began in the Western Cordillera and continued until35Ma.Widespread back-arc,maficto-rhyolitic volcanism began again at 25 Ma across a 300 km wide (WE) zone within the central Altiplano. Arc productivity has been higher south of20S and has also decreased in age southward since 12 Ma. The widespread volcanism only recently retreated to its present and narrow (50 kmWE) zone in the Western Cordillera 3 Ma. This volcanism infers a) a thin Altiplano lithosphere (<100 km thick) since ~25 Ma and b) a history of changing subduction geometry from normal to flat and back to normal during the Cenozoic. Onset of mafic magmatism at 3 Ma in thePunamaybe the result of recentdelamination and the causeof its higher mean elevation relative to the Altiplano.D. Uplift (Fig. 9D): most surface uplift from an initial elevation of 1 km has occurred since 25 Ma. Within error, paleoaltimetry data are equally consistent with anything from a slow and steady rise of the AP since25 Ma to a rapid rise of 2.5 km at 106 Ma. Much of the paleoaltimetry data can be explained by either surface uplift and/or climate change associated with plateau uplift.E. Incision (Fig. 9E): significant late Miocene incision (2.51 km since 118 Ma) has occurred along the Altiplano western flank with more minor incision both prior to this time and along the eastern plateau flank. The incision mechanism is unclear and could be surface uplift and/or climate change associated with plateau uplift. In contrast, there is no evidence for significant incision along the southeastern Puna margin.F. Modeling: models of Andean Plateau formation suggest that a weakened lithosphere resulting in flow at depth is important in the geodynamic evolution of the plateau.A major interpretation drawn from this synthesis is a synoptic history of Andean Plateau evolution that describes significant, yet variable upper-plate deformation (530150 km shortening) within a weak lithosphere that was protracted (40 Myr since deformationand magmatism began, 25 Myr since the lithosphere was thin in places (<100 km thick)) and more uniform in time along strike (1500 km) than previously appreciated. This synoptic history is more consistent with a geologic model of relatively continuous deformation and an end member model of Andean Plateau uplift that emphasizes a slow and steady rise since the Eocene (40 Ma) or even earlier. Therefore, we suggest the late Miocene (10 Ma) rapid uplift model may be an overestimate and that a protracted Cenozoic uplift history is tenable."

Early in their histories, all three apparently had oceans and extensive volcanism; Mars and Earth, at least, had magnetic fields, and Earth, at least, had life. All three currently have climates determined by energy balance relationships involving carbon dioxide, water and aerosols, regulated by solar energy deposition, atmospheric and ocean circulation, composition, and cloud physics and chemistry. This paper addresses the extent to which current knowledge allows us to explain the observed state of each planet, its planetology, climatology and biology, within a common framework. Areas of ignorance and mysteries are explored, and prospects for advances in resolving these with missions within the present planning horizon of the space agencies are considered and assessed. & 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. 8. Conclusion: glittering prizes: Although a new discipline, comparative planetology has within its reach at least two far-reaching goals of great significance. One belongs exclusively within this disciplinethe detection, or not, of life forms (and/or evidence for past life forms) in water-rich, or formerly water-rich, environments on Mars, and the implications for life as a common or uncommon phenomenon in the Universe. Venus is a less favourable, but still not entirely negligible, site for related investigations that will, like Mars, probably yield some of its secrets to investigations now in the planning cycle. The other prize is the contribution mentioned above that comparative planetology may make to the struggle to understand and ameliorate harmful climate change on the Earth. This is already underway with missions like the Mars and Venus Expresses, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the Exploration Rovers on the surface of Mars."

It is hypothesized that the rise of early non-vascular land plants, and the later evolution of roots and vasculature, drove the long-term shift towards a high-oxygen, low CO2 climate that eventually permitted the evolution of mammals and, ultimately, humans. However, very little is known about the productivity of the early terrestrial biosphere, which depended on the acquisition of the limiting nutrient phosphorus via fungal symbiosis. Recent laboratory experiments have shown that plantfungal symbiotic function is specific to fungal identity, with carbon-for-phosphorus exchange being either enhanced or suppressed under superambient CO2. By incorporating these experimental findings into a biogeochemical model, we show that the differences in these symbiotic nutrient acquisition strategies could greatly alter the plant-driven changes to climate, allowing drawdown of CO2 to glacial levels, and altering the nature of the rise of oxygen. We conclude that an accurate depiction of plantfungal symbiotic systems, informed by high-CO2 experiments, is key to resolving the question of how the first terrestrial ecosystems altered our planet. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue The Rhynie cherts: our earliest terrestrial ecosystem revisited."
__label__SUPPORT	"A 200-year record of gale frequency, Edinburgh, Scotland: possible link with high-magnitude volcanic eruptions  Abstract: Most research concerned with the relationship between volcanic activity and global climate change has focused on the impacts that volcanoes have on atmospheric temperature. Very little attention, however, has been given to the effect of volcanic eruptions on patterns of storminess. Here we present a historical record of gale-day frequency for Edinburgh, Scotland, extending from AD 1780 to 1988 (the Mossman-Hickey chronology), which we believe represents the longest historical record of gales in Europe. Calculation of galeday frequency for this time interval shows three clear peaks in storminess that follow the volcanic eruptions of Tambora (1815), Krakatoa (1883) and El Chichon (1982). It appears that the greatest periods of storminess evident in the Edinburgh record during the last 200 years have taken place during relatively short intervals following major episodes of volcanism. If correct, the processes linking high-magnitude volcanic eruptions to storminess in the North Atlantic need to be included in IPCC research that presently focuses most attention on linkages between increased storminess and the effects of global warming."

It has its own specific features in global common features of geology and has been paid close attention by scientists from home and abroad for its abundant, typical, and concentrated contents of geosciences. It is a typical and representative continental orogenic belt in the world and contains rich information about current development of geosciences.On the basis of comparative analyses of regional geology, geological sites in Qinling Zhongnanshan World Geopark, this paper has been concluded as follows:1. The Qinling Mountain is famous among all China and the worldbecause of its significance in geological and geographical research. In its middle section, Zhongnanshan region, there are many complicated geological phenomena and important geosites: representative stratigraphic section, magmatic activity remains, structure section and tectonic motion remains, geologicalgeomorphological landscape, special rocks and minerals, special hydrogeological phenomena, human engineering activity remains, disastrous geological process remains, and palaeontological fossils and sites, a total of nine types based on genetic classification.2. The big piedmont fault in the northern margin of Mt. Qinling is amarginal scarpside of the Weihe rift. Since the late Cretaceous period, it has been in active at all times and is still active up to now. It has a fault displacement up to 13 km. In the north side of Mt. Qinling, the Weihe graben is an intracontinental fault basin infilled with thick sediments, which has a global significance in geoscience research.3. The heritage sites of the Cuihuashan Mountain collapseslideranks third in size in the world, with which the landscapes are intact in patterns, including freeing surfaces, collapseslide accumulation, barrier dams, barrier lakes, and caves.4. The landforms of glacial erosion, moraine, and cryergy inTaibaishan Mountain are preserved well, which have an important significance in research of the evolution of the Quaternary climate and glaciations in China and East Asia.5. The unique geological background formed the highest peak andthe broad and prosperous Weihe basin in Eastern China. From the Palaeolithic Age, the Lantian Homo erectus was attracted to the foot area of the Qinling Mountains and began to settle down and multiply the following generations. Hereafter, the Chenjiawo Homo erectus (700,000 years) and the Banpo clan (6,500 years)had their colourful and prosperous life in this area. Thirteen dynasties of ancient China had established their capital cities in Xi'an, which had drove religions of Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianism to prosperity. So the territory of the geopark is one of the most representative areas in harmonious coexistence between human and nature.Geosites are records of geological history handed over through tens up to thousands of millions of years. In their probe into the nature's history, human beings understand gradually the importance of safeguarding geological heritage, and through long practice of conserving the heritage, they have found an optimal approach for this purpose, that is, establishing geoparks, make them special landscape areas for protecting the Earth's legacy and the geologicalecological environment, and furthermore, network them at different levels to form a research base for important geoscientific issues, educational field base for students, and scientific popularization base to the general public. The prominent value is the core content of World Natural Heritage application, protection, and management. Thus, for world geoparks, they also should enhance the ability to protect and manage geological sites. The park should make a scientific decision for implementing planning, exploitation, and construction; it is necessary to assess the whole value from the angle of tourists' demand. In doing so, revenues from geotourism, for example, knowledge tours, science tours, and environmental protection tours, can support the local economy and promote local employment."

This study extends the detailed record of Antarctic, South American, and equatorial volcanism over the last 12,000 years using continuous glaciochemical series developed from the Siple Dome A (SDMA) ice core, West Antarctica. The largest volcanic sulfate spike (280 mg/L) occurs at 5881 B.C.E. Other large signals with unknown sources are observed around 325 B.C.E. (270 mg/L) and 2818 B.C.E. (191 mg/L). Ages of several large equatorial or Southern Hemisphere volcanic eruptions are synchronous with many sulfate peaks detected in the SDMA volcanic ice chemistry record. The microprobe fingerprinting of glass shards in the SDMA core points to the following Antarctic volcanic centers as sources of tephra found in the SDMA core: Balenny Island, Pleiades, Mount Berlin, Mount Takahe, and Mount Melbourne as well as Mount Hudson and possibly Mount Burney volcanoes of South America. Identified volcanic sources provide an insight into the poorly resolved transport history of volcanic products from source volcanoes to the West Antarctic ice sheet."

The first occurrences of this genus are recorded in the sedimentary successions of the Gondwana, both in Australia and South America. However, the geographic and age distribution of Oriocrassatella in Late Mississippian deposits of Australia and Argentina may indicate an earliest Visean or even a pre-Visean origin for the genus. Following its origin in Early Carboniferous a complex paleobiogeographic history from Southern to Northern Hemisphere took place in the Permian. During its initial dispersal phase from Late Carboniferous to the Early Permian the genus thrived in cold water environments associated to the Late Paleozoic Gondwana glaciation.

__label__UNRELATED	"Groundwater flow pattern and related environmental phenomena in complex geologic setting based on integrated model construction  Abstract: Groundwater flow, driven, controlled and determined by topography, geology and climate, is responsible for several natural surface manifestations and affected by anthropogenic processes. Therefore, flowing groundwater can be regarded as an environmental agent. Numerical simulation of groundwater flow could reveal the flow pattern and explain the observed features. In complex geologic framework, where the geologichydrogeologic knowledge is limited, the groundwater flow model could not be constructed based solely on borehole data, but geophysical information could aid the model building. The integrated model construction was presented via the case study of the Tihany Peninsula, Hungary, with the aims of understanding the background and occurrence of groundwater-related environmental phenomena, such as wetlands, surface watergroundwater interaction, slope instability, and revealing the potential effect of anthropogenic activity and climate change. The hydrogeologic model was prepared on the basis of the compiled archive geophysical database and the results of recently performed geophysical measurements complemented with geologichydrogeologic data. Derivation of different electrostratigraphic units, revealing fracturing and detecting tectonic elements was achieved by systematically combined electromagnetic geophysical methods. The deduced information can be used as model input for groundwater flow simulation concerning hydrostratigraphy, geometry and boundary conditions. The results of numerical modelling were interpreted on the basis of gravity-driven regional groundwater flow concept and validated by field mapping of groundwater-related phenomena. The 3D model clarified the hydraulic behaviour of the formations, revealed the subsurface hydraulic connection between groundwater and wetlands and displayed the groundwater discharge pattern, as well. The position of wetlands, their vegetation type, discharge features and induced landslides were explained as environmental imprints of groundwater. The highly vulnerable wetlands and groundwater-dependent ecosystems have to be in the focus of water management and natural conservation policy. 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Summary and conclusion: Groundwater flow, driven, controlled and determined by topography, geology and climate, is responsible for several natural surface manifestations and affected by anthropogenic processes. Therefore, flowing groundwater can be regarded as an environmental agent. The concept of gravity-driven regional groundwater flow could aid the understanding of flow pattern in geologically complex (siliciclastic, carbonate and volcanic) area, and interpretation of environmental processes and conditions.Unless the required well data are available, the geological hydrogeological numerical model of the study area cannot be constructed based only on borehole information. In this case, spatiallycontinuous geophysical data can support groundwater flow model building: systematically combined geophysical methods can provide model input. Determining the different electrostratigraphic units and their position, revealing fractures, detecting structures can be carried out by easy-to-use, non-invasive and rapid electromagnetic geophysical methods even in complex geologic framework. Integration of lithostratigraphic, electrostratigraphic and hydrostratigraphic information could aid groundwater flow model construction: hydrostratigraphic units and their hydraulic behaviour, boundaries and geometry can be obtained. Groundwaterrelated natural manifestations can be explained with the help of the revealed flow pattern and field mapping of features.Integrated groundwater flow model construction in a geologically complex area was presented via the case study of the Tihany Peninsula, Hungary. The geophysical results were indispensable to clarify the geometry and hydraulic behaviour of the near-surface formations in the paleo-maar environment and identify the structural pattern. The 3D groundwater flow model, which is based on the scarce geologic information and the electromagnetic geophysical results, could answer the subsurface hydraulic connection between wetlands and also groundwater discharge pattern. Moreover, the gravity-driven regional groundwater flow concept can help to interpret the hydraulically nested flow systems (local and intermediate) even in such a geologically complex and relatively small area (25 km2). Validation of numerical simulation by natural surface conditions and phenomena was performed. Consequently, the position of wetlands, their vegetation type, discharge featuresand induced landslides were explained as environmental imprints of groundwater. Anthropogenic activities and climate change have great impact on groundwater; the highly vulnerable wetlands have to be in focus of water management and natural conservation policy."
__label__UNRELATED	"The Holocene history of George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula from clast-provenance analysis of epishelf lake sediments  Abstract: The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a dramatic increase in temperature and the loss of ca. 14,000 km of ice-shelf area in recent years. During this time George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) has remained relatively intact, but it is now reaching its theoretical limit of viability. Epishelf lakes, formed when ice shelves dam the mouths of marine embayments, accumulate sediments that can be used to constrain past ice-shelf behaviour. They are stratified water bodies with an upper layer of fresh meltwater overlying amarine layer of water. Multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core fromMoutonnee Lake, an epishelf lake dammed byGVIIS on the east coast of Alexander Island, has recently shown that it retreated to at least the Ablation Point area in the earlyHolocene, ca. 96007500 years BP, demonstrating its vulnerability to periods of atmospheric and oceanic warmth. This study tests this interpretation of ice-shelf collapse through detailed analyses of granulometric, geochemical and Sr and Nd isotope provenance data for N8 mm clasts from the same cores. Clast data from Moutonnee Lakewere comparedwith geological reference data from two further lakes onAlexander Island (Ablation Lake andCitadel Bastion Lake) and an extensive archive of rocks and isotope-geochemical provenance data from the Antarctic Peninsula region. Underpinning this provenance analysis is the contrast between the plutonic/igneous outcrops in Palmer Land on the western side and the predominantly sedimentary strata of Alexander Island on the eastern side of George VI Sound, and the different patterns in their deposition that would be expected at Moutonnee Lake during periods of ice-shelf presence and absence. Results show that changes in clast distribution and provenance reflect the early Holocene retreat and reformation of George VI Ice Shelf at Moutonnee Lake. The period of ice-shelf retreat was marked by the onset of marine conditions in the basin followed by a rapidly deposited zone of clasts whose provenance, distribution, varied lithology and larger than average clast size are indicative of a period of lake ice disintegration and ice-rafted debris deposition between ca. 96008450 years BP. Igneous clasts in the ice-rafted debris have a close affinity with the plutonic provinces of western Palmer Land suggesting transport to the site by icebergs or recycling through Alexander Island strata/ moraines. When epishelf lake conditions returned after ca. 7500 years BP, the clasts were smaller, the number of lithologies more limited and the assemblage dominated by olive-green vitric tuff and pale-green rhyolitic clasts that isotope data link to Early Cretaceous volcanic activity in Palmer Land.

TheMoutonnee Lake core has significant changes in clast type and density that are coupled to retreat phases of GVIIS and, most likely, re-advance phases of local catchment glaciers in Moutonnee Valley.281S.J. Roberts et al. / Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 259 (2008) 258283 The early Holocene retreat of GVIIS in the Ablation Point area (Bentley et al., 2005) is marked by a distinct depositional shift from a more ordered assemblage and low number of clast types when the ice-shelf is present to a more chaotic distribution of clasts and more numerous clast types during the period when the ice-shelf was absent. During periods of ice-shelf loss, the lithological assemblage is dominated by a range of exotic clasts. Iceberg rafting of material is likely to be the dominant sedimentary process during periods of ice-shelf loss. Sub-glacial flow through the ice-shelf is relatively minor compared to the input of material from local catchment glaciers and iceberg rafting. Further isotopic and age analyses of volcanic outcrops on Alexander Island and NW Palmer Land are necessary to determine provenance more precisely. This is a substantial undertaking, beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, data presented in this paper have identified six modes of clast transport highlighting the complex provenance and depositional processes in Moutonnee Lake and the GVIIS epishelf lake sedimentary system along the eastern coast of Alexander Island."
__label__UNRELATED	"Sulphur emissions to the stratosphere from explosive volcanic eruptions  Abstract: Two methods were used to quantify the flux of volcanic sulphur (as the equivalent mass of SO2) to the stratosphere over different timescales during the Holocene. A combination of satellite-based measurements of sulphur yields from recent explosive volcanic eruptions with an appropriate rate of explosive volcanism for the past 200 years constrains the medium-term (F10 years) flux of volcanic sulphur to the stratosphere to be F1 Mt a, with lower and upper bounds of 0.3 and 3 Mt a. The short-term (F10to 20-year) flux due to small magnitude (1010 kg) eruptions is of the order of 0.4 Mt a. At any time the instantaneous levels of sulphur in the stratosphere are dominated by the most recent (03 years) volcanic events. The flux calculations do not attempt to address this very short timescale variability. Although there are significant errors associated with the raw sulphur emission data on which this analysis is based, the approach presented is general and may be readily modified as the quantity and quality of the data improve. Data from a Greenland ice core support these conclusions. Integration of the sulphate signals from presumed volcanic sources recorded in the GISP2 core provides a minimum estimate of the 10year volcanic SO2 flux to the stratosphere of 0.51 Mt a over the past 9000 years. The short-term flux calculations do not account for the impact of rare, large events. The ice-core record does not fully account for the contribution from small, frequent events. Conclusions: Over a timescale of F102 years, the SO2 flux from explosive volcanic eruptions to the stratosphere is F1 Mt a1. We estimate that F0.4 Mt a1 of this flux is accounted for by high-latitude magnitude-three and magnitude-four eruptions, which together have a recurrence rate of 1.2 a1. More than 50% of eruption columns which reach the stratosphere are due to eruptions of magnitude three north of 40oN. However, the long-term stratospheric sulphate budget is dominated by volcanic eruptions of magnitudes four or larger. The record of residual sulphate peaks in the GISP2 Greenland ice core suggests that the minimum flux of volcanic sulphur to the stratosphere during the Holocene has varied between F0.5 and 1 Mt SO2 a1. The sulphate concentration of the ice cores place an upper limit on the sulphur flux into the stratosphere of F1.8 Mt a1. These flux estimates are not intended to be applied on an annual basis, or to describe instantaneous rate of volcanic sulphur emission to the stratosphere. The calculated fluxes are also not intended to be used as predictors of the significance of any particular volcanic event, but might best be used for comparison with marine and anthropogenic sources of global atmospheric sulphur.Acknowledgements We are grateful to Slimane Bekki for discussion, to Greg Zielinski, Bill Rose and Terry Gerlach for vigorous and detailed reviews, and to G.

__label__SUPPORT	"Possible correlation of Oligocene climate changes with Ethiopian Oligocene ignimbrite eruptions  Abstract: The Oligocene Ethiopian continental flood basalt province (ca. 2931 Ma) contains significant silicic pyroclastic rocks (>60,000 km constituting up to 20% of the volcanic stratigraphy). Rhyolitic tephras, synchronous with the Ethiopian silicic pyroclastic rocks, are found in Indian Ocean ODP holes 711A. They are geochemically akin to the Ethiopian silicic pyroclastic rocks. This suggests that the Indian Ocean tephras originated from Ethiopian silicic eruptions and represents more distal fallout of this volcanism. The temporal coincidence of the Ethiopian flood volcanism with the Oligocene global cooling event (Oi2 30.3 Ma) and the emplacement of the Ethiopian silicic pyroclastic eruptions on a near-global scale strongly suggest that the Ethiopian continental flood basalt province may have contributed or at least accelerated the climate change that was already underway."
__label__SUPPORT	"The midCretaceous North Atlantic nutrient trap: Black shales and OAEs  Abstract: [1] Organicrich sediments are the salient marine sedimentation product in the midCretaceous of the ocean basins formed in the Mesozoic. Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) are discrete and particularly organicrich intervals within these midCretaceous organicrich sequences and are defined by pronounced carbon isotope excursions. Marine productivity during OAEs appears to have been enhanced by the increased availability of biolimiting nutrients in seawater due to hydrothermal alteration of submarine basalts in the Pacific and proto Indian oceans. The exact mechanisms behind the deposition of organicrich sediments in the midCretaceous are still a matter of discussion, but a hypothesis which is often put forward is that their deposition was a consequence of the coupling of a particular paleogeography with changes in ocean circulation and nutrient supply. In this study, we used a global coupled climate model to investigate oceanic processes that affect the interbasinal exchange of nutrients as well as their spatial distribution and bioavailability. We conclude that the midCretaceous North Atlantic was a nutrient trap as a consequence of an estuarine circulation with respect to the Pacific. Organicrich sediments in the North Atlantic were deposited below regions of intense upwelling. We suggest that enhanced productivity during OAEs was a consequence of upwelling of Pacific derived nutrientrich seawater associated with submarine igneous events. 4. Conclusions: [29] In the midCretaceous, the productivity associated with the formation of black shales was triggered by changes in ocean circulation whereby the Mesozoic ocean basins, the North Atlantic in particular, became estuarine with respect to the Pacific Ocean. This oceanographic regime transformed the North Atlantic into a nutrient trap and promoted conditions of low oxygen, low carbonate, high heavy/trace metals and the accumulation of organicrich sediments on the seafloor below regions of intense wind driven upwelling. [30] The accumulation and preservation of marine organic matter in these sediments was enhanced by midCretaceous warm seawater temperatures, i.e., lower seawater oxygensolubility, and by midCretaceous transgressive pulses which prevented dilution of the neritic sediments by siliciclastics. [31] OAEs occur intercalated with these organicrich sediments and are characterized by higher TOC, important elemental anomalies and globally synchronous perturbations in the carbon isotope record. Furthermore, they are coeval with important submarine volcanic events in the Pacific. For this reason, we suggest that intermediate seawater entering the North Atlantic through the Central American Seaway was more nutrient rich during OAEs even though the oceanographic mechanism leading to the deposition of organicrich sediments essentially remained unchanged.[32] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Evaluating the link between the sulfur-rich Laacher See volcanic eruption and the Younger Dryas climate anomaly  Abstract: The Younger Dryas is considered the archetypal millennial-scale climate change event, and identifying its cause is fundamental for thoroughly understanding climate systematics during deglaciations. However, the mechanisms responsible for its initiation remain elusive, and both of the most researched triggers (a meltwater pulse or a bolide impact) are controversial. Here, we consider the problem from a different perspective and explore a hypothesis that Younger Dryas climate shifts were catalysed by the unusually sulfurrich 12.880 0.040 ka BP eruption of the Laacher See volcano (Germany). We use the most recent chronology for the GISP2 ice core ion dataset from the Greenland ice sheet to identify a large volcanic sulfur spike coincident with both the Laacher See eruption and the onset of Younger Dryasrelated cooling in Greenland (i.e. the most recent abrupt Greenland millennial-scale cooling event, the Greenland Stadial 1, GS-1). Previously published lake sediment and stalagmite records confirm that the eruptions timing was indistinguishable from the onset of cooling across the North Atlantic but that it preceded westerly wind repositioning over central Europe by 200 years. We suggest that the initial short-lived volcanic sulfate aerosol cooling was amplified by ocean circulation shifts and/or sea ice expansion, gradually cooling the North Atlantic region and incrementally shifting the midlatitude westerlies to the south. The aerosol-related cooling probably only lasted 13 years, and the majority of Younger Dryas-related cooling may have been due to the seaiceocean circulation positive feedback, which was particularly effective during the intermediate ice volume conditions characteristic of 13 ka BP. We conclude that the large and sulfur-rich Laacher See eruption should be considered a viable trigger for the Younger Dryas. However, future studies should prioritise climate modelling of high-latitude volcanism during deglacial boundary conditions in order to test the hypothesis proposed here. 4 Conclusions: We propose that the unusually sulfur-rich 12.880 0.040 ka BP Laacher See volcanic eruption initiated GS-1 cooling and the atmospheric reorganisation associated with the YD event. Recent revisions to the chronological framework of key European climate archives now strongly suggest that the onset of GS-1-related North Atlantic cooling occurred simultaneously with the LSE. We have identified a large volcanic sulfur spike within the GISP2 ion data (Zielinski et al., 1997) on the recent GICC05modelext chronology that coincides with both the onset of GS-1 cooling as recorded within the same ice core and the date of the LSE. Lipid biomarker hydrogen isotope ratios from Meerfelder Maar further corroborate that GS-1 atmospheric cooling began at 12.880 ka BP, coincident with the Laacher See Tephra within the same sediment but preceding the larger dynamical atmospheric response associated with the YD in central Europe by 170 years (Rach et al., 2014). Aerosol-induced cooling immediately following the eruption may have caused a positive feedback involving sea ice expansion and/or AMOC weakening, as previously proposed for other Greenland stadials over the interval 3080 ka BP (Baldini et al., 2015a), the 6th century AD (Buntgen et al., 2016), the Little Ice Age (Zhong et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2012), and the Holocene in general (Kobashi et al., 2017). Viewed from this perspective, the YD was simply the latest, and last, manifestation of a last glacial stadial.The strongly asymmetric nature of the sulfate aerosol veil released by the LSE cooled the Northern Hemisphere preferentially, inducing a strong hemispheric temperature asymmetry and potentially triggering a cascade of dynamical climate shifts across both hemispheres, including a southward-shifted ITCZ and Hadley cells. Intermediate ice volume conditions around 13 ka BP, driven by rising insolation during the Last Glacial termination, may have promoted a positive feedback following the LSEs injection of between 6.76 and 104.8 Mt of SO2 into the stratosphere (Textor et al., 2003). This is also consistent with observations that YD-type events were not unique to the last deglaciation but existed during older deglaciations as well (Broecker et al., 2010). At least one high-latitude M6 eruption likely occurred during most deglacial intervals, and therefore GS-1 and earlier YD-type events may simply reflect the convergence of large, sulfaterich high-latitude NH eruptions with intermediate ice volume conditions. NH continental ice sheet decay induced continental lithospheric unloading and may have triggered highlatitude NH volcanism (Zielinski et al., 1997; Sternai et al., 2016), highlighting the intriguing possibility that eruptions such as the LSE were not randomly distributed geographically and temporally but instead were intrinsically linked to deglaciation. This perspective is strongly supported by a previous observation that the three largest eruptions (including the LSE) in the East Eifel Volcanic Field (Germany) were all associated with warming during glacial terminations and the reduction in ice mass in northern Europe (Nowell et al., 2006).The hypothesis that the Laacher See eruption triggered the YD is testable. Detailed tephrochronological studies of the ice containing the sulfate spike identified here could confirm the source of the sulfate, and, if it is confirmed as the LSE rather than a smaller Icelandic eruption, this would provide an important step towards attributing GS-1 and the YD to volcanic forcing (although evidence of GS-1 cooling already seems to occur immediately above the LST in central Europe). Similarly, volcanic sulfate triple isotope ratios of sulfur and oxygen provide information regarding the residence time of volcanic plumes in the stratosphere. The majority of atmospheric processes encourage mass-dependent fractionation; however, rare mass-independent fractionation processes produce isotope ratios that do not behave according to predictions based on mass-dependent processes (Martin et al., 2014). Historical volcanic eruptions where sulfate aerosols reached the stratosphere have been successfully identified in ice cores (Baroni et al., 2008; Savarino et al., 2003), indicating that the technique is effective at distinguishing large explosive eruptions from smaller local ones. This technique could also determine if the sulfate in the potential LSE sulfate spike reached the stratosphere. Although this would not necessarily confirm the LSE as the source, it would strongly suggest that the sulfate was derived from a climatologically significant eruption rather than a smaller Icelandic one. Most importantly, more climate modelling studies of high-latitude, large, and sulfur-rich eruptions under deglacial boundary conditions are needed to constrain the climate effects of volcanism during deglaciation. The role of halogen emissions are particularly understudied, and modelling efforts should also quantify their effects on climate.Clim. Past, 14, 969990, 2018 www.clim-past.net/14/969/2018/Finally, accurate dating of other large volcanic eruptions during intermediate ice volume conditions is key to testing the link between volcanism and other Greenland stadials; this information could eventually also support, or refute, the LSEs role in triggering the YD.More research is clearly necessary to better characterise the sensitivity of Last Glacial climate to volcanic eruption latitude, sulfur content, and magnitude. Due to perceived chronological mismatches, the concept that the YD was triggered by the LSE is vastly understudied compared to both the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis and the meltwater forcing hypothesis. However, the concept that the LSE triggered the YD has clear advantages compared to other hypotheses: (i) there is no disagreement that the eruption occurred, (ii) available evidence suggests that the eruption occurred synchronously with the initiation of YD cooling, (iii) a volcanic trigger is consistent with the relatively high frequency of similar, and often more severe, cooling events during intermediate ice volume conditions, (iv) volcanic aerosol cooling followed by a prolonged positive feedback has been implicated in other cooling events, and (v) events similar to the YD occurred over other deglaciations, supporting a relatively commonplace trigger such as volcanism.

__label__UNRELATED	"Glaciochemical evidence in an East Antarctica ice core of a recent (AD 14501850) neoglacial episode  Abstract: [1] Chemical analysis of a shallow (82.5 m) ice core from a location (DT263) in the essentially unexplored area of Princess Elizabeth Land, East Antarctica, has been used to construct a continuous, high-resolution 780-year (AD 12071996) glaciochemical record. During the twentieth century, snow accumulation rates and concentrations of chemical species in snow appear to be stable with short-term variations, indicating relatively stable and warm climatic conditions. The period of AD 14501850 in this record is characterized by sharply reduced snow accumulation rates and decreased concentrations of several chemical species that suffer postdepositional losses linked to very low accumulation rates. These characteristics are consistent with colder climatic conditions and suggest that this is likely a neoglacial episode. The timing of this episode coincides with the Little Ice Age (LIA), a relatively cold period in the Northern Hemisphere between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the end of the nineteenth century. Evidence in ice core and sedimentary records also indicates neoglacial conditions in some Southern Hemisphere locations during the general time frame of LIA. The DT263 record, along with a few published ice core records, points to the existence of an LIA-type climatic episode in Antarctica between the fifteenth century and the twentieth century. However, other Antarctic ice core records show no such evidence. Together, these records highlight the regional differences in Holocene climate variations in Antarctica. The DT263 record suggests that colder and drier conditions prevailed during the LIA time period at the eastern Indian Ocean sector of East Antarctica. 4. Conclusions: [30] A shallow ice core from the Princess Elizabeth Land region of East Antarctica was analyzed for chemical composition. The chemical records from this core cover the last 780 years (AD 12071996). Snow annual accumulation rates calculated from annually dated snow layers and from volcanic time stratigraphic markers indicate that the average accumulation rate during the period between the midfifteenth century and the early or mid-nineteenth century was much reduced compared with those of the earlier period (the early thirteenth century to the mid-fifteenth century) and the later period (the late nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century). For instance, the average accumulation rate between 1450 and 1810 is nearly 80% lower than the twentieth century average. Such sharply reduced accumulation suggests that the climate conditions in this region during this period of 400 years (approximately 14501850) were colder than the earlier and later periods. Further evidence of reduced accumulation and therefore of colderclimate during this period is found in the decreased concentrations of chemical species that are reversibly deposited in snow. [31] This period of unusually cold climate conditions in the eastern Indian Ocean sector in East Antarctica coincides with the time frame of the Little Ice Age, which has been found to be a common neoglacial episode in many Northern Hemisphere locations and in a few places in the Southern Hemisphere. However, evidence from Antarctica ice core records does not consistently support a continent-wide neoglacial episode between the beginning of the fifteenth century and the end of the nineteenth century. Therefore regional differences in Antarctic climate variations during the LIA time period appear to be very important when assessing climate history during the last millennium. [32] Due to the general lack of glaciological information (e.g., ice flow) from this region of Antarctica, the conclusions based on the DT263 record are tentative and will need to be verified by additional information from ice cores and other glaciological archives in this region.[33] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Thermal erosion of cratonic lithosphere as a potential trigger for mass-extinction  Abstract: The temporal coincidence between large igneous provinces (LIPs) and mass extinctions has led many to pose a causal relationship between the two. However, there is still no consensus on a mechanistic model that explains how magmatism leads to the turnover of terrestrial and marine plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Here we present a synthesis of ammonite biostratigraphy, isotopic data and high precision U-Pb zircon dates from the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) and Pliensbachian-Toarcian (Pl-To) boundaries demonstrating that these biotic crises are both associated with rapid change from an initial cool period to greenhouse conditions. We explain these transitions as a result of changing gas species emitted during the progressive thermal erosion of cratonic lithosphere by plume activity or internal heating of the lithosphere. Our petrological model for LIP magmatism argues that initial gas emission was dominated by sulfur liberated from sulfide-bearing cratonic lithosphere before CO2 became the dominant gas. This model offers an explanation of why LIPs erupted through oceanic lithosphere are not associated with climatic and biotic crises comparable to LIPs emitted through cratonic lithosphere."
__label__UNRELATED	"Physiographic and tectonic settings of high-sulfidation epithermal gold-silver deposits of the Andes and their controls on mineralizing processes Introduction: The Andes are the world's most endowed region with respect to giant magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits (Cooke et al., 2005). They host the largest-known porphyry copper deposits (e.g., Rio BlancoLos BroncesLos Sulfatos, El Teniente, Chuquicamata) as well as many of theworld's largest epithermal AuAg deposits (e.g., Yanacocha, Lagunas Norte, PascuaLama, Veladero: Sillitoe, 2008). The vast majority of Andean epithermal deposits containing N10 Moz Au are of highsulfidation type. These deposits have a close link to a magmatic source for fluids, volatiles and metals (e.g., Deyell et al., 2004; Rye, 1993) but form at depths of typically less than 1 km (e.g. Sillitoe, 2010) and consequentlymineralizingprocesses are influenced by the near-surface physicochemical environment. The main focus of this review is on deposits and districts where the bulk of the precious metal is contained in the epithermal environment, i.e., the shallow part of magmatichydrothermal systems, and concentrates on the physiographic environment of epithermal mineralization. This paper does not discuss major porphyry Cu deposits in detail, although the shallow portions of many of these have been overprinted by epithermal mineralization or alteration (e.g., Masterman et al., 2004; Ossandon et al., 2001). Similarly, the deposits hosting Sn, W, Ag and Au ores in the eastern 15. Conclusions: High-sulfidation epithermal deposits of the Andes formed in predictable geological and geomorphological settings. They are located at high elevation and largely near the crest of the Andean cordillera in segments where volcanism is currently absent or subdued and where subduction angles are shallow. All were emplaced during major periods of contractile deformation and uplift andmost coincidedwith the terminal stages of local arc magmatism. The vast majority of deposits are between ca. 17 and 5 Ma old. Although the tectonic setting in which these deposits form makes them prone to erosion, their restricted age range is not only a function of preservation potential but also attributed to favorable tectonomagmatic settings at the time of hydrothermal activity. Eocene high-sulfidation epithermal deposits are only known from the driest regions of the Atacama Desert but they plausibly formed under similar tectonomagmatic conditions as the Miocene ones.

However, a magma from which the mineralizing magmatic fluids are derived must have present, albeit fluid exsolution typically occurred N34 km below the surface at the time of hydrothermal activity.Significant erosion during hydrothermal activity is documented for a number of districts (e.g., Lagunas Norte, Pierina, El Indio belt, California Vetas Mining District) and mineralization ages generally become younger upstream in both, the El Indio belt and the California Vetas Mining District. Fluid boiling and mixing with meteoric water are enhanced near topographic breaks such as the heads of incising valleys or backscarps of pediments, ultimately stimulating mineralization in those locations."
__label__UNRELATED	"Lake level change, climate, and the impact of natural events: the role of seismic and volcanic events in the formation of the Lake Patzcuaro Basin, Michoacan, Mexico  Abstract: In Central Mexico, lake-level change is commonly used as a proxy for climatic fluctuation. Lacustrine sequences are not stable units, however, and have been dramatically impacted by processes related to the evolution of the Mexican Volcanic Belt (MVB) and the fragmentation of the southern part of the North American plate including volcanism, tectonic action, landslides, and human activity. One notable example is the Lake Patzcuaro Basin, Mexico, which has one of the most intensively studied paleoenvironmental records in Latin America. Geologic processes have altered the lacustrine sequence in the southwest portion of the lake basin during the last 48,000 years. These include volcanic activity, major uplift, landslides and related tsunamis, and earthquakes. This new record has important implications for interpretations of climatic events in Central Mexico during the Pleistocene, and the impact these may have had on human settlement in the region. r 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: We consider that the lakes in the Mexican Volcanic Belt in the last thousand years have played an active role in the evolution of humans. The water bodies are the most significant and clear records of the geological events, climatic changes and the impact of human activities. Most of these events have been registered in the assemblage of sediments. To understand the functioning of these variables will give us a clearer vision of the interactions in the lacustrine record. Tectonic and volcanic processes have altered the sedimentation of Lake Patzcuaro in the last 40,000 years. For example, in the zone of Jaracuaro a great uplift of silts took place, caused by two factors; magmatic intrusions and landslide from El Estribo volcano. These two processes caused substantial changes in the sedimentation rate comparable to the one generated by anthropogenic processes. We consider that the problem of erosion into the lake has not been sufficiently studied, since the estimates obtained so far are solely based on models that only give a point of view according to the data used. They will be nearer or distant from reality, depending on the data from which the model was constructed. To solve this problem, it isrequired to extract cores with techniques that will allow us to obtain intact material, because it has been seen that the sediments contain a high percentage of saturation by water. Frozen cores and precise sediment dating are required. The seismic effects in the lake are a part of its evolution and have direct influence on its recharge. An earthquake causes openings in the fractures from which there would be contributions to the lake. However, an earthquake also represents a phenomenon of slope instability that in Patzcuaro caused the landslide of El Estribo, the collapse of El Metate and surely the one on the island of Janitzio. These collapses and earthquakes are manifested in the lake, with the increase in the water level, with the compression of water saturated clays, and the generation of small tsunamis (such as the one in 1858). In earthquakes with similar characteristics to those in 1845 and 1858, it is evident that the region of the lake behaves like an island, resulting in damages of IX degrees in intensity on the modified Mercalli scale. The magnitudes of three known events are higher than 6, which had devastating consequences for the town of Patzcuaro. Tectonic and the volcanic process in the Mexican Volcanic Belt produce significant deformation in lacustrine sequences that must be considered when evaluating the causality of deposition. Seismical studies in progress will elucidate the lakes geometry and the times and mechanism of sediment inputs."
__label__UNRELATED	"A detection of Milankovitch frequencies in global volcanic activity  Abstract: A rigorous detection of Milankovitch periodicities in volcanic output across the PleistoceneHolocene ice age has remained elusive. We report on a spectral analysis of a large number of well-preserved ash plume deposits recorded in marine sediments along the Pacifi c Ring of Fire. Our analysis yields a statistically signifi cant detection of a spectral peak at the obliquity period. We propose that this variability in volcanic activity results from crustal stress changes associated with ice age mass redistribution. In particular, increased volcanism lags behind the highest rate of increasing eustatic sea level (decreasing global ice volume) by 4.0 3.6 k.y. and correlates with numerical predictions of stress changes at volcanically active sites. These results support the presence of a causal link between variations in ice age climate, continental stress fi eld, and volcanism.

__label__UNRELATED	"Fingerprinting facies of the Tuff IF marker, with implications for early hominin palaeoecology, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania  Abstract: The top of Tuff IF marks the upper boundary of the Plio-/Pleistocene Bed I succession exposed in Olduvai Gorge, NE Tanzania, a tephrostratigraphic interval that is well known for remarkable Oldowan archaeological and vertebrate fossil assemblages, including early hominins. Geochemically, Tuff IF is characterized by a relatively consistent silica-undersaturated trachytic to phonolitic composition that relates both in terms of numerical ages (1.79Ma) and compositional constraints toOlmoti volcano, located 2238 kmEofOlduvaiGorge. Measured Tuff IF sections are characterized by a thick unwelded pyroclastic flow in proximal settings and a succession of surges and ashfalls that interfingers with fluvio-lacustrine deposits of the Olduvai Basin in the medial to distal settings. Only in those areas with a relatively low topographic gradient, in distal reaches and beyond the toe of an Olmoti-sourced volcaniclastic fan, did the Tuff IF marker develop a typical threefold subdivision comprising: (1) primary surges andminor fallout, (2) reworked pumice units as lateral correlatives of proximally emplaced pyroclastic flows and (3) a succession of mass flows in conjunction with aeolian and fluvially reworked units. The pyroclastic marker unit is thus highly heterogeneous with regard to its vertical and lateral facies architecture and this has immediate effects on its preservation potential and in situ burial of fossils and stone artifacts. Even though the volcanically-related environmental perturbationswere probablymore severe at the eastern lakemargin, the evidence for at least temporary freshwater sources and trees suggests environments conducive to hominin activities, but not during emplacement of Tuff IF pyroclastic flows and surges. This inference is supported by the presence of rich Oldowan stone artifact assemblages immediately preceding and following the deposition of Tuff IF, but only extremely sparse archaeological traces from one site in Tuff IF, restricted to the upper, fluvially reworked portion of Tuff IF. Tuff IF facies record the maximum of a regressive (drying) cycle that correlates with regional marine arid indicators. An ecological crisis covering 20003500 a of time during Tuff IF deposition resulted not only from the lethal effects of explosive volcanism but also from its coincidence with a pronounced period of climate induced drought. These combined effects appear to have made at least the eastern basin uninhabitable by hominins and other vertebrates for most of the time during which Tuff IF accumulated. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: Tuff IF is the most widespread of the Bed I marker tuffs and resulted from a series of explosive eruptions of its trachytic-phonolitic Olmoti volcanic source, alternating with and finally followed by times of massive tephra reworking. Measured Tuff IF sections are characterized by a thick unwelded ignimbrite in proximal settings and a succession of surges and ashfalls in the medial to distal settings. Only in those areas with a relatively gentle pre-eruptive topographic gradient, on and beyond the toe of the Olmoti-sourced volcaniclastic fan, did the pyroclastic marker unit Tuff IF develop its typical threefold subdivision consisting of: (1) primary surges and minor fallout, (2) reworked pumice units as lateral correlatives of proximally emplaced pyroclastic flows and (3) a succession of mass flows in conjunction with aeolian and fluvially reworked units. The pyroclastic marker unit is highly heterogeneous with regard to its vertical and lateral facies architecture and this has immediate effects on the preservation potential and in situ burial of fossils and stone artifacts, for example Level 1 at FLK-N in uppermost Bed I (Leakey, 1971). The upper, fluvially reworked subunit of Tuff IF may contain redeposited materials from strata lower in the stratigraphy. This is particularly valid for the FLK-N complex where Leakey (1971) documented channelized units of reworked IF tephra that eroded down sufficiently far that the IFbraided fluvial unit comes to sit directly on waxy claystones that underlie the tuff marker bed elsewhere.Facies analysis also shows that saline-alkaline Lake Olduvai was not only fed by fresh-water spring systems of lake-margin wetlands (Deocampo and Ashley, 1999) but also by shallow braided river channels associated with a volcaniclastic fan system draining the Volcanic Highlands at its eastern and southern margins. Moreover, beyond the former eastern lake margins evidence for the existence of temporary water sources such as floodplain pools has been deduced from Tuff IF lithofacies interpretation in the upstream areas of such rivers. In an otherwise inhospitable landscape these may have acted as important freshwater sources for large mammals and hominins. Prior and after emplacement of Tuff IF pyroclastic flows and surges it is the toe of the river-dissected volcaniclastic fan at the eastern lake margin where Bamford (2005), Bamford et al. (2006) and Albert et al. (2006) found evidence for tree vegetation, including palms and where hominin activities appear to be concentrated (Leakey and Hay, 1982; Blumenschine et al., 2003). This is particularly valid for times of low lake level, when Lake Olduvai was contracted to a minimum size and freshwater wetlands could form at the toe of the Olmoti sourced drainages. Flushing of the wetland sediment by meteoric and fluvially sourced waters then favoured rich vegetation, including trees in the eastern lake margin area.In contrast, only a few archaeological sites in upper Bed I sediments have been published from the western lake margin so far (Hay, 1976; Blumenschine et al., 2003) even though proximaldistal changes in facies and thickness of the pyroclastic units, suggest that the volcanically-related environmental perturbations were probably less severe to the west of the lake in contrast with its eastern side. Environments of the western part of the basin were also more stable in terms of lake level fluctuations even though lake transgressions and regressions may be expressed there by variations in salinity.The recognition of a complete drying out of Lake Olduvai during Tuff IF times considerably changes palaeoecological reconstructions of the area and consequently also the assessment of future hominin excavation sites. The drying episode that caused the lake regression near the top of Bed I had not ended by the time Tuff IF was deposited. It was only ended by the onset of Tuff IF fluvial reworking such that the topmost fluvially reworked and frequently rooted part of Tuff IF signals the return of increasingly wetter conditions contemporaneous to lake level rise and the recolonization of the volcanic hazard area by plants and animals.Harris and Van Couvering (1995) have described how a mock aridity is caused by volcanism. However in the case of Tuff IF where volcanism coincided with a real aridity crisis, the volcanically induced mock aridity effects would have superimposed themselves on top of the climatic extreme. Considering that Tuff IF covers a complete transgressive/regressive cycle with an average duration of 4000 a, the resulting ecological crisis caused by the combined effects of Tuff IF volcanism and climate-induced drought would have lasted 2000 3500 a (cf. Fig. 21B). This most probably reduced the abundance and variety of resources for hominins to unsustainable levels."
__label__UNRELATED	"Recent low-latitude freezethaw on Mars  Abstract: Outside polar latitudes, features corresponding to surface thaw have yet to be identified on Mars. The youthful gully landforms observed at mid-high latitude [Malin, M., Edgett, K., 2000. Science 288, 23302335] are the nearest candidate, but the source (and nature) of the gully carving agent remains controversial [e.g., Musselwhite, D.S., Swindle, T.D., Lunine, J.I., 2001. Geophys. Res. Lett. 28, 12831285; Mellon, M.T., Phillips, R.J., 2001. J. Geophys. Res. 106, 115; Knauth, L.P., Burt, D.M., 2002. Icarus 158, 267271; Costard, F., Forget, F., Mangold, N., Peulvast, J.P., 2002. Science 295, 110113; Christensen, P.R., 2003. Nature 422, 4548; Treiman, A.H., 2003. J. Geophys. Res. 108]. At higher obliquity than the present epoch, near-surface ground ice should be present globally [Mellon, M.T., Jakosky, B.M., 1995. J. Geophys. Res. 100 (E6), 1178111799], populated by condensation of atmospheric water vapour in the top few metres of the regolith, or emplaced as dusty ice sheets reaching down towards the equator. The latitudinal restriction of these gullies to regions poleward of 30 appears to argue against a thaw component to their formationsince ground ice is present and stable at all latitudes at high obliquity, the current (low) obliquity regime should result in ground ice thaw at low latitudes, where insolation and daytime temperatures are currently greatest, and this is not observed. A previously undescribed meltwater sequence in the Cerberus plains, at 20 N/187 E, shows that comparable, but much more continuous, and mappable melting and surface runoff have occurred in the geologically recent past at near-equatorial latitudes on Mars. Polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains is seen by the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) to suffer sequential, regional-scale volatile-loss consistent with thaw of near-surface ground ice under periglacial conditions. This degradation is continuously sampled by a single MOC strip, showing an icy landscape undergoing thaw modification and collapse, and may form the first evidence of equatorial wet-based glaciation during late Amazonian time, with indications of melting within the last million years. The dissolution and re-formation of polygonal ground links this landform to freezethaw processes, providing the conclusion to a question that has been the subject of debate for three decadeswhether Mars polygonal grounds require ice to formand a consistent explanation for the fate of the water that carved the great outflow channels, much of which may still reside as ground ice in the regolith. This thaw occurs in the Cerberus Formation; deposits that are considered to be magmatic in origin, and the type formation for late-stage, plains-style volcanism on Mars [Keszthelyi, L., McEwen, A.S., Thordarson T., 2000. J. Geophys. Res. 105, 1502715049]. By superposing large numbers of small impact craters, polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains sustains previous suggestions of a non-magmatic origin for this and other landforms in the region [Page, D.P., Murray, J.B., 2006. Icarus 183, 4654]. Together, these periglacial landforms document evidence of climate change much younger than is currently recognised by crater counts, with important implications for age constraints on young surfaces and absolute age determinations by this method. It is tentatively suggested that this melting may be occurring today, with a striking correspondence between permafrost thaw in the Cerberus plains, the high atmospheric methane flux currently observed over this region [Mumma, M.J., Novak, R.E., DiSanti, M.A., Bonev, B.P., Dello Russo, N., 2004. Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 36, 1127; Krasnopolsky, V.A., Maillard, J.P., Owen, T.C., 2004. Icarus 172, 537547; Formisano, V., Atreya, S., Encrenaz, T., Ignatiev, N., Giuranna, M., 2004. Science 306, 17581761], and the only latitude zone on Marsequatorward of 30 Nwhere melting of ground ice is thought possible in the current climate [Haberle, R.M., McKay, C.P., Schaeffer, J., Cabrol, N.A., Grin, E.A., Zent, A.P., Quinn, R., 2001. J. Geophys. Res. 106 (E10), 2331723326; Lobitz, B., Wood, B.L., Averner, M.M., McKay, C.P., 2001. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98, 21322137]. Low-latitude polygonal ground as transient, and hydrologically active over wide areas transforms our understanding of the recent climatic evolution of Mars, supporting models of atmospheric water-ice migration [Mischna, M., Richardson, M.I., Wilson, R.J., McCleese, D.J., 2003. J. Geophys. Res. 108 (E6). 5062], complex, volatile stratigraphies [Clifford, S.M., Parker, T.J., 2001. Icarus 154, 40 79], and hypothesised, geologically recent ice ages [Head, J.W., Mustard, J.F., Kreslavsky, M.A., Milliken, R.E., Marchant, D.R., 2003. Nature 426, 797802]. The temporal coincidence of glacial epochs on the Earth and Mars during the Quaternary and latest Amazonian would suggest a coupled system linking both [Sagan, C., Young, A.T., 1973. Nature 243, 459]. E-mail address: d.p.page@open.ac.uk. 0019-1035/$ see front matter 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.icarus.2007.01.005 84 D.P. Page / Icarus 189 (2007) 83117 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: Polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains is dynamic and secondary in origin, its thaw in Marte Vallis linking this landform to thermal contraction processes in ice-rich regolith. Meltwa-ter streams derived from this thaw can be continuously traced for over 15 km [an order of magnitude greater than other geologically recent surface runoff on Mars (e.g., Malin and Edgett, 2000)], pond in an enclosed lake, and connect distinct associations of process-related thaw features. Polygonal ground takes part in this runoff, preserving evidence of freezethaw cyclingthe first such for Mars. This degradation is only partial, so it is possible that a large metastable ground ice mass, in diffusive disequilibrium with the current atmosphere, remains.The spatial arrangement of these deposits parallels those of terrestrial periglacial environments; were a sequence exhibiting these proximal to distal relationships developed on Earth, there would be little hesitation in ascribing an ice-marginal, periglacial origin (e.g., see Baker et al., 2003). This explanation is consistently extended to other examples of patterned ground [i.e., the superposition of putative rootless cones and platy deposits in the Athabasca Valles (Page and Murray, 2006)], as the predicted expression of recognised periglacial phenomena, and questions the view of platy, patterned ground as magmatic the principal evidence for geologically recent flood volcanism on Mars (Keszthelyi et al., 2000; Berman and Hartmann, 2002; Plescia, 2003). This may be why low latitude patterned grounds receive so little attention (e.g., Mangold et al., 2004). Although climatic controls are described for such deposits at higher latitudes, it is at low latitude that they are seen in process of change (as might be expected, for this is where they are least stable).The premise of a periglacial origin for the Cerberus Formation is formed by analogy to the terrestrial environment. This interpretation and the hypothesis proposed for secondary landform generation is inductive in nature and not binding, but the morphological inductions (the association of ice-related landforms) and the stratigraphical inductions (the superposition relationships) are consilient. That is, these differing classes of observations converge in unified periglacial explanation, and are a test of the truth of this hypothesisone that is consistent with observed stratigraphical relationships where volcanism is not. By implication, superposition of large numbers of small impact craters also places these landforms in the appropriate (i.e., geologically recent) temporal settinga prime example of the explanatory surprises that are generated by consilient hypotheses (Gould, 2003; Baker, 2003).The spatial correlation between regions of favourable melting, the high atmospheric methane flux and surface thaw in the Cerberus plains adds a climatic element to this convergence, and while the evidence for ongoing melting is largely inferred, permafrost degradation does effectively reconcile thaw at low latitudes with the preponderance of cold-based features seen at mid-high latitudes (i.e., glaciers, viscous flow lobes and lineated valley fill) elsewhere in the northern plains. Whatever the ultimate control on martian climate, the most recent evidence of ground ice thaw would be expected at low latitude, where insolation and daytime temperatures are currently greatest (and where, at low obliquity, the conditions favour ice melting, not accumulation). Sublimation may produce polygonal ground; it may even produce surface pitting; it cannot produce kilometrescale dendritic runoff and intrusive frost mounds. The conclusion of geologically recent hydroclimatic change at low latitudeis certainly more complex (and problematic) than outlined here, but may help resolve open questions over the nature and source of the agent that carved the youthful gullies at higher latitudes (see Heldmann and Mellon, 2004), and the water-generated landforms and landscapes of Mars (that) have proven especially difficult to unite under a single working hypothesis (Baker, 2001).The platy deposits embayed within the crater lake (E) are clearly intraformational. Their thaw and fracture visibly affect (at GI ), and therefore postdate, the polygonal substrate. Fracturing of these and identical platy deposits in Elysium Planitia do not uniquely identify pack ice, but when this also forms the source of unequivocal meltwater features, then an icy origin becomes harder to dismiss. Unless processes operate on Mars that are able to replicate such cold-climate features, in form and spatial arrangement (with direct, well-understood terrestrial analogues), these cannot be lavas, and a significant episode of martian geological history must be reconsidered. The periglacial origin determined for polygonal ground in the Cerberus plains, and the widespread association of platy, polygonal, thermokarstic terrain in Chryse, Utopia and Amazonis Planitia, have implications of global extent. The designation of glaciomarine facies (at Fig. 2, O) considers the Marte Vallis to be a paleo-seaway connecting the platy deposits of the Elysium and Amazonis plains. MOC E05-03487 is proximal to where this outflow channel empties into the Amazonis basin, and the inner contact considered by Parker et al. (1993) to be the shoreline of a former northern polar ocean.This is no subset of the geomorphological evidence; platy, patterned ground is abundant and easily recognised, planetwide at these latitudes, and this freezethaw visible along the distal length of the Marte Vallis and out into the Amazonis plain (e.g., MOCs E05-03487, E17-00257, M03-06377, E02-01361, R23-00683, M11-01536, M22-01079, R14-01144, R15-00973, S09-02331, R14-00254). The similarity of the thermokarst to pitted, polygonal terrain in Mars south polar region, where there is no doubt of its origin (Malin et al., 2001), is striking. Although the substrates differ substantially, a major volatile component is required for formation in both, and recent climate change, the probable cause.That plains-forming deposits in the northern plains of Mars have suffered geologically recent thaw modification, possibly related to deglaciation, has implications that reach far beyond martian climate change. The evidence from the Cerberus region is that the coincidence of climate change on the Earth and Mars is even closer than suspected (e.g., Head et al., 2003), and may continue to this day. As originally suggested by Sagan and Young (1973), parallel climate change on these two planets an ice age Mars coincident with Earths glacial Quaternary periodwould imply a dominant external influence in longerterm climate change on our own planet."
__label__UNRELATED	"Glacial influence on caldera-forming eruptions Introduction: Volcanic influence on climate is a subject of many studies, but the reverse connection, i.e. climate influence on periodicity, size, volume, and character of volcanic eruptions is a rarely visited topic. Recently glaciated and volcanically active regions such as Iceland, Kamchatka, Alaska, and the southern Andes areas may serve as key areas in answering these questions. It has been suggested that deglaciations have increased volcanism in several areas around the world: e.g. Iceland, (Gudmundsson, 1986; Slater et al., 1998) and Sierra Nevada, California (Glazner et al., 1999; Jellinek et al., 2004). The relationship between ice cap retreat and volcanic activity has been evaluated considering unloading effects on both deep mantle melting zones (e.g. Jull and McKenzie, 1996) and shallow magma reservoirs (e.g. Gudmundsson, 1986; Jellinek et al., 2004). On the one hand, the increased eruption rates during glacial unloading are considered to be related to changes in the state of stress of the crust during deglaciation (Gudmundsson, 1986) and the release of magma stored in crustal chambers during the glacial period (Kelemen et al., 1997). On the other hand, it has been suggested that decompression during deglaciation can produce a large increase in mantle melting rates, causing increase in basaltic 6. Summary and conclusions: In this paper, we have investigated how the presence of ice caps during glacial periods and other secondary processes such as hydrothermal alteration or gravitational failure may modify the local stress field discouraging or favouring ring fault initiation and subsequent caldera collapse. For this, we have run a series of 2D plane strain numerical models simulating different scenarios by varying: (1) the thickness and asymmetric distribution of the existing ice cap, (2) the depth and size of the magmatic reservoir responsible for the subsequent collapse event, (3) the thickness and mechanical properties of the roof rock due to the alteration by hydrothermal fluids, (4) the existence of a deeper andwider magmatic reservoir and (5) possible gravitational failure triggered, in part, by the hydrothermal weakening of the roof rock under the glacial cover.In short, we have seen that the existence of ice caps does not favour directly the initiation of ring-faults and caldera formation, since the load of the ice cap tends to reduce the tensile stresses at surface which may inhibit the initiation of ring faults. In many occasions, the resultant stresses are far of reaching the tensile strength of the rock and even of ice, depending on the size and depth of the magmatic system. Nevertheless, tensile stresses induced by ice caps with dimensions of the same order of the volcanic system (including shallow and deep reservoir) may increase fracture-related porosity in the crustal rocks surrounding deep-seated magma chambers augmenting the effective size of such reservoirs. Continuous magma accumulation in these deeper reservoirs, results in doming of the crustal segment where the reservoir is located and starts to have an effect on the stresses in the upper part of the crust. In these situations, the compressive stresses induced by the ice load and the doming stresses due to the deep-seated reservoir counteract. Thus, an augment of the excess pressure inside the deep-seated reservoir and/or a reduction in size of the ice cap due to ice retreat or melting occurring during interstadials leads to higher tensile stresses at the ice rock contact favouring ring fault initiation.Besides, the ice cap existence may lead to secondary processes such as subglacial volcanicmass build-up followingby gravitational failure or hydrothermal weakening of the roof rock, that have been confirmed to be important parameters prone to favour the initiation of tensional fractures at surface for the sameunderpressure of themagmatic system. Most importantly, the rapid changes of surface topography (ice and rocks it moves) and thus over- and underpressure during interstadial (when the amount of ice widely oscillate on centuries-millennial timescales) may have most profound effects. The influence of ice may have an important role on timing and incrementality of magma discharge; under the ice (and ice-supported surface topography, e.g. Table mountains) more magma can accumulate, and under the glacial overpressure this magma will have greater proportions of volatiles. Some of these volatiles may be inherited from hydrothermally altered roof rocks that fingerprint magmas with low 18O values. Rapid and short-lived deglaciation during the interstadial cause additional amounts of vesiculation, leading to greater underpressures following the initial magma discharge (Fig. 13), leading to greater likelihood of ring fault propagation and caldera collapse. Whether more magma iserupting during the interstadial or intraglacial remains a question for future investigation, it appears that the Kamchatkan glaciations have an effect of eruption clustering, and less frequent but bigger eruptions in pyroclastic, rather than effusive character.Supplementarymaterials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2011.02.001."
__label__UNRELATED	"The volcanosedimentary evolution of a postVariscan intramontane basin in the Swiss Alps (Glarus Verrucano) as revealed by zircon UPb age dating and Hf isotope geochemistry  Abstract: In the aftermath of crustal shortening and thickening due to multiple collisions between Gondwana-derived continental fragments and Laurussia during Middle to Late Palaeozoic times (culminating in the Variscan orogeny in the Mid-Carboniferous, e.g. von Raumer et al. 2013), numerous small intracontinental basins opened all over Europe (McCann et al. 2006). They developed due to crustal re-equilibration processes and/or post-collisional strike-slip movements, which resulted in a Basin-and-Range topography (Lorenz and Nicholls 1976). During the last five decades, age and geologic development of many of these basins was worked out in detail (e.g. Roscher and Schneider 2006; McCann et al. 2006; Pochat and van den Driessche 2011), and this work provides information on, e.g. late to post-orogenic volcanism, basin evolution, or regional climate development at the turn from the Carboniferous to the Permian. Several such basins do occur in the Western and Central Alps and their forelands (Fig. 1), and much sedimentologic and geochronological work has been done in some of them during the last three decades (e.g. Matter 1987, Schaltegger and Corfu 1995, Schaltegger 1997, Capuzzo and Bussy 2000, and Capuzzo and Wetzel 2004). One of the most extensive Swiss examples of such a basin, the Glarus Verrucano Basin (GVB, Figs. 2, 3), played Abstract The Late Palaeozoic Glarus Verrucano basin (GVB, Glarus Alps, eastern Switzerland) formed as an intramontane graben in the aftermath of the Variscan orogeny. Its fill, the Glarus Verrucano, consists of immature alluvial fan and playa lake deposits with intercalated bimodal volcanics (basalts and rhyolites). Despite its importance for local and regional geology, no modern sedimentologic or stratigraphic studies on the GVB exist. By means of sedimentologic and geochronologic studies, we reconstruct the volcano-sedimentary evolution of the GVB: it developed at the Carboniferous/Permian boundary and experienced a first (bimodal) volcanic phase around 285 Ma. For the same time, indications for temporarily humid climate in the otherwise rather arid Early Permian are demonstrated (e.g. pyrite-bearing sandstones). During the Middle and Early Late Permian, increasing aridity is indicated by playa deposits, fanglomerates and subaerial ignimbrites, which mark a second (silicic) volcanic phase at 268 Ma. The detrital zircon age spectra are dominated by Late Variscan ages and thus demonstrate that older sedimentary and metamorphic rocks once forming the Variscan nappe edifice were already mostly eroded at that time. Finally, some larger-scale speculations are given which Conclusions: The following conclusions can be drawn from the present study of the GVB The detrital zircon spectra from the GVB document long-lasting magmatic and volcanic activity from 333 to 285 Ma in the area of the future northern margin of the Tethys ocean (Helvetic shelf). Hence, the youngest reliable ages from a given sample can be used to determine its approximate depositional age in this biostratigraphically poorly constrained basin fill. Volcanic activity within the GVB itself was episodic and restricted to two volcanic phases. A first bimodal phase occurred around 285 Ma and a second silicic phase around 268 Ma. The GVB was a hydrologically closed basin which received sedimentary detritus from its immediate hinterland. The latter was part of the remnants of the Variscan orogen which in Early Permian times must have been considerably worn down and dominated by post-Variscan volcanoes. It did not expose any widespread Variscan sedimentary or crystalline/metamorphic nappes of pre-Variscan origin which could have served as quantitatively important sedimentary sources. An important reorganization of regional palaeogeography of the future Helvetic shelf must have taken place during the time span from the Late Permian to the Earliest Triassic as the detrital zircon age spectra from Early Triassic rocks are considerably different from the spectra from the Permian Glarus Verrucano.Acknowledgments We thank A.

__label__UNRELATED	"Massive volcanism, evaporite deposition, and the chemical evolution of the Early Cretaceous ocean  Abstract: Early Cretaceous (145100 Ma) rocks record a ~5 negative shift in the sulfur isotope composition of marine sulfate, the largest shift observed over the past 130 m.y. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this shift: (1) massive evaporite deposition associated with rifting during opening of the South Atlantic and (2) increased inputs of volcanically derived sulfur due to eruption of large igneous provinces. Each process produces a very different impact on marine sulfate concentrations, which in turn affects several biogeochemical phenomena that regulate the global carbon cycle and climate. Here we present sulfur isotope data from Resolution Guyot, Mid-Pacific Mountains (North Pacific Ocean), that track sympathetically with strontium isotope records through the ~5 negative sulfur isotope shift. We employ a linked sulfur-strontium isotope mass-balance model to identify the mechanisms driving the sulfur isotope evolution of the Cretaceous ocean. The model only reproduces the coupled negative sulfur and strontium isotope shifts when both hydrothermal and weathering fluxes increase. Our results indicate that marine sulfate concentrations increased significantly during the negative sulfur isotope shift and that enhanced hydrothermal and weathering input fluxes to the ocean played a dominant role in regulating the marine sulfur cycle and CO2 exchange in the atmosphere-ocean system during this interval of rapid biogeochemical change. INTRODUCTION The sulfate content of the ocean plays an important role in regulating the global carbon cycle and the chemical composition of the ocean-atmosphere system. For example, in the present sulfate-rich ocean, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) remineralizes as much as 50% of the organic matter in coastal marine sediments (Jrgensen, 1982) and affects phosphorus recycling efficiency and therefore marine primary productivity (Ingall et al., 1993; Van Cappellen and Ingall, 1996; Adams et al., 2010). Moreover, MSR increases carbonate alkalinity via bicarbonate production, which in turn affects the partitioning of CO2 between the atmosphere and ocean (Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001). However, marine sulfate concentrations have varied considerably over geologic time (Lowenstein et al., 2001), affecting the marine carbon cycle, the evolution of Earths climate system, and the long-term redox balance of the ocean-atmosphere system. The relative importance of marine sulfur inputs and outputs through time can be tracked in part by reconstructing the S isotope composition of sulfate phases (i.e., barite, calcium sulfate, and carbonate-associated sulfate) preserved in marine sedimentary rocks. The S isotope composition of marine sulfate (Ssulfate) represents a balance between the input of 34S-depleted S from riverine (continental weathering) and hydrothermal sources and the removal of 34S-depleted S via MSR and associated pyrite burial (Canfield, 2001). An ~5 negative excursion extending from ca.126 to 100 Ma represents the most distinguishing feature of the Ssulfate record spanning the past 130 m.y. (Paytan et al., 2004; Fig. 1). While original interpretations of this event implicated a combination of increased hydrothermal and weathering inputs and decreased pyrite burial rates as possible triggers (Paytan et al., 2004), more recent work postulates that increased evaporite deposition (calcium sulfate) associated with the opening of the South Atlantic during this time dramatically lowered marine sulfate concentrations and facilitated a drop in relative pyrite burial rates (Wortmann and Chernyavsky, 2007; Wortmann and Paytan, 2012). Either of these processes operating in isolation could account for the negative Ssulfate excursion. However, each has a very different impact on marine sulfate concentrations: increased volcanism and continental weathering rates increase sulfate delivery to the ocean, whereas evaporite deposition removes it during calcium sulfate precipitation. Although there is geologic evidence for both massive evaporite deposition (Hay et al., 2006; Davison, 2007; Chaboureau et al., 2013) and extensive volcanism due to the formation of several large igneous provinces (LIPs) during the Early Cretaceous (Chandler et al., 2012; Mills et al., 2014), the relative importance of these factors in regulating marine sulfate levels and attendant biogeochemical change remains unconstrained. The Cretaceous Period (ca. 14565 Ma) is also punctuated by several ocean anoxic events (OAEs), short-term (<1 m.y.) intervals of carbon cycle disruption during which massive amounts of organic carbon were buried in marine sediments (Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976). OAE1a occurred at ca. 125 Ma (Ogg et al., 2012), although its temporal relationship with the negative Ssulfate shift has not been documented unambiguously (Gomes et al., 2016). Given the strong coupling between the geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur, improved understanding of how ocean chemistry and sulfate concentrations evolved over this period could provide insight into the factors that conditioned the oceans for carbon cycle instability (Wortmann and Chernyavsky, 2007; Adams et al., 2010; Gomes et al., 2016). *E-mail: matt@earth.northwestern.edu GEOLOGY, May 2017; v. 45; no. 5; p. 475478 | Data Repository item 2017153 | doi:10.1130/G38667.1 | Published online 15 March 2017 2017 The Authors.

The 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater represents a balance between hydrothermal (relatively unradiogenic, lower 87Sr/86Sr) and terrestrial weathering (relatively radiogenic, higher 87Sr/86Sr) inputs (Palmer and Edmond, 1989). While the relative ratio of these input fluxes largely controls the isotopic composition of the marine Sr reservoir, the output flux of pyrite burial exerts strong control over Ssulfate due to the large kinetic isotope effect associated with MSR and accompanying pyrite formation (Canfield and Teske, 1996). Thus, changes in the input fluxes (either in magnitude or isotopic composition) should be recorded in both isotope systems, while changes in the output flux (e.g., pyrite burial) should only affect the S cycle. If the Early Cretaceous negative S isotope shift was triggered by massive evaporite deposition and an attendant decrease in global pyrite burial rates, S and Sr isotope records should be decoupled. By contrast, if massive volcanism were responsible for driving the S isotope shift, one would expect a sympathetic shift in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of seawater (as recorded in marine carbonate). We present new S isotope data from Resolution Guyot, Mid-Pacific Mountains, that track sympathetically with Sr isotope records through the ~5 negative sulfur isotope shift, and employ a linked sulfur-strontium isotope mass-balance model to identify the mechanisms driving the sulfur isotope evolution of the Cretaceous ocean. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, in conjunction with recent temporal constraints for LIPemplacement and evaporite deposition during the Early Cretaceous, demonstrate that coupled increases in hydrothermal and weathering inputs, followed by a period of massive evaporite deposition, best explain the negative S and Sr isotope shifts recorded in rocks drilled at Resolution Guyot. This indicates that marine sulfate concentrations likely increased through most of the Aptian interval (including OAE1a) before dropping to lower levels via late Aptian evaporite deposition. Furthermore, the simultaneous increases in volcanism and weathering required to reconcile the S and Sr isotope records highlight the importance of feedback mechanisms in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels (Berner et al., 1983; Kump et al., 2000). It has long been recognized that enhanced volcanism could increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations and elevate weathering rates. However, in isolation, the marine Sr isotope record cannot be used to infer simultaneous increases (or decreases) in both hydrothermal and riverine fluxes. We propose the use of coupled S and Sr isotope measurements as a new tool for interpreting isotope records and identifying the processes that affect marine sulfate levels, and therefore the C cycle and the evolution of Earths climate system, particularly during large-scale plate tectonic reorganization."
__label__SUPPORT	"Volcanic stratospheric sulfur injections and aerosol optical depth from 500 BCE to 1900 CE  Abstract: The injection of sulfur into the stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions is the cause of significant climate variability. Based on sulfate records from a suite of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, the eVolv2k database includes estimates of the magnitudes and approximate source latitudes of major volcanic stratospheric sulfur injection (VSSI) events from 500 BCE to 1900 CE, constituting an update of prior reconstructions and an extension of the record by 1000 years. The database incorporates improvements to the ice core records (in terms of synchronisation and dating) and refinements to the methods used to estimate VSSI from ice core records, and it includes first estimates of the random uncertainties in VSSI values. VSSI estimates for many of the largest eruptions, including Samalas (1257), Tambora (1815), and Laki (1783), are within 10 % of prior estimates. A number of strong events are included in eVolv2k which are largely underestimated or not included in earlier VSSI reconstructions, including events in 540, 574, 682, and 1108 CE. The long-term annual mean VSSI from major volcanic eruptions is estimated to be 0.5 Tg [S]yr1, 50 % greater than a prior reconstruction due to the identification of more events and an increase in the magnitude of many intermediate events. A long-term latitudinally and monthly resolved stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) time series is reconstructed from the eVolv2k VSSI estimates, and the resulting global mean SAOD is found to be similar (within 33 %) to a prior reconstruction for most of the largest eruptions. The long-term (500 BCE1900 CE) average global mean SAOD estimated from the eVolv2k VSSI estimates including a constant background injection of stratospheric sulfur is 0.014, 30 % greater than a prior reconstruction. These new long-term reconstructions of past VSSI and SAOD variability give context to recent volcanic forcing, suggesting that the 20th century was a period of somewhat weaker than average volcanic forcing, with current best estimates of 20th century mean VSSI and SAOD values being 25 and 14 % less, respectively, than the mean of the 500 BCE to 1900 CE period. The reconstructed VSSI and SAOD data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/WDCC/eVolv2k_v2. 5 Conclusions and discussion: This paper presents a new reconstruction of the climatic influence of major volcanic eruptions over the time span from 500 BCE to 1900 CE. The eVolv2k reconstructions of volcanic VSSI and SAOD presented here represent, first and foremost, the results of improved dating, resolution, and synchronisation of ice core sulfate records from Antarctica and Greenland (Sigl et al., 2014, 2015). Given the improvements in methodologies used to date and synchronise ice core records including automated synchronising and absolute dating through the matching of signatures of cosmogenic isotopes in ice cores and tree rings in the eighth century (Sigl et al., 2015) the eVolv2k reconstruction can be confidently assumed to be a more accurate estimate of volcanic forcing compared to prior reconstructions, particularly for time periods before 1250 CE. This assertion is supported by strong correlation between the newly compiled volcanic ice core records and instances of sudden large-scale cooling from dendrochronological climate reconstructions (Sigl et al., 2015).The eVolv2k reconstruction provides the input data for climate model simulations which aim to include external climate forcing agents as far back in time as 500 BCE. Volcanic stratospheric sulfur injection (VSSI) estimates can be directly ingested by suitable aerosol climate models. Alternatively, the EVA forcing generator (Toohey et al., 2016b) can be used to produce stratospheric aerosol optical properties,Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 9, 809831, 2017 www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/9/809/2017/including the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) based on the VSSI record. Aerosol optical properties can then be used as boundary conditions for model simulations. The eVolv2k reconstruction is the recommended volcanic forcing for transient simulations within the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP; Jungclaus et al., 2016) and therefore represents an update to the reconstructions most often used in prior palaeo-simulations, including the IVI2 (Gao et al., 2008) and ICI (Crowley and Unterman, 2013) forcing datasets.The eVolv2k VSSI estimates and the related SAOD perturbations produced via the EVA forcing generator show broad agreement with the IVI2 and ICI reconstructions over the 12501900 period in terms of the magnitudes of the largest volcanic events. For VSSI, agreement between eVolv2k and IVI2 is the product of compensatory differences, including generally smaller ice core flux estimates and a larger effective transfer function used to scale ice core sulfate fluxes into VSSI estimates. For the SAOD reconstructions, agreement between the EVA(eVolv2k) and ICI reconstructions reflects relative consistency in the ice core composites (after 1250) constructed in both efforts and a related methodology, wherein observations following the 1991 Pinatubo eruption are used to define the scaling from ice core sulfate to SAOD. Before 1250 CE, the eVolv2k VSSI and SAOD reconstructions include a number of events which are comparatively underestimated or completely missing in prior reconstructions. These updated estimates promise improvements in the attribution of forced and unforced climate variability before 1250 CE.In general, estimates of long-term mean VSSI and SAOD in eVolv2k are larger than prior reconstructions. For VSSI, this reflects an increase in the number of identified events and an increase in the estimated magnitude for a number of moderate to strong events. The relative increase in long-term mean SAOD compared to prior work is primarily due to the inclusion of a non-zero minimum (or background) SAOD, which is consistent with the minimum in stratospheric SAOD observed by satellite sensors around the year 2000 CE. The long-term estimates of VSSI and SAOD evolution give context to the best current estimates of 20th century volcanic forcing. An independent estimate of 20th century mean VSSI is about 25 % smaller than the long-term eVolv2k mean. Assuming stationarity of global eruption frequencies, it is therefore more likely than not that the 21st century mean volcanic forcing will be greater than that of the 20th century.For the first time, the eVolv2k reconstruction provides estimates of the uncertainty in volcanic VSSI estimates based on estimated uncertainty in the ice core sulfate composites and the error inherent in using ice sheet average fluxes as a proxy for the full hemispheric sulfate deposition (and therefore the hemispheric atmospheric sulfate loading). These error estimates depend on the number of ice cores used in the composite and the degree of variation seen between the ice cores. For most of the largest volcanic events, the estimated uncertaintyis around 2030 %, while for smaller events the estimated error reaches values of > 50 %. Systematic errors are also significant, representing the possibility that VSSI or SAOD estimates are biased in the long-term average. The construction of transfer functions from the NWT of the 1950s and 1960s and from the single data point of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption carries significant uncertainties regarding the injection magnitudes and injection heights. Observational estimates of the VSSI of Pinatubo have uncertainties of 20 % (Guo et al., 2004), and recent modelling studies have argued for a VSSI from Pinatubo half that of the usual estimates (e.g. Dhomse et al., 2014). An important uncertainty in the reconstruction of volcanic forcing stems from the inability to differentiate between ice core sulfate from vast, stratospheric sulfate clouds and that from relatively local effusive eruptions. Icelandic eruptions with large effusive emissions, like Laki or the 20142015 Holuhraun eruption (Schmidt et al., 2015), could theoretically lead to large sulfate fluxes to the Greenland ice sheets with little to no significant stratospheric injection. VSSI and SAOD estimates then based on the raw Greenland sulfate records would produce large overestimates of the global effects of the eruptions. This issue led Crowley and Unterman (2013) to mute the impact of Greenland sulfate fluxes for signals that could be attributed to Icelandic eruptions in the ICI reconstruction. On the other hand, the vertical distribution of the sulfur emissions by Laki are still under debate (Lanciki et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012), and while it seems likely that the Greenland sulfate signal for Laki does contain some component related to tropospheric emissions, the proportion of tropospheric to stratospheric injections is very unclear. For these reasons, we have not implemented a correction to the VSSI estimates of Laki or other known or suspected Icelandic eruptions. Uncertainties in the scaling procedures used within the EVA forcing generator certainly add another level of uncertainty to the SAOD estimates: for example, uncertainty in the measured SAOD after Pinatubo translates directly into systematic uncertainty in the SAOD estimated by EVA.Future work should be able to further refine the estimates of VSSI and SAOD presented here. First, a larger network of high-quality ice core sulfate records from Greenland should reduce random errors in the composite flux due to limited sampling. Reducing uncertainty in the transfer functions used to link atmospheric sulfate content and ice core sulfate fluxes would greatly improve estimates of volcanic forcing. Studies with atmospheric models show some promise (Gao et al., 2007; Toohey et al., 2013; Marshall et al., 2017), but inter-model differences in stratospheric sulfate evolution highlight substantial uncertainties in the physical processes controlling aerosol growth and transport (Zanchettin et al., 2016). Emerging techniques to differentiate sulfur from tropospheric vs. stratospheric origin (e.g. Lanciki et al., 2012) offer potential strategies for reducing uncertainties in future volcanic forcing reconstructions. Finally, the continued extension of ice core volcanic records to thewww.earth-syst-sci-data.net/9/809/2017/ Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 9, 809831, 2017present should soon provide important information, since anthropogenic sulfate flux over Greenland contaminated over much of the 20th century by anthropogenic sulfur emissions has now almost reached pre-industrial levels, allowing for the detection of moderate volcanic eruptions in Greenland.Earth Syst.

__label__UNRELATED	"Oceanographic and climatic evolution of the Miocene Mediterranean deduced from Nd, Sr, C, and O isotope compositions of marine fossils and sediments  Abstract: [1] Isotopic compositions of marine sediments and fossils have been investigated from northern basins of the Mediterranean to help constrain local oceanographic and climatic changes adjacent to the uplifting Alps. Stable C and O isotope compositions of benthic and planktonic foraminifera from the Umbria-Marche region (UMC) have an offset characteristic for their habitats and the changes in composition mimic global changes, suggesting that the regional conditions of climate and the carbon cycle were controlled by global changes. The radiogenic isotope composition of these fossil assemblages allows recognition of three distinct periods. In the first period, from 25 to 19 Ma, high eNd values and low Sr/Sr of sediments and fossils support intense tectonism and volcanism, related to the opening of the western Mediterranean. In the second period, from 19 to 13 Ma the Sr/Sr ratio of Mediterranean (UMC) deviate from the global ocean, which is compatible with rapid uplift of the hinterland and intense influx of Sr from Mesozoic carbonates of the western Apennines. This local control on the seawater was driven by a humid and warm climate and indicates restricted exchange of water with the global ocean. Generally, the eNd values of the fossils are very similar to those of Indian Ocean water, with brief periods of a decrease in the eNd values coinciding with volcanic events and maybe sea level variation at 15.2 Ma. In the third period, from 13 to 10 Ma the fossils have Sr/Sr similar to those of Miocene seawater while their eNd values change considerably with time. This indicates fluctuating influence of the Atlantic versus the Paratethys and/or locally evolved seawater in the Mediterranean driven by global sea level changes. Other investigated localities near the Alps and from the ODP 900 site are compatible with this oceanographic interpretation. However, in the late early Miocene, enhanced local control, reflecting erosion of old crustal silicate rocks near the Alps, results in higher Sr/Sr. 6. Conclusion: [75] The Sr, Nd, C, and O isotope compositions of marine fossils and the Sr and Nd isotope compositions of their embedding sediments have been analyzed from sections of the Miocene Mediterranean. Oxygen isotope compositions of benthic and planktonic foraminifera have preserved compositions compatible with their relative habitats and that also vary in concert with those used for evaluating global changes in climate. Carbon isotope compositions also preserved differences characteristic for having equilibrated with the carbon isotope compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon in bottom and surface waters for benthic and planktonic foraminifera, respectively. Furthermore, between 17 to 13 Ma a positive d13C excursion is noted, which correlates well with the globally recognized Monterey carbon isotope event. These results support that the fossils are well preserved and did not experience strong diagenetic overprints. [76] The radiogenic isotope compositions, measured on the same splits of samples as the stable isotope compositions, when interpreted in conjunction allow for the following paleoceanographic interpretations: [77] 1. During the period of 25 to 19 Ma the compositions are indicative of the opening of the western Mediterranean and intense volcanism related to major tectonic events. The seawater compositions are locally influenced and do not yet reflect complete open ocean conditions, even though the gateway to the Indian Ocean was already of importance. [78] 2. During the period between 19 and 13 Ma the influence of seawater from the Indian Ocean strengthened, also affecting the Atlantic Ocean at the Mediterranean outflow. However, the 87Sr/86Sr of the fossils do not yet reflect Miocene open ocean conditions for the northern Mediterranean basins (at least till 15 Ma), suggestive of strong tectonic activity in the Alps with a predominant Sr input from weathering of Mesozoic carbonates but also significant erosion of older crustal rocks near the Alps. A warm subtropical climate suggested by the oxygen isotopic compositions favored intense weathering. Brief excursions most notably in the Nd isotopic compositions may indicate sporadic volcanic events. [79] 3. Between 13 and 10 Ma the Sr isotope record supports open ocean conditions, while the Nd isotope record suggests a fluctuating influence of Atlantic versus Paratethys and/or locally evolved seawater in the Mediterranean, which was driven by global sea level changes and by local tectonic adjustments.PA4211 KOCSIS ET AL.: OCEANOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC EVOLUTION17 of 20PA4211[80] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Did geologic emissions of methane play any role in Quaternary climate change?  Abstract: The methane-led hypotheses assume that gas hydrates and marine seeps are the sole geologic factors controlling Quaternary atmospheric and climate changes. Nevertheless, a wider class of geologic sources of methane exist which could have played a role in past climate changes. Beyond offshore seepage, relevant geologic emissions of methane (GEM) are from onshore seepage, including mud volcanism, microseepage and geothermal flux; altogether GEM are the second most important natural source of atmospheric methane at present. The amount of methane entering the atmosphere from onshore GEM seems to prevail on that from offshore seepage. Onshore sources inject a predominantly isotopically heavy (C-enriched) methane into the atmosphere. They are controlled mainly by endogenic (geodynamic) processes, which induce large-scale gas flow variations over geologic and millennial time scales, and only partially by exogenic (surface) conditions, so that they are not affected by negative feedbacks. The eventual influence on atmospheric methane concentration does not necessarily require catastrophic or abrupt releases, as proposed for the clathrate gun hypothesis. Enhanced degassing from these sources could have contributed to the methane trends observed in the ice core records, and could explain the late Quaternary peaks of increased methane concentrations accompanied by the enrichment of isotopically heavy methane, as recently observed. This hypothesis shall be tested by means of robust multidisciplinary studies, mainly based on a series of atmospheric, biologic and geologic proxies. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 4. Summary and conclusions: The amount of methane emitted from contemporary onshore geologic sources is likely greater than that from offshore sources. Onshore emissions were even greater in the preanthropogenic time and in glacial low sea-level periods. Gas seepage, in general, is always controlled by endogenic factors,which induce large-scale gas flow variations over geologic and millennial time scales. These arguments are the base for hypothesizing that all GEM, not only marine seeps and gas hydrates, may have played a role in past climate changes. Even if it is not yet possible to state whether all GEM were responsible for the abrupt climate changes of the late Quaternary, first considerations suggest that the argument cannot be disregarded and that it merits greater attention. The foundation for future work rests on the following main points: GEM are today the second most important natural source of atmospheric methane. In pre-anthropogenic times, they were at least the second most important source in absolute terms. GEM, emitting mainly thermogenic methane, could explain the enrichment of isotopically heavy methane observed in late Quaternary methane concentrations peaks. GEM are mainly controlled by endogenic (geodynamic) processes and only partially by exogenic (surface) conditions; therefore they are not affected by negative feedbacks. The main geodynamic factors controlling GEM are the gasbearing properties of the geologic formations (permeability, pressure gradients), which, in turn, are influenced by seismotectonics (neotectonics) and gas-pressure build-up in deep reservoirs. Deglaciation periods were characterised by enhanced seismicity. The Quaternary was a period of enhanced mud volcanism, with several re-activation phases. Preliminary analyses of mud volcanism proxies in Azerbaijan indicate that maximum extension of mud volcanic activity occurred in the Upper Quaternary. The eventual influence on atmospheric methane concentration does not necessarily require catastrophic or abrupt releases (as proposed for the clathrate gun hypothesis); continuous enhanced degassing and/or secular phases of intense mud volcanic eruptions may lead to significant increases of methane concentration in the atmosphere.We have evaluated the potential of some main proxies for Quaternary GEM. Our list and discussion are preliminary, and possibly more proxies can be proposed. Data on the proxies examined here are still quite rare and fragmentary, as is experience in their application to hypothesis testing, so that a strong case can be made for the compilation of a global GEM dataset. In the broader context of neglected proxy archives, such newly organised data on GEM would represent an important contribution to the CHANGES programme (Carbon, Hydrology ANd Global Environmental Systems). Concentrating on proxy archive data in three Late Quaternary global environments (drylands, karst terrain and continental shelves), the records making up the CHANGES global database are relatively neglected in global overviews and global change modelling initiatives, and integration of records from a GEM database could materially enhance current work by CHANGES that aims to enhance global assessment and modelling by greater use of such proxies (see www.sheffield.ac.uk/changes).It is clear that the proxy evaluation, data acquisition and interpretation require a multidisciplinary effort. Researchers working on past and present global climate changes are urged to take into consideration the possible a priori role of GEM in the atmospheric cycle of the greenhouse gases. In providing a means of searching for the cause of the methane increases in the late Quaternary that goes beyond the wetland and clathrate gun hypotheses, the newly proposed GEM hypothesis must be subjected to detailed testing. If validated, it promises to provide answers to many unsolved interpretative problems concerning past climate changes, and to improve predictive models designed to project future changes."

HiRISE will provide detailed images (0.25 to 1.3 m/pixel) covering 1% of the Martian surface during the 2-year Primary Science Phase (PSP) beginning November 2006. Most images will include color data covering 20% of the potential field of view. A top priority is to acquire 1000 stereo pairs and apply precision geometric corrections to enable topographic measurements to better than 25 cm vertical precision. We expect to return more than 12 Tb of HiRISE data during the 2-year PSP, and use pixel binning, conversion from 14 to 8 bit values, and a lossless compression system to increase coverage. HiRISE images are acquired via 14 CCD detectors, each with 2 output channels, and with multiple choices for pixel binning and number of Time Delay and Integration lines. HiRISE will support Mars exploration by locating and characterizing past, present, and future landing sites, unsuccessful landing sites, and past and potentially future rover traverses. We will investigate cratering, volcanism, tectonism, hydrology, sedimentary processes, stratigraphy, aeolian processes, mass wasting, landscape evolution, seasonal processes, climate change, spectrophotometry, glacial and periglacial processes, polar geology, and regolith properties.

__label__UNRELATED	"Carbon sequestration in an expanded lake system during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event  Abstract: The Early Jurassic Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (183Ma) was marked by marine anoxiaeuxinia and globally significant organic-matter burial, accompanied by a major global carbon-cycle perturbation probably linked to KarooFerrar volcanism. Although the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event is well studied in the marine realm, accompanying climatic and environmental change on the continents is poorly understood. Here, utilizing radioisotopic, palynological and geochemical data from lacustrine black shales, we demonstrate that a large lake system developed contemporaneously with the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in the Sichuan Basin, China, probably due to enhanced hydrological cycling under elevated atmospheric pCO2 . We attribute increased lacustrine organic productivity to elevated fluvial nutrient supply, which resulted in the burial of 460Gt of organic carbon in the Sichuan Basin alone, creating an important negative feedback in the global exogenic carbon cycle. We suggest that enhanced nutrient delivery to marine and large lacustrine systems was a key component in the global carbon cycle recovery during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event and acted to shorten the duration of the recovery of global C values."
__label__SUPPORT	"Calcium and calcium isotope changes during carbon cycle perturbations at the endPermian  Abstract: Negative carbon and calcium isotope excursions, as well as climate shifts, took place during the most severe mass extinction event in Earths history, the end-Permian (252 Ma). Investigating the connection between carbon and calcium cycles during transient carbon cycle perturbation events, such as the end-Permian, may help resolve the intricacies between the coupled calcium-carbon cycles, as well as provide a tool for constraining the causes of mass extinction. Here we identify the deficiencies of a simplified calcium model employed in several previous studies, and we demonstrate the importance of a fully coupled carbon cycle model when investigating the dynamics of carbon and calcium cycling. Simulations with a modified version of the Long-term Ocean-atmosphere-Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir model, which includes a fully coupled carbon-calcium cycle, indicate that increased weathering rates and ocean acidification (potentially caused by Siberian Trap volcanism) are not capable of producing trends observed in the record, as previously claimed. Our model results suggest that combined effects of carbon input via Siberian Trap volcanism (12,000 Pg C), the cessation of biological carbon export, and variable calcium isotope fractionation (due to a change in the seawater carbonate ion concentration) represents a more plausible scenario. This scenario successfully reconciles 13C and 44Ca trends observed in the sediment record, as well as the proposed warming of >6C. 7. Conclusions: Several previous studies have employed a simple calcium-only model (following Payne et al. [2010]) with the attempt to resolve the dynamics and links between carbon and calcium cycles as well as the cause of the mass extinction during the end-Permian [Payne et al., 2010; Hinojosa et al., 2012] and more recently during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (Early Jurassic) [Brazier et al., 2015]. Here we have identified the deficiencies in such a simplified approach and showed the importance of a fully coupled calcium-carbon cycle model.The modeling framework presented here successfully reconciles the end-Permian trends in 13C and 44Ca recorded in carbonate sediments. The model also predicts a 50 kyr rise in atmospheric CO2 causing a global temperature increase of more than 6C. Our model results suggest that the end-Permian mass extinction and the perturbation in carbon-calcium cycling was due to a combination of several factors, including introduction of about 12,000 Pg of carbon through Siberian Trap volcanism, the collapse of ocean primary productivity, and a variable calcium isotope fractionation between seawater and buried carbonates during inorganic precipitation due to changing [CO23 ]. Most importantly, accelerated weathering rates alone that arise due to the perturbation in the carbon cycle are most likely insufficient to directly produce a significant impact on the calcium cycle, contrary to the claims of previous studies."
__label__SUPPORT	"Hydrothermal venting of greenhouse gases triggering Early Jurassic global warming  Abstract: The climate change in the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) was characterized by a major perturbation of the global carbon cycle. The event lasted for approximately 200,000 years and was manifested by a global warming of 6 C, anoxic conditions in the oceans, and extinction of marine species. The triggering mechanisms for the perturbation and environmental change are however strongly debated. Here, we present evidence for a rapid formation and transport of greenhouse gases from the deep sedimentary reservoirs in the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Magmatic sills were emplaced during the initial stages of formation of the Early Jurassic Karoo Large Igneous Province, and had a profound influence on the fate of light elements in the organic-rich sedimentary host rocks. Total organic carbon contents and vitrinite reflectivity data from contact aureoles around the sills show that organic carbon was lost from the country rocks during heating. We present data from a new type of geological structures, termed breccia pipes, rooted in the aureoles within the shale of the Western Karoo Basin. The breccia pipes are cylindrical structures up to 150 meters in diameter and are mainly comprised of brecciated and baked black shale. Thousands of breccia pipes were formed due to gas pressure build-up during metamorphism of the shales, resulting in venting of greenhouse gases to the Toarcian atmosphere. Mass balance calculations constrained by new aureole data show that up to 1800 Gt of CO2 was formed from organic material in the western Karoo Basin. About 15 times this amount of CO2 (27,400 Gt) may have formed in the entire basin during the intrusive event. UPb dating of zircons from a sill related to many of the pipes demonstrates that the magma was emplaced 182.50.4 million years ago. This supports a causal relationship between the intrusive volcanism, the gas venting, and the Toarcian global warming. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: The new geological, geochemical and geochronology data represent evidence for large scale carbon gas venting in the Early Jurassic. It is likely that the many thousands of breccia pipes formed within the 200,000 yr time span of the Toarcian global warming. Our data show that nearly 2000 Gt CO2 could have been produced from the Ecca Group in the western Karoo Basin. This is a conservative estimate considering the total area with sill intrusions in organic rich shale, which has a production potential of at least 27,400 Gt CO2. The venting from the Karoo Basin could consequently have acted as the main trigger for the Toarcian carbon cycle perturbation. The Toarcian greenhouse would have been further accelerated by the metamorphism of coal deposits in Antarctica, long term lava degassing from the KarooFerrar province, astronomical climate forcing [3], and by feedback mechanisms such as melting of gas hydrates [2,4].Our new data clearly tie the Toarcian carbon cycle perturbation to the Karoo LIP and the volcanic Karoo Basin. Our hypothesis highlights the importance of the emplacement environment of LIPs in causing global environmental climate changes. Ultimately, an understanding of the triggering mechanism and consequences of previous climatic changes driven by carbon gas emissions is highly relevant for predicting the consequences of current anthropogenic carbon emissions, as these events are likely of similar magnitude and duration."
__label__UNRELATED	"THE ORIGIN AND DISTRIBUTION OF SALTS ON ALLUVIAL FANS IN THE ATACAMA DESERT, NORTHERN CHILE  Abstract: The Atacama Desert has been predominantly hyperarid since the middle Miocene. Combined ionic and X-ray diffraction analysis shows that calcium sulphate is prevalent on three similar alluvial fans in salar basins across a transect of different environments in Antofagasta Province, northern Chile. Differences between the fans were largely due to the effect of local factors on salt input, secondary redistribution and deposit preservation. Thus carbonate was notable in the High Andes (fan C) and Pre-Cordillera (fan B), whereas in the Central Valley (fan A) greater quantities of the more soluble salts (chlorides and nitrates) probably reflect the higher level of aridity and an oceanic source (the camanchaca). Calcium sulphate distribution on the alluvial fans and on adjacent hilltops indicates an aeolian origin. Evidence from the Pre-Cordillera (fan B), however, suggests that salt input may have been episodic, related to changes in conditions within the general aridity and possibly to stone pavement and soil development. Calcium sulphate sources range from an input in Andean precipitation and the camanchaca to abundant regional evaporite deposits. It is probable, however, that products of Andean volcanism constitute the dominant primary source of calcium sulphate, and that the salt has subsequently been distributed widely within the endoreic basins of the region by a combination of groundwater, surface flow and the wind. 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Earth surf. processes landf., 22, 581600 (1997) No. of figures: 6 No. of tables: 6 No. of refs: 50 CONCLUSIONS: Calcium sulphate was prevalent, and its distribution on the three alluvial fans studied and on adjacent hilltops suggests an aeolian origin. It is clear that aridity has been conducive to the accumulation and preservation of calcium sulphate near the surface accross the Atacama Desert, including the High Andes. Evidence from the Pre-Cordillera (fan B), however, suggests that salt input may have been episodic, related to changes in conditions within the general aridity and possibly to stone pavement and soil development. Elsewhere, an aeolian origin has been favoured for gypsic soils on alluvial fans in Wyoming, U.S.A. (Reheis, 1987), gypcretesin Tunisia (Watson, 1985, 1988), and for the development of reg soils and stone pavements on a variety of surfaces (e.g. Amit and Gerson, 1986; McFadden et al., 1987; Wells et al., 1987; Harden et al., 1991).Differences between fans in the distribution of salts were largely due to the effect of local factors on salt input, secondary redistribution, and deposit preservation. Thus carbonate was notable in the High Andes (fan C) and Pre-Cordillera (fan B), whereas greater quantities of the more soluble salts (chlorides and nitrates) in the Central Valley (fan A) probably reflect the higher level of aridity and an oceanic source (the camanchaca). Nevertheless, the degree to which calcium sulphate was dominant on the alluvial fans across the transect, mostly in segregated concentrations, was not anticipated. Sources of calcium sulphate range from an input in Andean precipitation and the camanchaca to abundant regional evaporite deposits. It is probable, however, that products of Andean volcanism constitute the dominant primary source of calcium sulphate, and that the salt has subsequently been distributed widely within the endoreic basins of the region by a combination of groundwater, surface flow and the wind."
__label__SUPPORT	"A volcanic trigger for the Late Ordovician mass extinction? Mercury data from south China and Laurentia  Abstract: The Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME), one of the five largest Phanerozoic biodiversity depletions, occurred in two pulses associated with the expansion and contraction of ice sheets on Gondwana during the Hirnantian Age. It is widely recognized that environmental disruptions associated with changing glacial conditions contributed to the extinctions, but neither the kill mechanisms nor the causes of glacial expansion are well understood. Here we report anomalously high Hg concentrations in marine strata from south China and Laurentia deposited immediately before, during, and after the Hirnantian glacial maximum that we interpret to reflect the emplacement of a large igneous province (LIP). An initial Hg enrichment occurs in the late Katian Age, while a second enrichment occurs immediately below the Katian-Hirnantian boundary, which marks the first pulse of extinction. Further Hg enrichment occurs in strata deposited during glacioeustatic sea-level fall and the glacial maximum. We propose that these Hg enrichments are products of multiple phases of LIP volcanism. While elevated Hg concentrations have been linked to LIP emplacement coincident with other Phanerozoic mass extinctions, the climate response during the LOME may have been unique owing to different climatic boundary conditions, including preexisting ice sheets. Our observations support a volcanic trigger for the LOME and further point to LIP volcanism as a primary driver of environmental changes that caused mass extinctions. INTRODUCTION Paleoclimate records indicate global cooling during ~35 m.y. of the Early and Middle Ordovician, a relatively stable climate in the ~8-m.y.long Katian Age, and a glacial maximum in the Hirnantian Age (445.2 443.8 Ma) (Trotter et al., 2008; Finnegan et al., 2011; Melchin et al., 2013). Cooling likely resulted in the establishment of ice sheets on polar Gondwana in the Katian Age or even earlier (Saltzman and Young, 2005; Finnegan et al., 2011; Pohl et al., 2016). The subsequent rapid expansion of Hirnantian ice sheets resulted in glacioeustatic sea-level fall and decreased temperatures (Finnegan et al., 2011) associated with the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME) (Melchin et al., 2013). The second pulse of the LOME occurred as glaciers melted, oceans warmed, and anoxic seawater transgressed the shelves (Melchin et al., 2013). The cause of the glacial advance is unknown, but has been attributed to CO2 levels falling below a critical threshold (Herrmann et al., 2004). Lefebvre et al. (2010) used a coupled biogeochemical-energy balance model to demonstrate that chemical weathering of a hypothetical late Katian large igneous province (LIP) could have lowered CO2 over millions of years to cause major ice sheet growth. However, geological and geochemical evidence of such an eruption are currently lacking, and it is unclear if the apparent rapid time scale of the Hirnantian glacial advance is consistent with a weathering mechanism. Phanerozoic mass extinctions have been linked geochronologically and mechanistically to the emplacement of LIPs (Courtillot and Renne, 2003; Bond and Wignall, 2014). CO2 release associated with LIP emplacement can produce greenhouse warming, ocean acidification, and marine anoxia (Self et al., 2014), and SO2 release can induce short-term cooling through the production of stratospheric sulfur aerosols (Schmidt et al., 2015). Volcanism is the major preanthropogenic source of mercury to Earths surface environments (Selin, 2009), and the accumulation of Hg in sediment can be used as a proxy for ancient volcanic events (Sanei et al., 2012; Font et al., 2016; Thibodeau et al., 2016). The atmospheric residence time of Hg is long (~12 yr) (Selin, 2009) relative to atmospheric mixing time, and volcanogenic Hg can accumulate globally (Schuster et al., 2002). Because Hg binds to organic matter in marine settings, Hg concentration per unit of total organic carbon (TOC) is a useful measure of environmental Hg loading in modern (Fitzgerald et al., 2007) and ancient (Sanei et al., 2012) environments. Hg and Hg/TOC enrichments are observed in marine strata deposited during Phanerozoic mass extinctions associated with known LIPs, including the Siberian Traps at the Permian-Triassic boundary (Sanei et al., 2012), the Central Atlantic magmatic province at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (Thibodeau et al., 2016), and the Deccan Traps at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (Font et al., 2016). GEOLOGIC SETTING AND METHODS In order to develop records of Hg loading associated with the LOME, we analyzed samples from successions in south China and Laurentia spanning the interval of the LOME and Hirnantian glacial maximum (Fig. 1).

Gold Open Access: This paper is published under the terms of the CC-BY license. Laurentia South China CONCLUSION: We document three Hg enrichments associated with the LOME and suggest that they are markers of LIP volcanism. While specific mechanisms linking LIP volcanism to the LOME and Hirnantian glacial maximum are speculative until direct geological and geochronological evidence of a late KatianHirnantian LIP is found, the stratigraphic position of the oldest of the Hg anomalies is consistent with modeling predictions linking the chemical weathering of a Katian LIP to Late Ordovician cooling. If the Hg enrichments just preceding the Katian-Hirnantian boundary and through the Hirnantian glacial maximum represent further LIP activity, the synchronous volcanism and glacial expansion may be reconcilable through the albedo effects of volcanic sulfate aerosols. If confirmed, the LIP inferred from our Hg data would join those associated with mass extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic and strengthen the case for LIP volcanism as a primary driver of the environmental changes that caused mass extinction of life on Earth.Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/45/7/631/998935/631.pdf by University of Arizona user on 20 February 2019634 www.gsapubs.org | Volume 45 | Number 7 | GEOLOGY"

Three ensembles of climate simulations conducted with two global atmosphere ocean general circulation climate models (GCMs), considering different external forcings, were used for comparison: ECHO-G (Erik) and MPI-ESM (E1 and E2). Additionally, individual simulations were available from GCM included in the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, as well as single-forcing simulations performed with MPI-ESM. The comparison of the reconstructed and simulated temperatures revealed a close agreement of NCZTjaso with the simulations performed with total solar irradiance forcing with wider amplitude. Furthermore, the correlations with single-forcing simulations suggest volcanism as the main factor controlling preindustrial summer temperature variations in the Cazorla Range over the last five centuries.

__label__UNRELATED	"Integrating the Holocene tephrostratigraphy for East Asia using a high-resolution cryptotephra study from Lake Suigetsu (SG14 core), central Japan  Abstract: Tephra (volcanic ash) layers have the potential to synchronise disparate palaeoenvironmental archives on regional to hemispheric scales. Highly productive arc regions, like those in East Asia, offer a considerable number of widespread isochrons, but before records can be confidently correlated using these layers, a refined and integrated framework of these eruptive events is required. Here we present the first highresolution Holocene cryptotephra study in East Asia, using the Lake Suigetsu sedimentary archive in central Japan. The Holocene tephrostratigraphy has been extended from four to twenty ash layers using cryptotephra extraction techniques, which integrates the deposits from explosive eruptions from North Korea/China, South Korea and along the Japanese arc. This Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy is now the most comprehensive record of East Asian volcanism, and the linchpin site for correlating sequences across this region. Major element glass geochemical compositions are presented for the tephra layers in the sequence, which have been compared to proximal datasets to correlate them to their volcanic source and specific eruptions. This study has significantly extended the ash dispersal of many key Holocene marker layers, and has identified the first distal occurrence of isochrons from Ulleungdo and Changbaishan volcanoes. Utilising the high-precision Lake Suigetsu chronology, we are able to provide constrained eruption ages for the tephra layers, which can be transferred into other site-specific age models containing these markers. This new framework indicates that several isochrons stratigraphically bracket abrupt climate intervals in Japan, and could be used to precisely assess the regional and hemispheric synchronicity of these events. 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 8. Conclusions: This study provides the first detailed Holocene cryptotephra study for the East Asian/Pacific region, and highlights the ability to identify distal ash layers in a productive arc setting. Primary ash layers can be resolved even in lacustrine sediments that contain high concentrations of background glasses, if they contain distinctive shard morphologies and/or unique geochemical compositions. The Lake Suigetsu Holocene tephrostratigraphy provides themost comprehensive record to date of volcanism from East Asia, and is able to integrate twenty ash layers from a range of eruption magnitudes. As a result, these findings have now significantly extended the known ash dispersal of numerous key Holocene marker layers, including the Ma-b ash (Mashu), which is now identified over 1100 km from its source, and thus forms one of the most widely dispersed Japanese isochrons.The Lake Suigetsu chronology is able to provide constrained eruption ages for all twenty ash layers, which offer a new insight into the frequency of explosive events from many of the volcanoes, including more precise repose intervals. These isochrons can now be robustly used to date and synchronise sedimentary records across Japan. Several of these stratigraphically constrain the onset and occurrence of rapid climate anomalies that occurred during the Holocene, and could provide a better understanding of climate drivers in this region. More work is required to robustly constrain the dispersal boundaries of these isochrons, with additional proximal glass geochemical datasets essential to testing future regional and hemispheric scale tephra correlations."
__label__UNRELATED	"Norian vegetation history and related environmental changes: New data from the Chinle Formation, Petrified Forest National Park (Arizona, SW USA)  Abstract: Fossil plant assemblages including spores and pollen grains provide useful information on past ecosystems and the response of terrestrial biotas to various environmental perturbations. New quantitative palynological data from the Chinle Formation of the American Southwest suggest that a floral turnover occurred in the middle Norian (between 217 and 213 Ma). Analysis of plant communities reveals that this turnover was followed by a complete reorganization of the riparian vegetation, driven by changes in fluvial styles and the tectonic regime of the basin, as well as a gradual transition toward a more arid climate. Marked increases in Klausipollenites gouldii, Patina sporites spp., and Froelichsporites traversei are probable indicators of environmental stress, such as increased aridity, perturbations of atmospheric pCO2, acid rain, and atmospheric aerosol accumulation due to volcanism in connection with the Pangean rifting and uplift of the Cordilleran arc. Comparison of the vegetation turnover with younger assemblages from the Chinle Formation in New Mexico revealed similar floral turnover patterns, suggesting two distinct drier periods as a result of multiple climatic oscillations. The climate-induced floral turnover may have contributed to the vertebrate faunal turnover as the loss of wetland habitat space and an increase in xerophytic plants may have dwindled the supply of palatable vegetation for herbivores. The onset of the floral turnover in Arizona roughly corresponds to the Manicouagan impact event, but a direct causal link is still speculative. INTRODUCTION The Norian Chinle Formation (e.g., Irmis et al., 2011; Ramezani et al., 2011, 2014) provides a vegetation record of an ancient terrestrial ecosystem composed of riverine, lowland, and upland plant communities (e.g., Ash, 1972, 1999, 2005, 2014). The flora of the Chinle Formation provides an excellent opportunity to trace vegetation dynamics during the Norian Stage, which was marked by a series of environmental perturbations, including climate change (e.g., Kutzbach and Gallimore, 1989), carbon cycle perturbation (e.g., Prochnow et al., 2006; Cleveland et al., 2008a, 2008b; Schaller et al., 2015), a probable impact event (Hodych and Dunning, 1992; Ramezani et al., 2005), and changes in the tectonic regime in the western part of the North American continent (e.g., Dubiel, 1989; Dubiel and Hasiotis, 2011; Atchley et al., 2013; Howell and Blakey, 2013; Riggs et al., 2013; Trendell et al., 2013a, 2013b; Nordt et al., 2015; Riggs et al., 2016). Pollen and spore records provide a window into regional plant succession and are a useful tool for detecting vegetation dynamics in relation to global climatic oscillations or environmental stress. The palynological record can provide information on regional-scale vegetation changes, in contrast to the macrofossil rec ord, which can be biased to local vegetation elements often in wet habitats (Demko et al., 1998). The palynology of the Chinle Formation is known from the earlier works of, for example, Gottesfeld (1972), Scott (1982), Fisher and Dunay (1984), Litwin (1986), Litwin et al. (1991), and more recently Reichgelt et al. (2013), Whiteside et al. (2015), and Lindstrom et al. (2016). The Chinle Formation was originally thought to encompass the Carnian and Norian Stages based on biostratigraphy (Litwin et al., 1991; Heckert et al., 2007), but paleomagnetic correlations (Muttoni et al., 2004; Olsen et al., 2011) and recent radiometric dating indicate a middle to late Norian age (Riggs et al., 2003; Irmis et al., 2011; Ramezani et al., 2011, 2014). This new age assignment makes the Chinle floras of special interest, because continental Norian palynofloras are relatively uncommon (e.g., Kurschner and Herngreen, 2010). The Chinle Formation was deposited at tropical latitudes and subject to a monsoonal climate (Parrish and Peterson, 1988; Dubiel et al., 1991). Sedimentological and paleontological evidence indicates climate change with increasing aridity and seasonality throughout its depositional period (Dubiel and Hasiotis, 2011; Atchley et al., 2013; Nordt et al., 2015). This climate change is expected to have caused stress in the terrestrial ecosystems, including plants and animals (e.g., Whiteside et al., 2015). In triguingly, previous paleontological studies showed a significant faunal and floral turnover in the middle of the Chinle Formation between 217.7 and 213.1 Ma (e.g., Litwin et al., 1991; Parker and Martz, 2011; Reichgelt et al., 2013; Rame zani et al., 2014), which might be related to climate change. In addition to the climate, other environmental perturbations, for example, volcanism (Atchley et al., 2013; Nordt et al., 2015) and pCO2 variations (Cleveland et al., 2008a, 2008b; Atchley et al., 2013; Nordt et al., 2015; Schaller et al., 2015; Whiteside et al., 2015), could have contributed to the causes of the biotic turnover. Furthermore, the age of the Manicouagan impact event at 215214 Ma (Ramezani et al., 2005; Walkden et al., 2002; Jourdan et al., 2009) is close to the age range of the floral and faunal turnover in the Chinle strata (Reichgelt et al., 2013; Lindstrom et al., 2016). So far, no global extinction has been matched with the ejecta hori zon of the Manicouagan impact ( Olsen et al., 2011).

A doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2011.10.014 Corresponding author. Address: School of Life Sc Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89 E-mail address: brysonjr@unlv.nevada.edu (R.W. B Neogene vicariance during the Miocene and Pliocene and Quaternary climate change have synergistically driven diversification in Mexican highland taxa. We investigated the impacts of these processes on genetic diversification in the widely distributed bunchgrass lizards in the Sceloporus scalaris group. We searched for correlations between timing in diversification and timing of (1) a period of marked volcanism across the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in central Mexico 37.5 million years ago (Ma) and (2) a transition to larger glacialinterglacial cycles during the mid-Pleistocene. From our phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA we identified two major clades that contained 13 strongly supported lineages. One clade contained lineages from the two northern sierras of Mexico, and the other clade included lineages associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Central Mexican Plateau. Results provided support for Neogene divergences within the S. scalaris group in response to uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a pattern observed in several co-distributed taxa, and suggested that Quaternary climate change likely had little effect on diversification between lineages. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during specific time periods appears to have strongly impacted diversification in Mexican highland taxa. 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 5. Conclusion: The S. scalaris group has proven useful for studying the impacts of Neogene vicariance and Quaternary climate change on diversification in a wide-ranging highland organism. Our results have broad implications for understanding impacts of shared historical events on co-distributed species. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is a strong driver of lineage diversification. At least one episode of widespread volcanism in the Late Miocene and Pliocene heavily impacted highland taxa. Extreme climatic oscillations in the Pleistocene, a key driver of diversification between lineages in some taxa (Leon-Paniagua et al., 2007; Ruiz et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011b), did not substantially affect diversification rates in all Mexican highland species.The Mexican highlands are considered one of the worlds great biodiversity hotspots (Mittermeier et al., 2005), yet our understanding of the evolutionary drivers generating this diversity remains fragmentary (McCormack et al., 2008; Bryson et al., 2011c). Diversification in the S. scalaris group is a good example of how the complex dynamics between past geological and climatic events work together to shape biodiversity. The addition of future studies linking genetic diversity of Mexican highland taxa with their paleohistories will provide further insight into the historical processes responsible for diversification in this complex system."
__label__SUPPORT	"Volcanic and Solar Forcing of Climate Change during the Preindustrial Era  Abstract: The climate response to variability in volcanic aerosols and solar irradiance, the primary forcings during the preindustrial era, is examined in a stratosphere-resolving general circulation model. The best agreement with historical and proxy data is obtained using both forcings, each of which has a significant effect on global mean temperatures. However, their regional climate impacts in the Northern Hemisphere are quite different. While the short-term continental winter warming response to volcanism is well known, it is shown that due to opposing dynamical and radiative effects, the long-term (decadal mean) regional response is not significant compared to unforced variability for either the winter or the annual average. In contrast, the long-term regional response to solar forcing greatly exceeds unforced variability for both time averages, as the dynamical and radiative effects reinforce one another, and produces climate anomalies similar to those seen during the Little Ice Age. Thus, long-term regional changes during the preindustrial appear to have been dominated by solar forcing. 6. Conclusions: Volcanic forcing is important for both regional climate change on a year-to-year basis, and for long-term climate change on a global scale. It appears unlikely to induce sustained regional climate changes that exceed unforced variability, however. In contrast, solar forcing creates long-term regional climate changes that are greater than unforced variability, and which resemble those seen in proxy-based reconstructions of historical temperature change during the Maunder Minimum. The regional anomalies result primarily from a forced shift in the AO.During the last several decades, there has been an apparent upward trend in the AO (Thompson and Wallace 1998). Solar forcing, however, has increased little if at all over this period, by less than 0.05 W m22 since the 1960s (the exact value depends upon the particular years chosen for the trend calculations). Such a small increase in irradiance would cause an AO enhancement of about 0.1 mb, much smaller than the apparent trend of 3 mb, which is more likely to be attributable to increases in greenhouse gases, and to a lesser extent, Arctic ozone depletion (Shindell et al. 2001b).Downward shifts in the AO are closely correlated with cold temperature extremes in Europe (Higgins et al. 2002; Thompson and Wallace 2001), consistent with the historical impression that the LIA in Europe was punctuated by short periods of extreme cold exceeding that seen in the multidecadal averages of proxy data shown here (Pfister 1995). The global mean Little IceAge signal can therefore be attributed to both volcanic and solar forcing, but while volcanic forcing may have played a major role in global-scale cooling, the much larger regional changes and probable changes in the frequency of extreme cold events were likely driven primarily by solar variability.Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Volcanologic and petrologic evolution of Antuco-Sierra Velluda, Southern Andes, Chile  Abstract: Article history: Received 28 August 2017 Received in revised form 15 November 2017 Accepted 27 November 2017 Available online 5 December 2017 The Andean SouthernVolcanic Zone comprises N30 active arc front volcanoes that grewover periods of hundreds of thousands of years. Quantifying the rates at which these volcanoes grow is key to appreciating geological hazards, clarifying petrologic evolution, and exploring possible relationships between volcanism, ice loading, and climate. The integration of precise geochronology and geologic mapping, together with new lava compositions and volume estimates, reveal the evolution of the Antuco-Sierra Velluda volcanic complex at 37.2S. Thirty-one new Ar/Ar age determinations illuminate a punctuated eruptive history that spans at least 430 kyr. Sierra Velluda comprises ~130 km and began to grow prior to 426.8 ka. A lacuna in the volcanic record between 343.5 and 150.4 ka coincideswith glaciations associatedwithmarine isotope stages (MIS) 10 and 8, although shallow intrusionswere emplaced at 207.0 and 190.0 ka. Antuco began to grow rapidly on the northeastflank of Sierra Velluda, erupting N60 km of lava during three phases: (1) an early phase that began at 150.4 ka, (2) a post-MIS 2 phase between 16.3 and 6.2 ka, and (3) a post-sector collapse phase after 6.2 ka. Volcanism has been continuous during the last 100 kyr, with an average rate of cone growth during this period of ~0.46 km/kyr that has accelerated by about 50% during the past 6 kyr. Whereas Sierra Velluda erupted basaltic andesitic to andesitic (53.5 to 58.7 wt% SiO2) lavas, during the last expansion of glaciers between ~130 and 17 ka, Early Antuco erupted awider spectrum of lavas, ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite (52.0 to 64.5 wt% SiO2). Notably, eruptions following the last glacial termination at 17 ka produced basalts and basaltic andesites (50.953.7% SiO2), and following the 6.2 ka cone collapse they have been exclusively olivine basalt (50.953.0% SiO2) with N5 wt% MgO. Thermodynamic and trace element modeling suggests that lavas fromSierra Velluda and Early Antuco reflect extensive fractional crystallization of parental basaltic magmas with low water content (~1 wt%) at pressures between 0.9 and 1.5 kbar. In contrast, eruptions following rapid deglaciation tapped asthenospheric mantle-derived basalt that has been extensivelymodified by assimilation of partial melts of lower crustal rocks. 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: Sierra Velluda erupted lavas that range from basaltic andesite to andesite (53.5 to 58.7 wt% SiO2) between 430 ka and ~340 ka, with minor shallow intrusions occurring ~200 ka. Subsequently, Antuco began togrow at ~150 ka in three main phases: (1) an early pre-LGM phase, ~ 15017 ka; (2) a post-LGM phase between ~176.2 ka; and (3) a post-collapse phase after 6.2 ka. Antuco erupted a wide spectrum of lavas ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite (52.0 to 64.5 wt% SiO2), and is characterized by an abrupt shift to exclusively basaltic compositions (50.953.7% SiO2) following the LGM. Whereas Sierra Velluda grew at ~1.44 km3/kyr, Antuco initially began to grow at a modest rate of ~0.28 km3/kyr, which remained relatively constant until the sector collapse at 6.2 ka. Following cone collapse, its growth rate increased to ~0.65 km3/kyr.Major and trace element variations in Sierra Velluda and Early Antuco lavas reflect extensive crystal fractionation of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine, oxides, andminor amphibole. Petrologic modeling constrains the origin of these early-erupted andesites and dacites to depths of about 25 km in relatively water-poor magma reservoirs. Following rapid deglaciation at ~17 ka (Hulton et al., 2002; Hein et al., 2010; Watt et al., 2013), Antuco began to erupt basaltic magmas at a pace that has increased over time. Major and trace element abundances in Antuco basalt are difficult to explain by low pressure crystal fractionation processes. Instead, Antuco is interpreted to be the southernmost volcano on the SVZ arc front that erupts asthenosphere-derived basalts which have acquired their trace element compositions, including elevated La/Yb (49) and low K/Rb (300400) ratios, through extensive mixing with partial melts of lower crustal rocks (Hildreth and Moorbath, 1988). The evacuation-relaxation-recovery model of Rawson et al. (2016a, 2016b), developed to explain the impact of rapid deglaciation on the magma system beneath Mocho Choshuenco volcano to produce post-glacial silicic eruptions, does not apply to Antuco. This likely reflects either differences in the crustal plumbing systems beneath these volcanoes with shallower ponding of basalt beneath Antuco, or a higher production rate of basalt at Antuco, or both."
__label__SUPPORT	"A major sulphur isotope event at c. 510 Ma: a possible anoxiaextinctionvolcanism connection during the EarlyMiddle Cambrian transition?  Abstract: Seven mass extinctions have occurred since the Cambrian explosion of animal life roughly 540 Ma. These biotic crises are from youngest to oldest: the CretaceousTertiary, TriassicJurassic, PermianTriassic, Late Permian (end-Guadalupian), Late Devonian, end-Ordovician and EarlyMiddle Cambrian events (Erwin, 2001; Hallam, 2005). Although bolide impacts are popularly believed to cause mass extinctions, global climate change associated with volcanism and ocean anoxia is increasingly regarded to be the common thread linking most times of extreme biotic crisis (Courtillot, 1999; Hallam, 2005). At least five of seven Phanerozoic mass extinctions occurred at the same time (within the resolution of current age dating) as the eruptions of five unusually large igneous provinces (Fig. 1). Major climate perturbations linked to lesser extinctions are also temporally coincident with large eruptive events, e.g. the end-Palaeocene thermal maximum (Rea et al., 1990). In all these cases, global warming is considered to have triggered ocean anoxia due to the lower solubility of oxygen at higher temperatures although the exact extinction mechanism is uncertain. Because ocean anoxia favours bacterial sulphate reduction, it can possibly be recognized in the geological record by higher pyrite burial rates and a related increase in marine sulphate dS (Strauss, 1999), which fluctuates in response to changing pyrite burial rates (Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). The long residence time of sulphate in the oceans means that dS excursions generally express themselves over a 10 Myr time-frame (Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). However, relatively abrupt 10 10 Myr excursions related to ocean anoxic events can be superimposed on long-term trends. Extremely sharp positive shifts in dS have been reported to follow known mass extinction events of the end-Permian and Late Devonian (end-Frasnian) (Holser, 1977; Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). Additional sharp spikes in the seawater dS record occurred during the Cretaceous period and following the PalaeoceneEocene boundary (Paytan et al., 1999; Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). Although most studies have used evaporite or barite sulphate to reconstruct seawater dS, this study uses francolite because francolite precipitation occurs near the sedimentseawater interface in less-restricted marine environments than those associated with evaporite deposits (Shields et al., 2004). Francolite is also relatively more robust with respect to postdepositional alteration than most other sulphate-bearing marine authigenic minerals. Previous isotopic studies of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian phosphorites (Shields et al., 1999, 2004) demonstrate that francolite dS results are consistent with data from contemporaneous evaporite minerals, provided that the effects of post-depositional alteration and the diagenetic environment of formation (Benmore et al., 1983) can be constrained. The combination of sulphate concentration and isotopic data can in theory be used to backstrip the effects of bacterial sulphate reduction on francolite dS (cf. Piper and Kolodny, 1987), thus permitting us to determine seawater dS and sulphate concentration beyond the resolution possible using most other approaches. We analysed 32 samples from the Monastery Creek Phosphorite Member in the Georgina Basin, Australia that were deposited during the early part of the Templetonian subdivision of the Middle Cambrian (508 505 Ma) (Gradstein et al., 2004). This level lies stratigraphically above EarlyMiddle Cambrian boundary ABSTRACT"
__label__SUPPORT	"Assessing the impact of large volcanic eruptions of the last millennium (8501850 CE) on Australian rainfall regimes  Abstract: Explosive volcanism is an important natural climate forcing, impacting global surface temperatures and regional precipitation. Although previous studies have investigated aspects of the impact of tropical volcanism on various oceanatmosphere systems and regional climate regimes, volcanic eruptions remain a poorly understood climate forcing and climatic responses are not well constrained. In this study, volcanic eruptions are explored in particular reference to Australian precipitation, and both the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El NinoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). Using nine realisations of the last millennium (LM) (8501850 CE) with different time-evolving forcing combinations, from the NASA GISS ModelE2-R, the impact of the six largest tropical volcanic eruptions of this period are investigated. Overall, we find that volcanic aerosol forcing increased the likelihood of El Nino and positive IOD conditions for up to four years following an eruption, and resulted in positive precipitation anomalies over north-west (NW) and south-east (SE) Australia. Larger atmospheric sulfate loading during larger volcanic eruptions coincided with more persistent positive IOD and El Nino conditions, enhanced positive precipitation anomalies over NW Australia, and dampened precipitation anomalies over SE Australia. 4 Discussion and conclusions: Our results suggest that the large-scale IOD and ENSO systems, and Australian rainfall regimes, were all impacted by large tropical eruptions of the last millennium.The DMI response simulated in the GISS ensemble following large eruptions is complimentary to previous research conducted by Cheung and Abram (2016) and Maher et al. (2015). The pIOD peak in year 1 (Fig. 4) is consistent with both studies, in which statistically significant pIOD conditions occurred from 6 months to 2 years after an eruption. Cheung and Abram (2016) also found a statistically significant negative condition immediately after eruption at year 0, however this was absent from both Maher et al.s (2015) results and the CR forcing category in this study. The 2G category does show a nIOD condition at year 0, but this is not believed to be a response to volcanic forcing as a similar nIOD condition can be seen at year 1. The abrupt shift to a negative condition at year 5 was not found in either Cheung and Abram (2016) or Maher et al. (2015)s results. Both studies found a gradual decrease in DMI from year 1 to years 3 to 4.www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/ Clim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018The smooth transition to a lower DMI following eruptions found by Cheung and Abram (2016) and Maher et al. (2015) contrasts with the abrupt change from a pIOD of approximately 0.13 at year 4, to an nIOD of 0.069 in the CR ensembles and 0.083 in the 2G ensemble at year 5 (Fig. 4). This inconsistency between studies could be due to the selection of eruptions analysed by each paper. Cheung and Abram (2016) included all eruptions from 850 to 2005 CE recorded on the IVI2 (Gao et al., 2008) in their analysis. While this encompasses all eruptions analysed here, it also included many smaller eruptions that would likely have dampened the climatic response a response that has been analysed in previous papers (Zambri and Robock, 2016). Maher et al. (2015) looked at the five largest eruptions from 1880 to present, of which the largest was Pinatubo (1991), which measured at 30.10 Tg globally on the IVI2 (Gao et al., 2008). In comparison, our research deals with eruptions of much larger atmospheric loading, ranging from 56.59 to 257.91 Tg.Therefore, the persistence of a high pIOD through to year 4 seen here may result from the larger mean atmospheric sulfate loading imposed. This theory is supported by the comparison between the Samalas and Huaynaptina (Fig. 5) eruptions. Our results showed that while both eruptions caused asignificant pIOD at year 1, the larger 1258 Samalas eruption alone persisted with a significant pIOD condition in following years. Further support can be gathered from the comparison between the 2G and CR ensemble means in Fig. 4. Years 03 show more extreme values in the 2G ensemble mean, while years 46 show similar values for both forcing categories. Maher et al. (2015) found a similar response, with the two largest eruptions analysed in the paper showing the largest and longest enduring pIOD anomalies. This suggests that larger mean atmospheric sulfate loading can cause not only more persistent, but also more extreme pIOD conditions.The phase and intensity of the IOD is known to be influenced by the Asian monsoon (Brown et al., 2009; Xiang et al., 2011), which means that the physical mechanisms driving the pIOD response to volcanic forcing in GISS likely stem from this relationship. In GISS, the Asian monsoon was suppressed by the anomalous north-easterly flow off the south-east coast of China in years 0 and +1 (Figs. 13, 14) generated by volcanic aerosols, and a decrease of convection over the warm pool, cause by El Nino-like anomalies in those same years (Fig. 3). These feedbacks caused a comparatively warmer WIO, generating a pIOD. The AsianClim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018 www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/monsoon suppression following volcanic eruptions was also noted by Stevenson et al. (2016).The NINO3.4 response found in this research supports previous studies by Adams et al. (2003), Mann et al. (2005), Emile-Geay et al. (2008), McGregor et al. (2010) and Maher et al. (2015), despite GISS modelling weaker SST anomalies than observations (Fig. 1a, b). Figure 6 shows a very promi-nent and persistent El Nino response in all 6 years following eruption, however it lacks the weaker La Nina-like state that was observed 36 years after eruption in these previous papers. Spatial maps of SST (Fig. 3), while dominated by the overall volcanic cooling, show an El Nino-like pattern in the eastern Pacific that is most visible in year 4, possibly driven by the anomalous winds off the western coast of Southwww.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/ Clim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018America in year +3 (Fig. 13); however it is also distinctive in years 0, 1, and 3. We can therefore conclude that El Ninolike anomalies were generated in the multi-ensemble mean response in years 06 following eruption by a uniform reduction in surface temperature, driven by a decrease in the surface heat flux; a response which was also observed by Mann et al. (2005) and Emile-Geay et al. (2008). It can furthermore be concluded that the intensification of the El Nino in year +4 was due to anomalous wind flow in year +3. Comparison of the Samalas and Huaynaptina (Fig. 7) eruptions also suggest that, similar to the DMI, the intensity and endurance of the ENSO response to volcanic forcing increases with increasing mean atmospheric sulfate loading. This once again supports the findings of Maher et al. (2015) that identified a similar pattern.The positive response of Australian precipitation to volcanic forcing as seen here (Figs. 8, 9 and 11) is in agreement with several papers that identified a precipitation surplus over Australia following large volcanic eruptions (Schneider et al., 2009; Joseph and Zeng, 2011). Our results suggest thatthe direct effect of volcanic aerosols on precipitation overrode the impact of the IOD and ENSO on Australian precipitation in the years following large tropical volcanic eruptions. Northwestern Australia (Fig. 9) showed larger positive precipitation anomalies between years 0 and 2 than southeastern Australia (Fig. 11) in the CR ensemble mean, and in years 0 and 2 in the 2G ensemble mean. This could be due to the positive precipitation anomalies that can be generated by combined El Nino and pIOD events in the NW Australian region (Meyers et al., 2007; Pepler et al., 2014), which enhance the precipitation surplus caused by volcanic aerosols.The varying response of NW Australia to the Samalas and Huaynaptina eruptions (Fig. 10) also supports the enhancement of the volcanically induced precipitation surplus by combined El Nino and pIOD events. The Samalas eruption was followed by strong and enduring El Nino and pIOD conditions for up to 4 years post volcanism, and showed larger positive precipitation anomalies from years 0 to 3 than the Huaynaptina eruption, that was accompanied by smaller, shorter lived El Nino and pIOD conditions. The precipitationClim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018 www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/surplus related to the Samalas eruption in NW and SE Australia also peaked earlier than Huaynaptina, which could be a response to the larger atmospheric sulfate loading. Interestingly, previous papers have not reported a relationship between atmospheric sulfate loading and the peak in precipitation response (Robock and Lui, 1994; Iles et al., 2013, 2015).The precipitation anomalies of SE Australia (Fig. 12) further support this theory. The response to the Huaynaptina eruption, while peaking later than Samalas, endured longer, and with larger positive anomalies. The effect of strong, combined El Nino and pIOD conditions on SE Australia is significant precipitation deficits (Meyers et al., 2007; Pepler et al., 2014), which could explain the negative precipitation anomalies that occur in the Samalas response from year 2 onwards. This combined influence of a strong El Nino and pIOD dampened the positive precipitation response generated by the atmospheric sulfate loading. It should be noted that the surprisingly large positive precipitation anomaly at year 1 for SE Australia is an indicator of the uncertainty of the post-eruption values; however the significance of this event can still be seen by the comparison of the volcanic ensembles to the None ensemble.We note that our study has provided an analysis of climatic response to a set of forcings in a single climate model, which may limit the precise interpretation of responses to eruptions. Overall, volcanic aerosols remain an understudied climatic forcing such that the timing, magnitude, and spatialfootprint of past eruptions remains uncertain (Colose et al., 2016). In addition to uncertainties around the fundamental physical forcings, limitations still exist in the implementation of volcanic eruptions in climate models (Colose et al., 2016; Zambri et al., 2017). For example, Colose et al. (2016) suggest that improvements in model representations of volcanic particle size may improve the accuracy of model simulations. Furthermore, LeGrande et al. (2016) note that the chemistry and composition of a volcanic plume affects its climatic impact, which requires realistic representation in climatic models. Overall, these limitations in modelling eruptions and the idealised approach adopted here may mean that impacts simulated do not precisely match those of the proxy record.In summary, this paper aimed to identify the impact of large, tropical volcanism on the ENSO, IOD, and Australian rainfall. Averaging over multiple major eruptions and multiple simulations was undertaken to reduce the noise associated with the analysis of single volcanic eruptions, as seen by the 90th and 10th percentiles in Figs. 5, 7, 10, and 12. Results showed an El Nino and pIOD response in the immediate years following eruption, accompanied by positive precipitation anomalies over SE and NW Australia. The positive precipitation anomalies suggest that volcanic aerosol cooling dominates the precipitation response, rather than the effect of ENSO or IOD, despite aerosols also proving to be an important influence on these large-scale modes. Although this study focused on Australian rainfall regimes and its main cli-www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/ Clim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018matic drivers, this approach can be applied for exploring the impact of time evolving forcings, such as volcanism, in other regions.Data availability.

__label__UNRELATED	"The change of eruption styles of Martian volcanoes and estimates of the water content of the Martian mantle  Abstract: Estimated water contents in the Martian mantle range from 36 ppm to more than 1%. These values are based on the chemical analyses such as hydrous minerals in SNC meteorites and formation models of Mars. This study evaluates the water content of the Martian mantle using the change with time of volcanic eruption style on Mars as an observational constraint. Styles of volcanic activity depend on the volatile content of the magma and the atmospheric pressure. Because a low atmospheric pressure leads to a more explosive volcanic eruption, it has been believed that the volcanism on the current Martian environment would be very explosive. Our calculations, however, show that, under the current Martian atmospheric conditions, erupted magma cannot entrain the ambient air effectively, so the decrease in temperature of the magma during ascent is small. Consequently, the erupted magma may form a lava-like deposit when it falls back on the ground. This effusive-like style of eruption is a counterpart of clastogenic lava on Mars. On the other hand, numerical calculations under a thick CO atmosphere, which may correspond to an ancient Martian atmosphere, reveal a rather explosive eruption style. 2 Geological features of earlier stages of Martian history in the Noachian and Hesperian eras suggest that the volcanic eruptions on Mars were explosive then. Effusive eruptions, however, became dominant in more recent times. It has been widely accepted that Mars experienced a major climate change. In addition, the release factor of volatiles on Mars has been suggested to be as small as 0.0170.112. This may imply that the volatile content has been almost constant throughout Martian history. Consequently, we assume that this change in eruption style was caused by the change in atmospheric pressure. For a given water content of magma, a major climatic change may lead to a transition in eruption style. If we know the atmospheric pressure at the time of this transition, we can calculate the possible range of the volatile content of the mantle using our numerical simulations. If the atmospheric pressure on Mars around late Hesperian era is about 1 bar, the estimated values for a typical Martian magma are 0.050.25 wt.%, which is within the range of the water content of typical terrestrial basaltic magmas. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

__label__SUPPORT	"Perturbations in the carbon cycle during the Carnian Humid Episode: carbonate carbon isotope records from southwestern China and northern Oman  Abstract: The Carnian Humid Episode is an interval of prominent climatic changes in the Late Triassic. We studied the carbon isotope (C) geochemistry of carbonates from sections in southwestern China and northern Oman. C records from the Yongyue section (western Guizhou, South China) show a progressive positive shift from 1.4 to 2.8 in the early to middle Julian 1 substage. This positive trend is followed by a swift negative shift of c. 4.2 from 2.8 to1.4 in the Julian 2 substage. C from theWadiMayhah section (northern Oman) shows a positive shift from 2.2 to 2.8 in the Julian 1 substage, followed by a negative shift of c. 3.2 from 2.8 to 0.3 in the Julian 2 substage. The C records from the two study sections generally correlate well with each other as well as with published records, pointing to a considerable input of isotopically light carbon starting in the late Julian 1 substage. Such a large amount of light carbon probably derived from direct degassing and the sedimentsill contact metamorphism of the Panthalassan Wrangellia Large Igneous Province and contemporary Tethyan volcanism. The voluminous volcanogenic greenhouse gases probably contributed to the warming pulse in the middle Carnian. Thus the drywet climatic transition during the Carnian Humid Episode is best interpreted as a warm climate-driven intensification of the activities of the atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycle. Received 31 December 2017; revised 27 July 2018; accepted 9 August 2018 First introduced as the Carnian Pluvial Event by Simms & Ruffell (1989), the Carnian Humid Episode (CHE, following the latest term of Ruffell et al. 2015) represents an interval of major climatic changes in the Triassic Period, but remains the least understood. The CHE is characterized by a transient phase (<1 myr) of increased humidity in an otherwise long-lasting arid climate (Kozur & Bachmann 2010; Preto et al. 2010; Chatalov 2017; Lopez-Gomez et al. 2017). The sudden climatic shift caused significant environmental and ecological changes, which are documented in both sedimentary and fossil records. On land, a clear shift in floral assemblages from xerophytes to hygrophytes is seen in the late Julian substage (Roghi et al. 2010;Mueller et al. 2016a, b), possibly promoting the changeovers in terrestrial tetrapods (Benton 1986, 1994; Bernardi et al. 2018). Peat-forming environments were steadily established in both North America and western Europe (Olsen 1988; Pott et al. 2008), representing their first occurrences in equatorial latitudes after the c. 15 myr coal gap from the endPermian mass extinction (Retallack et al. 1996). In the oceans, the drywet climatic transition caused an increase in siliciclastic influx to the epicontinental seas (Stefani et al. 2010; Arche & LopezGomez 2014). Increased turbidity probably suppressed carbonate production, resulting in the demise of platforms and reef ecosystems in the western Tethys (Flugel & Senowbari-Daryan 2001; Hornung et al. 2007a; Preto et al. 2010). In the eastern Tethys (SW China), the CHE is manifested by the development of extensive oxygendepleted facies on top of the fossiliferous platform and slope to basin carbonates (Sun et al. 2016). The deposition of black shales in the region was closely associated with anoxia and the development of local foreland basins on top of the former platform (Enos et al. 2006). Notable victims of the CHE in marine realms include platform and reef dwellers, such as encrinid crinoids, forams and scallops, as well as casualties in nektonic groups such as conodonts and ammonoids (Simms et al. 1994; Hornung et al. 2007a; Rigo et al. 2007; BouDagher-Fadel 2008; Chen et al. 2016). Losses on land are not yet fully quantified. Perturbations in the carbon cycle often coincided with bio-crisis intervals in the geological past, mirroring significant environmental changes. The carbon isotope ratio (C) of marine carbonates traces the carbon isotope composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon pool in the ocean and thus records a subtle equilibrium of carbon input (e.g. riverine carbon input and volcanic degassing) and carbon burial (e.g. carbonate and organic carbon) (Sharp 2017). Primary producers (i.e. phytoplankton and plants) preferentially utilize C, synthesizing isotopically light organic matter. The organic matter rains down from the photic zone to the seafloor and might be either re-oxidized or buried with sediments (Hayes et al. 1999). Positive C excursions are generally interpreted as evidence for enhanced burial of organic carbon, either due to increases in primary productivity in the euphotic zone, oxygen deficiency in the water column, or both at the same time (Saltzman & Thomas 2012). Negative C excursions are caused by an increased input of isotopically light carbon from, for example, the remineralization of organic carbon, volcanism and contact metamorphism. As the CHE coincided with voluminous eruptions of theWrangellia flood basalt, the negative C excursion during the CHE has been linked to the release of volcanogenic carbon (Dal Corso et al. 2012;Mueller et al. 2016b; Miller et al. 2017). The carbonate production crisis and sudden siliciclastic fluxes during the CHE generated a carbonate gap in large areas in both western Tethys and the peri-Gondwana margins (Hornung et al. 2018 The Author(s).

Only a small number of Ccarb studies have been carried out through (or partially through) the CHE interval (Keim et al. 2006; Hornung et al. 2007b; Dal Corso et al. 2015; Sun et al. 2016). Low total organic carbon contents and potential admixtures of terrestrial organic carbon in the siliciclastic rocks in different basins hinder the interpretation of Corg on the global scale (Dal Corso et al. 2015; Mueller et al. 2016a). All sedimentary rocks are subject to diagenetic alteration. Thus sedimentary C records should be interpreted with prudence, especially in case of shallow water carbonates formed in situ on platforms. The original isotopic signatures can be substantially influenced by meteoritic diagenesis, a higher proportion of metastable aragonite relative to calcite and the local remineralization of organic matter (Patterson & Walter 1994; Immenhauser et al. 2003; Swart & Eberli 2005). Deeper water carbonates (e.g. slopes and ramps) are less prone to diagenetic overprinting and may preserve primary Ccarb values, especially if they stabilized in a closed diagenetic system (Swart 2008). We carried out Ccarb analyses on carbonates from a carbonate ramp setting in South China (the eastern Palaeotethys) and a periplatform deeper basin setting in Oman (the southern margin of the western Neotethys). The new data show a comparable negative shift in Ccarb at the beginning of the CHE, pointing to an at least Tethyan-wide, if not global, disturbance in the global carbon cycle. Conclusions: The carbon isotope composition of carbonates from the Yongyue section (China) in the eastern Palaeotethys and the Wadi Mayhah section (Oman) in the southern Neotethys have been measured. Although the study sections were situated in different palaeogeographical settings, both show generally consistent patterns of 13Ccarb. The comparable negative 13Ccarb excursion suggests that the instability of the carbon cycle during the CHEwas Tethyan-wideand most likely a global phenomenon. The input of isotopically light carbon can be related to volcanic degassing and thermogenic heating of organic-rich sediments as a consequence of the Wrangellia LIP and other contemporary volcanic activities. The drywet transition during the CHE thus coincided with a large input of carbon into the atmosphere and a shift in sedimentation from (cherty) carbonates to shales in study areas, and was most probably due to the intensification of the hydrological cycle triggered by volcanism-induced global warming.Acknowledgements This is a contribution to Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Science Foundation) Research Unit TERSANE (FOR 2332: Temperature-related stressors as a unifying principle in ancient extinctions; Project Jo 219/15).

__label__UNRELATED	"Cool Climate Lateritic and Bauxitic Weathering  Abstract: It is commonly held that laterites and bauxites form under tropical climates. Although some workers have suggested lateritic weathering was not representative of tropical climates, the assertion is still almost universally made. Early Tertiary (56-34 Ma) basalts are widespread in the Monaro Region of New South Wales. They overlie and enclose fluvial and lacustrine sediments, hyaloclastites, and tuffs, and the upper parts of many flows are bauxitized. The basalts are up to about 200 m thick and in one section comprise 22 flows, eight tuffs and hyaloclastites, two dolerites, and nine interflow bauxitic profiles. This region in the eastern Australian Highlands was tectonically stable and had probably been at its present elevation for some 50-100 Ma. Immediately before the beginning of volcanism and during the extrusion and bauxitization of the earlier flows, the region was at 57.5S latitude. Climates were wet, cool to cold, and thermally seasonal, and the region was well forested. Paleomagnetic studies show that the flows were weathered for more than 0.5 Ma at a minimum average rate of about 0.6 mm/103 yr. Erosion was minimal because of the stable tectonic environment. These bauxites therefore formed slowly under wet, cool to cold climatic conditions with sufficient time, and minimal erosion, allowing their formation and preservation by later basalt flows. The presence in the geological record of lateritic bauxites should not necessarily imply a tropical climate."

Although advantages of an arid site are many, hazard identification and scenario development have generally recognized fractures in the tuff as important features; climate change, water infiltration and percolation, and an oxidizing environment as important processes; and igneous activity, seismicity, human intrusion, and criticality as important disruptive events to consider at Yucca Mountain. Some of the scientific and technical challenges encountered included a change in the repository design from in-floor emplacement with small packages to in-drift emplacement with large packages without backfill. This change, in turn, increased the importance of igneous and seismic hazards. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
__label__UNRELATED	"Re-Os study of Fe-Ti-V oxide and Fe-Cu-Ni sulde deposits, Suwaki Anorthosite Massif, northeast Poland  Abstract: The Suwaki anorthosite massif, located in extreme northeast Poland beneath more than a kilometer of Phanerozoic cover, hosts major Fe-Ti-V deposits. These deposits, discovered in 1962, are contained in Fe and Ti oxide minerals that coexist with subordinate quantities of Fe, Cu, Ni, and Co suldes in massif-style anorthosites, norites, and gabbronorites. Accessibility and other considerations preclude development of this natural resource in the present economic climate. Detailed work by Polish geologists during the last 35 years provides a sound geologic framework for this Re-Os study of the age and origin of oxide and sulde deposits associated with a major, but lesser known anorthosite massif. Rhenium and osmium abundances and Os isotopic compositions were measured for nine suldes and four titanomagnetites from the Suwaki anorthosite massif. The titanomagnetites are over an order of magnitude lower in Re (0.41.5 ppb) and Os (0.036 0.144 ppb) concentrations than co-precipitated pyrrhotite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite that yield consistent concentrations for Re (3055 ppb) and Os (16 ppb). Parallel lines connecting co-existing titanomagnetite and suldes have slopes of 1 on Re versus common Os concentration plots, indicating that both Re and Os behave similarly during crystallization in their high preference for any sulde phase over magnetite. Samples from three deposits within the anorthosite massif were analyzed. An age of 1559 37 Ma (n 10) with an initial Os/Os of 1.16 0.06 for the Jezioro OkraIge and Krzemianka deposits is essentially identical to an age of 1556 94 Ma (n 3) for the UdrynA deposit. UdrynA , however, yielded a marginally lower initial 187Os/188Os of 0.87 0.20. The high initial Os/Os combined with the Proterozoic Re-Os age indicates that the source for Suwaki oxides-suldes is older crust, and hypothetically, could involve Archean rocks. An average crustal value of 50 for Re/Os yields a 2777 Ma age for Suwaki source rocks. Widespread Phanerozoic cover severely limits knowledge of basement rocks in Poland, however, and no Archean rocks are known in the immediate region. More likely, Re/Os ratios may be higher than average continental crust, re ecting mac crust in the source, and may move the source age for Suwaki anorthosite and mineral deposits toward younger values that easily include 2.0 Ga Proterozoic rocks. This more favorable case also accommodates Paleoproterozoic Nd model ages. Regardless of Archean or Proterozoic source age, the high initial Os/Os ratios derived from the Re-Os isochron indicate that the source for the oxide-sulde mineral deposits is more likely the crust and not the mantle. Given that these deposits are clearly magmatic, the Re-Os results add a new dimension to the long-standing ``origin of anorthosite'' problem, implying a crustal source for the anorthosite as well. The 1559 Ma Suwaki age is compatible with a well-exposed east-west band of 15301660 Ma rapakivi granite-anorthosite magmatism to the immediate north, transecting western Russia, southern Finland, Estonia and Latvia, and central Sweden. In particular, the age and isotopic character of Suwaki are not unlike those of the well-studied Salmi rapakivi granite-anorthosite batholith in western Russia (Karelia)."
__label__SUPPORT	"The ZiwayShala lake basin system, Main Ethiopian Rift: Influence of volcanism, tectonics, and climatic forcing on basin formation and sedimentation  Abstract: In the central sector of the Main Ethiopian Rift, the ZiwayShala lake basin system includes four present-day residual lakes, from north to south, lakes Ziway, Langano, Abijata, and Shala. This region of East Africa is under the influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone seasonal migration. Thus it has been designated as a potential core site by the ERICA Project (Environmental Research for Intertropical Climate in Africa). The four lakes have been subjected to strong changes in water level and water salinity at least during the Late Pleistocene. The purpose of this study is to produce a model of basin formation and sediment accumulation for this system of lakes, in order to separate the effects of climatic change from environmental variations induced by local or regional factors such as volcano-tectonic forcings. In addition to an exhaustive synthesis of available data, various investigations have been used to develop this model: 3D remote sensing, high-resolution seismics, coring, and structural, sedimentological, and hydrological field studies. New AMS radiocarbon dating helped to refine the pre-existing stratigraphic framework for this region, and basin age estimations were calculated using mean sediment accumulation rates.

The early-middle PleistoceneLate Pleistocene period (1010 yr) was marked by a regional volcano-tectonic paroxysm, resulting in major changes in the morphology of the area, with the formation of the Abijata, Ziway and Shala lake basins. From 340.20 Ma, the ZiwayShala basin history is marked by the eastward migration of volcano-tectonic activity, resulting in the development of the youngest basin of the ZiwayShala system, the Langano Basin. The joint history of sedimentation in the Ziway, Langano, Abijata, and Shala lake basins started during the early-Late Pleistocene period (101104 yr) and is characterized from this period up to the present-day by a series of climatically controlled rises and falls of lake level. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: This study of the ZiwayShala lake basin system of the MER provides an evolutionary model that can be applied to other intracontinental rift systems where initial rift floor segmentation is dominated by major explosive volcanism, in contrast with tectonics-dominated rift basins.At the macro-architectural scale (106 yr), the Late PlioceneEarly Pleistocene morphology of the ZiwayShala region directly relates to catastrophic explosive volcanic eruptions correlated with major caldera collapse (Munesa and Gademotta calderas). The history of the lake basin system started as a result of a combination of large (30 km diameter?) pre-existing caldera depressions.At the meso-architectural scale (104106 yr), fault deformation and migration linked to the tectonic structuration of the WFB results in controlling the architectural pattern of the basin and drainage system. Successive depressions caused by the subsidence of crustal blocks combined with reliefs formed by magma effusion during a new paroxysmic explosive volcanic phase, the whole being associated with graben-like downfaulting related to the development of the Wonji Fault Belt, resulted in less than 105 yr in a new complex rift floor morphology: to the174 C.

Lateral migration of volcano-tectonic activity resulted later in the diachronous formation of two opposite half-grabens, the Abijata Main Basin to the west, and the Langano Basin to the east, separated by the Katlo Horst.Finally, at a micro-architectural scale (101104 yr), the climate signal appeared to be more pronounced as tectonic effects have waned. Climatic fluctuations at regional or global scale, linked to the monsoon effects, and possibly influenced at a millennial scale by the regional explosive volcanism, caused river regime change and major baselevel changes controlling drainage basin area and shape, resulting in quick-alternating high- and lowlake morphologies. Minor tectonic movements appeared to be concentrated in the youngest Langano Basin, possibly correlated with volcanic activity of Alutu, thus defining the present-day Ethiopian Rift active axis."
__label__UNRELATED	"New evidence for a volcanically, tectonically, and climatically active Mars  Abstract: Geological analysis of Mars imagery supports the hypothesis that the planet has been the site of recent (< 10 Ma) volcanic and tectonic processes and glacier flow, and makes most likely previous suggestions of continuing endogenic and exogenic activity. Tectonic structures which deform very slightly cratered (at MOC scales) surfaces of Tharsis Montes and surrounding regions seem to attest to active tectonism (both extensional and transcurrent) on Mars. Exogenic processes in this region, such as a glacial origin for the aureole deposits on the northwestern flanks of the Tharsis Montes shield volcanoes, are supported by new data. The very recent age of these structures could be the first direct confirmation that drastic changes in obliquity are modulating the martian climate, such that an increase in obliquity would result in equatorial glaciers taking the place of the receding polar ice caps. If this and other concurring research is extended and confirmed, the alive Mars which would emerge would constitute a most appealing place for exobiology and comparative planetology. 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: 1. The best explanation for recent glacier flow at high altitudes and low latitudes on Mars is an abrupt change in the martian obliquity, as first advanced by Laskar (1989).2. The evidence for recent volcanism and tectonics point to a planet with remaining internal energy.3. The proposed ages for endogenic and exogenic activity would necessarily place Mars among the active planetary bodies, a quite interesting place for the immediate and ensuing exploration missions."
__label__UNRELATED	"Minimum estimates of the amount and timing of gases released into the martian atmosphere from volcanic eruptions  Abstract: Volcanism has been a major process during most of the geologic history of Mars. Based on data collected from terrestrial basaltic eruptions, we assume that the volatile content of martian lavas was typically 0.5 wt.% water, 0.7 wt.% carbon dioxide, 0.14 wt.% sulfur dioxide, and contained several other important volatile constituents. From the geologic record of volcanism on Mars we find that during the late Noachian and through the Amazonian volcanic degassing contributed 0.8 bar to the martian atmosphere. Because most of the outgassing consisted of greenhouse gases (i.e., CO2 and SO2) warmer surface temperatures resulting from volcanic eruptions may have been possible. Our estimates suggest that 1.1 10 g ( 8 1 m m ) of juvenile water were released by volcanism; slightly more than half the amount contained in the north polar cap and atmosphere. Estimates for released CO2 (1.6 10 g) suggests that a large reservoir of carbon dioxide is adsorbed in the martian regolith or alternatively 300 cm cm 2 of carbonates may have formed, although these materials would not occur readily in the presence of excess SO2. Up to 120 cm cm 2 (2.2 10 g) of acid rain (H2SO4) may have precipitated onto the martian surface as the result of SO2 degassing. The hydrogen flux resulting from volcanic outgassing may help explain the martian atmospheric D/H ratio. The amount of outgassed nitrogen ( 1.3 mbar) may also be capable of explaining the martian atmospheric N/N ratio. Minor gas constituents (HF, HCl, and H2S) could have formed hydroxyl salts on the surface resulting in the physical weathering of geologic materials. The amount of hydrogen fluoride emitted (1.82 10 g) could be capable of dissolving a global layer of quartz sand 5 mm thick, possibly explaining why this mineral has not been positively identified in spectral observations. The estimates of volcanic outgassing presented here will be useful in understanding how the martian atmosphere evolved over time. Published by Elsevier Inc. 4. Conclusions: (1) During its early history (Noachian through the Hesperian) release of volcanic gases may have increased the atmospheric pressure up to 0.3 bar for several martian years. It may be possible that the greenhouse effect of these gases, primarily SO2 and CO2, were enough to raise the surface temperature above freezing and permit liquid water or carbon dioxide to exist on the surface. (2) Acid rain (H2SO4) was probably produced as the result of SO2 degassing. As much as 120 cm of this liquid may have precipitated onto the martian surface with time, contributing to the high sulfur content of the martian soil and perhaps creating runoff channels on the flanks of young volcanoes. Collectively with released water and CO2, acid rain may have aided in the degradation of the martian highlands and formation of the valley networks. (3) Revised estimates of juvenile water suggest that a global layer equivalent to 8 mm 2 was produced by volcanic degassing. Assuming that volcanism was the only source of water on Mars, 6.7 m would have been lost to space to explain the high martian D/H ratio. Estimates for released CO2 suggest that most of it most be adsorbed in the martian regolith. Depending on the mineralogy, estimates for the amount of adsorbed CO2 suggest that the martian regolith is a minimum of 50400 m thick. Alternatively, 130 cm cm 2 of carbonates may be present. (4) Providing that the temperature increases accompanying early volcanic gas emissions were high enough to decouple the nonthermal escape of oxygen to the Jeans escape of hydrogen, the hydrogen flux from degassing may be able to explain the high martian atmospheric D/H ratio. (5) The amount of nitrogen outgassed appears to be able to explain the current atmospheric 15N/14N ratio, implying that chemical fixation of nitrogen to the martian soil did not occur. (6) Minor gas constituents (HF, HCl and H2S) could have formed hydroxyl salts on surface materials. Under current martian conditions these salts would continually recrystallize, perhaps resulting in physical weathering of geologic material (Malin, 1974). The amount of hydrogen fluoride emitted would be capable of dissolving a layer of quartz sand 5 mm thick distributed globally, perhaps explaining the absence of this material in spectral studies."

Conclusions: 40Ar/39Ar and fission-track data have been used to quantify the thermal and exhumation history of the Eastern Rhodopes, which has permitted the genetic relationships between mineralization and extensional processes to be constrained. These results were integrated in timetemperature paths, which permit an assessment of the timing, magnitude and duration of different thermal events in relation to the ongoing extensional tectonic evolution. As a result, a quantitative framework for the Tertiary thermal and exhumation history of theEasternRhodopeshasbeenestablished,whichprovides constraints on the role of different processes in the formation, preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits in the Eastern Rhodopes. Heat accumulation during burial of the upper plate rocks is considered to be a plausible heat source for ore formation. The development of large halfgraben basins above the detachment faults, accompanied by a favourable climate, might have provided the primary meteoric water supply for the hydrothermal convective systems. Our new 40Ar/39Ar ages support the presence of amagmatic heat, sulphur and/or themetal reservoir contemporaneous with gold deposition. The preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits is largely controlled by the exhumation history of the upper plate, which can be quantitatively constrained by low-temperature thermochronological methods.TheEoceneMiocene tectonic evolutionof this area is characterizedby several distinct structural episodes. Based on 40Ar/39Ar and FT thermochronology, the lower plate experienced continuous cooling and exhumation since the Late Eocene. 40Ar/39Ar data acquired from metamorphic rocks of the lower plate show that the footwall cooled through 350 C between 36.900.16 Ma and 37.280.19 Ma, via exhumation during detachment faulting. Sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization, which occurred at 250220 C, developed during the early stage of basin formation (34.710.16 Ma to 35.360.21 Ma). The earliest known calcalkaline type magmatism at Iran Tepe (33.97 0.36 Ma to 34.620.46Ma), and the end of the hydrothermal mineralization from Ada Tepe were contemporaneous. The AFT data show that the lower plate rocks cooled to 120 C at 18.31.9 Ma. The ZFT and AFT thermal history models for the upper plate show that it was being buried duringmost of the Oligocene. A dramatic change occurred at 3330Ma, with the onset of horstgraben tectonism, resulting in rapid exhumation of the upper plate, together with the incorporated gold deposits."

Conclusions: The T-OAE CIE and the high-frequency fluctuations within it have now been documented from multiple oceanic basins spanning the globe. This is consistent with the suggestion that they reflect global perturbations to the carbon cycle triggered by volcanism associated with the emplacement of the KarooFerrar LIP and subsequent biogeochemical feedbacks (e.g., methane clathrate releases or terrestrial methanogenesis). This finding also further confirms the utility of the overall T-OAE CIE as a global chemostratigraphic marker. Additionally, we suggest that increased terrestrial methanogenesis, which would have been an important positive feedback to the initial warming and increased precipitation caused by the emplacement of the KarooFerrar LIP, played an important role in the Toarcian carbon cycle. Importantly, any additional flux of carbon from terrestrial environments to the oceanatmosphere system would decrease the carbon flux needed from other potential sources to generate the broader T-OAE CIE and small-scale CIEs within it. Future studies will further elucidate the role of the terrestrial carbon cycle in the Toarcian climatic change.A better understanding of the T-OAE record may serve to inform models of other events triggered by rapid injections of greenhouse gases, such as the PETM. While these two events were separated by roughly 130 million years and had significantly different Earth system boundary conditions, the resulting environmental change and ecological deterioration were broadly similar. As our planet experiences another significant perturbation to the global carbon cycle and climatic warming, the record of environmental change recorded during these geologic events represents an invaluable archive for models of future long-term climate and oceanographic change."
__label__SUPPORT	"Early Eocene climatic, volcanic, and biotic events in the northwestern Tethyan Untersberg section, Austria  Abstract: The 40 m thick Untersberg section (Salzburg, Austria) of the Northern Calcareous Alps comprises the Palaeocene Eocene transition and spans the upper part of calcareous nannoplankton zone NP9 and the lower part of zone NP10 (subzone NP10a). These zones are equivalent to planktonic foraminifera zone P5 and the lower part of zone P6 (sub-zone P6a). The succession was deposited in a lower bathyal slope environment at a palaeodepth of about 2000 m. Within the dominantly marlstone succession, a 5.5-m-thick intercalation of red and green claystone and marly claystone represents the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) which is used to recognize the PalaeoceneEocene boundary. The CIE was associated with a shallowing of the calcite compensation depth by at least 1 km. Throughout the section, clay mineral assemblages are dominated by smectite, indicating a seasonal climate with alternating wet and dry conditions. A 49% increase in detrital quartz and feldspar within the CIE-interval suggests enhanced continental run-off. This was probably the result of the establishment of a monsoonal setting, in which vegetation was sparse, while periodic high rainfall caused pronounced sediment transport. The increased terrestrially derived input is associated with abundant radiolarian casts indicating high primary productivity. This suggests that seasonal nutrient pulses resulting from intensified precipitation during the wet season have caused high surface-water fertility. The benthic foraminifera faunas of the samples rich in siliceous plankton are strongly dominated by Glomospira spp., Nuttalides truempyii, Abyssamina poagi, Anomalinoides praeacutus, Anomalinoides nobilis, and Oridorsalis spp. We assume that the GlomospiraNuttalides fauna consists of opportunistic species which quickly react to seasonally varying amounts of food. The calcareous nannoplankton assemblage of the CIE-interval is characterized by the first occurrences of the genus Rhomboaster and of Discoaster araneus and Discoaster mahmoudii, whereas Scapholithus apertus become extinct at the PalaeoceneEocene boundary. Within nannoplankton sub-zone NP10a, a series of primarily basaltic ashes give evidence for a major episode of explosive volcanism which can be correlated with the positive ash-series of the Fur-Formation in northern Denmark. The wide 5. Conclusion: In the northwestern Tethys, abundant siliceous plankton indicate high nutrient levels in oceanic surface waters in the basal Eocene. A coeval increase in both sedimentation rates and the amounts of terrestrially derived quartz and feldspar suggests that this high primary productivity was the result of enhanced continental run-off. It is assumed that the establishment of a pronounced monsoonal climate caused this increase in continental erosion.Frequent ash-layers indicate that intense explosive volcanism was another important environmental factor in the early Eocene. The biostratigraphical and geochemical correspondence of these tephras with ashes from the North Sea Basin suggests that these pyroclastic deposits are related to the continental breakup of Europe and Greenland. The distance the tephras in the northwestern Tethyan sections were dispersed from their proposed magmatic source in the North Atlantic igneous province (ca. 4000 km) indicates that the eruptions were extremely powerful and emitted large volumes of ash and gases into the lower stratosphere. It can be assumed that these eruptions greatly affected the radiation of the sun and, therefore, caused a decrease of surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. As basaltic eruptions require watermagma interaction, the onset of eruptive activity was probably an effect of the emergence of part of the North Atlantic igneous province above sea level. The tephra layers are restricted to sub-zone NP10a and vanish at the top of this sub-zone. The transgression of the London clay and the Ieper clay in the North Sea basin was an effect of a pronounced sea-level rise at the base of sub-zone NP10b (Aubry, 1996; Knox, 1998). The termination of basaltic eruptions at that stratigraphic level suggests that the rising sea level caused the drowning of the volcanic source area.H.

__label__SUPPORT	"Evidence for a volcanic cooling signal in a 335year coral record from New Caledonia  Abstract: Although volcanic cooling events have been detected in tree ring records, their occurrence in marine records has received much less attention. Herein we report results from a 335-year oxygen isotope record (1657-1992) from a New Caledonia coral indicating that as many as 16 interannual-scale cooling events occur within 1 year of a volcanic eruption as determined by ice core records. There are also pentadal/decadal-scale cooling events beginning in 1675, 1813, and 1903 that immediately postdate volcanic eruptions. However, the interannual correspondences are complicated by the fact that some of the cooling events also coincide with E1 Nifios, which cause cooling in this part of the western South Pacific. If our conclusions are substantiated by further work, occurrence of distinct volcanic cooling signals may enable refinement of coral chronologies by use of the event stratigraphic approach, with the most promising correlation horizons being associated with the following eruptions: 1808 (Unknown), 1813-1821 (several eruptions), 1835 (Coseguina), 1883 (Krakatau), and possibly 1963 (Agung)."
__label__SUPPORT	"Earth dynamics and climate changes La dynamique terrestre et les modifications climatiques  Abstract: The evolution of the Earths climate over geological time is now relatively well known. Conversely, the causes and feedback mechanisms involved in these climatic changes are still not well determined. At geological timescales, two factors play a prevailing role: plate tectonics and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Their climatic effects will be examined using palaeoclimatic indicators as well as results of climate models. I focus primarily on the influence of continental drift on warm and cold climatic episodes. The consequences of peculiar land sea distributions (amalgamation/dispersal of continental blocks) are discussed. Plate tectonics also drive sea level changes as well as mountain uplift. Marine transgressions during the MidCretaceous favoured warmth within the interiors of continents, although their effect could be very different according to the season. Mountain uplift is also an important factor, which is able to alter climate at large spatial scales. Experiments relative to climatic sensitivity to the elevation of the Appalachians during the Late Permian are discussed. To affect the whole Earth, the chemical composition of the atmosphere appears to be a more efficient forcing factor. The carbon dioxide driven by the longterm carbon cycle has influenced the global climate. Geochemical modelling simulates more or less accurately the long-term evolution of pCO2, which corresponds roughly to the icehouse/greenhouse climatic oscillations. However, the uncertainties on pCO2 are still important because different parameters involved in the long-term carbon cycle (degassing rate, chemical weathering of silicates, burial of organic matter) are not well constrained throughout the past. The chemical composition of the atmosphere is also altered by the emissions of modern volcanic eruptions leading to weak global cooling. The influence of large flood basalt provinces on climate is not yet known well enough; this volcanism may have released huge amounts of SO2 as well as CO2. At last, the chemical composition of the atmosphere may have been altered by the release of methane in response to the dissociation of gas hydrates. This scenario has been proposed to explain the abrupt warming during the Late Palaeocene. 2003 Academie des sciences/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved. 8. Conclusion: Understanding the Earths climate history over geologic time-scales remains a challenge, despite the huge amount of data accumulated over a century and the use of numerical models since two decades. The first-order climate history over the Phanerozoic, which shows a succession of warmer and colder global periods, is now relatively well known. However, we are still unable to reproduce the long-term trend. Different forcing factors, most of them resulting from internal Earths processes, have been proposed to account for climate evolution over geologic timescales. Two of them are of primary importance, plate tectonics and greenhouse gases, both being themselves possibly in part causally related.The past position of continents is accurately known for the past 200 Ma, but progress is still required for older periods. Climate modelling has shown that this factor cannot account alone for global long-term climate changes. Indeed, the location of continents cannot explain the extreme warmth in the Mid-Cretaceous or the short duration of the Ordovician ice age. The impact of plate configurations on climate may have evolved in the past. Numerical experiments reveal that the Late Permian climate was largely driven by a peculiar palaeogeographic configuration (Pangea supercontinent). All continents are assembled as a single entity, deeply reducing the effect of oceanic circulation on the climatic system. Most recently, a combination of break-up of the equatorial supercontinent of Rodinia, emission of a huge flood basalt and enhanced weathering has been suggested as a possible cause for the 700-Ma Proterozoic Snowball Earth (Godderis et al., in review). Conversely, the rise of sea level driven by plate tectonics affects the landsea dis-tribution and both alter atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Climate modelling reveals that marine transgression causes a warming within the interiors of continents. The Mid-Cretaceous warmth within the interiors of continents could be explained by such a mechanism. The coupled effect of plate tectonics and sealevel variations has led to the opening and closure of marine gateways. The effects of marine gateways on climate vary drastically with respect to their location, width and depth. In the case of closure of the Isthmus of Panama, as well as of the closure of Indonesian seaway, changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation may likely have contributed to large-scale climate changes. Finally, the elevation of mountain ranges such as the Appalachians during the Late Palaeozoic or the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau during the Late Cainozoic appears to be an important forcing factor, which alters atmospheric circulation and therefore climate at the continental scale.To influence the climate on a global scale, changes in atmospheric chemical composition, and especially CO2 fluctuations appear to be a more efficient mechanism. Fluctuations of pCO2 deduced from geochemical models simulate roughly long-term climate evolution. An elevated pCO2 is required to partly explain the warmth of the Mid-Cretaceous. The evolutions of sources and sinks of carbon as well as fluxes between carbon reservoirs have to be better constrained over long-term timescales. The impact of silicate weathering on climate has been suggested as a potential mechanism to balance the input of CO2 from volcanoes (mid-ocean ridges, arc- and plume-type volcanism) and other sources. The Late-Cainozoic global cooling has been ascribed to an increase in silicate weathering resulting from the Himalayan uplift. However, the uptake of CO2 by sedimentary burial of organic matter could have been a more efficient mechanism, because of the high denudation rate during the rise of the Himalayas. The influence of weathering of volcanic rocks may have been significantly underestimated.Volcanic eruptions are a major potential candidate for climate change on short timescales, resulting from the injection of aerosols such as SO2 in the atmosphere. However, the climatic effects of recent volcanic eruptions do not exceed several years. The influence of large flood basalts on climate remains to be better studied. The amounts of SO2 and CO2 must be known more accurately, as well as eruptivefluxes during eruptions of single lava flows. Most recently, the emission of methane resulting from the dissociation of gas hydrates has been proposed to explain an extreme warm episode in the Late Palaeocene, as well as a negative excursion of 13C. The contribution of the latter mechanism on long-term climate evolution is still unknown.Because of the complexity of both the climatic system and climate changes, there is no single factor that can explain all of the Earths climatic evolution. We must improve our understanding of climate evolution, of the climatic system, as well as the forcing factors in order to better reconstruct the history of the Earths climate."
__label__SUPPORT	"Sulfate source inventories from a Svalbard ice core record spanning the Industrial Revolution  Abstract: [1] The 800-year sulfate record from Lomonosovfonna was analyzed by a novel multiple linear regression algorithm that attempts to explain sulfate variability in terms of other chemical species measured in the core and sulfur emission inventories. We use three statistical approaches to determine sulfate sources. We examine trends using singular spectrum analysis with confidence intervals, finding clear evidence that anthropogenic sources are important but not dominant; we use cross-wavelet coherence to examine significant multidecadal covariance in terrestrial sulfate; but our main tool is multiple regression analysis of the sulfate dependency on other ions and anthropogenic emission inventories. Models are fitted in a moving time window of typically 50 years length, explaining 80% of the sulfate variance. A suite of model predictors are examined, and the variation in relative magnitudes of the model coefficients along the core can be used to infer variations in the strength of various sulfate sources. We observe large changes in sulfate sources at the end of the Little Ice Age associated with changes in Barents Sea marine productivity, changes in North Atlantic sulfate input and a long-lasting period of disturbance caused by the large Laki volcanic eruption. Modeling sulfur emission inventories shows that western Europe contributes about 15% of the sulfate budget, with essentially no input from other regions, in contrast with predictions from global circulation models incorporating sulfur chemistry. Multidecadal cycles are mainly confined to the Little Ice Age and most likely associated with increased storminess and enhanced deposition of both marine aerosol and biogenic sulfate from the Atlantic Ocean. The model residuals do not show a normal distribution but display very large spikes. Unexpectedly, those significant at the 99% level can be closely matched to major volcanic eruptions using independent dating methods. The 20th century sulfate in the core is inventoried as sea salt (15%), terrestrial (10%), volcanic (510%), western European anthropogenic (1025%), Barents Sea biogenic (2040%), and Atlantic biogenic (1015%). 5. Summary and Conclusions: [36] Multiple linear regression modeling of the sulfate profile unexpectedly showed that the best predictors were nitrate and magnesium. These seem to represent acid and neutral components of sulfate, most likely because acids are colocated in the ice and magnesium is sourced from both sea salt and terrestrial sources. Moore et al. [2005a] show that postdepositional percolation is the primary agent for determining the location of species in the ice core, on shortdistance scales corresponding to a few annual layers of accumulation. Therefore it is most likely that it is postdepositional coelution of ions that results in the relationships seen in the MLR models. For this reason we need to useaNote the Laki 1783 signal was removed before modeling. bKekonen et al. [2005]. cPohjola et al. [2002b]. dSiebert and Simkin [20022005]. VEI is the volcanic explosivity index.D15307 MOORE ET AL.: SULFATE SOURCES IN A SVALBARD ICE CORE10 of 13D15307many more models than just the best fitting MLR model to understand the sulfate budget in the ice core. The expected predictors, salt, MSA, calcium are useful conceptually as we know that they are representative of particular sources. [37] Percolation longer than the smoothing window would simply introduce a smoothing to the MLR model residuals, but we do not see such an effect. A residual peak is about the length of the smoothing window (except deep in the core, such as the 1259 event), as would be expected of volcanic events affected by slow diffusion processes. This is good evidence that the assumptions made concerning the degree of smoothing due to percolation are sufficiently conservative. In effect we have verified a preservation model that suggests that the net effect of dating and percolation smoothing of the ion records is a limiting resolution of 3 years. Therefore there is no advantage is to be gained in fitting the ice core record to external emission inventories by using a percolation correcting model to recover the original ion concentrations. [38] Sea-salt sulfate amounts to about 18% of the mean post-1918 sulfate budget of about 280 ppb or 5.8 meq L 1. Calcium is almost entirely of non-sea-salt origin in the Lomonosovfonna core, and model 3 in Table 1 suggests that it contributes about 10% of the sulfate budget. Kekonen et al. [2005a] show that the dominant 2530-year band covariation of calcium with sulfate has an amplitude of about 1 meq L 1 (about 50 ppb of SO42 ), suggesting that the terrestrial input is largely modulated by this periodicity. So a terrestrial source of sulfate primarily deposited with calcium contributes on average about 10% of the post-1918 sulfate budget. Long-period (multidecadal) cycles were relatively strong during the LIA, but apparently related only to the magnesium predictor of sulfate, not with the nitrate predictor. This can be explained by increased storminess and wind speeds in the LIA bringing both sea-salt aerosol and Atlantic biogenic sulfate to the ice cap. [39] MSA as a predictor of sulfate is most likely due to both having a common DMS source. This must be mostly local as the dramatic change in the MSA ion profiles at the end of LIA was very likely caused by the sea ice edge moving north. However, biogenic acidic sulfate coming from production in the Atlantic may also be carried to Lomonosovfonna with storms [Hara et al., 1997]. This is a viable mechanism as biogenic production in the Atlantic starts much earlier in the spring, close to the peak storm season, and is much greater than in the Barents Sea [Lancelot and Wassmann, 1994]. From Figure 4c it can be seen that the coefficient of MSA increases dramatically at the end of the LIA. The fraction of sulfate coming from Barents Sea DMS emission should be given by the proportion of sulfate predicted by MSA in an appropriate MLRmodel. Table 1, model 5 is one such model where we interpret the MSA contribution to represent local Barents Sea production, magnesium represents the sea salt, terrestrial and Atlantic acid contribution, while anthropogenic and other acidic sources are represented by western European emissions and nitrate. The nitrate coefficient is not significant in the model, but we include it as we wish to show that even allowing all plausible acidic components, magnesium still overrepresents sulfate. Magnesium accounts for 40% of sulfate, of which 1520% is from sea salt and 10% from terrestrial sources, leaving 1015% as the Atlantic biogenic sulfate contribution. MSA represents about 30%, similar modeling of the LIA shows only 20% sulfate from MSA. The much reduced concentrations of MSA in post-LIA ice imply that the MSA/nss SO42branching ratio has changed by a much larger amount: to favor H2SO4 production over MSA. [40] Anthropogenic sulfate seems to account for about 15% of the total sulfate since 1918 and appears to have a western European source. Local sources, eastern Europe, and North America make no significant contribution. GotoAzuma and Koerner [2001], compare a sulfate record extending to the 1930s from Snfonnafjella in Svalbard with sulfur emissions from Eurasia and North America, qualitatively finding emissions from Eurasia match the trend in SO42 better than those from North America. This is consistent with our findings, though as we have separated the western and eastern European contributions we see no good fits between eastern sources and SO42 either in trends or in detailed three-point sample analysis. This is unexpected from GCMs incorporating sulfur chemical process [Christensen, 1997] and may possibly be explained by the altitude of Lomonosovfonna; though it is relatively low, it is above the inversion layer in contrast with all the monitoring stations collecting sulfur aerosol. [41] Thus summing up the various lines of evidence, the typical 20th century sulfate budget appears to be composed as in Table 3. Probably the weakest estimate is for the Atlantic biogenic contribution which is based on inferences from the excess magnesium contribution. Best guesses for the other contributions would be sea salt: 18% (mean seawater ratio); western European emissions: 18% (Table 1, model 3); terrestrial dust: 10% (decadal covariability); Barents sea biogenic: 30% (arguments above); volcanic + measurement error: 15% (MLR variance accounted for), which sums to 91%. This leaves about 10% unexplained which is consistent with the estimate for Atlantic biogenic activity in Table 3. [42] One surprising finding is the enormously long-lasting impact of the Laki volcanic event. Kekonen et al. [2005b] show that the signal affects temperatures for several yearsD15307 MOORE ET AL.: SULFATE SOURCES IN A SVALBARD ICE CORE11 of 13D15307after the sulfate deposition itself, but here we remove that signal prior to any modeling. We observe that the impact is clearly felt for some time after the event by the sudden switch from magnesium to nitrate as most important predictor, the only similar switch occurring at the end of the LIA (Figure 4b). Further, the volcanic interpretation in Table 2 suggests that the accumulation rate was anomalously low in the period around Laki. So either the Laki eruption occurred during an anomalous period, or that its influence was more pervasive in the chemistry of the atmosphere and possibly the circulation patterns of both oceans and atmosphere than previously realized. [43] It seems clear that the largest volcanic eruption signals originate in Iceland or the Far East: We see no conclusive signals from North America. This contrasts with signals seen in Greenland where transport paths over the pole from Alaska seem much more common than for Svalbard. Despite this natural pollution pathway, we see no evidence for eastern European or Asian anthropogenic sulfur, perhaps because those are low-altitude signals rather than the large volcanic events that inject sulfur to the high troposphere or stratosphere.[44] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"WHAT CAN PRESENT CLIMATE MODELS TELL US ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?  Abstract: Climate models are evaluated in terms of their ability to describe the past climatic changes. Past climatic trends are inferred from fitting a truncated Taylor series to the observational record and an ensemble of downscaled results from climate models. Analytical expressions are derived for the warming rates associated with long-term temperature trends using simple calculus. Different trend models are compared, and a third-order polynomial gives the best description of the past winter warming over southwestern Scandinavia. The coefficients from the regression analysis are used in an objective comparison of the past climatic evolution in the models and the observations. Comparisons between the temperature trends from observations and the output from an ensemble of various climate models suggest that single climate model scenarios do not provide a reliable description of the climatic evolution. Ensembles of state-of-the-art climate models, on the other hand, capture the main features of the past climatic evolution. However, there has been an interval with pronounced local winter warming over Scandinavia in the past, which is not reproduced by the majority of climate models. It is difficult to say whether this accelerated warming event was part of natural decadal variations or induced by external factors. The climate models may not yet be able to predict similar local episodes for the future if they are related to events unaccounted for, such as solar activity or volcanism. 4. Discussion and Conclusion: The use of polynomials to describe the temporal evolution has been examined and the advantage over a linear trend approximation and low-pass-filtering has been demonstrated. Linear trend models do not describe slow variations in the warming rate and do not capture features such as the rapid warming at the beginning of the 20th century, the cooling between the 1940s and 1960s, and the most recent period of accelerated warming. If climate models are used to make scenarios for the next 3050 years, it is important to know whether they may describe such variations in the climatic trends. It is argued here that low-pass-filtering is not as useful as the polynomial fit approach in terms of trend studies. The regressional approach, allows a simple estimation of confidence intervals, compresses the trend information down to 5 numbers, and facilitates an objective comparison between the observed trends and the trends derived from climate models.Trend-fits based on regression to polynomials may give unstable results and may be strongly affected by pronounced interannual variability or outliers near the ends of the records. It is therefore important to use this method with caution. It is important to stress that polynomial trends models are inappropriate for extrapolation outside the calibration interval. It is often useful to compare trends derived using different models or with low-pass-filtered records.The solutions tend to exhibit a tightening near the middle of the interval since the solutions are constructed for the interval x [1, 1] and the spread at x = 0 is only affected by the uncertainties in the c0 (intercept) or the c1 (linear trend) estimates.An important observation is that single climate model scenarios do not give a reliable description of the warming, in accord with the conclusions of Benestad (2001a) . A multi-model ensemble, on the other hand, may give a good description of the past climatic trends. If future emissions follow the IS92a scenario from the IPCC and the climate models give an equally reliable description for the future as for the past, then future temperature scenarios derived from these models are highly realistic. It is important to keep in mind, however, that there is no guarantee that the future temperature trends will be within the multi-model ensemble range (Allen et al., 2000). This issue is important for the question of how to construct an ensemble.On the one hand, an ensemble could consist of extreme climate models which predict an unrealistically wide range (say [,]) of values which is bound to span the future values. Such unrealistic ensembles, however, are not useful. An ensemble may, on the other hand, include only similar models which give a very small spread, but there is greater risk for a very narrow range not to span the future. There is clearly a trade-off between the sharpness (usefulness) and the reliability. The spread in the multi-model ensemble may come from different spin-up histories and initialisation (Benestad, 2000), different model formulation, different model resolution and internal variability. It is also important to realize that different choices of downscaling strategy may result in different results (Huth, 2002; Hellstrom et al., 2001; Benestad, 2001b).On a regional and local scale, there have been variations in the warming trends with time scales of similar order as the future climate change scenario time horizon (3050 years) that have only been reproduced by one of the most extreme climate models. The rapid winter warming in Scandinavia before 1930 may well be due to internal or natural variability. If the early 20th century warming was a result of internal variability, then the multi-model ensemble size of 14 probably is too small to give a reliable description of the winter warming trends. This warming may also be related to a rapid global warming before 19401950, which is difficult to explain in terms of the enhanced greenhouse effect alone (the concentrations were still low then), and it has been speculated about whether changes in the sun may have been responsible for most of this warming (Parker, 2000). If the early 20th century warming was related to solar activity, then the climate models used in this study are not expected to reproduce the rapid warming, since they do not account for changes in the sun. One burning question is then: why would changes in solar activity only affect the winter temperature in Scandinavia? If changes in the sun, volcanism or unresolved oceanic processes contribute to a future climate change, then the climate models may not be able to predict all of the future local warming. These results nevertheless suggest that multi-model ensembles are capable of predicting most of the local climate changes related to an enhanced greenhouse effect. Singlemodel scenarios (the individual parabolas in Figure 6), on the other hand, are far less reliable."
__label__UNRELATED	"Review of erosion dynamics along the major N-S climatic gradient in Chile and perspectives  Abstract: Chile is an elongated country, running in a north-south direction for more than 30 along a subduction zone. Its climate is progressively wetter and colder from north to south. This particular geography has been used positively by a growing number of studies to better understand the relationships between erosion processes and climate, land use, slope, tectonics, volcanism, etc. Here we review the erosion rates, factors, and dynamics over millennial to daily periods reported in the literature. In addition, 21 new catchment mean erosion rates (suspended sediment and 10Be) are provided, and previous suspended sediment-derived erosion rates are updated. A total of 485 local and catchment mean erosion rates are reported. Erosion rates vary between some of the smallest values on earth (105 mm/a) to moderate values 0.5 mm/a compared to other active ranges. This review highlights strong limitations concerning the quantification of local erosion factors because of uncertainties in sampling point location, slope and rainfall data. For the mean erosion rates E for the millennial and decennial catchments, a model of the form E S/[1 (S/0.6)2]R with a = [0.3, 0.8] accounts for 40 to 70% of the erosion variance, confirming a primary role of slope S compared to precipitation rate R over this time scale. Over the long-term, this review points to the long (5 to >10 Ma) response time of rivers to surface uplift in north-central arid Chile. Over millennia, data provide evidence for the progressive contribution of extreme erosion events to millennial averages for drier climates, as well as the link between glacier erosion and glacier sliding velocity. In this period of time, a discrepancy exists between the long-term offshore sedimentological record and continental decennial or millennial erosion data, for which no single explanation appears. Still, little information is available concerning the magnitude of variation of millennial erosion rates. Over centuries, data show the variable role of groundwater in the dynamics of suspended load and document a decrease in erosion over hundreds of years, probably associated with historical harvesting. 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: Erosion studies in Chile have provided benchmarks for erosion rate values in different climatic and slope environments and over different time scales. These values are mainly <0.5 mm/a or <500 m/Ma or <1300 t/km2/a, except catchment erosion rates 1 mm/a inferred from 10Be in riverine pebbles, and extreme glacier abrasion erosion rates in the Chilean Tierra del Fuego 100 mm/a. These erosion rates are moderate compared to other active ranges. In addition to the arid climate of northern Chile, these lower erosion rates may be mainly explained by the transient nature of erosion in this part of the Andes.Over the Neogene and in the arid part of Chile, river incision rates averaged over periods of several Ma vary between 0.05 and 0.5 mm/a, in association with a tectonic surface uplift and knickpoint retreat. In the semiarid area, long-term and millennial catchment erosion rates are similar. Nevertheless, the presence of encased Neogene low relief surfaces in Andean catchments suggest that erosion may have varied over the Neogene, but the magnitude of these variations is unknown. To the south of 33S, the southward increase in sediment volume trapped in the subduction trench suggests larger erosion rates than the decennial and millennial erosion rates. Nevertheless, the magnitude of erosion variations over Ma has not been quantified. Available data suggest that the response time of catchment erosion is >10 Ma for arid catchments in the north and 510 Ma for the catchment in central Chile near 33S. Lower response times are expected more to the south under wetter climates; however, quantitative estimates are needed. A global analysis of thermochronological data in terms of denudation history would most likely provide quantitative information.Millennial catchment erosion rates are progressively higher than decennial erosion rates toward a more arid climate between 35 and 27S. This difference is linked to the increased variability in erosion toward the arid north, where millennial erosion is increasingly dominated by rare and heavy storms, in particular during El Nino periods. In arid areas, the difference between decennial and millennial catchment erosion rates can reach one order of magnitude. In Patagonia, the removal of volcanic ashes and glacier erosion may have generated extreme variations in erosion rates over periods of years to millennia. Where the sliding velocity of glaciers is high, the catchment mean erosion during glacial periods may have been 200 times larger than during the Holocene.The impact of harvesting and land use in southern Chile is complex and depends on the time scales. Over centuries, intense deforestation in the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in the temperate to humid region of BioBio (3637S) seems to have stripped erodible soils, leading to the decrease in the catchment mean erosion rate. This decrease in erosion over hundreds of years is consistent with studies showing an increase in soil erosion during high precipitation events in the weeks and months after clearcutting. Nevertheless, high frequency erosion monitoring reveals that clearcutting may increase infiltration and decrease erosion for moderate rainfall.A reanalysis of the decennial and millennial catchment mean erosion rates confirms that erosion depends less-than-linearly on the mean annual precipitation and that slope exerts the main control. The variability in a large number of available local erosion rates (n = 330) is much larger than that of the catchment mean erosion. This variability seems to decrease toward wetter climates. As a result, this variability may be a rich source of information for improving local erosion models. Nevertheless, the lack of a precise local slope measurement except in rare cases and rainfall as well as uncertainties in the sampling point coordinates limit the analysis of local erosion factors from the global database. Paradoxically, no decennial or millennial erosion rate data are available in the wettest places of Chile (4150S).Quantifying the role of other erosion factors remains difficult. The incomplete seismological and landslide catalogues prevent the quantification of the contribution of seismicity to erosion rates along the Chilean climatic gradient. The strong correlation between green vegetation and rainfall limits our ability to independently study these two erosion factors. Similarly, the correlation between catchment mean slope and proportion of granitoids makes the lithological control difficult to quantify.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.10.016."
__label__UNRELATED	"The longest voyage: Tectonic, magmatic, and paleoclimatic evolution of the Indian plate during its northward flight from Gondwana to Asia Introduction: The tectonic evolution of the Indian plate from its original location in the Gondwana supercontinent during Permian through Middle Jurassic time, its sequential separation from other Gondwana continents, its continual fragmentation, its northwardmotion as an island continent, and its successive collisions, first with the KohistanLadakh Arc and then with Asia, represents one of the longest journeys of all continents, about 9000 km in 160 million years (Dietz and Holden, 1970; Chatterjee, 1992; Chatterjee and Scotese, 1999, 2010). India has had one of the most complicated tectonic histories of all of the Gondwana continents. This tectonic history was shaped by complex breakup and dispersal events, and modified by flood basal volcanism and collision events. The rifting events of the Indian plate can be reconstructed from the magnetic anomalies of the Indian Ocean floor. The Indian Ocean is one of the most diverse oceans on the face of the globe, both in relief and origin of seafloor features, and contains every type of plate boundary. The origin and evolution of the Indian Ocean is the result of the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent from Early Jurassic onwards (~167 Ma), and by the northward movement of the Indian plate, which began colliding with 11. Conclusion: The tectonic evolution of the Indian plate, which represents one of the most remarkable journeys of all the continents (about 9000 km in 160 million years), is largely the story of the breakup of Gondwana through time and its subsequent collision with the KohistanLadakh Arc and Asia. The tectonic history of India plays a central role in the dispersal of Gondwana. Though complex, this story can now be told using evidence from linear magnetic anomalies, paleomagnetism and hot spot tracks. Information from different fields of continental geology and deep sea drilling also provide useful information to constrain India's journey. Both the eastern andwestern coasts of India arelimate is dominated by monsoon. Monsoons blow from the land toward sea in winter, re from the Indian Ocean and bring heavy rains from June to September. (B) During the re is high because the Himalaya forms a barrier that prevents cold air from passing intorifted margins, characterized by sub-aerial volcanic rocks. The age of flood basalts along the continental rift margins help to constrain the timing of major tectonic events.The present day configuration of passive margins of the Indian peninsula is the consequence of seven episodes of continental flood volcanism and sequential rifting events since the Jurassic. By reviewing spatial association of flood basalts, mantle plumes, and rifting events of the Indian plate through time and space and reconstructing the thermal history of the evolving continental margins, these events can be summarized as:a) Separation of East Gondwana from West Gondwana during Middle Jurassic time (KarooFerrar flood basalts, Bouvet plume, 182 Ma), b) India separated fromAntarcticaAustralia during the Late Cretaceous (KerguelenRajmahal basalts, Kerguelen plume, 118 Ma), c) India separated from Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous (MorondavaSt. May basalts, Marion plume, 88 Ma), d) An island arc, the KohistanLadakh Arc, formed on the northern side of the Indothethys and became trapped between India and Asia. This allowed for two stages of deformation. The first consisted of a collision of the arc with India, followed by the collision with Asia. India rapidly drifted northward as an island continent across the Indotethys and collided with the KohistanLadakh arc in Late Cretaceous (~85 Ma), e) The eruption of the Deccan traps as the Reunion plume breaches the lithosphere (65 Ma),f) The breakup of the western margin of the Indian subcontinent continued in the Late Cretaceous as the Seychelles separated from Laxmi Ridge and the western Indian margin (7065 Ma), g) Eohimalayanphase: IndiaAsia collision began in Early Eocene along the ShyokTsangpo Suture Zone, which later transferred to the IndusTsangpo Suture Zone with the closure of the Neotethys (~50 Ma). h) Neohimalayan phase: the architecture of the HimalayanTibetan orogen is dominated by deformational structures developed in the Neogene Period (b23 Ma), dominated by the channel flow extrusion of the higher Himalaya with the onset of Asian monsoon. IndiaAsia collision and intracontinental deformation resulted in large crustal shortening and uplift of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau above the snow line that might have triggered the Pleistocene glaciation in Northern Hemisphere.During its tectonic evolution from Gondwana to Asia, India became smaller and smaller, trimming its rifted continental margins, and leaving behind several continental terrances such as Madagascar, Seychelles, and Laxmi Ridge, stranded in oceanic crust as India drifted away from Africa opening the Indian Ocean. With the complete subduction of Neotethys at the ShyokTsangpo Suture, the northern one-third part of the Indian plate was subducted beneath Asia during the initial phases of collision (50 Ma), and now lies buried beneath the Tibetan Plateau.Starting northward at a rate of 35 cm/year during the Mesozoic, the Indian plate attained a sudden acceleration of 20 cm/year from Late Cretaceous (~67 Ma) at the KT boundary, which has been a major tectonic puzzle. This accelerated northward migration of the Indian plate during the Late CretaceousEarly Eocene makes India unique among the fragments of Gondwana. India slowed down considerably 5 cm/year at Early Eocene (~50 Ma) during its convergence with Asia and the closure of the Neotethys. IndiaAsia collision is marked by indentation, channel flow extrusion of Higher Himalaya, rotational underthrusting, and oroclinal bending of the Himalaya. With the rise of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, the onset of the Asian monsoon began dramatically, changing the climatic regime of Asia. During its long northward journey, the climatic and biotic regime of the Indian plate changed gradually with the onset of monsoon and Pleistocene glaciation during the Neohimalayan phase."
__label__UNRELATED	"Spatial and temporal geochemical variability in lacustrine sedimentation in the East African Rift System: Evidence from the Kenya Rift and regional analyses  Abstract: Many previous studies on lacustrine basins in the East African Rift System have directed their attention to climatic controls on contemporary sedimentation or climate change as part of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. In contrast, this research focuses on the impact of tectonism and volcanism on rift deposition and develops models that help to explain their roles and relative importance. The study focuses on the spatial and temporal variability in bulk sediment geochemistry from a diverse range of modern and ancient rift sediments through an analysis of 519 samples and 50 major and trace elements. The basins examined variously include, or have contained, wetlands and/or shallow to deep, fresh to hypersaline lakes. Substantial spatial variability is documented for Holocene to modern deposits in lakes Turkana, Baringo, Bogoria, Magadi and Malawi. Mio-Pleistocene sediments in the Central Kenya Rift and Quaternary deposits of the southern Kenya Rift illustrate temporal variability. Tectonic and volcanic controls on geochemical variability are explained in terms of: (i) primary controlling factors (faulting, subsidence, uplift, volcanism, magma evolution and antecedent lithologies and landscapes); (ii) secondary controls (bedrock types, rift shoulder and axis elevations, accommodation space, meteoric and hydrothermal fluids and mantle CO2); and (iii) response factors (catchment area size, orographic rains, rain shadows, vegetation densities, erosion and weathering rates, and spring/runoff ratios). The models developed have, in turn, important implications for palaeoenvironmental interpretation in other depositional basins. CONCLUSIONS: The East African Rift System (EARS) hosts shallow to deep and fresh to hypersaline lakes with sediments characterized by variable geochemistry. Variation plots for major elements show a clear separation of Late Quaternary sediments from the Okavango, Malawi, southern Tanganyika, Magadi, Baringo, Bogoria, Turkana and Magadi basins. There are positive correlations between Al2O3 and SiO2 in some basins, but most show an overall negative relationship. 2017 The Authors. Sedimentology 2017 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 65, 16971730Positive trends characterize Al2O3 versus TiO2 and Fe2O3, with weaker positive correlations for MgO, K2O and Na2O with Al2O3. These differences partly reflect the different bedrock in the various drainage basins. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots document four major element groupings, reflecting detrital sedimentation (K2O, Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, P2O5 and MnO), the accumulation of lime muds (CaO and loss on ignition), the formation of silica in biogenic and hydrothermal-related deposits (diatomites, chert and opaline silica) and precipitation of sodium carbonate evaporites such as trona and nahcolite. The principal component analyses of trace elements also show distinctive clusters: (i) Sr, Y, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu and Tb; (ii) Cs, Rb, Ta, Hf and Zn; and (iii) Co, Cr, Cu and V. Separation of basins is also possible using Eu/Eu# versus Lan/Ybn space with, for example, Lake Magadi chemical sediments plotting with very high Lan/Ybn ratios. Sediment REE patterns reflect source lithologies, but depart from these patterns for some spring tufas, and modern and ancient alkaline lake sediments. Ternary plots for LaThSc and ThHf Co show distinctive trends with sediments from different basins plotting in contrasting areas. Neogene major and trace element data for the Central Kenya Rift (Kamego, Tambach, Ngorora, Lukeino, Chemeron and Kapthurin formations) show temporal variability with a transition from metamorphic sources through mixed metamorphic/basaltic terrains to phonolitic and basalt/trachyte lithologies. Quaternary temporal variability in the South Kenya Rift mainly reflects tectonic controls rather than changes in igneous rock geochemistry during rifting. In addition to widely reported climate factors, lake sediment geochemistry in the EARS is related to major primary rifting controls that include faulting, subsidence, uplift, volcanism and magmatic evolution. Long-term trends may enhance the elevation contrasts between rift margins and adjacent floors. However, varying rates of faulting and volcanic infilling may return a rift to a more subdued topography. These primary controls, in turn, influence or determine the nature of igneous rocks formed within the rift, rift shoulder uplift, axial subsidence, accommodation space, the movement of non-thermal meteoric and hydrothermal fluids, and the discharge of mantle CO2. Rifts respond to these controls through a series of response factors that include variations in catchment size and the development of orographic rains and rain shadows, withincreased aridity common along the rift axis. Other responses include changes in vegetation related to uplift and subsidence, as well as erosion and weathering rates. Variations in spring to runoff ratios may have significant implications for the dissolved, suspended and bedload inputs to lake basins. Lakes fed mainly by spring discharge are more likely to have chemical and biochemical sediments than those fed by runoff. The sedimentary record of continental rift basins is not simple to interpret, especially in volcanic rifts. The evidence from the EARS shows that the palaeoclimate record interpreted from lake sediments cannot be divorced from the tectonics and associated volcanism linked to stage of rift development, and the evolving hydrology and hydrogeology, especially over long timescales."
__label__SUPPORT	"Voluminous silicic eruptions during late Permian Emeishan igneous province and link to climate cooling Introduction: Basaltic eruptions associated with large igneous provinces (LIPs) have been widely discussed to induce climate warming via CO2 degassing or cooling by sulfur gas emission (e.g., Jolley and Widdowson, 2005; Mussard et al., 2014; Self et al., 2006, 2014; Zhang et al., 2013). However the climatic impact of LIP silicic volcanism is often overlooked even though it may constitute a substantial component of many LIPs (Bryan et al., 2002) and have a potential linkage with regional or hemispheric climate cooling via delivering sulfur gases and ash into the upper atmosphere (Scaillet and Macdonald, 2006). This is mainly because of the poor preservation of such volcanic activity due to erosion, especially for pre-Mesozoic provinces (Bryan et al., 2002). In the late Permian Emeishan volcanic province in SW China (Chung and Jahn, 1995; Fig. 1A), silicic volcanic rocks are only a very rare component (<1%) of the total exposed igneous rocks (Shellnutt and Jahn, 2010; Xu et al., 2010). Their rarity in the rock archive might * Corresponding author. E-mail address: yjhcug@126.com (J. Yang). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.09.050 0012-821X/ 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. result from their dispersal due to the explosive nature of the silicic activity (e.g., Xu et al., 2010) and the 9. Conclusions: Silicic volcanism in LIPs has the potential to release massive volumes of volcanic gases into stratosphere and affect climate. Relative to flood basalts, silicic volcanic rocks have low preservation potential because of their preferential erosion and explosive nature, and thus their impact on environmental change is often overlooked. Estimating the original volume of silicic eruptions and the potential emissions of climate-sensitive gases (e.g., SO2) is important to fully understand the climate impact of LIP volcanism. In the Emeishan province of SW China, silicic volcanic rocks are restricted to the top of few volcanic sequences and form only a very minor component of the preserved rock record of the LIP. This volcanic province has been subject to extensive erosion after emplacement in the Late Permian as indicated by the petrological, geochemical and detrital zircon provenance analysis from the Late Permian sedimentary rocks in the adjacent basin. Modal and geochemical compositions of the derived sandstones indicate that the Emeishan source rocks include approximately 30% silicic volcanic rocks by volume. Two independent methods estimate the total volume of eroded Emeishan volcanic rocks in the Late Permian to be at 3 104 or 4.5 104 km3. Combining these estimates indicates that Emeishan silicic eruptions were at least 1 104 km3 in volume. Zircon grains within the sandstones, which are assumed to be derived from the Emeishan silicic source rocks, exhibit unimodal Late Permian ages of around 260 Ma and trace element trends that closely match zircons from Icelandic and Yellowstone rhyolitic rocks of hot-spot magmatic origins. Zircons from lower stratigraphic samples within the Shaiwa Formation have much lower Th/Nb and U/Yb ratios than those from the upper samples with Hf(t) values being positive for the lower samples and generally negative for the upper ones. These data suggest Emeishan silicic source rocks were generated by fractional crystallization of associated high-Ti basaltic magmas with decreasing crustal assimilation, consistent with studies on remnant Emeishan rhyolites and trachytes. Following experimental and theoretical calculations, the conservative estimate of 1 104 km3 basalt-derived silicic volcanism would potentially release 1 1017 g bulk sulfur. The now predominantly eroded silicic volcanic component of the Emeishan LIP therefore provided a hitherto unrecognized massive sulfur gas emission that was likely to significantly contribute to the global climate cooling at the Capitanian-Wuchiapingian transition (260 Ma). This volcano-climate effect hypothesis can be evaluated by climate proxy studies combined with high-precision dating from related sedimentary sequences."

Conclusion: The osmium isotope record of the Maastrichtian has a coherent structure, characterized by two geochemically and temporally distinct declines leading up to the KPB. This pattern is seen in the four pelagic carbonate sections studied, and agrees well with previously published records. Additionally, the agreement between the subaerial carbonate section (Bottaccione) and the marine carbonate sections (DSDP and ODP Sites) demonstrates the robustness of bulk sediment osmium isotope analyses in recovering a global seawater signature. The initial decline in 187Os/188Os is coeval with an abrupt and transient warming event, an increase in atmospheric CO2, and a potential suppression of carbonate burial, and is consistent with an interpretation of Deccan volcanism as the cause of this initial decline. 187Os/188Os records may be used to constrain the onset of Deccan volcanism, but may not constrain its duration."
__label__UNRELATED	"SEAWATER STRONTIUM ISOTOPES, OCEANIC ANOXIC EVENTS, AND SEAFLOOR HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY IN THE JURASSIC AND CRETACEOUS  Abstract: There were three negative seawater strontium-isotope excursions (shifts to lower Sr/Sr values) during the Jurassic and Cretaceous that were of relatively short duration (5-13 my) and showed a relatively quick recovery to pre-excursion Sr/Sr ratios. These excursions occurred in the Pliensbachian-Toarcian (Early Jurassic), Aptian-Albian, and Cenomanian-Santonian (Early and Late Cretaceous respectively). Each excursion coincided closely in time with an Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) marked by sediments unusually rich in organic carbon. The Jurassic OAE occurred at the end of the strontium-isotope excursion, whereas the two Cretaceous OAEs occurred at the onset of the accompanying strontium-isotope excursions. The possible causes of these excursions were evaluated by successively examining the changes in the riverine strontium fluxes, riverine Sr/Sr ratios, or hydrothermal strontium fluxes required to produce each excursion. A range of seawater strontium budgets was used to encompass the uncertainties in modern and ancient cycles. To produce the excursions, we calculate that the riverine strontium fluxes would have had to decrease by 6 to 15 percent or the fluvial Sr/Sr ratios by 0.00019 to 0.00046. The uncertainties largely stem from the assumed magnitude of the hydrothermal strontium flux at the onset of each excursion. Alternatively, increases in sea-floor hydrothermal activity of 7 to 104 percent could also have produced the strontium-isotope excursions. This large range is due mostly to uncertainties in the relative flux of strontium from axial high-temperature hydrothermal systems and low-temperature off-axis systems. Only a small portion of this range stems from uncertainties in the riverine strontium terms. The possible causes of the excursions were further evaluated by examining several geologic factors that could have affected riverine strontium, including climate change, sealevel, and the eruption of flood basalts. We conclude that neither variations in riverine strontium fluxes nor in Sr/Sr ratios is the likely cause of the strontiumisotope excursions. The most probable explanation is increased rates of hydrothermal activity related to increased ocean-crust production at the mid-ocean ridges. The close correlation in time between the strontium-isotope excursions and the major Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) is compatible with a causal linkage. We propose that increased ocean-crust production led to enhanced CO2 outgassing and global warming, which in turn led to several processes that acted to make surface ocean waters more productive. However, because OAEs did not occur throughout the proposed periods of enhanced hydrothermal activity, it appears that these processes only preconditioned the oceans for the OAEs: sealevel rise may have been the final trigger. This model explains why all three OAEs did not occur at the same time relative to the onset of excess hydrothermal activity and why OAEs are not associated with every sealevel rise documented in the stratigraphic record."
__label__SUPPORT	"Volcanic stratospheric sulfur injections and aerosol optical depth from 500 BCE to 1900 CE  Abstract: The injection of sulfur into the stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions is the cause of significant climate variability. Based on sulfate records from a suite of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, the eVolv2k database includes estimates of the magnitudes and approximate source latitudes of major volcanic stratospheric sulfur injection (VSSI) events from 500 BCE to 1900 CE, constituting an update of prior reconstructions and an extension of the record by 1000 years. The database incorporates improvements to the ice core records (in terms of synchronisation and dating) and refinements to the methods used to estimate VSSI from ice core records, and it includes first estimates of the random uncertainties in VSSI values. VSSI estimates for many of the largest eruptions, including Samalas (1257), Tambora (1815), and Laki (1783), are within 10 % of prior estimates. A number of strong events are included in eVolv2k which are largely underestimated or not included in earlier VSSI reconstructions, including events in 540, 574, 682, and 1108 CE. The long-term annual mean VSSI from major volcanic eruptions is estimated to be 0.5 Tg [S]yr1, 50 % greater than a prior reconstruction due to the identification of more events and an increase in the magnitude of many intermediate events. A long-term latitudinally and monthly resolved stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) time series is reconstructed from the eVolv2k VSSI estimates, and the resulting global mean SAOD is found to be similar (within 33 %) to a prior reconstruction for most of the largest eruptions. The long-term (500 BCE1900 CE) average global mean SAOD estimated from the eVolv2k VSSI estimates including a constant background injection of stratospheric sulfur is 0.014, 30 % greater than a prior reconstruction. These new long-term reconstructions of past VSSI and SAOD variability give context to recent volcanic forcing, suggesting that the 20th century was a period of somewhat weaker than average volcanic forcing, with current best estimates of 20th century mean VSSI and SAOD values being 25 and 14 % less, respectively, than the mean of the 500 BCE to 1900 CE period. The reconstructed VSSI and SAOD data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/WDCC/eVolv2k_v2. 5 Conclusions and discussion: This paper presents a new reconstruction of the climatic influence of major volcanic eruptions over the time span from 500 BCE to 1900 CE. The eVolv2k reconstructions of volcanic VSSI and SAOD presented here represent, first and foremost, the results of improved dating, resolution, and synchronisation of ice core sulfate records from Antarctica and Greenland (Sigl et al., 2014, 2015). Given the improvements in methodologies used to date and synchronise ice core records including automated synchronising and absolute dating through the matching of signatures of cosmogenic isotopes in ice cores and tree rings in the eighth century (Sigl et al., 2015) the eVolv2k reconstruction can be confidently assumed to be a more accurate estimate of volcanic forcing compared to prior reconstructions, particularly for time periods before 1250 CE. This assertion is supported by strong correlation between the newly compiled volcanic ice core records and instances of sudden large-scale cooling from dendrochronological climate reconstructions (Sigl et al., 2015).The eVolv2k reconstruction provides the input data for climate model simulations which aim to include external climate forcing agents as far back in time as 500 BCE. Volcanic stratospheric sulfur injection (VSSI) estimates can be directly ingested by suitable aerosol climate models. Alternatively, the EVA forcing generator (Toohey et al., 2016b) can be used to produce stratospheric aerosol optical properties,Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 9, 809831, 2017 www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/9/809/2017/including the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) based on the VSSI record. Aerosol optical properties can then be used as boundary conditions for model simulations. The eVolv2k reconstruction is the recommended volcanic forcing for transient simulations within the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP; Jungclaus et al., 2016) and therefore represents an update to the reconstructions most often used in prior palaeo-simulations, including the IVI2 (Gao et al., 2008) and ICI (Crowley and Unterman, 2013) forcing datasets.The eVolv2k VSSI estimates and the related SAOD perturbations produced via the EVA forcing generator show broad agreement with the IVI2 and ICI reconstructions over the 12501900 period in terms of the magnitudes of the largest volcanic events. For VSSI, agreement between eVolv2k and IVI2 is the product of compensatory differences, including generally smaller ice core flux estimates and a larger effective transfer function used to scale ice core sulfate fluxes into VSSI estimates. For the SAOD reconstructions, agreement between the EVA(eVolv2k) and ICI reconstructions reflects relative consistency in the ice core composites (after 1250) constructed in both efforts and a related methodology, wherein observations following the 1991 Pinatubo eruption are used to define the scaling from ice core sulfate to SAOD. Before 1250 CE, the eVolv2k VSSI and SAOD reconstructions include a number of events which are comparatively underestimated or completely missing in prior reconstructions. These updated estimates promise improvements in the attribution of forced and unforced climate variability before 1250 CE.In general, estimates of long-term mean VSSI and SAOD in eVolv2k are larger than prior reconstructions. For VSSI, this reflects an increase in the number of identified events and an increase in the estimated magnitude for a number of moderate to strong events. The relative increase in long-term mean SAOD compared to prior work is primarily due to the inclusion of a non-zero minimum (or background) SAOD, which is consistent with the minimum in stratospheric SAOD observed by satellite sensors around the year 2000 CE. The long-term estimates of VSSI and SAOD evolution give context to the best current estimates of 20th century volcanic forcing. An independent estimate of 20th century mean VSSI is about 25 % smaller than the long-term eVolv2k mean. Assuming stationarity of global eruption frequencies, it is therefore more likely than not that the 21st century mean volcanic forcing will be greater than that of the 20th century.For the first time, the eVolv2k reconstruction provides estimates of the uncertainty in volcanic VSSI estimates based on estimated uncertainty in the ice core sulfate composites and the error inherent in using ice sheet average fluxes as a proxy for the full hemispheric sulfate deposition (and therefore the hemispheric atmospheric sulfate loading). These error estimates depend on the number of ice cores used in the composite and the degree of variation seen between the ice cores. For most of the largest volcanic events, the estimated uncertaintyis around 2030 %, while for smaller events the estimated error reaches values of > 50 %. Systematic errors are also significant, representing the possibility that VSSI or SAOD estimates are biased in the long-term average. The construction of transfer functions from the NWT of the 1950s and 1960s and from the single data point of the 1991 Pinatubo eruption carries significant uncertainties regarding the injection magnitudes and injection heights. Observational estimates of the VSSI of Pinatubo have uncertainties of 20 % (Guo et al., 2004), and recent modelling studies have argued for a VSSI from Pinatubo half that of the usual estimates (e.g. Dhomse et al., 2014). An important uncertainty in the reconstruction of volcanic forcing stems from the inability to differentiate between ice core sulfate from vast, stratospheric sulfate clouds and that from relatively local effusive eruptions. Icelandic eruptions with large effusive emissions, like Laki or the 20142015 Holuhraun eruption (Schmidt et al., 2015), could theoretically lead to large sulfate fluxes to the Greenland ice sheets with little to no significant stratospheric injection. VSSI and SAOD estimates then based on the raw Greenland sulfate records would produce large overestimates of the global effects of the eruptions. This issue led Crowley and Unterman (2013) to mute the impact of Greenland sulfate fluxes for signals that could be attributed to Icelandic eruptions in the ICI reconstruction. On the other hand, the vertical distribution of the sulfur emissions by Laki are still under debate (Lanciki et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012), and while it seems likely that the Greenland sulfate signal for Laki does contain some component related to tropospheric emissions, the proportion of tropospheric to stratospheric injections is very unclear. For these reasons, we have not implemented a correction to the VSSI estimates of Laki or other known or suspected Icelandic eruptions. Uncertainties in the scaling procedures used within the EVA forcing generator certainly add another level of uncertainty to the SAOD estimates: for example, uncertainty in the measured SAOD after Pinatubo translates directly into systematic uncertainty in the SAOD estimated by EVA.Future work should be able to further refine the estimates of VSSI and SAOD presented here. First, a larger network of high-quality ice core sulfate records from Greenland should reduce random errors in the composite flux due to limited sampling. Reducing uncertainty in the transfer functions used to link atmospheric sulfate content and ice core sulfate fluxes would greatly improve estimates of volcanic forcing. Studies with atmospheric models show some promise (Gao et al., 2007; Toohey et al., 2013; Marshall et al., 2017), but inter-model differences in stratospheric sulfate evolution highlight substantial uncertainties in the physical processes controlling aerosol growth and transport (Zanchettin et al., 2016). Emerging techniques to differentiate sulfur from tropospheric vs. stratospheric origin (e.g. Lanciki et al., 2012) offer potential strategies for reducing uncertainties in future volcanic forcing reconstructions. Finally, the continued extension of ice core volcanic records to thewww.earth-syst-sci-data.net/9/809/2017/ Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 9, 809831, 2017present should soon provide important information, since anthropogenic sulfate flux over Greenland contaminated over much of the 20th century by anthropogenic sulfur emissions has now almost reached pre-industrial levels, allowing for the detection of moderate volcanic eruptions in Greenland.Earth Syst.

__label__UNRELATED	"Oceanographic and climatic evolution of the Miocene Mediterranean deduced from Nd, Sr, C, and O isotope compositions of marine fossils and sediments  Abstract: [1] Isotopic compositions of marine sediments and fossils have been investigated from northern basins of the Mediterranean to help constrain local oceanographic and climatic changes adjacent to the uplifting Alps. Stable C and O isotope compositions of benthic and planktonic foraminifera from the Umbria-Marche region (UMC) have an offset characteristic for their habitats and the changes in composition mimic global changes, suggesting that the regional conditions of climate and the carbon cycle were controlled by global changes. The radiogenic isotope composition of these fossil assemblages allows recognition of three distinct periods. In the first period, from 25 to 19 Ma, high eNd values and low Sr/Sr of sediments and fossils support intense tectonism and volcanism, related to the opening of the western Mediterranean. In the second period, from 19 to 13 Ma the Sr/Sr ratio of Mediterranean (UMC) deviate from the global ocean, which is compatible with rapid uplift of the hinterland and intense influx of Sr from Mesozoic carbonates of the western Apennines. This local control on the seawater was driven by a humid and warm climate and indicates restricted exchange of water with the global ocean. Generally, the eNd values of the fossils are very similar to those of Indian Ocean water, with brief periods of a decrease in the eNd values coinciding with volcanic events and maybe sea level variation at 15.2 Ma. In the third period, from 13 to 10 Ma the fossils have Sr/Sr similar to those of Miocene seawater while their eNd values change considerably with time. This indicates fluctuating influence of the Atlantic versus the Paratethys and/or locally evolved seawater in the Mediterranean driven by global sea level changes. Other investigated localities near the Alps and from the ODP 900 site are compatible with this oceanographic interpretation. However, in the late early Miocene, enhanced local control, reflecting erosion of old crustal silicate rocks near the Alps, results in higher Sr/Sr. 6. Conclusion: [75] The Sr, Nd, C, and O isotope compositions of marine fossils and the Sr and Nd isotope compositions of their embedding sediments have been analyzed from sections of the Miocene Mediterranean. Oxygen isotope compositions of benthic and planktonic foraminifera have preserved compositions compatible with their relative habitats and that also vary in concert with those used for evaluating global changes in climate. Carbon isotope compositions also preserved differences characteristic for having equilibrated with the carbon isotope compositions of dissolved inorganic carbon in bottom and surface waters for benthic and planktonic foraminifera, respectively. Furthermore, between 17 to 13 Ma a positive d13C excursion is noted, which correlates well with the globally recognized Monterey carbon isotope event. These results support that the fossils are well preserved and did not experience strong diagenetic overprints. [76] The radiogenic isotope compositions, measured on the same splits of samples as the stable isotope compositions, when interpreted in conjunction allow for the following paleoceanographic interpretations: [77] 1. During the period of 25 to 19 Ma the compositions are indicative of the opening of the western Mediterranean and intense volcanism related to major tectonic events. The seawater compositions are locally influenced and do not yet reflect complete open ocean conditions, even though the gateway to the Indian Ocean was already of importance. [78] 2. During the period between 19 and 13 Ma the influence of seawater from the Indian Ocean strengthened, also affecting the Atlantic Ocean at the Mediterranean outflow. However, the 87Sr/86Sr of the fossils do not yet reflect Miocene open ocean conditions for the northern Mediterranean basins (at least till 15 Ma), suggestive of strong tectonic activity in the Alps with a predominant Sr input from weathering of Mesozoic carbonates but also significant erosion of older crustal rocks near the Alps. A warm subtropical climate suggested by the oxygen isotopic compositions favored intense weathering. Brief excursions most notably in the Nd isotopic compositions may indicate sporadic volcanic events. [79] 3. Between 13 and 10 Ma the Sr isotope record supports open ocean conditions, while the Nd isotope record suggests a fluctuating influence of Atlantic versus Paratethys and/or locally evolved seawater in the Mediterranean, which was driven by global sea level changes and by local tectonic adjustments.PA4211 KOCSIS ET AL.: OCEANOGRAPHIC AND CLIMATIC EVOLUTION17 of 20PA4211[80] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Did geologic emissions of methane play any role in Quaternary climate change?  Abstract: The methane-led hypotheses assume that gas hydrates and marine seeps are the sole geologic factors controlling Quaternary atmospheric and climate changes. Nevertheless, a wider class of geologic sources of methane exist which could have played a role in past climate changes. Beyond offshore seepage, relevant geologic emissions of methane (GEM) are from onshore seepage, including mud volcanism, microseepage and geothermal flux; altogether GEM are the second most important natural source of atmospheric methane at present. The amount of methane entering the atmosphere from onshore GEM seems to prevail on that from offshore seepage. Onshore sources inject a predominantly isotopically heavy (C-enriched) methane into the atmosphere. They are controlled mainly by endogenic (geodynamic) processes, which induce large-scale gas flow variations over geologic and millennial time scales, and only partially by exogenic (surface) conditions, so that they are not affected by negative feedbacks. The eventual influence on atmospheric methane concentration does not necessarily require catastrophic or abrupt releases, as proposed for the clathrate gun hypothesis. Enhanced degassing from these sources could have contributed to the methane trends observed in the ice core records, and could explain the late Quaternary peaks of increased methane concentrations accompanied by the enrichment of isotopically heavy methane, as recently observed. This hypothesis shall be tested by means of robust multidisciplinary studies, mainly based on a series of atmospheric, biologic and geologic proxies. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 4. Summary and conclusions: The amount of methane emitted from contemporary onshore geologic sources is likely greater than that from offshore sources. Onshore emissions were even greater in the preanthropogenic time and in glacial low sea-level periods. Gas seepage, in general, is always controlled by endogenic factors,which induce large-scale gas flow variations over geologic and millennial time scales. These arguments are the base for hypothesizing that all GEM, not only marine seeps and gas hydrates, may have played a role in past climate changes. Even if it is not yet possible to state whether all GEM were responsible for the abrupt climate changes of the late Quaternary, first considerations suggest that the argument cannot be disregarded and that it merits greater attention. The foundation for future work rests on the following main points: GEM are today the second most important natural source of atmospheric methane. In pre-anthropogenic times, they were at least the second most important source in absolute terms. GEM, emitting mainly thermogenic methane, could explain the enrichment of isotopically heavy methane observed in late Quaternary methane concentrations peaks. GEM are mainly controlled by endogenic (geodynamic) processes and only partially by exogenic (surface) conditions; therefore they are not affected by negative feedbacks. The main geodynamic factors controlling GEM are the gasbearing properties of the geologic formations (permeability, pressure gradients), which, in turn, are influenced by seismotectonics (neotectonics) and gas-pressure build-up in deep reservoirs. Deglaciation periods were characterised by enhanced seismicity. The Quaternary was a period of enhanced mud volcanism, with several re-activation phases. Preliminary analyses of mud volcanism proxies in Azerbaijan indicate that maximum extension of mud volcanic activity occurred in the Upper Quaternary. The eventual influence on atmospheric methane concentration does not necessarily require catastrophic or abrupt releases (as proposed for the clathrate gun hypothesis); continuous enhanced degassing and/or secular phases of intense mud volcanic eruptions may lead to significant increases of methane concentration in the atmosphere.We have evaluated the potential of some main proxies for Quaternary GEM. Our list and discussion are preliminary, and possibly more proxies can be proposed. Data on the proxies examined here are still quite rare and fragmentary, as is experience in their application to hypothesis testing, so that a strong case can be made for the compilation of a global GEM dataset. In the broader context of neglected proxy archives, such newly organised data on GEM would represent an important contribution to the CHANGES programme (Carbon, Hydrology ANd Global Environmental Systems). Concentrating on proxy archive data in three Late Quaternary global environments (drylands, karst terrain and continental shelves), the records making up the CHANGES global database are relatively neglected in global overviews and global change modelling initiatives, and integration of records from a GEM database could materially enhance current work by CHANGES that aims to enhance global assessment and modelling by greater use of such proxies (see www.sheffield.ac.uk/changes).It is clear that the proxy evaluation, data acquisition and interpretation require a multidisciplinary effort. Researchers working on past and present global climate changes are urged to take into consideration the possible a priori role of GEM in the atmospheric cycle of the greenhouse gases. In providing a means of searching for the cause of the methane increases in the late Quaternary that goes beyond the wetland and clathrate gun hypotheses, the newly proposed GEM hypothesis must be subjected to detailed testing. If validated, it promises to provide answers to many unsolved interpretative problems concerning past climate changes, and to improve predictive models designed to project future changes."

HiRISE will provide detailed images (0.25 to 1.3 m/pixel) covering 1% of the Martian surface during the 2-year Primary Science Phase (PSP) beginning November 2006. Most images will include color data covering 20% of the potential field of view. A top priority is to acquire 1000 stereo pairs and apply precision geometric corrections to enable topographic measurements to better than 25 cm vertical precision. We expect to return more than 12 Tb of HiRISE data during the 2-year PSP, and use pixel binning, conversion from 14 to 8 bit values, and a lossless compression system to increase coverage. HiRISE images are acquired via 14 CCD detectors, each with 2 output channels, and with multiple choices for pixel binning and number of Time Delay and Integration lines. HiRISE will support Mars exploration by locating and characterizing past, present, and future landing sites, unsuccessful landing sites, and past and potentially future rover traverses. We will investigate cratering, volcanism, tectonism, hydrology, sedimentary processes, stratigraphy, aeolian processes, mass wasting, landscape evolution, seasonal processes, climate change, spectrophotometry, glacial and periglacial processes, polar geology, and regolith properties.

__label__UNRELATED	"Carbon sequestration in an expanded lake system during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event  Abstract: The Early Jurassic Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (183Ma) was marked by marine anoxiaeuxinia and globally significant organic-matter burial, accompanied by a major global carbon-cycle perturbation probably linked to KarooFerrar volcanism. Although the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event is well studied in the marine realm, accompanying climatic and environmental change on the continents is poorly understood. Here, utilizing radioisotopic, palynological and geochemical data from lacustrine black shales, we demonstrate that a large lake system developed contemporaneously with the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event in the Sichuan Basin, China, probably due to enhanced hydrological cycling under elevated atmospheric pCO2 . We attribute increased lacustrine organic productivity to elevated fluvial nutrient supply, which resulted in the burial of 460Gt of organic carbon in the Sichuan Basin alone, creating an important negative feedback in the global exogenic carbon cycle. We suggest that enhanced nutrient delivery to marine and large lacustrine systems was a key component in the global carbon cycle recovery during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event and acted to shorten the duration of the recovery of global C values."
__label__SUPPORT	"Calcium and calcium isotope changes during carbon cycle perturbations at the endPermian  Abstract: Negative carbon and calcium isotope excursions, as well as climate shifts, took place during the most severe mass extinction event in Earths history, the end-Permian (252 Ma). Investigating the connection between carbon and calcium cycles during transient carbon cycle perturbation events, such as the end-Permian, may help resolve the intricacies between the coupled calcium-carbon cycles, as well as provide a tool for constraining the causes of mass extinction. Here we identify the deficiencies of a simplified calcium model employed in several previous studies, and we demonstrate the importance of a fully coupled carbon cycle model when investigating the dynamics of carbon and calcium cycling. Simulations with a modified version of the Long-term Ocean-atmosphere-Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir model, which includes a fully coupled carbon-calcium cycle, indicate that increased weathering rates and ocean acidification (potentially caused by Siberian Trap volcanism) are not capable of producing trends observed in the record, as previously claimed. Our model results suggest that combined effects of carbon input via Siberian Trap volcanism (12,000 Pg C), the cessation of biological carbon export, and variable calcium isotope fractionation (due to a change in the seawater carbonate ion concentration) represents a more plausible scenario. This scenario successfully reconciles 13C and 44Ca trends observed in the sediment record, as well as the proposed warming of >6C. 7. Conclusions: Several previous studies have employed a simple calcium-only model (following Payne et al. [2010]) with the attempt to resolve the dynamics and links between carbon and calcium cycles as well as the cause of the mass extinction during the end-Permian [Payne et al., 2010; Hinojosa et al., 2012] and more recently during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (Early Jurassic) [Brazier et al., 2015]. Here we have identified the deficiencies in such a simplified approach and showed the importance of a fully coupled calcium-carbon cycle model.The modeling framework presented here successfully reconciles the end-Permian trends in 13C and 44Ca recorded in carbonate sediments. The model also predicts a 50 kyr rise in atmospheric CO2 causing a global temperature increase of more than 6C. Our model results suggest that the end-Permian mass extinction and the perturbation in carbon-calcium cycling was due to a combination of several factors, including introduction of about 12,000 Pg of carbon through Siberian Trap volcanism, the collapse of ocean primary productivity, and a variable calcium isotope fractionation between seawater and buried carbonates during inorganic precipitation due to changing [CO23 ]. Most importantly, accelerated weathering rates alone that arise due to the perturbation in the carbon cycle are most likely insufficient to directly produce a significant impact on the calcium cycle, contrary to the claims of previous studies."
__label__SUPPORT	"Hydrothermal venting of greenhouse gases triggering Early Jurassic global warming  Abstract: The climate change in the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) was characterized by a major perturbation of the global carbon cycle. The event lasted for approximately 200,000 years and was manifested by a global warming of 6 C, anoxic conditions in the oceans, and extinction of marine species. The triggering mechanisms for the perturbation and environmental change are however strongly debated. Here, we present evidence for a rapid formation and transport of greenhouse gases from the deep sedimentary reservoirs in the Karoo Basin, South Africa. Magmatic sills were emplaced during the initial stages of formation of the Early Jurassic Karoo Large Igneous Province, and had a profound influence on the fate of light elements in the organic-rich sedimentary host rocks. Total organic carbon contents and vitrinite reflectivity data from contact aureoles around the sills show that organic carbon was lost from the country rocks during heating. We present data from a new type of geological structures, termed breccia pipes, rooted in the aureoles within the shale of the Western Karoo Basin. The breccia pipes are cylindrical structures up to 150 meters in diameter and are mainly comprised of brecciated and baked black shale. Thousands of breccia pipes were formed due to gas pressure build-up during metamorphism of the shales, resulting in venting of greenhouse gases to the Toarcian atmosphere. Mass balance calculations constrained by new aureole data show that up to 1800 Gt of CO2 was formed from organic material in the western Karoo Basin. About 15 times this amount of CO2 (27,400 Gt) may have formed in the entire basin during the intrusive event. UPb dating of zircons from a sill related to many of the pipes demonstrates that the magma was emplaced 182.50.4 million years ago. This supports a causal relationship between the intrusive volcanism, the gas venting, and the Toarcian global warming. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: The new geological, geochemical and geochronology data represent evidence for large scale carbon gas venting in the Early Jurassic. It is likely that the many thousands of breccia pipes formed within the 200,000 yr time span of the Toarcian global warming. Our data show that nearly 2000 Gt CO2 could have been produced from the Ecca Group in the western Karoo Basin. This is a conservative estimate considering the total area with sill intrusions in organic rich shale, which has a production potential of at least 27,400 Gt CO2. The venting from the Karoo Basin could consequently have acted as the main trigger for the Toarcian carbon cycle perturbation. The Toarcian greenhouse would have been further accelerated by the metamorphism of coal deposits in Antarctica, long term lava degassing from the KarooFerrar province, astronomical climate forcing [3], and by feedback mechanisms such as melting of gas hydrates [2,4].Our new data clearly tie the Toarcian carbon cycle perturbation to the Karoo LIP and the volcanic Karoo Basin. Our hypothesis highlights the importance of the emplacement environment of LIPs in causing global environmental climate changes. Ultimately, an understanding of the triggering mechanism and consequences of previous climatic changes driven by carbon gas emissions is highly relevant for predicting the consequences of current anthropogenic carbon emissions, as these events are likely of similar magnitude and duration."
__label__UNRELATED	"THE ORIGIN AND DISTRIBUTION OF SALTS ON ALLUVIAL FANS IN THE ATACAMA DESERT, NORTHERN CHILE  Abstract: The Atacama Desert has been predominantly hyperarid since the middle Miocene. Combined ionic and X-ray diffraction analysis shows that calcium sulphate is prevalent on three similar alluvial fans in salar basins across a transect of different environments in Antofagasta Province, northern Chile. Differences between the fans were largely due to the effect of local factors on salt input, secondary redistribution and deposit preservation. Thus carbonate was notable in the High Andes (fan C) and Pre-Cordillera (fan B), whereas in the Central Valley (fan A) greater quantities of the more soluble salts (chlorides and nitrates) probably reflect the higher level of aridity and an oceanic source (the camanchaca). Calcium sulphate distribution on the alluvial fans and on adjacent hilltops indicates an aeolian origin. Evidence from the Pre-Cordillera (fan B), however, suggests that salt input may have been episodic, related to changes in conditions within the general aridity and possibly to stone pavement and soil development. Calcium sulphate sources range from an input in Andean precipitation and the camanchaca to abundant regional evaporite deposits. It is probable, however, that products of Andean volcanism constitute the dominant primary source of calcium sulphate, and that the salt has subsequently been distributed widely within the endoreic basins of the region by a combination of groundwater, surface flow and the wind. 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Earth surf. processes landf., 22, 581600 (1997) No. of figures: 6 No. of tables: 6 No. of refs: 50 CONCLUSIONS: Calcium sulphate was prevalent, and its distribution on the three alluvial fans studied and on adjacent hilltops suggests an aeolian origin. It is clear that aridity has been conducive to the accumulation and preservation of calcium sulphate near the surface accross the Atacama Desert, including the High Andes. Evidence from the Pre-Cordillera (fan B), however, suggests that salt input may have been episodic, related to changes in conditions within the general aridity and possibly to stone pavement and soil development. Elsewhere, an aeolian origin has been favoured for gypsic soils on alluvial fans in Wyoming, U.S.A. (Reheis, 1987), gypcretesin Tunisia (Watson, 1985, 1988), and for the development of reg soils and stone pavements on a variety of surfaces (e.g. Amit and Gerson, 1986; McFadden et al., 1987; Wells et al., 1987; Harden et al., 1991).Differences between fans in the distribution of salts were largely due to the effect of local factors on salt input, secondary redistribution, and deposit preservation. Thus carbonate was notable in the High Andes (fan C) and Pre-Cordillera (fan B), whereas greater quantities of the more soluble salts (chlorides and nitrates) in the Central Valley (fan A) probably reflect the higher level of aridity and an oceanic source (the camanchaca). Nevertheless, the degree to which calcium sulphate was dominant on the alluvial fans across the transect, mostly in segregated concentrations, was not anticipated. Sources of calcium sulphate range from an input in Andean precipitation and the camanchaca to abundant regional evaporite deposits. It is probable, however, that products of Andean volcanism constitute the dominant primary source of calcium sulphate, and that the salt has subsequently been distributed widely within the endoreic basins of the region by a combination of groundwater, surface flow and the wind."
__label__SUPPORT	"A volcanic trigger for the Late Ordovician mass extinction? Mercury data from south China and Laurentia  Abstract: The Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME), one of the five largest Phanerozoic biodiversity depletions, occurred in two pulses associated with the expansion and contraction of ice sheets on Gondwana during the Hirnantian Age. It is widely recognized that environmental disruptions associated with changing glacial conditions contributed to the extinctions, but neither the kill mechanisms nor the causes of glacial expansion are well understood. Here we report anomalously high Hg concentrations in marine strata from south China and Laurentia deposited immediately before, during, and after the Hirnantian glacial maximum that we interpret to reflect the emplacement of a large igneous province (LIP). An initial Hg enrichment occurs in the late Katian Age, while a second enrichment occurs immediately below the Katian-Hirnantian boundary, which marks the first pulse of extinction. Further Hg enrichment occurs in strata deposited during glacioeustatic sea-level fall and the glacial maximum. We propose that these Hg enrichments are products of multiple phases of LIP volcanism. While elevated Hg concentrations have been linked to LIP emplacement coincident with other Phanerozoic mass extinctions, the climate response during the LOME may have been unique owing to different climatic boundary conditions, including preexisting ice sheets. Our observations support a volcanic trigger for the LOME and further point to LIP volcanism as a primary driver of environmental changes that caused mass extinctions. INTRODUCTION Paleoclimate records indicate global cooling during ~35 m.y. of the Early and Middle Ordovician, a relatively stable climate in the ~8-m.y.long Katian Age, and a glacial maximum in the Hirnantian Age (445.2 443.8 Ma) (Trotter et al., 2008; Finnegan et al., 2011; Melchin et al., 2013). Cooling likely resulted in the establishment of ice sheets on polar Gondwana in the Katian Age or even earlier (Saltzman and Young, 2005; Finnegan et al., 2011; Pohl et al., 2016). The subsequent rapid expansion of Hirnantian ice sheets resulted in glacioeustatic sea-level fall and decreased temperatures (Finnegan et al., 2011) associated with the first pulse of the Late Ordovician mass extinction (LOME) (Melchin et al., 2013). The second pulse of the LOME occurred as glaciers melted, oceans warmed, and anoxic seawater transgressed the shelves (Melchin et al., 2013). The cause of the glacial advance is unknown, but has been attributed to CO2 levels falling below a critical threshold (Herrmann et al., 2004). Lefebvre et al. (2010) used a coupled biogeochemical-energy balance model to demonstrate that chemical weathering of a hypothetical late Katian large igneous province (LIP) could have lowered CO2 over millions of years to cause major ice sheet growth. However, geological and geochemical evidence of such an eruption are currently lacking, and it is unclear if the apparent rapid time scale of the Hirnantian glacial advance is consistent with a weathering mechanism. Phanerozoic mass extinctions have been linked geochronologically and mechanistically to the emplacement of LIPs (Courtillot and Renne, 2003; Bond and Wignall, 2014). CO2 release associated with LIP emplacement can produce greenhouse warming, ocean acidification, and marine anoxia (Self et al., 2014), and SO2 release can induce short-term cooling through the production of stratospheric sulfur aerosols (Schmidt et al., 2015). Volcanism is the major preanthropogenic source of mercury to Earths surface environments (Selin, 2009), and the accumulation of Hg in sediment can be used as a proxy for ancient volcanic events (Sanei et al., 2012; Font et al., 2016; Thibodeau et al., 2016). The atmospheric residence time of Hg is long (~12 yr) (Selin, 2009) relative to atmospheric mixing time, and volcanogenic Hg can accumulate globally (Schuster et al., 2002). Because Hg binds to organic matter in marine settings, Hg concentration per unit of total organic carbon (TOC) is a useful measure of environmental Hg loading in modern (Fitzgerald et al., 2007) and ancient (Sanei et al., 2012) environments. Hg and Hg/TOC enrichments are observed in marine strata deposited during Phanerozoic mass extinctions associated with known LIPs, including the Siberian Traps at the Permian-Triassic boundary (Sanei et al., 2012), the Central Atlantic magmatic province at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (Thibodeau et al., 2016), and the Deccan Traps at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (Font et al., 2016). GEOLOGIC SETTING AND METHODS In order to develop records of Hg loading associated with the LOME, we analyzed samples from successions in south China and Laurentia spanning the interval of the LOME and Hirnantian glacial maximum (Fig. 1).

Gold Open Access: This paper is published under the terms of the CC-BY license. Laurentia South China CONCLUSION: We document three Hg enrichments associated with the LOME and suggest that they are markers of LIP volcanism. While specific mechanisms linking LIP volcanism to the LOME and Hirnantian glacial maximum are speculative until direct geological and geochronological evidence of a late KatianHirnantian LIP is found, the stratigraphic position of the oldest of the Hg anomalies is consistent with modeling predictions linking the chemical weathering of a Katian LIP to Late Ordovician cooling. If the Hg enrichments just preceding the Katian-Hirnantian boundary and through the Hirnantian glacial maximum represent further LIP activity, the synchronous volcanism and glacial expansion may be reconcilable through the albedo effects of volcanic sulfate aerosols. If confirmed, the LIP inferred from our Hg data would join those associated with mass extinction events throughout the Phanerozoic and strengthen the case for LIP volcanism as a primary driver of the environmental changes that caused mass extinction of life on Earth.Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-pdf/45/7/631/998935/631.pdf by University of Arizona user on 20 February 2019634 www.gsapubs.org | Volume 45 | Number 7 | GEOLOGY"

Three ensembles of climate simulations conducted with two global atmosphere ocean general circulation climate models (GCMs), considering different external forcings, were used for comparison: ECHO-G (Erik) and MPI-ESM (E1 and E2). Additionally, individual simulations were available from GCM included in the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, as well as single-forcing simulations performed with MPI-ESM. The comparison of the reconstructed and simulated temperatures revealed a close agreement of NCZTjaso with the simulations performed with total solar irradiance forcing with wider amplitude. Furthermore, the correlations with single-forcing simulations suggest volcanism as the main factor controlling preindustrial summer temperature variations in the Cazorla Range over the last five centuries.

__label__UNRELATED	"Integrating the Holocene tephrostratigraphy for East Asia using a high-resolution cryptotephra study from Lake Suigetsu (SG14 core), central Japan  Abstract: Tephra (volcanic ash) layers have the potential to synchronise disparate palaeoenvironmental archives on regional to hemispheric scales. Highly productive arc regions, like those in East Asia, offer a considerable number of widespread isochrons, but before records can be confidently correlated using these layers, a refined and integrated framework of these eruptive events is required. Here we present the first highresolution Holocene cryptotephra study in East Asia, using the Lake Suigetsu sedimentary archive in central Japan. The Holocene tephrostratigraphy has been extended from four to twenty ash layers using cryptotephra extraction techniques, which integrates the deposits from explosive eruptions from North Korea/China, South Korea and along the Japanese arc. This Lake Suigetsu tephrostratigraphy is now the most comprehensive record of East Asian volcanism, and the linchpin site for correlating sequences across this region. Major element glass geochemical compositions are presented for the tephra layers in the sequence, which have been compared to proximal datasets to correlate them to their volcanic source and specific eruptions. This study has significantly extended the ash dispersal of many key Holocene marker layers, and has identified the first distal occurrence of isochrons from Ulleungdo and Changbaishan volcanoes. Utilising the high-precision Lake Suigetsu chronology, we are able to provide constrained eruption ages for the tephra layers, which can be transferred into other site-specific age models containing these markers. This new framework indicates that several isochrons stratigraphically bracket abrupt climate intervals in Japan, and could be used to precisely assess the regional and hemispheric synchronicity of these events. 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 8. Conclusions: This study provides the first detailed Holocene cryptotephra study for the East Asian/Pacific region, and highlights the ability to identify distal ash layers in a productive arc setting. Primary ash layers can be resolved even in lacustrine sediments that contain high concentrations of background glasses, if they contain distinctive shard morphologies and/or unique geochemical compositions. The Lake Suigetsu Holocene tephrostratigraphy provides themost comprehensive record to date of volcanism from East Asia, and is able to integrate twenty ash layers from a range of eruption magnitudes. As a result, these findings have now significantly extended the known ash dispersal of numerous key Holocene marker layers, including the Ma-b ash (Mashu), which is now identified over 1100 km from its source, and thus forms one of the most widely dispersed Japanese isochrons.The Lake Suigetsu chronology is able to provide constrained eruption ages for all twenty ash layers, which offer a new insight into the frequency of explosive events from many of the volcanoes, including more precise repose intervals. These isochrons can now be robustly used to date and synchronise sedimentary records across Japan. Several of these stratigraphically constrain the onset and occurrence of rapid climate anomalies that occurred during the Holocene, and could provide a better understanding of climate drivers in this region. More work is required to robustly constrain the dispersal boundaries of these isochrons, with additional proximal glass geochemical datasets essential to testing future regional and hemispheric scale tephra correlations."
__label__UNRELATED	"Norian vegetation history and related environmental changes: New data from the Chinle Formation, Petrified Forest National Park (Arizona, SW USA)  Abstract: Fossil plant assemblages including spores and pollen grains provide useful information on past ecosystems and the response of terrestrial biotas to various environmental perturbations. New quantitative palynological data from the Chinle Formation of the American Southwest suggest that a floral turnover occurred in the middle Norian (between 217 and 213 Ma). Analysis of plant communities reveals that this turnover was followed by a complete reorganization of the riparian vegetation, driven by changes in fluvial styles and the tectonic regime of the basin, as well as a gradual transition toward a more arid climate. Marked increases in Klausipollenites gouldii, Patina sporites spp., and Froelichsporites traversei are probable indicators of environmental stress, such as increased aridity, perturbations of atmospheric pCO2, acid rain, and atmospheric aerosol accumulation due to volcanism in connection with the Pangean rifting and uplift of the Cordilleran arc. Comparison of the vegetation turnover with younger assemblages from the Chinle Formation in New Mexico revealed similar floral turnover patterns, suggesting two distinct drier periods as a result of multiple climatic oscillations. The climate-induced floral turnover may have contributed to the vertebrate faunal turnover as the loss of wetland habitat space and an increase in xerophytic plants may have dwindled the supply of palatable vegetation for herbivores. The onset of the floral turnover in Arizona roughly corresponds to the Manicouagan impact event, but a direct causal link is still speculative. INTRODUCTION The Norian Chinle Formation (e.g., Irmis et al., 2011; Ramezani et al., 2011, 2014) provides a vegetation record of an ancient terrestrial ecosystem composed of riverine, lowland, and upland plant communities (e.g., Ash, 1972, 1999, 2005, 2014). The flora of the Chinle Formation provides an excellent opportunity to trace vegetation dynamics during the Norian Stage, which was marked by a series of environmental perturbations, including climate change (e.g., Kutzbach and Gallimore, 1989), carbon cycle perturbation (e.g., Prochnow et al., 2006; Cleveland et al., 2008a, 2008b; Schaller et al., 2015), a probable impact event (Hodych and Dunning, 1992; Ramezani et al., 2005), and changes in the tectonic regime in the western part of the North American continent (e.g., Dubiel, 1989; Dubiel and Hasiotis, 2011; Atchley et al., 2013; Howell and Blakey, 2013; Riggs et al., 2013; Trendell et al., 2013a, 2013b; Nordt et al., 2015; Riggs et al., 2016). Pollen and spore records provide a window into regional plant succession and are a useful tool for detecting vegetation dynamics in relation to global climatic oscillations or environmental stress. The palynological record can provide information on regional-scale vegetation changes, in contrast to the macrofossil rec ord, which can be biased to local vegetation elements often in wet habitats (Demko et al., 1998). The palynology of the Chinle Formation is known from the earlier works of, for example, Gottesfeld (1972), Scott (1982), Fisher and Dunay (1984), Litwin (1986), Litwin et al. (1991), and more recently Reichgelt et al. (2013), Whiteside et al. (2015), and Lindstrom et al. (2016). The Chinle Formation was originally thought to encompass the Carnian and Norian Stages based on biostratigraphy (Litwin et al., 1991; Heckert et al., 2007), but paleomagnetic correlations (Muttoni et al., 2004; Olsen et al., 2011) and recent radiometric dating indicate a middle to late Norian age (Riggs et al., 2003; Irmis et al., 2011; Ramezani et al., 2011, 2014). This new age assignment makes the Chinle floras of special interest, because continental Norian palynofloras are relatively uncommon (e.g., Kurschner and Herngreen, 2010). The Chinle Formation was deposited at tropical latitudes and subject to a monsoonal climate (Parrish and Peterson, 1988; Dubiel et al., 1991). Sedimentological and paleontological evidence indicates climate change with increasing aridity and seasonality throughout its depositional period (Dubiel and Hasiotis, 2011; Atchley et al., 2013; Nordt et al., 2015). This climate change is expected to have caused stress in the terrestrial ecosystems, including plants and animals (e.g., Whiteside et al., 2015). In triguingly, previous paleontological studies showed a significant faunal and floral turnover in the middle of the Chinle Formation between 217.7 and 213.1 Ma (e.g., Litwin et al., 1991; Parker and Martz, 2011; Reichgelt et al., 2013; Rame zani et al., 2014), which might be related to climate change. In addition to the climate, other environmental perturbations, for example, volcanism (Atchley et al., 2013; Nordt et al., 2015) and pCO2 variations (Cleveland et al., 2008a, 2008b; Atchley et al., 2013; Nordt et al., 2015; Schaller et al., 2015; Whiteside et al., 2015), could have contributed to the causes of the biotic turnover. Furthermore, the age of the Manicouagan impact event at 215214 Ma (Ramezani et al., 2005; Walkden et al., 2002; Jourdan et al., 2009) is close to the age range of the floral and faunal turnover in the Chinle strata (Reichgelt et al., 2013; Lindstrom et al., 2016). So far, no global extinction has been matched with the ejecta hori zon of the Manicouagan impact ( Olsen et al., 2011).

A doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2011.10.014 Corresponding author. Address: School of Life Sc Las Vegas, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Las Vegas, NV 89 E-mail address: brysonjr@unlv.nevada.edu (R.W. B Neogene vicariance during the Miocene and Pliocene and Quaternary climate change have synergistically driven diversification in Mexican highland taxa. We investigated the impacts of these processes on genetic diversification in the widely distributed bunchgrass lizards in the Sceloporus scalaris group. We searched for correlations between timing in diversification and timing of (1) a period of marked volcanism across the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in central Mexico 37.5 million years ago (Ma) and (2) a transition to larger glacialinterglacial cycles during the mid-Pleistocene. From our phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA we identified two major clades that contained 13 strongly supported lineages. One clade contained lineages from the two northern sierras of Mexico, and the other clade included lineages associated with the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and Central Mexican Plateau. Results provided support for Neogene divergences within the S. scalaris group in response to uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, a pattern observed in several co-distributed taxa, and suggested that Quaternary climate change likely had little effect on diversification between lineages. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt during specific time periods appears to have strongly impacted diversification in Mexican highland taxa. 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 5. Conclusion: The S. scalaris group has proven useful for studying the impacts of Neogene vicariance and Quaternary climate change on diversification in a wide-ranging highland organism. Our results have broad implications for understanding impacts of shared historical events on co-distributed species. Uplift of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt is a strong driver of lineage diversification. At least one episode of widespread volcanism in the Late Miocene and Pliocene heavily impacted highland taxa. Extreme climatic oscillations in the Pleistocene, a key driver of diversification between lineages in some taxa (Leon-Paniagua et al., 2007; Ruiz et al., 2010; Bryson et al., 2011b), did not substantially affect diversification rates in all Mexican highland species.The Mexican highlands are considered one of the worlds great biodiversity hotspots (Mittermeier et al., 2005), yet our understanding of the evolutionary drivers generating this diversity remains fragmentary (McCormack et al., 2008; Bryson et al., 2011c). Diversification in the S. scalaris group is a good example of how the complex dynamics between past geological and climatic events work together to shape biodiversity. The addition of future studies linking genetic diversity of Mexican highland taxa with their paleohistories will provide further insight into the historical processes responsible for diversification in this complex system."
__label__NEGATESUPPORT	"Volcanic and Solar Forcing of Climate Change during the Preindustrial Era  Abstract: The climate response to variability in volcanic aerosols and solar irradiance, the primary forcings during the preindustrial era, is examined in a stratosphere-resolving general circulation model. The best agreement with historical and proxy data is obtained using both forcings, each of which has a significant effect on global mean temperatures. However, their regional climate impacts in the Northern Hemisphere are quite different. While the short-term continental winter warming response to volcanism is well known, it is shown that due to opposing dynamical and radiative effects, the long-term (decadal mean) regional response is not significant compared to unforced variability for either the winter or the annual average. In contrast, the long-term regional response to solar forcing greatly exceeds unforced variability for both time averages, as the dynamical and radiative effects reinforce one another, and produces climate anomalies similar to those seen during the Little Ice Age. Thus, long-term regional changes during the preindustrial appear to have been dominated by solar forcing. 6. Conclusions: Volcanic forcing is important for both regional climate change on a year-to-year basis, and for long-term climate change on a global scale. It appears unlikely to induce sustained regional climate changes that exceed unforced variability, however. In contrast, solar forcing creates long-term regional climate changes that are greater than unforced variability, and which resemble those seen in proxy-based reconstructions of historical temperature change during the Maunder Minimum. The regional anomalies result primarily from a forced shift in the AO.During the last several decades, there has been an apparent upward trend in the AO (Thompson and Wallace 1998). Solar forcing, however, has increased little if at all over this period, by less than 0.05 W m22 since the 1960s (the exact value depends upon the particular years chosen for the trend calculations). Such a small increase in irradiance would cause an AO enhancement of about 0.1 mb, much smaller than the apparent trend of 3 mb, which is more likely to be attributable to increases in greenhouse gases, and to a lesser extent, Arctic ozone depletion (Shindell et al. 2001b).Downward shifts in the AO are closely correlated with cold temperature extremes in Europe (Higgins et al. 2002; Thompson and Wallace 2001), consistent with the historical impression that the LIA in Europe was punctuated by short periods of extreme cold exceeding that seen in the multidecadal averages of proxy data shown here (Pfister 1995). The global mean Little IceAge signal can therefore be attributed to both volcanic and solar forcing, but while volcanic forcing may have played a major role in global-scale cooling, the much larger regional changes and probable changes in the frequency of extreme cold events were likely driven primarily by solar variability.Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Volcanologic and petrologic evolution of Antuco-Sierra Velluda, Southern Andes, Chile  Abstract: Article history: Received 28 August 2017 Received in revised form 15 November 2017 Accepted 27 November 2017 Available online 5 December 2017 The Andean SouthernVolcanic Zone comprises N30 active arc front volcanoes that grewover periods of hundreds of thousands of years. Quantifying the rates at which these volcanoes grow is key to appreciating geological hazards, clarifying petrologic evolution, and exploring possible relationships between volcanism, ice loading, and climate. The integration of precise geochronology and geologic mapping, together with new lava compositions and volume estimates, reveal the evolution of the Antuco-Sierra Velluda volcanic complex at 37.2S. Thirty-one new Ar/Ar age determinations illuminate a punctuated eruptive history that spans at least 430 kyr. Sierra Velluda comprises ~130 km and began to grow prior to 426.8 ka. A lacuna in the volcanic record between 343.5 and 150.4 ka coincideswith glaciations associatedwithmarine isotope stages (MIS) 10 and 8, although shallow intrusionswere emplaced at 207.0 and 190.0 ka. Antuco began to grow rapidly on the northeastflank of Sierra Velluda, erupting N60 km of lava during three phases: (1) an early phase that began at 150.4 ka, (2) a post-MIS 2 phase between 16.3 and 6.2 ka, and (3) a post-sector collapse phase after 6.2 ka. Volcanism has been continuous during the last 100 kyr, with an average rate of cone growth during this period of ~0.46 km/kyr that has accelerated by about 50% during the past 6 kyr. Whereas Sierra Velluda erupted basaltic andesitic to andesitic (53.5 to 58.7 wt% SiO2) lavas, during the last expansion of glaciers between ~130 and 17 ka, Early Antuco erupted awider spectrum of lavas, ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite (52.0 to 64.5 wt% SiO2). Notably, eruptions following the last glacial termination at 17 ka produced basalts and basaltic andesites (50.953.7% SiO2), and following the 6.2 ka cone collapse they have been exclusively olivine basalt (50.953.0% SiO2) with N5 wt% MgO. Thermodynamic and trace element modeling suggests that lavas fromSierra Velluda and Early Antuco reflect extensive fractional crystallization of parental basaltic magmas with low water content (~1 wt%) at pressures between 0.9 and 1.5 kbar. In contrast, eruptions following rapid deglaciation tapped asthenospheric mantle-derived basalt that has been extensivelymodified by assimilation of partial melts of lower crustal rocks. 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: Sierra Velluda erupted lavas that range from basaltic andesite to andesite (53.5 to 58.7 wt% SiO2) between 430 ka and ~340 ka, with minor shallow intrusions occurring ~200 ka. Subsequently, Antuco began togrow at ~150 ka in three main phases: (1) an early pre-LGM phase, ~ 15017 ka; (2) a post-LGM phase between ~176.2 ka; and (3) a post-collapse phase after 6.2 ka. Antuco erupted a wide spectrum of lavas ranging from basaltic andesite to dacite (52.0 to 64.5 wt% SiO2), and is characterized by an abrupt shift to exclusively basaltic compositions (50.953.7% SiO2) following the LGM. Whereas Sierra Velluda grew at ~1.44 km3/kyr, Antuco initially began to grow at a modest rate of ~0.28 km3/kyr, which remained relatively constant until the sector collapse at 6.2 ka. Following cone collapse, its growth rate increased to ~0.65 km3/kyr.Major and trace element variations in Sierra Velluda and Early Antuco lavas reflect extensive crystal fractionation of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine, oxides, andminor amphibole. Petrologic modeling constrains the origin of these early-erupted andesites and dacites to depths of about 25 km in relatively water-poor magma reservoirs. Following rapid deglaciation at ~17 ka (Hulton et al., 2002; Hein et al., 2010; Watt et al., 2013), Antuco began to erupt basaltic magmas at a pace that has increased over time. Major and trace element abundances in Antuco basalt are difficult to explain by low pressure crystal fractionation processes. Instead, Antuco is interpreted to be the southernmost volcano on the SVZ arc front that erupts asthenosphere-derived basalts which have acquired their trace element compositions, including elevated La/Yb (49) and low K/Rb (300400) ratios, through extensive mixing with partial melts of lower crustal rocks (Hildreth and Moorbath, 1988). The evacuation-relaxation-recovery model of Rawson et al. (2016a, 2016b), developed to explain the impact of rapid deglaciation on the magma system beneath Mocho Choshuenco volcano to produce post-glacial silicic eruptions, does not apply to Antuco. This likely reflects either differences in the crustal plumbing systems beneath these volcanoes with shallower ponding of basalt beneath Antuco, or a higher production rate of basalt at Antuco, or both."
__label__UNRELATED	"A major sulphur isotope event at c. 510 Ma: a possible anoxiaextinctionvolcanism connection during the EarlyMiddle Cambrian transition?  Abstract: Seven mass extinctions have occurred since the Cambrian explosion of animal life roughly 540 Ma. These biotic crises are from youngest to oldest: the CretaceousTertiary, TriassicJurassic, PermianTriassic, Late Permian (end-Guadalupian), Late Devonian, end-Ordovician and EarlyMiddle Cambrian events (Erwin, 2001; Hallam, 2005). Although bolide impacts are popularly believed to cause mass extinctions, global climate change associated with volcanism and ocean anoxia is increasingly regarded to be the common thread linking most times of extreme biotic crisis (Courtillot, 1999; Hallam, 2005). At least five of seven Phanerozoic mass extinctions occurred at the same time (within the resolution of current age dating) as the eruptions of five unusually large igneous provinces (Fig. 1). Major climate perturbations linked to lesser extinctions are also temporally coincident with large eruptive events, e.g. the end-Palaeocene thermal maximum (Rea et al., 1990). In all these cases, global warming is considered to have triggered ocean anoxia due to the lower solubility of oxygen at higher temperatures although the exact extinction mechanism is uncertain. Because ocean anoxia favours bacterial sulphate reduction, it can possibly be recognized in the geological record by higher pyrite burial rates and a related increase in marine sulphate dS (Strauss, 1999), which fluctuates in response to changing pyrite burial rates (Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). The long residence time of sulphate in the oceans means that dS excursions generally express themselves over a 10 Myr time-frame (Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). However, relatively abrupt 10 10 Myr excursions related to ocean anoxic events can be superimposed on long-term trends. Extremely sharp positive shifts in dS have been reported to follow known mass extinction events of the end-Permian and Late Devonian (end-Frasnian) (Holser, 1977; Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). Additional sharp spikes in the seawater dS record occurred during the Cretaceous period and following the PalaeoceneEocene boundary (Paytan et al., 1999; Kampschulte and Strauss, 2004). Although most studies have used evaporite or barite sulphate to reconstruct seawater dS, this study uses francolite because francolite precipitation occurs near the sedimentseawater interface in less-restricted marine environments than those associated with evaporite deposits (Shields et al., 2004). Francolite is also relatively more robust with respect to postdepositional alteration than most other sulphate-bearing marine authigenic minerals. Previous isotopic studies of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian phosphorites (Shields et al., 1999, 2004) demonstrate that francolite dS results are consistent with data from contemporaneous evaporite minerals, provided that the effects of post-depositional alteration and the diagenetic environment of formation (Benmore et al., 1983) can be constrained. The combination of sulphate concentration and isotopic data can in theory be used to backstrip the effects of bacterial sulphate reduction on francolite dS (cf. Piper and Kolodny, 1987), thus permitting us to determine seawater dS and sulphate concentration beyond the resolution possible using most other approaches. We analysed 32 samples from the Monastery Creek Phosphorite Member in the Georgina Basin, Australia that were deposited during the early part of the Templetonian subdivision of the Middle Cambrian (508 505 Ma) (Gradstein et al., 2004). This level lies stratigraphically above EarlyMiddle Cambrian boundary ABSTRACT"
__label__SUPPORT	"Assessing the impact of large volcanic eruptions of the last millennium (8501850 CE) on Australian rainfall regimes  Abstract: Explosive volcanism is an important natural climate forcing, impacting global surface temperatures and regional precipitation. Although previous studies have investigated aspects of the impact of tropical volcanism on various oceanatmosphere systems and regional climate regimes, volcanic eruptions remain a poorly understood climate forcing and climatic responses are not well constrained. In this study, volcanic eruptions are explored in particular reference to Australian precipitation, and both the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El NinoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). Using nine realisations of the last millennium (LM) (8501850 CE) with different time-evolving forcing combinations, from the NASA GISS ModelE2-R, the impact of the six largest tropical volcanic eruptions of this period are investigated. Overall, we find that volcanic aerosol forcing increased the likelihood of El Nino and positive IOD conditions for up to four years following an eruption, and resulted in positive precipitation anomalies over north-west (NW) and south-east (SE) Australia. Larger atmospheric sulfate loading during larger volcanic eruptions coincided with more persistent positive IOD and El Nino conditions, enhanced positive precipitation anomalies over NW Australia, and dampened precipitation anomalies over SE Australia. 4 Discussion and conclusions: Our results suggest that the large-scale IOD and ENSO systems, and Australian rainfall regimes, were all impacted by large tropical eruptions of the last millennium.The DMI response simulated in the GISS ensemble following large eruptions is complimentary to previous research conducted by Cheung and Abram (2016) and Maher et al. (2015). The pIOD peak in year 1 (Fig. 4) is consistent with both studies, in which statistically significant pIOD conditions occurred from 6 months to 2 years after an eruption. Cheung and Abram (2016) also found a statistically significant negative condition immediately after eruption at year 0, however this was absent from both Maher et al.s (2015) results and the CR forcing category in this study. The 2G category does show a nIOD condition at year 0, but this is not believed to be a response to volcanic forcing as a similar nIOD condition can be seen at year 1. The abrupt shift to a negative condition at year 5 was not found in either Cheung and Abram (2016) or Maher et al. (2015)s results. Both studies found a gradual decrease in DMI from year 1 to years 3 to 4.www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/ Clim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018The smooth transition to a lower DMI following eruptions found by Cheung and Abram (2016) and Maher et al. (2015) contrasts with the abrupt change from a pIOD of approximately 0.13 at year 4, to an nIOD of 0.069 in the CR ensembles and 0.083 in the 2G ensemble at year 5 (Fig. 4). This inconsistency between studies could be due to the selection of eruptions analysed by each paper. Cheung and Abram (2016) included all eruptions from 850 to 2005 CE recorded on the IVI2 (Gao et al., 2008) in their analysis. While this encompasses all eruptions analysed here, it also included many smaller eruptions that would likely have dampened the climatic response a response that has been analysed in previous papers (Zambri and Robock, 2016). Maher et al. (2015) looked at the five largest eruptions from 1880 to present, of which the largest was Pinatubo (1991), which measured at 30.10 Tg globally on the IVI2 (Gao et al., 2008). In comparison, our research deals with eruptions of much larger atmospheric loading, ranging from 56.59 to 257.91 Tg.Therefore, the persistence of a high pIOD through to year 4 seen here may result from the larger mean atmospheric sulfate loading imposed. This theory is supported by the comparison between the Samalas and Huaynaptina (Fig. 5) eruptions. Our results showed that while both eruptions caused asignificant pIOD at year 1, the larger 1258 Samalas eruption alone persisted with a significant pIOD condition in following years. Further support can be gathered from the comparison between the 2G and CR ensemble means in Fig. 4. Years 03 show more extreme values in the 2G ensemble mean, while years 46 show similar values for both forcing categories. Maher et al. (2015) found a similar response, with the two largest eruptions analysed in the paper showing the largest and longest enduring pIOD anomalies. This suggests that larger mean atmospheric sulfate loading can cause not only more persistent, but also more extreme pIOD conditions.The phase and intensity of the IOD is known to be influenced by the Asian monsoon (Brown et al., 2009; Xiang et al., 2011), which means that the physical mechanisms driving the pIOD response to volcanic forcing in GISS likely stem from this relationship. In GISS, the Asian monsoon was suppressed by the anomalous north-easterly flow off the south-east coast of China in years 0 and +1 (Figs. 13, 14) generated by volcanic aerosols, and a decrease of convection over the warm pool, cause by El Nino-like anomalies in those same years (Fig. 3). These feedbacks caused a comparatively warmer WIO, generating a pIOD. The AsianClim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018 www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/monsoon suppression following volcanic eruptions was also noted by Stevenson et al. (2016).The NINO3.4 response found in this research supports previous studies by Adams et al. (2003), Mann et al. (2005), Emile-Geay et al. (2008), McGregor et al. (2010) and Maher et al. (2015), despite GISS modelling weaker SST anomalies than observations (Fig. 1a, b). Figure 6 shows a very promi-nent and persistent El Nino response in all 6 years following eruption, however it lacks the weaker La Nina-like state that was observed 36 years after eruption in these previous papers. Spatial maps of SST (Fig. 3), while dominated by the overall volcanic cooling, show an El Nino-like pattern in the eastern Pacific that is most visible in year 4, possibly driven by the anomalous winds off the western coast of Southwww.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/ Clim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018America in year +3 (Fig. 13); however it is also distinctive in years 0, 1, and 3. We can therefore conclude that El Ninolike anomalies were generated in the multi-ensemble mean response in years 06 following eruption by a uniform reduction in surface temperature, driven by a decrease in the surface heat flux; a response which was also observed by Mann et al. (2005) and Emile-Geay et al. (2008). It can furthermore be concluded that the intensification of the El Nino in year +4 was due to anomalous wind flow in year +3. Comparison of the Samalas and Huaynaptina (Fig. 7) eruptions also suggest that, similar to the DMI, the intensity and endurance of the ENSO response to volcanic forcing increases with increasing mean atmospheric sulfate loading. This once again supports the findings of Maher et al. (2015) that identified a similar pattern.The positive response of Australian precipitation to volcanic forcing as seen here (Figs. 8, 9 and 11) is in agreement with several papers that identified a precipitation surplus over Australia following large volcanic eruptions (Schneider et al., 2009; Joseph and Zeng, 2011). Our results suggest thatthe direct effect of volcanic aerosols on precipitation overrode the impact of the IOD and ENSO on Australian precipitation in the years following large tropical volcanic eruptions. Northwestern Australia (Fig. 9) showed larger positive precipitation anomalies between years 0 and 2 than southeastern Australia (Fig. 11) in the CR ensemble mean, and in years 0 and 2 in the 2G ensemble mean. This could be due to the positive precipitation anomalies that can be generated by combined El Nino and pIOD events in the NW Australian region (Meyers et al., 2007; Pepler et al., 2014), which enhance the precipitation surplus caused by volcanic aerosols.The varying response of NW Australia to the Samalas and Huaynaptina eruptions (Fig. 10) also supports the enhancement of the volcanically induced precipitation surplus by combined El Nino and pIOD events. The Samalas eruption was followed by strong and enduring El Nino and pIOD conditions for up to 4 years post volcanism, and showed larger positive precipitation anomalies from years 0 to 3 than the Huaynaptina eruption, that was accompanied by smaller, shorter lived El Nino and pIOD conditions. The precipitationClim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018 www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/surplus related to the Samalas eruption in NW and SE Australia also peaked earlier than Huaynaptina, which could be a response to the larger atmospheric sulfate loading. Interestingly, previous papers have not reported a relationship between atmospheric sulfate loading and the peak in precipitation response (Robock and Lui, 1994; Iles et al., 2013, 2015).The precipitation anomalies of SE Australia (Fig. 12) further support this theory. The response to the Huaynaptina eruption, while peaking later than Samalas, endured longer, and with larger positive anomalies. The effect of strong, combined El Nino and pIOD conditions on SE Australia is significant precipitation deficits (Meyers et al., 2007; Pepler et al., 2014), which could explain the negative precipitation anomalies that occur in the Samalas response from year 2 onwards. This combined influence of a strong El Nino and pIOD dampened the positive precipitation response generated by the atmospheric sulfate loading. It should be noted that the surprisingly large positive precipitation anomaly at year 1 for SE Australia is an indicator of the uncertainty of the post-eruption values; however the significance of this event can still be seen by the comparison of the volcanic ensembles to the None ensemble.We note that our study has provided an analysis of climatic response to a set of forcings in a single climate model, which may limit the precise interpretation of responses to eruptions. Overall, volcanic aerosols remain an understudied climatic forcing such that the timing, magnitude, and spatialfootprint of past eruptions remains uncertain (Colose et al., 2016). In addition to uncertainties around the fundamental physical forcings, limitations still exist in the implementation of volcanic eruptions in climate models (Colose et al., 2016; Zambri et al., 2017). For example, Colose et al. (2016) suggest that improvements in model representations of volcanic particle size may improve the accuracy of model simulations. Furthermore, LeGrande et al. (2016) note that the chemistry and composition of a volcanic plume affects its climatic impact, which requires realistic representation in climatic models. Overall, these limitations in modelling eruptions and the idealised approach adopted here may mean that impacts simulated do not precisely match those of the proxy record.In summary, this paper aimed to identify the impact of large, tropical volcanism on the ENSO, IOD, and Australian rainfall. Averaging over multiple major eruptions and multiple simulations was undertaken to reduce the noise associated with the analysis of single volcanic eruptions, as seen by the 90th and 10th percentiles in Figs. 5, 7, 10, and 12. Results showed an El Nino and pIOD response in the immediate years following eruption, accompanied by positive precipitation anomalies over SE and NW Australia. The positive precipitation anomalies suggest that volcanic aerosol cooling dominates the precipitation response, rather than the effect of ENSO or IOD, despite aerosols also proving to be an important influence on these large-scale modes. Although this study focused on Australian rainfall regimes and its main cli-www.clim-past.net/14/811/2018/ Clim. Past, 14, 811824, 2018matic drivers, this approach can be applied for exploring the impact of time evolving forcings, such as volcanism, in other regions.Data availability.

__label__UNRELATED	"The change of eruption styles of Martian volcanoes and estimates of the water content of the Martian mantle  Abstract: Estimated water contents in the Martian mantle range from 36 ppm to more than 1%. These values are based on the chemical analyses such as hydrous minerals in SNC meteorites and formation models of Mars. This study evaluates the water content of the Martian mantle using the change with time of volcanic eruption style on Mars as an observational constraint. Styles of volcanic activity depend on the volatile content of the magma and the atmospheric pressure. Because a low atmospheric pressure leads to a more explosive volcanic eruption, it has been believed that the volcanism on the current Martian environment would be very explosive. Our calculations, however, show that, under the current Martian atmospheric conditions, erupted magma cannot entrain the ambient air effectively, so the decrease in temperature of the magma during ascent is small. Consequently, the erupted magma may form a lava-like deposit when it falls back on the ground. This effusive-like style of eruption is a counterpart of clastogenic lava on Mars. On the other hand, numerical calculations under a thick CO atmosphere, which may correspond to an ancient Martian atmosphere, reveal a rather explosive eruption style. 2 Geological features of earlier stages of Martian history in the Noachian and Hesperian eras suggest that the volcanic eruptions on Mars were explosive then. Effusive eruptions, however, became dominant in more recent times. It has been widely accepted that Mars experienced a major climate change. In addition, the release factor of volatiles on Mars has been suggested to be as small as 0.0170.112. This may imply that the volatile content has been almost constant throughout Martian history. Consequently, we assume that this change in eruption style was caused by the change in atmospheric pressure. For a given water content of magma, a major climatic change may lead to a transition in eruption style. If we know the atmospheric pressure at the time of this transition, we can calculate the possible range of the volatile content of the mantle using our numerical simulations. If the atmospheric pressure on Mars around late Hesperian era is about 1 bar, the estimated values for a typical Martian magma are 0.050.25 wt.%, which is within the range of the water content of typical terrestrial basaltic magmas. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

__label__SUPPORT	"Perturbations in the carbon cycle during the Carnian Humid Episode: carbonate carbon isotope records from southwestern China and northern Oman  Abstract: The Carnian Humid Episode is an interval of prominent climatic changes in the Late Triassic. We studied the carbon isotope (C) geochemistry of carbonates from sections in southwestern China and northern Oman. C records from the Yongyue section (western Guizhou, South China) show a progressive positive shift from 1.4 to 2.8 in the early to middle Julian 1 substage. This positive trend is followed by a swift negative shift of c. 4.2 from 2.8 to1.4 in the Julian 2 substage. C from theWadiMayhah section (northern Oman) shows a positive shift from 2.2 to 2.8 in the Julian 1 substage, followed by a negative shift of c. 3.2 from 2.8 to 0.3 in the Julian 2 substage. The C records from the two study sections generally correlate well with each other as well as with published records, pointing to a considerable input of isotopically light carbon starting in the late Julian 1 substage. Such a large amount of light carbon probably derived from direct degassing and the sedimentsill contact metamorphism of the Panthalassan Wrangellia Large Igneous Province and contemporary Tethyan volcanism. The voluminous volcanogenic greenhouse gases probably contributed to the warming pulse in the middle Carnian. Thus the drywet climatic transition during the Carnian Humid Episode is best interpreted as a warm climate-driven intensification of the activities of the atmospheric circulation and hydrological cycle. Received 31 December 2017; revised 27 July 2018; accepted 9 August 2018 First introduced as the Carnian Pluvial Event by Simms & Ruffell (1989), the Carnian Humid Episode (CHE, following the latest term of Ruffell et al. 2015) represents an interval of major climatic changes in the Triassic Period, but remains the least understood. The CHE is characterized by a transient phase (<1 myr) of increased humidity in an otherwise long-lasting arid climate (Kozur & Bachmann 2010; Preto et al. 2010; Chatalov 2017; Lopez-Gomez et al. 2017). The sudden climatic shift caused significant environmental and ecological changes, which are documented in both sedimentary and fossil records. On land, a clear shift in floral assemblages from xerophytes to hygrophytes is seen in the late Julian substage (Roghi et al. 2010;Mueller et al. 2016a, b), possibly promoting the changeovers in terrestrial tetrapods (Benton 1986, 1994; Bernardi et al. 2018). Peat-forming environments were steadily established in both North America and western Europe (Olsen 1988; Pott et al. 2008), representing their first occurrences in equatorial latitudes after the c. 15 myr coal gap from the endPermian mass extinction (Retallack et al. 1996). In the oceans, the drywet climatic transition caused an increase in siliciclastic influx to the epicontinental seas (Stefani et al. 2010; Arche & LopezGomez 2014). Increased turbidity probably suppressed carbonate production, resulting in the demise of platforms and reef ecosystems in the western Tethys (Flugel & Senowbari-Daryan 2001; Hornung et al. 2007a; Preto et al. 2010). In the eastern Tethys (SW China), the CHE is manifested by the development of extensive oxygendepleted facies on top of the fossiliferous platform and slope to basin carbonates (Sun et al. 2016). The deposition of black shales in the region was closely associated with anoxia and the development of local foreland basins on top of the former platform (Enos et al. 2006). Notable victims of the CHE in marine realms include platform and reef dwellers, such as encrinid crinoids, forams and scallops, as well as casualties in nektonic groups such as conodonts and ammonoids (Simms et al. 1994; Hornung et al. 2007a; Rigo et al. 2007; BouDagher-Fadel 2008; Chen et al. 2016). Losses on land are not yet fully quantified. Perturbations in the carbon cycle often coincided with bio-crisis intervals in the geological past, mirroring significant environmental changes. The carbon isotope ratio (C) of marine carbonates traces the carbon isotope composition of the dissolved inorganic carbon pool in the ocean and thus records a subtle equilibrium of carbon input (e.g. riverine carbon input and volcanic degassing) and carbon burial (e.g. carbonate and organic carbon) (Sharp 2017). Primary producers (i.e. phytoplankton and plants) preferentially utilize C, synthesizing isotopically light organic matter. The organic matter rains down from the photic zone to the seafloor and might be either re-oxidized or buried with sediments (Hayes et al. 1999). Positive C excursions are generally interpreted as evidence for enhanced burial of organic carbon, either due to increases in primary productivity in the euphotic zone, oxygen deficiency in the water column, or both at the same time (Saltzman & Thomas 2012). Negative C excursions are caused by an increased input of isotopically light carbon from, for example, the remineralization of organic carbon, volcanism and contact metamorphism. As the CHE coincided with voluminous eruptions of theWrangellia flood basalt, the negative C excursion during the CHE has been linked to the release of volcanogenic carbon (Dal Corso et al. 2012;Mueller et al. 2016b; Miller et al. 2017). The carbonate production crisis and sudden siliciclastic fluxes during the CHE generated a carbonate gap in large areas in both western Tethys and the peri-Gondwana margins (Hornung et al. 2018 The Author(s).

Only a small number of Ccarb studies have been carried out through (or partially through) the CHE interval (Keim et al. 2006; Hornung et al. 2007b; Dal Corso et al. 2015; Sun et al. 2016). Low total organic carbon contents and potential admixtures of terrestrial organic carbon in the siliciclastic rocks in different basins hinder the interpretation of Corg on the global scale (Dal Corso et al. 2015; Mueller et al. 2016a). All sedimentary rocks are subject to diagenetic alteration. Thus sedimentary C records should be interpreted with prudence, especially in case of shallow water carbonates formed in situ on platforms. The original isotopic signatures can be substantially influenced by meteoritic diagenesis, a higher proportion of metastable aragonite relative to calcite and the local remineralization of organic matter (Patterson & Walter 1994; Immenhauser et al. 2003; Swart & Eberli 2005). Deeper water carbonates (e.g. slopes and ramps) are less prone to diagenetic overprinting and may preserve primary Ccarb values, especially if they stabilized in a closed diagenetic system (Swart 2008). We carried out Ccarb analyses on carbonates from a carbonate ramp setting in South China (the eastern Palaeotethys) and a periplatform deeper basin setting in Oman (the southern margin of the western Neotethys). The new data show a comparable negative shift in Ccarb at the beginning of the CHE, pointing to an at least Tethyan-wide, if not global, disturbance in the global carbon cycle. Conclusions: The carbon isotope composition of carbonates from the Yongyue section (China) in the eastern Palaeotethys and the Wadi Mayhah section (Oman) in the southern Neotethys have been measured. Although the study sections were situated in different palaeogeographical settings, both show generally consistent patterns of 13Ccarb. The comparable negative 13Ccarb excursion suggests that the instability of the carbon cycle during the CHEwas Tethyan-wideand most likely a global phenomenon. The input of isotopically light carbon can be related to volcanic degassing and thermogenic heating of organic-rich sediments as a consequence of the Wrangellia LIP and other contemporary volcanic activities. The drywet transition during the CHE thus coincided with a large input of carbon into the atmosphere and a shift in sedimentation from (cherty) carbonates to shales in study areas, and was most probably due to the intensification of the hydrological cycle triggered by volcanism-induced global warming.Acknowledgements This is a contribution to Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Science Foundation) Research Unit TERSANE (FOR 2332: Temperature-related stressors as a unifying principle in ancient extinctions; Project Jo 219/15).

__label__UNRELATED	"Cool Climate Lateritic and Bauxitic Weathering  Abstract: It is commonly held that laterites and bauxites form under tropical climates. Although some workers have suggested lateritic weathering was not representative of tropical climates, the assertion is still almost universally made. Early Tertiary (56-34 Ma) basalts are widespread in the Monaro Region of New South Wales. They overlie and enclose fluvial and lacustrine sediments, hyaloclastites, and tuffs, and the upper parts of many flows are bauxitized. The basalts are up to about 200 m thick and in one section comprise 22 flows, eight tuffs and hyaloclastites, two dolerites, and nine interflow bauxitic profiles. This region in the eastern Australian Highlands was tectonically stable and had probably been at its present elevation for some 50-100 Ma. Immediately before the beginning of volcanism and during the extrusion and bauxitization of the earlier flows, the region was at 57.5S latitude. Climates were wet, cool to cold, and thermally seasonal, and the region was well forested. Paleomagnetic studies show that the flows were weathered for more than 0.5 Ma at a minimum average rate of about 0.6 mm/103 yr. Erosion was minimal because of the stable tectonic environment. These bauxites therefore formed slowly under wet, cool to cold climatic conditions with sufficient time, and minimal erosion, allowing their formation and preservation by later basalt flows. The presence in the geological record of lateritic bauxites should not necessarily imply a tropical climate."

Although advantages of an arid site are many, hazard identification and scenario development have generally recognized fractures in the tuff as important features; climate change, water infiltration and percolation, and an oxidizing environment as important processes; and igneous activity, seismicity, human intrusion, and criticality as important disruptive events to consider at Yucca Mountain. Some of the scientific and technical challenges encountered included a change in the repository design from in-floor emplacement with small packages to in-drift emplacement with large packages without backfill. This change, in turn, increased the importance of igneous and seismic hazards. & 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

These deposits, discovered in 1962, are contained in Fe and Ti oxide minerals that coexist with subordinate quantities of Fe, Cu, Ni, and Co suldes in massif-style anorthosites, norites, and gabbronorites. Accessibility and other considerations preclude development of this natural resource in the present economic climate. Detailed work by Polish geologists during the last 35 years provides a sound geologic framework for this Re-Os study of the age and origin of oxide and sulde deposits associated with a major, but lesser known anorthosite massif. Rhenium and osmium abundances and Os isotopic compositions were measured for nine suldes and four titanomagnetites from the Suwaki anorthosite massif. The titanomagnetites are over an order of magnitude lower in Re (0.41.5 ppb) and Os (0.036 0.144 ppb) concentrations than co-precipitated pyrrhotite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite that yield consistent concentrations for Re (3055 ppb) and Os (16 ppb). Parallel lines connecting co-existing titanomagnetite and suldes have slopes of 1 on Re versus common Os concentration plots, indicating that both Re and Os behave similarly during crystallization in their high preference for any sulde phase over magnetite. Samples from three deposits within the anorthosite massif were analyzed. An age of 1559 37 Ma (n 10) with an initial Os/Os of 1.16 0.06 for the Jezioro OkraIge and Krzemianka deposits is essentially identical to an age of 1556 94 Ma (n 3) for the UdrynA deposit. UdrynA , however, yielded a marginally lower initial 187Os/188Os of 0.87 0.20. The high initial Os/Os combined with the Proterozoic Re-Os age indicates that the source for Suwaki oxides-suldes is older crust, and hypothetically, could involve Archean rocks. An average crustal value of 50 for Re/Os yields a 2777 Ma age for Suwaki source rocks. Widespread Phanerozoic cover severely limits knowledge of basement rocks in Poland, however, and no Archean rocks are known in the immediate region. More likely, Re/Os ratios may be higher than average continental crust, re ecting mac crust in the source, and may move the source age for Suwaki anorthosite and mineral deposits toward younger values that easily include 2.0 Ga Proterozoic rocks. This more favorable case also accommodates Paleoproterozoic Nd model ages. Regardless of Archean or Proterozoic source age, the high initial Os/Os ratios derived from the Re-Os isochron indicate that the source for the oxide-sulde mineral deposits is more likely the crust and not the mantle. Given that these deposits are clearly magmatic, the Re-Os results add a new dimension to the long-standing ``origin of anorthosite'' problem, implying a crustal source for the anorthosite as well. The 1559 Ma Suwaki age is compatible with a well-exposed east-west band of 15301660 Ma rapakivi granite-anorthosite magmatism to the immediate north, transecting western Russia, southern Finland, Estonia and Latvia, and central Sweden. In particular, the age and isotopic character of Suwaki are not unlike those of the well-studied Salmi rapakivi granite-anorthosite batholith in western Russia (Karelia)."
__label__UNRELATED	"The ZiwayShala lake basin system, Main Ethiopian Rift: Influence of volcanism, tectonics, and climatic forcing on basin formation and sedimentation  Abstract: In the central sector of the Main Ethiopian Rift, the ZiwayShala lake basin system includes four present-day residual lakes, from north to south, lakes Ziway, Langano, Abijata, and Shala. This region of East Africa is under the influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone seasonal migration. Thus it has been designated as a potential core site by the ERICA Project (Environmental Research for Intertropical Climate in Africa). The four lakes have been subjected to strong changes in water level and water salinity at least during the Late Pleistocene. The purpose of this study is to produce a model of basin formation and sediment accumulation for this system of lakes, in order to separate the effects of climatic change from environmental variations induced by local or regional factors such as volcano-tectonic forcings. In addition to an exhaustive synthesis of available data, various investigations have been used to develop this model: 3D remote sensing, high-resolution seismics, coring, and structural, sedimentological, and hydrological field studies. New AMS radiocarbon dating helped to refine the pre-existing stratigraphic framework for this region, and basin age estimations were calculated using mean sediment accumulation rates.

The early-middle PleistoceneLate Pleistocene period (1010 yr) was marked by a regional volcano-tectonic paroxysm, resulting in major changes in the morphology of the area, with the formation of the Abijata, Ziway and Shala lake basins. From 340.20 Ma, the ZiwayShala basin history is marked by the eastward migration of volcano-tectonic activity, resulting in the development of the youngest basin of the ZiwayShala system, the Langano Basin. The joint history of sedimentation in the Ziway, Langano, Abijata, and Shala lake basins started during the early-Late Pleistocene period (101104 yr) and is characterized from this period up to the present-day by a series of climatically controlled rises and falls of lake level. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: This study of the ZiwayShala lake basin system of the MER provides an evolutionary model that can be applied to other intracontinental rift systems where initial rift floor segmentation is dominated by major explosive volcanism, in contrast with tectonics-dominated rift basins.At the macro-architectural scale (106 yr), the Late PlioceneEarly Pleistocene morphology of the ZiwayShala region directly relates to catastrophic explosive volcanic eruptions correlated with major caldera collapse (Munesa and Gademotta calderas). The history of the lake basin system started as a result of a combination of large (30 km diameter?) pre-existing caldera depressions.At the meso-architectural scale (104106 yr), fault deformation and migration linked to the tectonic structuration of the WFB results in controlling the architectural pattern of the basin and drainage system. Successive depressions caused by the subsidence of crustal blocks combined with reliefs formed by magma effusion during a new paroxysmic explosive volcanic phase, the whole being associated with graben-like downfaulting related to the development of the Wonji Fault Belt, resulted in less than 105 yr in a new complex rift floor morphology: to the174 C.

Lateral migration of volcano-tectonic activity resulted later in the diachronous formation of two opposite half-grabens, the Abijata Main Basin to the west, and the Langano Basin to the east, separated by the Katlo Horst.Finally, at a micro-architectural scale (101104 yr), the climate signal appeared to be more pronounced as tectonic effects have waned. Climatic fluctuations at regional or global scale, linked to the monsoon effects, and possibly influenced at a millennial scale by the regional explosive volcanism, caused river regime change and major baselevel changes controlling drainage basin area and shape, resulting in quick-alternating high- and lowlake morphologies. Minor tectonic movements appeared to be concentrated in the youngest Langano Basin, possibly correlated with volcanic activity of Alutu, thus defining the present-day Ethiopian Rift active axis."
__label__UNRELATED	"New evidence for a volcanically, tectonically, and climatically active Mars  Abstract: Geological analysis of Mars imagery supports the hypothesis that the planet has been the site of recent (< 10 Ma) volcanic and tectonic processes and glacier flow, and makes most likely previous suggestions of continuing endogenic and exogenic activity. Tectonic structures which deform very slightly cratered (at MOC scales) surfaces of Tharsis Montes and surrounding regions seem to attest to active tectonism (both extensional and transcurrent) on Mars. Exogenic processes in this region, such as a glacial origin for the aureole deposits on the northwestern flanks of the Tharsis Montes shield volcanoes, are supported by new data. The very recent age of these structures could be the first direct confirmation that drastic changes in obliquity are modulating the martian climate, such that an increase in obliquity would result in equatorial glaciers taking the place of the receding polar ice caps. If this and other concurring research is extended and confirmed, the alive Mars which would emerge would constitute a most appealing place for exobiology and comparative planetology. 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: 1. The best explanation for recent glacier flow at high altitudes and low latitudes on Mars is an abrupt change in the martian obliquity, as first advanced by Laskar (1989).2. The evidence for recent volcanism and tectonics point to a planet with remaining internal energy.3. The proposed ages for endogenic and exogenic activity would necessarily place Mars among the active planetary bodies, a quite interesting place for the immediate and ensuing exploration missions."
__label__UNRELATED	"Minimum estimates of the amount and timing of gases released into the martian atmosphere from volcanic eruptions  Abstract: Volcanism has been a major process during most of the geologic history of Mars. Based on data collected from terrestrial basaltic eruptions, we assume that the volatile content of martian lavas was typically 0.5 wt.% water, 0.7 wt.% carbon dioxide, 0.14 wt.% sulfur dioxide, and contained several other important volatile constituents. From the geologic record of volcanism on Mars we find that during the late Noachian and through the Amazonian volcanic degassing contributed 0.8 bar to the martian atmosphere. Because most of the outgassing consisted of greenhouse gases (i.e., CO2 and SO2) warmer surface temperatures resulting from volcanic eruptions may have been possible. Our estimates suggest that 1.1 10 g ( 8 1 m m ) of juvenile water were released by volcanism; slightly more than half the amount contained in the north polar cap and atmosphere. Estimates for released CO2 (1.6 10 g) suggests that a large reservoir of carbon dioxide is adsorbed in the martian regolith or alternatively 300 cm cm 2 of carbonates may have formed, although these materials would not occur readily in the presence of excess SO2. Up to 120 cm cm 2 (2.2 10 g) of acid rain (H2SO4) may have precipitated onto the martian surface as the result of SO2 degassing. The hydrogen flux resulting from volcanic outgassing may help explain the martian atmospheric D/H ratio. The amount of outgassed nitrogen ( 1.3 mbar) may also be capable of explaining the martian atmospheric N/N ratio. Minor gas constituents (HF, HCl, and H2S) could have formed hydroxyl salts on the surface resulting in the physical weathering of geologic materials. The amount of hydrogen fluoride emitted (1.82 10 g) could be capable of dissolving a global layer of quartz sand 5 mm thick, possibly explaining why this mineral has not been positively identified in spectral observations. The estimates of volcanic outgassing presented here will be useful in understanding how the martian atmosphere evolved over time. Published by Elsevier Inc. 4. Conclusions: (1) During its early history (Noachian through the Hesperian) release of volcanic gases may have increased the atmospheric pressure up to 0.3 bar for several martian years. It may be possible that the greenhouse effect of these gases, primarily SO2 and CO2, were enough to raise the surface temperature above freezing and permit liquid water or carbon dioxide to exist on the surface. (2) Acid rain (H2SO4) was probably produced as the result of SO2 degassing. As much as 120 cm of this liquid may have precipitated onto the martian surface with time, contributing to the high sulfur content of the martian soil and perhaps creating runoff channels on the flanks of young volcanoes. Collectively with released water and CO2, acid rain may have aided in the degradation of the martian highlands and formation of the valley networks. (3) Revised estimates of juvenile water suggest that a global layer equivalent to 8 mm 2 was produced by volcanic degassing. Assuming that volcanism was the only source of water on Mars, 6.7 m would have been lost to space to explain the high martian D/H ratio. Estimates for released CO2 suggest that most of it most be adsorbed in the martian regolith. Depending on the mineralogy, estimates for the amount of adsorbed CO2 suggest that the martian regolith is a minimum of 50400 m thick. Alternatively, 130 cm cm 2 of carbonates may be present. (4) Providing that the temperature increases accompanying early volcanic gas emissions were high enough to decouple the nonthermal escape of oxygen to the Jeans escape of hydrogen, the hydrogen flux from degassing may be able to explain the high martian atmospheric D/H ratio. (5) The amount of nitrogen outgassed appears to be able to explain the current atmospheric 15N/14N ratio, implying that chemical fixation of nitrogen to the martian soil did not occur. (6) Minor gas constituents (HF, HCl and H2S) could have formed hydroxyl salts on surface materials. Under current martian conditions these salts would continually recrystallize, perhaps resulting in physical weathering of geologic material (Malin, 1974). The amount of hydrogen fluoride emitted would be capable of dissolving a layer of quartz sand 5 mm thick distributed globally, perhaps explaining the absence of this material in spectral studies."

Conclusions: 40Ar/39Ar and fission-track data have been used to quantify the thermal and exhumation history of the Eastern Rhodopes, which has permitted the genetic relationships between mineralization and extensional processes to be constrained. These results were integrated in timetemperature paths, which permit an assessment of the timing, magnitude and duration of different thermal events in relation to the ongoing extensional tectonic evolution. As a result, a quantitative framework for the Tertiary thermal and exhumation history of theEasternRhodopeshasbeenestablished,whichprovides constraints on the role of different processes in the formation, preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits in the Eastern Rhodopes. Heat accumulation during burial of the upper plate rocks is considered to be a plausible heat source for ore formation. The development of large halfgraben basins above the detachment faults, accompanied by a favourable climate, might have provided the primary meteoric water supply for the hydrothermal convective systems. Our new 40Ar/39Ar ages support the presence of amagmatic heat, sulphur and/or themetal reservoir contemporaneous with gold deposition. The preservation and exhumation of sedimentary rock-hosted gold deposits is largely controlled by the exhumation history of the upper plate, which can be quantitatively constrained by low-temperature thermochronological methods.TheEoceneMiocene tectonic evolutionof this area is characterizedby several distinct structural episodes. Based on 40Ar/39Ar and FT thermochronology, the lower plate experienced continuous cooling and exhumation since the Late Eocene. 40Ar/39Ar data acquired from metamorphic rocks of the lower plate show that the footwall cooled through 350 C between 36.900.16 Ma and 37.280.19 Ma, via exhumation during detachment faulting. Sedimentary rock-hosted gold mineralization, which occurred at 250220 C, developed during the early stage of basin formation (34.710.16 Ma to 35.360.21 Ma). The earliest known calcalkaline type magmatism at Iran Tepe (33.97 0.36 Ma to 34.620.46Ma), and the end of the hydrothermal mineralization from Ada Tepe were contemporaneous. The AFT data show that the lower plate rocks cooled to 120 C at 18.31.9 Ma. The ZFT and AFT thermal history models for the upper plate show that it was being buried duringmost of the Oligocene.

Conclusions: The T-OAE CIE and the high-frequency fluctuations within it have now been documented from multiple oceanic basins spanning the globe. This is consistent with the suggestion that they reflect global perturbations to the carbon cycle triggered by volcanism associated with the emplacement of the KarooFerrar LIP and subsequent biogeochemical feedbacks (e.g., methane clathrate releases or terrestrial methanogenesis). This finding also further confirms the utility of the overall T-OAE CIE as a global chemostratigraphic marker. Additionally, we suggest that increased terrestrial methanogenesis, which would have been an important positive feedback to the initial warming and increased precipitation caused by the emplacement of the KarooFerrar LIP, played an important role in the Toarcian carbon cycle. Importantly, any additional flux of carbon from terrestrial environments to the oceanatmosphere system would decrease the carbon flux needed from other potential sources to generate the broader T-OAE CIE and small-scale CIEs within it. Future studies will further elucidate the role of the terrestrial carbon cycle in the Toarcian climatic change.A better understanding of the T-OAE record may serve to inform models of other events triggered by rapid injections of greenhouse gases, such as the PETM. While these two events were separated by roughly 130 million years and had significantly different Earth system boundary conditions, the resulting environmental change and ecological deterioration were broadly similar. As our planet experiences another significant perturbation to the global carbon cycle and climatic warming, the record of environmental change recorded during these geologic events represents an invaluable archive for models of future long-term climate and oceanographic change."
__label__SUPPORT	"Early Eocene climatic, volcanic, and biotic events in the northwestern Tethyan Untersberg section, Austria  Abstract: The 40 m thick Untersberg section (Salzburg, Austria) of the Northern Calcareous Alps comprises the Palaeocene Eocene transition and spans the upper part of calcareous nannoplankton zone NP9 and the lower part of zone NP10 (subzone NP10a). These zones are equivalent to planktonic foraminifera zone P5 and the lower part of zone P6 (sub-zone P6a). The succession was deposited in a lower bathyal slope environment at a palaeodepth of about 2000 m. Within the dominantly marlstone succession, a 5.5-m-thick intercalation of red and green claystone and marly claystone represents the global negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) which is used to recognize the PalaeoceneEocene boundary. The CIE was associated with a shallowing of the calcite compensation depth by at least 1 km. Throughout the section, clay mineral assemblages are dominated by smectite, indicating a seasonal climate with alternating wet and dry conditions. A 49% increase in detrital quartz and feldspar within the CIE-interval suggests enhanced continental run-off. This was probably the result of the establishment of a monsoonal setting, in which vegetation was sparse, while periodic high rainfall caused pronounced sediment transport. The increased terrestrially derived input is associated with abundant radiolarian casts indicating high primary productivity. This suggests that seasonal nutrient pulses resulting from intensified precipitation during the wet season have caused high surface-water fertility. The benthic foraminifera faunas of the samples rich in siliceous plankton are strongly dominated by Glomospira spp., Nuttalides truempyii, Abyssamina poagi, Anomalinoides praeacutus, Anomalinoides nobilis, and Oridorsalis spp. We assume that the GlomospiraNuttalides fauna consists of opportunistic species which quickly react to seasonally varying amounts of food. The calcareous nannoplankton assemblage of the CIE-interval is characterized by the first occurrences of the genus Rhomboaster and of Discoaster araneus and Discoaster mahmoudii, whereas Scapholithus apertus become extinct at the PalaeoceneEocene boundary. Within nannoplankton sub-zone NP10a, a series of primarily basaltic ashes give evidence for a major episode of explosive volcanism which can be correlated with the positive ash-series of the Fur-Formation in northern Denmark. The wide 5. Conclusion: In the northwestern Tethys, abundant siliceous plankton indicate high nutrient levels in oceanic surface waters in the basal Eocene. A coeval increase in both sedimentation rates and the amounts of terrestrially derived quartz and feldspar suggests that this high primary productivity was the result of enhanced continental run-off. It is assumed that the establishment of a pronounced monsoonal climate caused this increase in continental erosion.Frequent ash-layers indicate that intense explosive volcanism was another important environmental factor in the early Eocene. The biostratigraphical and geochemical correspondence of these tephras with ashes from the North Sea Basin suggests that these pyroclastic deposits are related to the continental breakup of Europe and Greenland. The distance the tephras in the northwestern Tethyan sections were dispersed from their proposed magmatic source in the North Atlantic igneous province (ca. 4000 km) indicates that the eruptions were extremely powerful and emitted large volumes of ash and gases into the lower stratosphere. It can be assumed that these eruptions greatly affected the radiation of the sun and, therefore, caused a decrease of surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. As basaltic eruptions require watermagma interaction, the onset of eruptive activity was probably an effect of the emergence of part of the North Atlantic igneous province above sea level. The tephra layers are restricted to sub-zone NP10a and vanish at the top of this sub-zone. The transgression of the London clay and the Ieper clay in the North Sea basin was an effect of a pronounced sea-level rise at the base of sub-zone NP10b (Aubry, 1996; Knox, 1998). The termination of basaltic eruptions at that stratigraphic level suggests that the rising sea level caused the drowning of the volcanic source area.H.

__label__SUPPORT	"Evidence for a volcanic cooling signal in a 335year coral record from New Caledonia  Abstract: Although volcanic cooling events have been detected in tree ring records, their occurrence in marine records has received much less attention. Herein we report results from a 335-year oxygen isotope record (1657-1992) from a New Caledonia coral indicating that as many as 16 interannual-scale cooling events occur within 1 year of a volcanic eruption as determined by ice core records. There are also pentadal/decadal-scale cooling events beginning in 1675, 1813, and 1903 that immediately postdate volcanic eruptions. However, the interannual correspondences are complicated by the fact that some of the cooling events also coincide with E1 Nifios, which cause cooling in this part of the western South Pacific. If our conclusions are substantiated by further work, occurrence of distinct volcanic cooling signals may enable refinement of coral chronologies by use of the event stratigraphic approach, with the most promising correlation horizons being associated with the following eruptions: 1808 (Unknown), 1813-1821 (several eruptions), 1835 (Coseguina), 1883 (Krakatau), and possibly 1963 (Agung)."
__label__UNRELATED	"Earth dynamics and climate changes La dynamique terrestre et les modifications climatiques  Abstract: The evolution of the Earths climate over geological time is now relatively well known. Conversely, the causes and feedback mechanisms involved in these climatic changes are still not well determined. At geological timescales, two factors play a prevailing role: plate tectonics and the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Their climatic effects will be examined using palaeoclimatic indicators as well as results of climate models. I focus primarily on the influence of continental drift on warm and cold climatic episodes. The consequences of peculiar land sea distributions (amalgamation/dispersal of continental blocks) are discussed. Plate tectonics also drive sea level changes as well as mountain uplift. Marine transgressions during the MidCretaceous favoured warmth within the interiors of continents, although their effect could be very different according to the season. Mountain uplift is also an important factor, which is able to alter climate at large spatial scales. Experiments relative to climatic sensitivity to the elevation of the Appalachians during the Late Permian are discussed. To affect the whole Earth, the chemical composition of the atmosphere appears to be a more efficient forcing factor. The carbon dioxide driven by the longterm carbon cycle has influenced the global climate. Geochemical modelling simulates more or less accurately the long-term evolution of pCO2, which corresponds roughly to the icehouse/greenhouse climatic oscillations. However, the uncertainties on pCO2 are still important because different parameters involved in the long-term carbon cycle (degassing rate, chemical weathering of silicates, burial of organic matter) are not well constrained throughout the past. The chemical composition of the atmosphere is also altered by the emissions of modern volcanic eruptions leading to weak global cooling. The influence of large flood basalt provinces on climate is not yet known well enough; this volcanism may have released huge amounts of SO2 as well as CO2. At last, the chemical composition of the atmosphere may have been altered by the release of methane in response to the dissociation of gas hydrates. This scenario has been proposed to explain the abrupt warming during the Late Palaeocene. 2003 Academie des sciences/Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved. 8. Conclusion: Understanding the Earths climate history over geologic time-scales remains a challenge, despite the huge amount of data accumulated over a century and the use of numerical models since two decades. The first-order climate history over the Phanerozoic, which shows a succession of warmer and colder global periods, is now relatively well known. However, we are still unable to reproduce the long-term trend. Different forcing factors, most of them resulting from internal Earths processes, have been proposed to account for climate evolution over geologic timescales. Two of them are of primary importance, plate tectonics and greenhouse gases, both being themselves possibly in part causally related.The past position of continents is accurately known for the past 200 Ma, but progress is still required for older periods. Climate modelling has shown that this factor cannot account alone for global long-term climate changes. Indeed, the location of continents cannot explain the extreme warmth in the Mid-Cretaceous or the short duration of the Ordovician ice age. The impact of plate configurations on climate may have evolved in the past. Numerical experiments reveal that the Late Permian climate was largely driven by a peculiar palaeogeographic configuration (Pangea supercontinent). All continents are assembled as a single entity, deeply reducing the effect of oceanic circulation on the climatic system. Most recently, a combination of break-up of the equatorial supercontinent of Rodinia, emission of a huge flood basalt and enhanced weathering has been suggested as a possible cause for the 700-Ma Proterozoic Snowball Earth (Godderis et al., in review). Conversely, the rise of sea level driven by plate tectonics affects the landsea dis-tribution and both alter atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Climate modelling reveals that marine transgression causes a warming within the interiors of continents. The Mid-Cretaceous warmth within the interiors of continents could be explained by such a mechanism. The coupled effect of plate tectonics and sealevel variations has led to the opening and closure of marine gateways. The effects of marine gateways on climate vary drastically with respect to their location, width and depth. In the case of closure of the Isthmus of Panama, as well as of the closure of Indonesian seaway, changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation may likely have contributed to large-scale climate changes. Finally, the elevation of mountain ranges such as the Appalachians during the Late Palaeozoic or the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau during the Late Cainozoic appears to be an important forcing factor, which alters atmospheric circulation and therefore climate at the continental scale.To influence the climate on a global scale, changes in atmospheric chemical composition, and especially CO2 fluctuations appear to be a more efficient mechanism. Fluctuations of pCO2 deduced from geochemical models simulate roughly long-term climate evolution. An elevated pCO2 is required to partly explain the warmth of the Mid-Cretaceous. The evolutions of sources and sinks of carbon as well as fluxes between carbon reservoirs have to be better constrained over long-term timescales. The impact of silicate weathering on climate has been suggested as a potential mechanism to balance the input of CO2 from volcanoes (mid-ocean ridges, arc- and plume-type volcanism) and other sources. The Late-Cainozoic global cooling has been ascribed to an increase in silicate weathering resulting from the Himalayan uplift. However, the uptake of CO2 by sedimentary burial of organic matter could have been a more efficient mechanism, because of the high denudation rate during the rise of the Himalayas. The influence of weathering of volcanic rocks may have been significantly underestimated.Volcanic eruptions are a major potential candidate for climate change on short timescales, resulting from the injection of aerosols such as SO2 in the atmosphere. However, the climatic effects of recent volcanic eruptions do not exceed several years. The influence of large flood basalts on climate remains to be better studied. The amounts of SO2 and CO2 must be known more accurately, as well as eruptivefluxes during eruptions of single lava flows. Most recently, the emission of methane resulting from the dissociation of gas hydrates has been proposed to explain an extreme warm episode in the Late Palaeocene, as well as a negative excursion of 13C. The contribution of the latter mechanism on long-term climate evolution is still unknown.Because of the complexity of both the climatic system and climate changes, there is no single factor that can explain all of the Earths climatic evolution. We must improve our understanding of climate evolution, of the climatic system, as well as the forcing factors in order to better reconstruct the history of the Earths climate."
__label__SUPPORT	"Sulfate source inventories from a Svalbard ice core record spanning the Industrial Revolution  Abstract: [1] The 800-year sulfate record from Lomonosovfonna was analyzed by a novel multiple linear regression algorithm that attempts to explain sulfate variability in terms of other chemical species measured in the core and sulfur emission inventories. We use three statistical approaches to determine sulfate sources. We examine trends using singular spectrum analysis with confidence intervals, finding clear evidence that anthropogenic sources are important but not dominant; we use cross-wavelet coherence to examine significant multidecadal covariance in terrestrial sulfate; but our main tool is multiple regression analysis of the sulfate dependency on other ions and anthropogenic emission inventories. Models are fitted in a moving time window of typically 50 years length, explaining 80% of the sulfate variance. A suite of model predictors are examined, and the variation in relative magnitudes of the model coefficients along the core can be used to infer variations in the strength of various sulfate sources. We observe large changes in sulfate sources at the end of the Little Ice Age associated with changes in Barents Sea marine productivity, changes in North Atlantic sulfate input and a long-lasting period of disturbance caused by the large Laki volcanic eruption. Modeling sulfur emission inventories shows that western Europe contributes about 15% of the sulfate budget, with essentially no input from other regions, in contrast with predictions from global circulation models incorporating sulfur chemistry. Multidecadal cycles are mainly confined to the Little Ice Age and most likely associated with increased storminess and enhanced deposition of both marine aerosol and biogenic sulfate from the Atlantic Ocean. The model residuals do not show a normal distribution but display very large spikes. Unexpectedly, those significant at the 99% level can be closely matched to major volcanic eruptions using independent dating methods. The 20th century sulfate in the core is inventoried as sea salt (15%), terrestrial (10%), volcanic (510%), western European anthropogenic (1025%), Barents Sea biogenic (2040%), and Atlantic biogenic (1015%). 5. Summary and Conclusions: [36] Multiple linear regression modeling of the sulfate profile unexpectedly showed that the best predictors were nitrate and magnesium. These seem to represent acid and neutral components of sulfate, most likely because acids are colocated in the ice and magnesium is sourced from both sea salt and terrestrial sources. Moore et al. [2005a] show that postdepositional percolation is the primary agent for determining the location of species in the ice core, on shortdistance scales corresponding to a few annual layers of accumulation. Therefore it is most likely that it is postdepositional coelution of ions that results in the relationships seen in the MLR models. For this reason we need to useaNote the Laki 1783 signal was removed before modeling. bKekonen et al. [2005]. cPohjola et al. [2002b]. dSiebert and Simkin [20022005]. VEI is the volcanic explosivity index.D15307 MOORE ET AL.: SULFATE SOURCES IN A SVALBARD ICE CORE10 of 13D15307many more models than just the best fitting MLR model to understand the sulfate budget in the ice core. The expected predictors, salt, MSA, calcium are useful conceptually as we know that they are representative of particular sources. [37] Percolation longer than the smoothing window would simply introduce a smoothing to the MLR model residuals, but we do not see such an effect. A residual peak is about the length of the smoothing window (except deep in the core, such as the 1259 event), as would be expected of volcanic events affected by slow diffusion processes. This is good evidence that the assumptions made concerning the degree of smoothing due to percolation are sufficiently conservative. In effect we have verified a preservation model that suggests that the net effect of dating and percolation smoothing of the ion records is a limiting resolution of 3 years. Therefore there is no advantage is to be gained in fitting the ice core record to external emission inventories by using a percolation correcting model to recover the original ion concentrations. [38] Sea-salt sulfate amounts to about 18% of the mean post-1918 sulfate budget of about 280 ppb or 5.8 meq L 1. Calcium is almost entirely of non-sea-salt origin in the Lomonosovfonna core, and model 3 in Table 1 suggests that it contributes about 10% of the sulfate budget. Kekonen et al. [2005a] show that the dominant 2530-year band covariation of calcium with sulfate has an amplitude of about 1 meq L 1 (about 50 ppb of SO42 ), suggesting that the terrestrial input is largely modulated by this periodicity. So a terrestrial source of sulfate primarily deposited with calcium contributes on average about 10% of the post-1918 sulfate budget. Long-period (multidecadal) cycles were relatively strong during the LIA, but apparently related only to the magnesium predictor of sulfate, not with the nitrate predictor. This can be explained by increased storminess and wind speeds in the LIA bringing both sea-salt aerosol and Atlantic biogenic sulfate to the ice cap. [39] MSA as a predictor of sulfate is most likely due to both having a common DMS source. This must be mostly local as the dramatic change in the MSA ion profiles at the end of LIA was very likely caused by the sea ice edge moving north. However, biogenic acidic sulfate coming from production in the Atlantic may also be carried to Lomonosovfonna with storms [Hara et al., 1997]. This is a viable mechanism as biogenic production in the Atlantic starts much earlier in the spring, close to the peak storm season, and is much greater than in the Barents Sea [Lancelot and Wassmann, 1994]. From Figure 4c it can be seen that the coefficient of MSA increases dramatically at the end of the LIA. The fraction of sulfate coming from Barents Sea DMS emission should be given by the proportion of sulfate predicted by MSA in an appropriate MLRmodel. Table 1, model 5 is one such model where we interpret the MSA contribution to represent local Barents Sea production, magnesium represents the sea salt, terrestrial and Atlantic acid contribution, while anthropogenic and other acidic sources are represented by western European emissions and nitrate. The nitrate coefficient is not significant in the model, but we include it as we wish to show that even allowing all plausible acidic components, magnesium still overrepresents sulfate. Magnesium accounts for 40% of sulfate, of which 1520% is from sea salt and 10% from terrestrial sources, leaving 1015% as the Atlantic biogenic sulfate contribution. MSA represents about 30%, similar modeling of the LIA shows only 20% sulfate from MSA. The much reduced concentrations of MSA in post-LIA ice imply that the MSA/nss SO42branching ratio has changed by a much larger amount: to favor H2SO4 production over MSA. [40] Anthropogenic sulfate seems to account for about 15% of the total sulfate since 1918 and appears to have a western European source. Local sources, eastern Europe, and North America make no significant contribution. GotoAzuma and Koerner [2001], compare a sulfate record extending to the 1930s from Snfonnafjella in Svalbard with sulfur emissions from Eurasia and North America, qualitatively finding emissions from Eurasia match the trend in SO42 better than those from North America. This is consistent with our findings, though as we have separated the western and eastern European contributions we see no good fits between eastern sources and SO42 either in trends or in detailed three-point sample analysis. This is unexpected from GCMs incorporating sulfur chemical process [Christensen, 1997] and may possibly be explained by the altitude of Lomonosovfonna; though it is relatively low, it is above the inversion layer in contrast with all the monitoring stations collecting sulfur aerosol. [41] Thus summing up the various lines of evidence, the typical 20th century sulfate budget appears to be composed as in Table 3. Probably the weakest estimate is for the Atlantic biogenic contribution which is based on inferences from the excess magnesium contribution. Best guesses for the other contributions would be sea salt: 18% (mean seawater ratio); western European emissions: 18% (Table 1, model 3); terrestrial dust: 10% (decadal covariability); Barents sea biogenic: 30% (arguments above); volcanic + measurement error: 15% (MLR variance accounted for), which sums to 91%. This leaves about 10% unexplained which is consistent with the estimate for Atlantic biogenic activity in Table 3. [42] One surprising finding is the enormously long-lasting impact of the Laki volcanic event. Kekonen et al. [2005b] show that the signal affects temperatures for several yearsD15307 MOORE ET AL.: SULFATE SOURCES IN A SVALBARD ICE CORE11 of 13D15307after the sulfate deposition itself, but here we remove that signal prior to any modeling. We observe that the impact is clearly felt for some time after the event by the sudden switch from magnesium to nitrate as most important predictor, the only similar switch occurring at the end of the LIA (Figure 4b). Further, the volcanic interpretation in Table 2 suggests that the accumulation rate was anomalously low in the period around Laki. So either the Laki eruption occurred during an anomalous period, or that its influence was more pervasive in the chemistry of the atmosphere and possibly the circulation patterns of both oceans and atmosphere than previously realized. [43] It seems clear that the largest volcanic eruption signals originate in Iceland or the Far East: We see no conclusive signals from North America. This contrasts with signals seen in Greenland where transport paths over the pole from Alaska seem much more common than for Svalbard. Despite this natural pollution pathway, we see no evidence for eastern European or Asian anthropogenic sulfur, perhaps because those are low-altitude signals rather than the large volcanic events that inject sulfur to the high troposphere or stratosphere.[44] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"WHAT CAN PRESENT CLIMATE MODELS TELL US ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?  Abstract: Climate models are evaluated in terms of their ability to describe the past climatic changes. Past climatic trends are inferred from fitting a truncated Taylor series to the observational record and an ensemble of downscaled results from climate models. Analytical expressions are derived for the warming rates associated with long-term temperature trends using simple calculus. Different trend models are compared, and a third-order polynomial gives the best description of the past winter warming over southwestern Scandinavia. The coefficients from the regression analysis are used in an objective comparison of the past climatic evolution in the models and the observations. Comparisons between the temperature trends from observations and the output from an ensemble of various climate models suggest that single climate model scenarios do not provide a reliable description of the climatic evolution. Ensembles of state-of-the-art climate models, on the other hand, capture the main features of the past climatic evolution. However, there has been an interval with pronounced local winter warming over Scandinavia in the past, which is not reproduced by the majority of climate models. It is difficult to say whether this accelerated warming event was part of natural decadal variations or induced by external factors. The climate models may not yet be able to predict similar local episodes for the future if they are related to events unaccounted for, such as solar activity or volcanism. 4. Discussion and Conclusion: The use of polynomials to describe the temporal evolution has been examined and the advantage over a linear trend approximation and low-pass-filtering has been demonstrated. Linear trend models do not describe slow variations in the warming rate and do not capture features such as the rapid warming at the beginning of the 20th century, the cooling between the 1940s and 1960s, and the most recent period of accelerated warming. If climate models are used to make scenarios for the next 3050 years, it is important to know whether they may describe such variations in the climatic trends. It is argued here that low-pass-filtering is not as useful as the polynomial fit approach in terms of trend studies. The regressional approach, allows a simple estimation of confidence intervals, compresses the trend information down to 5 numbers, and facilitates an objective comparison between the observed trends and the trends derived from climate models.Trend-fits based on regression to polynomials may give unstable results and may be strongly affected by pronounced interannual variability or outliers near the ends of the records. It is therefore important to use this method with caution. It is important to stress that polynomial trends models are inappropriate for extrapolation outside the calibration interval. It is often useful to compare trends derived using different models or with low-pass-filtered records.The solutions tend to exhibit a tightening near the middle of the interval since the solutions are constructed for the interval x [1, 1] and the spread at x = 0 is only affected by the uncertainties in the c0 (intercept) or the c1 (linear trend) estimates.An important observation is that single climate model scenarios do not give a reliable description of the warming, in accord with the conclusions of Benestad (2001a) . A multi-model ensemble, on the other hand, may give a good description of the past climatic trends. If future emissions follow the IS92a scenario from the IPCC and the climate models give an equally reliable description for the future as for the past, then future temperature scenarios derived from these models are highly realistic. It is important to keep in mind, however, that there is no guarantee that the future temperature trends will be within the multi-model ensemble range (Allen et al., 2000). This issue is important for the question of how to construct an ensemble.On the one hand, an ensemble could consist of extreme climate models which predict an unrealistically wide range (say [,]) of values which is bound to span the future values. Such unrealistic ensembles, however, are not useful. An ensemble may, on the other hand, include only similar models which give a very small spread, but there is greater risk for a very narrow range not to span the future. There is clearly a trade-off between the sharpness (usefulness) and the reliability. The spread in the multi-model ensemble may come from different spin-up histories and initialisation (Benestad, 2000), different model formulation, different model resolution and internal variability. It is also important to realize that different choices of downscaling strategy may result in different results (Huth, 2002; Hellstrom et al., 2001; Benestad, 2001b).On a regional and local scale, there have been variations in the warming trends with time scales of similar order as the future climate change scenario time horizon (3050 years) that have only been reproduced by one of the most extreme climate models. The rapid winter warming in Scandinavia before 1930 may well be due to internal or natural variability. If the early 20th century warming was a result of internal variability, then the multi-model ensemble size of 14 probably is too small to give a reliable description of the winter warming trends. This warming may also be related to a rapid global warming before 19401950, which is difficult to explain in terms of the enhanced greenhouse effect alone (the concentrations were still low then), and it has been speculated about whether changes in the sun may have been responsible for most of this warming (Parker, 2000). If the early 20th century warming was related to solar activity, then the climate models used in this study are not expected to reproduce the rapid warming, since they do not account for changes in the sun. One burning question is then: why would changes in solar activity only affect the winter temperature in Scandinavia? If changes in the sun, volcanism or unresolved oceanic processes contribute to a future climate change, then the climate models may not be able to predict all of the future local warming. These results nevertheless suggest that multi-model ensembles are capable of predicting most of the local climate changes related to an enhanced greenhouse effect. Singlemodel scenarios (the individual parabolas in Figure 6), on the other hand, are far less reliable."
__label__UNRELATED	"Review of erosion dynamics along the major N-S climatic gradient in Chile and perspectives  Abstract: Chile is an elongated country, running in a north-south direction for more than 30 along a subduction zone. Its climate is progressively wetter and colder from north to south. This particular geography has been used positively by a growing number of studies to better understand the relationships between erosion processes and climate, land use, slope, tectonics, volcanism, etc. Here we review the erosion rates, factors, and dynamics over millennial to daily periods reported in the literature. In addition, 21 new catchment mean erosion rates (suspended sediment and 10Be) are provided, and previous suspended sediment-derived erosion rates are updated. A total of 485 local and catchment mean erosion rates are reported. Erosion rates vary between some of the smallest values on earth (105 mm/a) to moderate values 0.5 mm/a compared to other active ranges. This review highlights strong limitations concerning the quantification of local erosion factors because of uncertainties in sampling point location, slope and rainfall data. For the mean erosion rates E for the millennial and decennial catchments, a model of the form E S/[1 (S/0.6)2]R with a = [0.3, 0.8] accounts for 40 to 70% of the erosion variance, confirming a primary role of slope S compared to precipitation rate R over this time scale. Over the long-term, this review points to the long (5 to >10 Ma) response time of rivers to surface uplift in north-central arid Chile. Over millennia, data provide evidence for the progressive contribution of extreme erosion events to millennial averages for drier climates, as well as the link between glacier erosion and glacier sliding velocity. In this period of time, a discrepancy exists between the long-term offshore sedimentological record and continental decennial or millennial erosion data, for which no single explanation appears. Still, little information is available concerning the magnitude of variation of millennial erosion rates. Over centuries, data show the variable role of groundwater in the dynamics of suspended load and document a decrease in erosion over hundreds of years, probably associated with historical harvesting. 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: Erosion studies in Chile have provided benchmarks for erosion rate values in different climatic and slope environments and over different time scales. These values are mainly <0.5 mm/a or <500 m/Ma or <1300 t/km2/a, except catchment erosion rates 1 mm/a inferred from 10Be in riverine pebbles, and extreme glacier abrasion erosion rates in the Chilean Tierra del Fuego 100 mm/a. These erosion rates are moderate compared to other active ranges. In addition to the arid climate of northern Chile, these lower erosion rates may be mainly explained by the transient nature of erosion in this part of the Andes.Over the Neogene and in the arid part of Chile, river incision rates averaged over periods of several Ma vary between 0.05 and 0.5 mm/a, in association with a tectonic surface uplift and knickpoint retreat. In the semiarid area, long-term and millennial catchment erosion rates are similar. Nevertheless, the presence of encased Neogene low relief surfaces in Andean catchments suggest that erosion may have varied over the Neogene, but the magnitude of these variations is unknown. To the south of 33S, the southward increase in sediment volume trapped in the subduction trench suggests larger erosion rates than the decennial and millennial erosion rates. Nevertheless, the magnitude of erosion variations over Ma has not been quantified. Available data suggest that the response time of catchment erosion is >10 Ma for arid catchments in the north and 510 Ma for the catchment in central Chile near 33S. Lower response times are expected more to the south under wetter climates; however, quantitative estimates are needed. A global analysis of thermochronological data in terms of denudation history would most likely provide quantitative information.Millennial catchment erosion rates are progressively higher than decennial erosion rates toward a more arid climate between 35 and 27S. This difference is linked to the increased variability in erosion toward the arid north, where millennial erosion is increasingly dominated by rare and heavy storms, in particular during El Nino periods. In arid areas, the difference between decennial and millennial catchment erosion rates can reach one order of magnitude. In Patagonia, the removal of volcanic ashes and glacier erosion may have generated extreme variations in erosion rates over periods of years to millennia. Where the sliding velocity of glaciers is high, the catchment mean erosion during glacial periods may have been 200 times larger than during the Holocene.The impact of harvesting and land use in southern Chile is complex and depends on the time scales. Over centuries, intense deforestation in the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in the temperate to humid region of BioBio (3637S) seems to have stripped erodible soils, leading to the decrease in the catchment mean erosion rate. This decrease in erosion over hundreds of years is consistent with studies showing an increase in soil erosion during high precipitation events in the weeks and months after clearcutting. Nevertheless, high frequency erosion monitoring reveals that clearcutting may increase infiltration and decrease erosion for moderate rainfall.A reanalysis of the decennial and millennial catchment mean erosion rates confirms that erosion depends less-than-linearly on the mean annual precipitation and that slope exerts the main control. The variability in a large number of available local erosion rates (n = 330) is much larger than that of the catchment mean erosion. This variability seems to decrease toward wetter climates. As a result, this variability may be a rich source of information for improving local erosion models. Nevertheless, the lack of a precise local slope measurement except in rare cases and rainfall as well as uncertainties in the sampling point coordinates limit the analysis of local erosion factors from the global database. Paradoxically, no decennial or millennial erosion rate data are available in the wettest places of Chile (4150S).Quantifying the role of other erosion factors remains difficult. The incomplete seismological and landslide catalogues prevent the quantification of the contribution of seismicity to erosion rates along the Chilean climatic gradient. The strong correlation between green vegetation and rainfall limits our ability to independently study these two erosion factors. Similarly, the correlation between catchment mean slope and proportion of granitoids makes the lithological control difficult to quantify.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https:// doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.10.016."
__label__UNRELATED	"The longest voyage: Tectonic, magmatic, and paleoclimatic evolution of the Indian plate during its northward flight from Gondwana to Asia Introduction: The tectonic evolution of the Indian plate from its original location in the Gondwana supercontinent during Permian through Middle Jurassic time, its sequential separation from other Gondwana continents, its continual fragmentation, its northwardmotion as an island continent, and its successive collisions, first with the KohistanLadakh Arc and then with Asia, represents one of the longest journeys of all continents, about 9000 km in 160 million years (Dietz and Holden, 1970; Chatterjee, 1992; Chatterjee and Scotese, 1999, 2010). India has had one of the most complicated tectonic histories of all of the Gondwana continents. This tectonic history was shaped by complex breakup and dispersal events, and modified by flood basal volcanism and collision events. The rifting events of the Indian plate can be reconstructed from the magnetic anomalies of the Indian Ocean floor. The Indian Ocean is one of the most diverse oceans on the face of the globe, both in relief and origin of seafloor features, and contains every type of plate boundary. The origin and evolution of the Indian Ocean is the result of the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent from Early Jurassic onwards (~167 Ma), and by the northward movement of the Indian plate, which began colliding with 11. Conclusion: The tectonic evolution of the Indian plate, which represents one of the most remarkable journeys of all the continents (about 9000 km in 160 million years), is largely the story of the breakup of Gondwana through time and its subsequent collision with the KohistanLadakh Arc and Asia. The tectonic history of India plays a central role in the dispersal of Gondwana. Though complex, this story can now be told using evidence from linear magnetic anomalies, paleomagnetism and hot spot tracks. Information from different fields of continental geology and deep sea drilling also provide useful information to constrain India's journey. Both the eastern andwestern coasts of India arelimate is dominated by monsoon. Monsoons blow from the land toward sea in winter, re from the Indian Ocean and bring heavy rains from June to September. (B) During the re is high because the Himalaya forms a barrier that prevents cold air from passing intorifted margins, characterized by sub-aerial volcanic rocks. The age of flood basalts along the continental rift margins help to constrain the timing of major tectonic events.The present day configuration of passive margins of the Indian peninsula is the consequence of seven episodes of continental flood volcanism and sequential rifting events since the Jurassic. By reviewing spatial association of flood basalts, mantle plumes, and rifting events of the Indian plate through time and space and reconstructing the thermal history of the evolving continental margins, these events can be summarized as:a) Separation of East Gondwana from West Gondwana during Middle Jurassic time (KarooFerrar flood basalts, Bouvet plume, 182 Ma), b) India separated fromAntarcticaAustralia during the Late Cretaceous (KerguelenRajmahal basalts, Kerguelen plume, 118 Ma), c) India separated from Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous (MorondavaSt. May basalts, Marion plume, 88 Ma), d) An island arc, the KohistanLadakh Arc, formed on the northern side of the Indothethys and became trapped between India and Asia. This allowed for two stages of deformation. The first consisted of a collision of the arc with India, followed by the collision with Asia. India rapidly drifted northward as an island continent across the Indotethys and collided with the KohistanLadakh arc in Late Cretaceous (~85 Ma), e) The eruption of the Deccan traps as the Reunion plume breaches the lithosphere (65 Ma),f) The breakup of the western margin of the Indian subcontinent continued in the Late Cretaceous as the Seychelles separated from Laxmi Ridge and the western Indian margin (7065 Ma), g) Eohimalayanphase: IndiaAsia collision began in Early Eocene along the ShyokTsangpo Suture Zone, which later transferred to the IndusTsangpo Suture Zone with the closure of the Neotethys (~50 Ma). h) Neohimalayan phase: the architecture of the HimalayanTibetan orogen is dominated by deformational structures developed in the Neogene Period (b23 Ma), dominated by the channel flow extrusion of the higher Himalaya with the onset of Asian monsoon. IndiaAsia collision and intracontinental deformation resulted in large crustal shortening and uplift of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau above the snow line that might have triggered the Pleistocene glaciation in Northern Hemisphere.During its tectonic evolution from Gondwana to Asia, India became smaller and smaller, trimming its rifted continental margins, and leaving behind several continental terrances such as Madagascar, Seychelles, and Laxmi Ridge, stranded in oceanic crust as India drifted away from Africa opening the Indian Ocean. With the complete subduction of Neotethys at the ShyokTsangpo Suture, the northern one-third part of the Indian plate was subducted beneath Asia during the initial phases of collision (50 Ma), and now lies buried beneath the Tibetan Plateau.Starting northward at a rate of 35 cm/year during the Mesozoic, the Indian plate attained a sudden acceleration of 20 cm/year from Late Cretaceous (~67 Ma) at the KT boundary, which has been a major tectonic puzzle. This accelerated northward migration of the Indian plate during the Late CretaceousEarly Eocene makes India unique among the fragments of Gondwana. India slowed down considerably 5 cm/year at Early Eocene (~50 Ma) during its convergence with Asia and the closure of the Neotethys. IndiaAsia collision is marked by indentation, channel flow extrusion of Higher Himalaya, rotational underthrusting, and oroclinal bending of the Himalaya. With the rise of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, the onset of the Asian monsoon began dramatically, changing the climatic regime of Asia. During its long northward journey, the climatic and biotic regime of the Indian plate changed gradually with the onset of monsoon and Pleistocene glaciation during the Neohimalayan phase."
__label__UNRELATED	"Spatial and temporal geochemical variability in lacustrine sedimentation in the East African Rift System: Evidence from the Kenya Rift and regional analyses  Abstract: Many previous studies on lacustrine basins in the East African Rift System have directed their attention to climatic controls on contemporary sedimentation or climate change as part of palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. In contrast, this research focuses on the impact of tectonism and volcanism on rift deposition and develops models that help to explain their roles and relative importance. The study focuses on the spatial and temporal variability in bulk sediment geochemistry from a diverse range of modern and ancient rift sediments through an analysis of 519 samples and 50 major and trace elements. The basins examined variously include, or have contained, wetlands and/or shallow to deep, fresh to hypersaline lakes. Substantial spatial variability is documented for Holocene to modern deposits in lakes Turkana, Baringo, Bogoria, Magadi and Malawi. Mio-Pleistocene sediments in the Central Kenya Rift and Quaternary deposits of the southern Kenya Rift illustrate temporal variability. Tectonic and volcanic controls on geochemical variability are explained in terms of: (i) primary controlling factors (faulting, subsidence, uplift, volcanism, magma evolution and antecedent lithologies and landscapes); (ii) secondary controls (bedrock types, rift shoulder and axis elevations, accommodation space, meteoric and hydrothermal fluids and mantle CO2); and (iii) response factors (catchment area size, orographic rains, rain shadows, vegetation densities, erosion and weathering rates, and spring/runoff ratios). The models developed have, in turn, important implications for palaeoenvironmental interpretation in other depositional basins. CONCLUSIONS: The East African Rift System (EARS) hosts shallow to deep and fresh to hypersaline lakes with sediments characterized by variable geochemistry. Variation plots for major elements show a clear separation of Late Quaternary sediments from the Okavango, Malawi, southern Tanganyika, Magadi, Baringo, Bogoria, Turkana and Magadi basins. There are positive correlations between Al2O3 and SiO2 in some basins, but most show an overall negative relationship. 2017 The Authors. Sedimentology 2017 International Association of Sedimentologists, Sedimentology, 65, 16971730Positive trends characterize Al2O3 versus TiO2 and Fe2O3, with weaker positive correlations for MgO, K2O and Na2O with Al2O3. These differences partly reflect the different bedrock in the various drainage basins. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots document four major element groupings, reflecting detrital sedimentation (K2O, Al2O3, TiO2, Fe2O3, P2O5 and MnO), the accumulation of lime muds (CaO and loss on ignition), the formation of silica in biogenic and hydrothermal-related deposits (diatomites, chert and opaline silica) and precipitation of sodium carbonate evaporites such as trona and nahcolite. The principal component analyses of trace elements also show distinctive clusters: (i) Sr, Y, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu and Tb; (ii) Cs, Rb, Ta, Hf and Zn; and (iii) Co, Cr, Cu and V. Separation of basins is also possible using Eu/Eu# versus Lan/Ybn space with, for example, Lake Magadi chemical sediments plotting with very high Lan/Ybn ratios. Sediment REE patterns reflect source lithologies, but depart from these patterns for some spring tufas, and modern and ancient alkaline lake sediments. Ternary plots for LaThSc and ThHf Co show distinctive trends with sediments from different basins plotting in contrasting areas. Neogene major and trace element data for the Central Kenya Rift (Kamego, Tambach, Ngorora, Lukeino, Chemeron and Kapthurin formations) show temporal variability with a transition from metamorphic sources through mixed metamorphic/basaltic terrains to phonolitic and basalt/trachyte lithologies. Quaternary temporal variability in the South Kenya Rift mainly reflects tectonic controls rather than changes in igneous rock geochemistry during rifting. In addition to widely reported climate factors, lake sediment geochemistry in the EARS is related to major primary rifting controls that include faulting, subsidence, uplift, volcanism and magmatic evolution. Long-term trends may enhance the elevation contrasts between rift margins and adjacent floors. However, varying rates of faulting and volcanic infilling may return a rift to a more subdued topography. These primary controls, in turn, influence or determine the nature of igneous rocks formed within the rift, rift shoulder uplift, axial subsidence, accommodation space, the movement of non-thermal meteoric and hydrothermal fluids, and the discharge of mantle CO2. Rifts respond to these controls through a series of response factors that include variations in catchment size and the development of orographic rains and rain shadows, withincreased aridity common along the rift axis. Other responses include changes in vegetation related to uplift and subsidence, as well as erosion and weathering rates. Variations in spring to runoff ratios may have significant implications for the dissolved, suspended and bedload inputs to lake basins. Lakes fed mainly by spring discharge are more likely to have chemical and biochemical sediments than those fed by runoff. The sedimentary record of continental rift basins is not simple to interpret, especially in volcanic rifts. The evidence from the EARS shows that the palaeoclimate record interpreted from lake sediments cannot be divorced from the tectonics and associated volcanism linked to stage of rift development, and the evolving hydrology and hydrogeology, especially over long timescales."
__label__SUPPORT	"Voluminous silicic eruptions during late Permian Emeishan igneous province and link to climate cooling Introduction: Basaltic eruptions associated with large igneous provinces (LIPs) have been widely discussed to induce climate warming via CO2 degassing or cooling by sulfur gas emission (e.g., Jolley and Widdowson, 2005; Mussard et al., 2014; Self et al., 2006, 2014; Zhang et al., 2013). However the climatic impact of LIP silicic volcanism is often overlooked even though it may constitute a substantial component of many LIPs (Bryan et al., 2002) and have a potential linkage with regional or hemispheric climate cooling via delivering sulfur gases and ash into the upper atmosphere (Scaillet and Macdonald, 2006). This is mainly because of the poor preservation of such volcanic activity due to erosion, especially for pre-Mesozoic provinces (Bryan et al., 2002). In the late Permian Emeishan volcanic province in SW China (Chung and Jahn, 1995; Fig. 1A), silicic volcanic rocks are only a very rare component (<1%) of the total exposed igneous rocks (Shellnutt and Jahn, 2010; Xu et al., 2010). Their rarity in the rock archive might * Corresponding author. E-mail address: yjhcug@126.com (J. Yang). http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.09.050 0012-821X/ 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. result from their dispersal due to the explosive nature of the silicic activity (e.g., Xu et al., 2010) and the 9. Conclusions: Silicic volcanism in LIPs has the potential to release massive volumes of volcanic gases into stratosphere and affect climate. Relative to flood basalts, silicic volcanic rocks have low preservation potential because of their preferential erosion and explosive nature, and thus their impact on environmental change is often overlooked. Estimating the original volume of silicic eruptions and the potential emissions of climate-sensitive gases (e.g., SO2) is important to fully understand the climate impact of LIP volcanism. In the Emeishan province of SW China, silicic volcanic rocks are restricted to the top of few volcanic sequences and form only a very minor component of the preserved rock record of the LIP. This volcanic province has been subject to extensive erosion after emplacement in the Late Permian as indicated by the petrological, geochemical and detrital zircon provenance analysis from the Late Permian sedimentary rocks in the adjacent basin. Modal and geochemical compositions of the derived sandstones indicate that the Emeishan source rocks include approximately 30% silicic volcanic rocks by volume. Two independent methods estimate the total volume of eroded Emeishan volcanic rocks in the Late Permian to be at 3 104 or 4.5 104 km3. Combining these estimates indicates that Emeishan silicic eruptions were at least 1 104 km3 in volume. Zircon grains within the sandstones, which are assumed to be derived from the Emeishan silicic source rocks, exhibit unimodal Late Permian ages of around 260 Ma and trace element trends that closely match zircons from Icelandic and Yellowstone rhyolitic rocks of hot-spot magmatic origins. Zircons from lower stratigraphic samples within the Shaiwa Formation have much lower Th/Nb and U/Yb ratios than those from the upper samples with Hf(t) values being positive for the lower samples and generally negative for the upper ones. These data suggest Emeishan silicic source rocks were generated by fractional crystallization of associated high-Ti basaltic magmas with decreasing crustal assimilation, consistent with studies on remnant Emeishan rhyolites and trachytes. Following experimental and theoretical calculations, the conservative estimate of 1 104 km3 basalt-derived silicic volcanism would potentially release 1 1017 g bulk sulfur. The now predominantly eroded silicic volcanic component of the Emeishan LIP therefore provided a hitherto unrecognized massive sulfur gas emission that was likely to significantly contribute to the global climate cooling at the Capitanian-Wuchiapingian transition (260 Ma). This volcano-climate effect hypothesis can be evaluated by climate proxy studies combined with high-precision dating from related sedimentary sequences."
__label__UNRELATED	"A high-resolution marine Os/Os record for the late Maastrichtian: Distinguishing the chemical fingerprints of Deccan volcanism and the KP impact event  Abstract: a Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI 96822-2225, USA b Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Uomo, dell'Ambiente e della Natura dell'Universita degli Studi Carlo Bo, Campus Scientifico, Localita Crocicchia, 61029 Urbino, Italy c Department of Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Woods Hole, MA 02543, USA d Scripps Institute of Oceanography, 9500 Gilman Drive, MC 0208, La Jolla CA 92092, USA 7. Conclusion: The osmium isotope record of the Maastrichtian has a coherent structure, characterized by two geochemically and temporally distinct declines leading up to the KPB. This pattern is seen in the four pelagic carbonate sections studied, and agrees well with previously published records. Additionally, the agreement between the subaerial carbonate section (Bottaccione) and the marine carbonate sections (DSDP and ODP Sites) demonstrates the robustness of bulk sediment osmium isotope analyses in recovering a global seawater signature. The initial decline in 187Os/188Os is coeval with an abrupt and transient warming event, an increase in atmospheric CO2, and a potential suppression of carbonate burial, and is consistent with an interpretation of Deccan volcanism as the cause of this initial decline. 187Os/188Os records may be used to constrain the onset of Deccan volcanism, but may not constrain its duration."
__label__UNRELATED	"SEAWATER STRONTIUM ISOTOPES, OCEANIC ANOXIC EVENTS, AND SEAFLOOR HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY IN THE JURASSIC AND CRETACEOUS  Abstract: There were three negative seawater strontium-isotope excursions (shifts to lower Sr/Sr values) during the Jurassic and Cretaceous that were of relatively short duration (5-13 my) and showed a relatively quick recovery to pre-excursion Sr/Sr ratios. These excursions occurred in the Pliensbachian-Toarcian (Early Jurassic), Aptian-Albian, and Cenomanian-Santonian (Early and Late Cretaceous respectively). Each excursion coincided closely in time with an Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) marked by sediments unusually rich in organic carbon. The Jurassic OAE occurred at the end of the strontium-isotope excursion, whereas the two Cretaceous OAEs occurred at the onset of the accompanying strontium-isotope excursions. The possible causes of these excursions were evaluated by successively examining the changes in the riverine strontium fluxes, riverine Sr/Sr ratios, or hydrothermal strontium fluxes required to produce each excursion. A range of seawater strontium budgets was used to encompass the uncertainties in modern and ancient cycles. To produce the excursions, we calculate that the riverine strontium fluxes would have had to decrease by 6 to 15 percent or the fluvial Sr/Sr ratios by 0.00019 to 0.00046. The uncertainties largely stem from the assumed magnitude of the hydrothermal strontium flux at the onset of each excursion. Alternatively, increases in sea-floor hydrothermal activity of 7 to 104 percent could also have produced the strontium-isotope excursions. This large range is due mostly to uncertainties in the relative flux of strontium from axial high-temperature hydrothermal systems and low-temperature off-axis systems. Only a small portion of this range stems from uncertainties in the riverine strontium terms. The possible causes of the excursions were further evaluated by examining several geologic factors that could have affected riverine strontium, including climate change, sealevel, and the eruption of flood basalts. We conclude that neither variations in riverine strontium fluxes nor in Sr/Sr ratios is the likely cause of the strontiumisotope excursions. The most probable explanation is increased rates of hydrothermal activity related to increased ocean-crust production at the mid-ocean ridges. The close correlation in time between the strontium-isotope excursions and the major Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) is compatible with a causal linkage. We propose that increased ocean-crust production led to enhanced CO2 outgassing and global warming, which in turn led to several processes that acted to make surface ocean waters more productive. However, because OAEs did not occur throughout the proposed periods of enhanced hydrothermal activity, it appears that these processes only preconditioned the oceans for the OAEs: sealevel rise may have been the final trigger. This model explains why all three OAEs did not occur at the same time relative to the onset of excess hydrothermal activity and why OAEs are not associated with every sealevel rise documented in the stratigraphic record."
__label__SUPPORT	"Effects of volcanism on tropical variability  Abstract: The effects of large tropical volcanic eruptions on Indo-Pacific tropical variability are investigated using 122 historical ensemble members from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5. Radiative forcing due to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is found to increase the likelihood of a model climatic response that projects onto both the El NinoSouthern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Large eruptions are associated with co-occurring El Nino and positive IOD events in the ensemble means that peak 612 months after the volcanic forcing peaks, marking a significant increase in the likelihood of each event occurring in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) spring/summer posteruption. There is also an ensemble mean La Nina-like response in the third SH summer posteruption, which coincides with a significant increase in the likelihood of a La Nina occurring. Taken together with the initial cooling, this La Nina-like response may increase the persistence of the cool global average surface temperature anomaly after an eruption. 4. Discussion and Conclusions: Volcanic eruptions significantly cool SAT on timescales of 13 years after an eruption, with a recovery timescale of 67 years [Hegerl, 2003; Thompson et al., 2009]. The response of the CMIP5 models to the fiveMAHER ET AL. EFFECTS OF VOLCANISM 6030largest tropical eruptions over the last century roughly agrees with these observed timescales, with the peak volcanic cooling occurring around 1.5 years.Focusing on the tropical response to the five largest tropical eruptions over the last century, we examine whether there is a robust response in Indo-Pacific variability. While we consider both SST and SSH, SST is more difficult to interpret as changes in ENSO and IOD variability are superimposed on volcanic cooling. When considering the multimodel multivolcano mean, we find that between the eruption start and peak, in the equatorial band (5N to 5S) there is a global cooling signal consistent with a large-scale volcanic cooling due to aerosols across both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After the eruption peak there is a tendency for a zonal gradient to develop in both the equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans, which strengthens into a positive IOD and El Nino-like pattern in the first SH spring/summer after the eruption.The initial zonal gradient in SST is consistent with mechanisms relating to changes in zonal gradients of albedo and mean upwelling (dynamical thermostat) [e.g., Seager et al., 1988] highlighted in McGregor and Timmermann [2011], although the spatial structure appears to be more consistent with a dynamical thermostat mechanism [see McGregor and Timmermann, 2011, Figure 8d]. This zonal gradient is intensified over the year after the eruption. The El Nino response is also consistent with the study of Meehl et al. [2008]. albeit reversed, who showed that an increase in solar radiation causes an atmospheric response similar to a La Nina event. While the SST zonal gradient and changes in SSH are similar to those occurring during an El Nino event, the signal is not seen in eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies. This result agrees well with many previous studies such as Adams et al. [2003] but was not seen by Ding et al. [2014] in the CMIP5 models; likely as they did not have enough ensemble members and only considered the SST response and not SSH. The El Nino tends to co-occur with a positive IOD signal, although rather than a warm and cool anomaly, this manifests as a change in the zonal SST gradients superimposed on large-scale volcanic cooling. When considering the individual eruptions (supporting information Figures S2S7), the response of each is largely consistent with the multimodel mean. The exception is the Agung eruption which looks quite different from the other eruptions at the time of the eruption and the first SH summer/spring after the eruption. We hypothesize that this is due to the location of the Agung eruption as it is the furthest eruption from the equator. Supporting information Figure S8 illustrates the zonal shortwave radiation response after each eruption and demonstrates that Agung is the only eruption which does not show a cross-equatorial response.In the third summer after the eruption there is a flip in the east-west Pacific gradient, with cooler SST and lower SSH in the east equatorial Pacific compared to the west. This SSH response is weaker than the El Nino like response seen directly after event, but is still statistically significant. The ongoing volcanic signal acts to enhance the Pacific cooling. The equatorial zonal wind is anomalously westward consistent with a La Nina and provides the forcing to drive the SST and SSH response. Izumo et al. [2010] find that La Nina events tend to occur approximately 14 months after a positive IOD event in the Indian Ocean, due to a collapse of the wind anomalies in the Pacific induced by a breakdown of the IOD. This mechanism could explain the occurrence of this pattern in the models approximately 14 months after the positive IOD composite. This is also consistent with the fact that La Nina events tend to follow El Nino events [e.g., Okumura and Deser, 2011]. The occurrence of a La Nina pattern at this time is consistent with a previous study of McGregor et al. [2010], who use proxy records to show that there is a significant increase in the probability of a La Nina event occurring 3 years posteruption. Again, the response of each eruption is largely consistent with the multimodel mean (supporting information Figures S2S7). The exception here, however, is the Santa Maria eruption, which does not exhibit the drop in SSH or pronounced east Pacific cooling in the third SH summer after the eruption.It is widely known that the CMIP5 models have biases in the mean state and the representation of the modes of variability [Bellenger et al., 2014; Guilyardi et al., 2012; Weller and Cai, 2013], as such the question arises as to whether these biases impact on the projection of volcanic forcing onto ENSO and the IOD. In an attempt to answer this question we assess the impact of volcanic forcing on the subset of CMIP5 identified by Kim et al. [2014] that have more realistic ENSO (indicated in supporting information Table S1). As these models have a noticeably reduced equatorial Pacific cold tongue bias when compared to the remaining models, we also expect them to have a more realistic IOD location. With this subset of models we find that while there are model biases in ENSO and IOD, our results are robust to subsampling for the least biased models.Models also have different treatments of volcanic aerosols, which may influence the ENSO/IOD evolution. To test this, we subset the models by their underlying forcing data sets. While some differences exist (probablyMAHER ET AL. EFFECTS OF VOLCANISM 6031due to the small number of models in each subset and the larger aerosol depth in the Ammann data sets) our overall conclusions are robust.We propose that a volcanic eruption causes global cooling that increases the likelihood of an El Nino-like response in the Pacific Ocean and a co-occurring positive IOD event in the Indian Ocean. There is also an increased likelihood of a La Nina pattern occurring in the third DJF posteruption (i.e., 14 months later that the peak of the El Nino), which is enhanced in the SST field due to volcanic cooling. This signal, coherent with a weak negative IOD may enhance the persistence of postvolcanic cooling seen in CMIP5 models and the global climate system."
__label__SUPPORT	"Upheavals during the Late Maastrichtian: Volcanism, climate and faunal events preceding the end-Cretaceous mass extinction Introduction: The last five million years of the Maastrichtian experienced the coldest climate of the Cretaceous interrupted by two warm periods, major sea level fluctuations and faunal turnovers ending in the CretaceousTertiary boundary (KTB also known as KPg) mass extinction (Li and Keller, 1998a,b; Li et al., 2000; Keller, 2001; Nordt et al., 2003). Planktic foraminifera responded to these environmental upheavals by dramatically reduced diversity after the late Campanianearly Maastrichtian cooling. This cooling was followed by rapid evolution and diversification reaching maximum Cretaceous diversity during the first warm period of the early lateMaastrichtian (Keller, 2001). The second warm period near the end of the Maastrichtian marks the onset of the terminal decline leading to the mass extinction (Fig. 1). South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A has excellent climate and faunal records that mirror global climate changes through the Maastrichtian and yield insights into the environmental conditions that led to the KTB mass extinction (e.g., Li and Keller, 1998a,b,c, 1999; Keller, 2001; Abramovich and Keller, 2002, 2003; Thibault and Gardin, 2006, 2007; rsity, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA. Friedrich et al., 2009; Abramovich et al., 2010). From the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian, deep ocean waters cooled from an average of 16 C to 5. Conclusions: Evaluation of high-stress planktic foraminiferal assemblages from the Indian Ocean to the Eastern Tethys and Gulf of Mexico (Texas)during the late Maastrichtian reveals two faunal upheavals during rapid climate warming, each associated with major volcanism.The early late Maastrichtian warming of 23 C in intermediate waters spans from ~69.5 to 68 Ma (upper C31r to base C30n, zones CF5CF4) and resulted in rapid evolutionary diversification in intermediate and surface waters increasing species assemblages by 43% marking the highest planktic foraminifer diversity in their history. At the same time high-stress conditions prevailed in surface and subsurface waters as marked by blooms of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria blooms and low oxygen tolerant small Heterohelix species.This evolution streak ends abruptly near the end of the warm event (top C31n)with a cluster of extinctions marking the onset of the terminal diversity decline that ends at the KTB mass extinction.The early late Maastrichtian climate warming and faunal upheaval correlate with major volcanic activity at DSDP Site 216 on Ninetyeast Ridge (Kerguelen hotspot) where volcanic sediments above basement basalt are dated ~69.5 Ma (nannofossil zone UC20a, planktic foraminiferal zones CF5CF4) and continued for about 2 million years. Deccan volcanism (phase-1) also began during this time interval although we are still uncertain about their age and duration.The latest Maastrichtian warm event in C29r (zones CF2CF1, UC20d) increased intermediate water temperatures by 34 C and resulted in extreme stress conditions marked by Guembelitria blooms, species dwarfing, reduced diversity and abundances of specialized species that ended with rapid mass extinction of nearly all species. Documentation of the mass extinction in intertrappean sediments between massive Deccan lava flows reveals Deccan volcanism phase-2 as the cause for the rapid warming and mass extinction.Global warming and high-stress conditions associated with early late and latest Maastrichtian volcanic events, are marked by Guembelitria blooms and reduced diversity and abundance of large specialized species particularly Globotruncanidae, with stress conditions at a maximum near volcanic centers and diminishing with distance. The highest stress condition (maximum Guembelitria blooms) mark maximum warming in C29r prior to the rapid mass extinction.Massive Deccan outgassing, climate warming and ocean acidification at the end of the Maastrichtian appear to be the direct causes for the mass extinction. The Chicxulub impact, now considered to predate themass extinction by ~100 kymay have contributed to this catastrophe but was not likely the cause."
__label__UNRELATED	"Ice core paleovolcanic records from the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada  Abstract: [1] We previously reported a record of regionally significant volcanic eruptions in the North Pacific using an ice core from Eclipse Icefield (St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada). The acquisition of two new ice cores from Eclipse Icefield, along with the previously available Eclipse Icefield and Mount Logan Northwest Col ice cores, allows us to extend our record of North Pacific volcanism to 550 years before present using a suite of four ice cores spanning an elevation range of 35 km. Comparison of volcanic sulfate flux records demonstrates that the results are highly reproducible, especially for the largest eruptions such as Katmai (A.D. 1912). Correlation of volcanic sulfate signals with historically documented eruptions indicates that at least one-third of the eruptions recorded in St. Elias ice cores are from Alaskan and Kamchatkan volcanoes. Although there are several moderately large (volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 4) eruptions recorded in only one core from Eclipse Icefield, the use of multiple cores provides signals in at least one core from all known VEI 4 eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka since A.D. 1829. Tephrochronological evidence from the Eclipse ice cores documents eruptions in Alaska (Westdahl, Redoubt, Trident, and Katmai), Kamchatka (Avachinsky, Kliuchevoskoi, and Ksudach), and Iceland (Hekla). Several unidentified tephra-bearing horizons, with available geochemical evidence suggesting Alaskan and Kamchatkan sources, were also found. We present a reconstruction of annual volcanic sulfate loading for the North Pacific troposphere based on our ice core data, and we provide a detailed assessment of the atmospheric and climatic effects of the Katmai eruption. 7. Conclusions: [64] We have presented records of regionally significant volcanic eruptions using a suite of three ice cores from Eclipse Icefield and one ice core from Mount Logan in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada. These cores cover variously 90, 100, 290, and 550+ years. Volcanic horizonsD08102 YALCIN ET AL.: ICE CORE VOLCANIC RECORDS18 of 21D08102were identified by statistical analysis of the ice core SO4 2 and Cl records. Comparison of results from an EOF analysis and from using non-sea-salt residuals above a robust spline demonstrates that the EOF analysis provides a more conservative estimation of volcanic SO42 for sites affected by anthropogenic SO42 deposition. However, ice core sites with no or negligible anthropogenic SO42 deposition will yield comparable results using either technique. Comparisons of volcanic SO42 flux records using linear regression demonstrate a high degree of reproducibility of the results, especially for the largest sulfur producing eruptions such as Katmai, which are also the eruptions of greatest interest in climate forcing studies. [65] Correlation of volcanic SO42 signals with eruptions documented in the historical record indicates that one-third of the eruptions recorded in St. Elias ice cores are from Alaskan and Kamchatkan volcanoes. This is a minimum proportion, because many of the unidentified signals in these records are undoubtedly also from eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka, regions where the number of historically documented eruptions decreases markedly prior to the twentieth century. Although there are several moderately large (VEI 4) eruptions recorded in only one of the three available cores from Eclipse Icefield, the use of multiple records provides signals from all known VEI 4 eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka since A.D. 1829 in at least one core. Clearly, multiple cores can provide a more complete picture of regionally significant volcanic events than is possible from any one core. The large number of eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka recorded in the St. Elias cores provides a Northern Hemisphere volcanic aerosol record complementary to the records already available from Greenland where Icelandic eruptions predominate. [66] The St. Elias ice cores record a large volcanic SO4 2 signal in the early sixteenth century that is not prominent in the eastern Arctic. Analysis of volcanic glass shards from this eruption in the Eclipse ice core suggest it could be from an undocumented eruption in the Wrangell Volcanic Field of southeast Alaska. Tephrochronological evidence from the Eclipse ice core also documents eruptions in Alaska (Redoubt, Trident, Katmai), Kamchatka (Avachinsky, Kliuchevoskoi, Ksudach), and Iceland (Hekla). Several unidentified tephra-bearing horizons, with available geochemical evidence suggesting Alaskan and Kamchatkan sources, are also found in the Eclipse ice core. Trace and rare earth element analysis of glass shards via ICP-MS could provide more robust identifications of source volcanoes, with the potential for identifying previously unrecognized volcanic eruptions, as many of the tephras older than A.D. 1900 cannot be correlated to any known eruption. [67] Using multiple ice cores from a single site, we have presented a robust reconstruction of volcanic sulfate aerosol mass loading for the North Pacific troposphere. The use of multiple cores also allows us to quantify the uncertainty in our reconstruction. Our results show that the Katmai eruption produced the largest volcanic sulfate perturbation affecting the regional troposphere in at least the last 550 years. Thirteen other events also resulted in a regional volcanic sulfate loading greater than or equal to that resulting from Tambora. The results presented here contribute to our understanding of the atmospheric and climactic effects of volcanic eruptions in the North Pacific region.[68] Acknowledgments. We thank E.

__label__UNRELATED	"Denudation history and landscape evolution of the northern East-Brazilian continental margin from apatite fission-track thermochronology  Abstract: We reconstruct the history of denudation and landscape evolution of the northern EastBrazilian continental margin using apatite fission-track thermochronology and thermal history modeling. This part of the Brazilian Atlantic margin is morphologically characterized by inland and coastal plateaus surrounding a wide low-lying inland region, the Sertaneja Depression. The apatite fission track ages and mean track lengths vary from 39 4 to 350 57 Ma and from 10.0 0.3 to 14.2 0.2 mm, respectively, implying a protracted history of spatially variable denudation since the Permian at relatively low rates (<50 m My 1). The Sertaneja Depression and inland plateaus record Permian-Early Jurassic (300e180 Ma) denudation that precedes rifting of the margin by > 60 Myrs. In contrast, the coastal regions record up to 2.5 km of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (150e120 Ma) denudation, coeval with rifting of the margin. The samples from elevated coastal regions, the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range, record cooling from temperatures above 120 C since the Late Cretaceous extending to the Cenozoic. We interpret this denudation as related to post-rift uplift of these parts of the margin, possibly resulting from compressional stresses transmitted from the Andes and/or magmatism at that time. Several samples from these areas also record accelerated Neogene (<30 Ma) cooling, which may record landscape response to a change from a tropical to a more erosive semi-arid climate during this time. The inferred denudation history is consistent with the offshore sedimentary record, but not with evolutionary scenarios inferred from the recognition of planation surfaces on the margin. The denudation history of the northeastern Brazilian margin implies a control of pre-, synand post-rift tectonic and climatic events on landscape evolution. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: From the study of the AFT, geological, and geomorphological data, it is evident that the continental margin of northeastern and eastern Brazil underwent a protracted and spatially variable history of denudation, which is only in part related to continental rifting.The AFT data and models allow us to determine the timing and relative importance of four cooling/denudation episodes: Permiane Early Jurassic denudation is recorded in the samples from the S~ao Francisco Craton and the Sertaneja Depression to thewest of the RTJ rift system, followed by a second episode of cooling in the Early Cretaceous, recorded by the samples from along the coastline, the flanks of the RTJ rift, the Conquista Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range. Samples from the Borborema Plateau, theMantiqueira Range and the adjacent areas record cooling from temperatures above 120 C since the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene, whereas Neogene cooling from temperatures ~60e70 C is recorded by a subgroup of samples from throughout the study region, in particular in the Mantiqueira Range, Borborema Plateau and coastal region. Although such a late-stage cooling event is a well-known artifact of thermal historymodeling usingAFT length data, both themodeling approach used in the study and the evidence from the offshore sedimentary record provide us with confidence in this model outcome.The timing of these various cooling and denudation events are broadly consistent with those inferred in and around the study areausing the same method by Harman et al. (1998), Turner et al. (2008), Morais Neto et al. (2009) and Japsen et al. (2012b). We associate the Permian-Early Jurassic denudation to erosion of topography that was built during the final stages of the Gondwanides orogeny, Early Cretaceous denudation to rift-shoulder erosion during the rifting and break-up of the South Atlantic, Late Cretaceous-Paleogene denudation to possible thermal-isostatic uplift and magmatic underplating of the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range, and final Neogene denudation to a transition to a more erosive semi-arid climate. Overall, the landscape evolved at a slow pace and denudation rates did not exceed ~75 m My 1 since the Mesozoic anywhere in the study area. The inferred denudation history of the margin is consistent with the sedimentary record preserved in the offshore basins. It appears, however, at odds with the inferences from geomorphologic studies based on the interpretation of regionally correlative paleo-surfaces. We interpret these upland low-relief surfaces as relict landscapes predating the Neogene transition to localized erosion of the landscape.Our results imply that the present-day elevated Diamantina Plateau and its escarpment were not formed during opening of the South Atlantic but instead developed well before the onset of rifting. Obtaining thermochronological data from the elevated plateau surface would be useful to better define the age of landscape evolution and scarp retreat of the Diamantina Plateau. In contrast, the onset of denudation of the coastal region, the Conquista and Borborema Plateaus, and the Mantiqueira Range appears to be controlled by rift-shoulder uplift, whereas the pattern of denudation suggests significant segmentation of the margin.Landscape evolution of the Brazilian continental margin is considerably more complex than predicted by simple models of continental-margin development and exhibits evidence for pre, syn- and post-rift tectonic and climatic controls. Further thermochronological studies are required to better constrain the spatial and temporal variation in the onshore denudation and the nature and rate of sediment supply to the offshore basins; future studies should also refine themodel of landscape evolution in this segment of the Brazilian continental margin. Particular emphasis should be placed on extending the dataset for the northern and eastern continental margin of Brazil to lower temperatures by the application of apatite (UeTh)/He thermochronology (e.g., Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012), combined with quantitative geomorphological tools and advanced numerical surface-process models."
__label__UNRELATED	"Radiation and extinction patterns in Permian floras from North China as indicators for environmental and climate change  Abstract: Permian continental sequences from North China contain previously unrecognized episodes of plant radiation and elevated extinction. The earliest extinction, in the Lower Shihhotse Formation (Roadian, Guadalupian), records a 45% floral species loss and is tentatively correlated with global extinctions amongst dinocephalian reptiles. Two younger extinctions are dated by correlating the Illawara Reversal and palaeomagnetic polarity sequences from Shanxi Province against global palaeomagnetic history. Missing data from the Shanxi sequence are evaluated using a novel approach estimating likely maximum and minimum sequence changes that provide age estimates for post-Illawara events in North China. The second extinction in the middle Upper Shihhotse Formation is more significant and is dated to the mid-Capitanian, with a loss of 56% of plant species coinciding with two phases of volcanism of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province in South China, previously linked to the mid-Capitanian marine mass extinction. The youngest extinction in the upper Upper Shihhotse Formation (late Capitanian to mid-Wuchapingian) is catastrophic and represents the end of range in the sequence. Changes in sedimentary facies suggest it to be related to global climatic warming and drying. Other viable causal mechanisms for the extinction episodes include plate motion and collision, global climate change, volcanism and biological competition. The Permian of the northern hemisphere is often regarded as a dry interval in Earth history, although it is now widely appreciated that extensive wetland ecosystems developed in lowland settings such as the North China block during the Cisuralian to Guadalupian Series, and in the South China block during the Guadalupian and Lopingian Series (Rees et al. 2002; Hilton & Cleal 2007; Wang 2010). The Pennsylvanian and Permian North and South China blocks have traditionally been viewed as comprising distinct phytogeographical regions bearing the Northern and Southern Cathaysian floras respectively, but episodes of floral mixing and interchange have been inferred from postCarboniferous plant occurrences and distributions (e.g. Laveine et al. 1992; Li & Wu 1996; Wang et al. 1998; Fluteau et al. 2001; Hilton & Cleal 2007). During the Pennsylvanian and Cisuralian the North China block occupied low northern palaeolatitudes and is believed to have been an island that collided with Mongolia during the Lopingian, bringing it into contact with a landmass containing representatives of the Angaran flora (Xiao et al. 2003; Cope et al. 2005). Accretion of the North and South China blocks was, in contrast, more complex, and according to Meng & Zhang (1999) involved accretion of the Qinling Terrane with the southern part of North China, and separation of South Qinling from the South China block during the Carboniferous and continuing into the Permian. The North China block and Qinling Terrane then accreted with the South China block during the Late Triassic (Metcalfe 2002). This complex tectonic framework provides controls on floral composition and phytogeography, with connection of the Northern Cathaysian floral province and the Angaran floral province during the Lopingian, mixing of the Northern and Southern Cathaysian floras during the Lopingian, and final accretion into a single phytogeographical realm in the late Triassic. In the present paper we investigate those fossil plant assemblages from the Pennsylvanian and Permian of North China that were initially documented in a now classic monographic treatment by Halle (1927) and compare them with recent studies on plants from the same stratigraphic sequence in North China (Wang 1989; Wang 2010). The floral assemblages are abundant, diverse, and were collected in a geological framework that allows their relative stratigraphic position and order to be identified within the regional sedimentary sequence. The fossil plant assemblages represent the Benxi (formerly Penxi; see Cleal & Wang 2002), Taiyuan, Shanxi (formerly Shansi), and Lower and Upper Shihhotse (formerly Shihezi) Formations that span a range of depositional environments from paralic peat-forming mires with or without marine influence, through fluvio-deltaic, and finally into fluvial and lacustrine settings (Norin 1922, 1924; He et al. 1995; Kong et al. 1996). These assemblages record changing floral composition and diversity through time and provide an unrivalled window into the floral history of North China during this stratigraphic interval. In previous investigations, the fossil plant composition from North China through this sequence has been used to identify floral assemblages and to provide insights into biostratigraphy and correlation (Shen 1995; Wang 2010), but here we conclude that the same data include previously unrecognized information on palaeoecology, community change and floristic turnover including episodes of floral radiation and extinction. However, stratigraphic control on the Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/168/2/607/4044533/607.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019 age of single assemblages within the sequence is poorly constrained and based primarily on plant megafossil stratigraphy, palynostratigraphy, and regional-scale lithostratigraphic correlation, leading us to explore other potentially viable methods of stratigraphic correlation using palaeomagnetism. Sedimentology and palaeoenvironments of North China during the Permian The Upper Palaeozoic and tentatively Lower Mesozoic sediments of Central Shanxi were divided into three series by Norin (1922) that are now reclassified as formations: the Lower and Upper Shihhotse Formations, and the overlying Shiqianfeng (formerly Shihchienfeng) Formation. An additional three formations have subsequently been recognized below this level (Shen 1995; Cleal & Wang 2002; Hilton & Cleal 2007), extending back to the Moscovian Stage of the Carboniferous (Fig. 1): the Benxi, Taiyuan and Shanxi formations. The lowermost is the Late Moscovian Benxi Formation that rests unconformably on Ordovician limestones (Cleal & Wang 2002), and contains marine limestones along with coal seams, estuarine sandstones, mudstones and shales. The Benxi Formation is overlain conformably (but probably in a diachronous manner) by the Cisuralian (AsselianSakmarian) Taiyuan Formation, which comprises black shales, coal seams, quartz sandstones and calcareous shales, intercalated with marine limestones (Kong et al. 1996; Hilton et al. 2001; Hilton & Cleal 2007). The Shanxi Formation rests conformably on the Taiyuan Formation and is of broadly similar composition but lacks the marginal marine facies and limestones of marine incursions (Shen 1995; Geng & Hilton 1999). Present evidence considers the Shanxi Formation to be of SakmarianArtinskian age within the Cisuralian, but it also may extend into the early (Shen 1995) or late Kungurian (Wang 2010), and again may be diachronous on a continental scale. The Taiyuan and Shanxi formations are interpreted to have been dominated by marginal marine to paralic swamp environments (He et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2003), with the plant communities preserved representing lowland basinal settings. The overlying Lower Shihhotse Formation and Upper Shihhotse Formation contain little coal but are rich in fossil plants. These formations, dominated by alluvial sandstones, siltstones and clays, are c. 450 m thick (Norin 1922), and constitute the main plant-bearing units of the monograph by Halle (1927). Plant-bearing facies of the Lower Shihhotse Formation are dominated by browngreen homogeneous siltstones and clays, interpreted by Norin (1922) as alluvial and fluvial sediments, the plants deposited in a lowland, basinal environment from marginal and overbank growth areas. The Upper Shihhotse Formation contains plant beds of a similar lithological nature, but with a higher proportion of yellow laminated clays, suggestive of lacustrine influence (Norin 1922, 1924). The Shiqianfeng Formation lies unconformably above the Upper Shihhotse Formation following a regional-scale hiatus (Hu et al. 1990; Wang 2010) and is characterized by red or brown claystones and sandstones containing few fossil plants that Wang (1985, 1989) interpreted as evidence of arid conditions. The lower part of this formation contains gypsum, indicating evaporitic conditions, and the upper 700 m include numerous finegrained aeolian sandstones suggestive of dry desert conditions (Norin 1922, 1924; Wang & Wang 1986; Wang & Chen 2001). Other parts of the Shiqianfeng Formation contain plant fossils that record a dramatic demise in elements of wetland vegetation towards the top of the sequence, which corresponds to the PermianTriassic boundary (Wang & Chen 2001). Liu (1990) reconstructed the palaeogeography and lithofacies of Late Palaeozoic North China (Fig. 2) with Taiyuan city (the Shanxi locality analysed in the present study), positioned at the centre of the microcontinent. During the Cisuralian, Taiyuan city bordered the marginal marine and paralic sediments of southern North China and the fluvial and alluvial sediments of the northern part of the landmass. This is consistent with the sedimentary record of the Taiyuan and Shanxi formations. During the Guadalupian, Taiyuan city is shown as a lowland basin that saw deposition of fluvial and lacustrine siltstones and shales from the surrounding upland areas. These reconstructions and the extended duration of time recorded in the Shanxi sequence point to a complex sedimentary history, in which there were a variety of environments and variable rates of deposition and erosion. The entire sequence from the Taiyuan to the Shiqianfeng Formations was interpreted by Norin (1922) to be a prograding delta, but given the length of time represented by the sequence and the range in sedimentary environments, it is likely that there were multiple episodes of deposition and erosion within a broad suite of marginal marine to fully terrestrial environments (He et al. 1995; Kong et al. 1996). Overall, we consider that the plants in the Shanxi sequence developed in three broad environmental settings: (1) a paralic sequence of interlayer terrestrial and marine rocks that record regular fluctuations in sea level and climate during the Benxi and Taiyuan formations; (2) a more terrestrial sequence with cyclic alteration of coals and shales or mudrocks in the Shanxi and Lower Shihhotse formations; (3) transition to a more terrestrial sequence of red beds, gypsum evaporites and fluvial deposits in the Upper Shihhotse Formation. This records a continuing trend toward reduced climatic variability and increasing average aridity in the equatorial and paratropical regions of Pangaea, as seen globally (e.g. Montanez et al. 2007). Although the plants from the Shanxi sequence are on the whole allochthonous (e.g. Stevens 2009; Stevens & Hilton 2009), the majority are large, well-preserved and often articulated foliage fragments that have not been transported a great distance. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the presence and distribution of plants found in the sequence would have been influenced by palaeoenvironmental changes, such as disruption caused by shifting river deltas and the low energy level and low nutrient flow typical of swamp environments. Correlation of terrestrial sequences in the Permian of North China Correlation and stratigraphy of Carboniferous and Permian terrestrial sequences in China is notoriously difficult as in most cases they lack appropriate marine species for high-resolution biostratigraphy, and also lack suitable lithologies for radiometric dating methods. Palynostratigraphy often provides good stratigraphic resolution but palynomorphs are prone to reworking in sedimentary environments, are heterogeneously deposited across facies, may not be present in some settings, and are subject to a variety of taphonomic processes including non-preservation in oxidizing environments or coarse-grained lithologies (Bateman 1991; Batten 1999). In the Carboniferous and Permian of China, the palynostratigraphy of the PennsylvanianCisuralian Benxi, Taiyuan and Shanxi sequences has been compared with interbedded marine faunal associations to develop good stratigraphic constraint (e.g. Liu et al. 2008). In contrast, stratigraphically L. G.

Fossil plant biostratigraphy offers the potential to correlate fossiliferous sequences within single basins, but on a regional scale this is more problematic and where adopted provides only a basic level of correlation (e.g. Bateman 1991; Cleal 1991). Biostratigraphy based on terrestrial plant fossils is limited by a variety of factors with different kinds of effects, including those taphonomic processes that lead to fragmentation of plant remains, floral migration and provinciality, variable preservation potential of different facies and convergence of morphological features among plant groups, making identification difficult in fragmentary preservation. However, where other methods are unavailable, palynostratigraphy and fossil plant biostratigraphy are widely Fig. 1.

For the lithostratigraphy in Shanxi Province, two stratigraphic frameworks are presented based on correlation of the palaeomagnetic data from Embleton et al. (1996), but interpreting the polarity of beds in which no data were recovered in different ways: the maximum range column infers the maximum amount of change for beds with no data from previous and successive beds, whereas conversely the minimum range column infers the minimum amount of change in beds with no data between previous and successive beds. In both maximum and minimum ranges periods of normal (black) and reversed (white) polarity are correlated with the post-Illawara Reversal global palaeomagnetic record. uUSF, upper Upper Shihhotse Formation; muUSF, middle Upper Shihhotse Formation. PERMIAN FLORAL TURNOVER IN NORTH CHINA 609 Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/168/2/607/4044533/607.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019 adopted and provide the best results when combined with geological data to form regional correlation. Wang (2010) synthesized the current understanding of the stratigraphy of the CarboniferousPermian sequences from Shanxi Province based on information recovered from marine faunal assemblages (restricted to the Benxi and Taiyuan formations), plant fossil biostratigraphy and regional correlation, summarized here in Figure 1. The correlation presented by Wang (2010) represents a broad-based synthesis of total data in North China. In our view, however, aspects of his stratigraphic conclusions must be examined critically and with caution, as he directly correlates international stage boundaries with geological formation boundaries and megafossil plant and spore assemblages (see fig. 10 of Wang (2010)). It is now imperative that radiometric and other dating methods are applied to the Permian terrestrial sequences of North China to generate a more accurate framework to study organismal and environmental change at this time. In the present study we employ existing palaeomagnetic data as a viable stratigraphic method for parts of the terrestrial sequence in Shanxi Province, and see this as an important first step in increasing the stratigraphic resolution in the terrestrial facies from this stratigraphic interval. In the Permian, the Illawara palaeomagnetic reversal marks the boundary between the reversed polarity CarboniferousPermian Kiaman Superchron and the PermianTriassic mixed polarity superzone of the Illawara Superchron (Irving & Parry 1963; Steiner 2006; Isozaki 2009). Glen et al. (2009) undertook a magnetostratigraphic study of the Permian marine and terrestrial sequences of NW China that used the Illawara Reversal for correlation purposes; however, they did not include the sedimentary sequences of Shanxi Province in North China in their treatment. By contrast, Embleton et al. (1996) identified the Illawara Reversal in the type section at Ximing near Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, and concluded that the reversal occurred during the base of the Upper Shihhotse Formation, within the Ufimian regional stage (Roadian in the latest global stratigraphy). However, Menning & Jin (1998) reinterpreted the age of the Illawara Reversal based on correlation across Asia and concluded that it was of mid-Capitanian age, whereas more recent studies, including that by Isozaki (2009), concluded that it was earliest Capitanian based on global correlation, an age that we follow here. We infer the Illawara Reversal as documented in the Shanxi Sequence, identified in Bed 73 of Embleton et al. (1996), to be a fixed stratigraphic datum of earliest Capitanian age, occurring in the middle of the lowermost member of the Upper Shihhotse Formation (Shihezi A of Embleton et al. 1996). We therefore consider the lowest part of the Upper Shihhotse Formation, occurring beneath the Illawara Reversal to be either latest Wordian or earliest Capitanian. Unfortunately, it has proven impossible to determine the exact position in the Shanxi regional sequence of Bed 73 in which Embleton et al. (1996) identified the Illawara Reversal; although they cited that the section is the type section near Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, North China, the bed numbers do not agree with any of those we have been able to find in the literature for the same formations in the same region (e.g. Norin 1922, 1924; Halle 1927: Editorial Group for Shanxi Province Stratigraphy 1979; He et al. 1995; Kong et al. 1996; Wang 2010). As Embleton et al. (1996) did not provide locations for their sampling sites, we can only locate the Illawara Reversal to the middle of the lowermost member in the formation. Placement of the Illawara Reversal in the lower part of the Upper Shihhotse Formation allows correlation of the post-Illawara Reversal magnetic sequence in Shanxi Province with the global sequence (e.g. Isozaki 2009), matching the bar-code of consecutive normal and reversed polarities from different areas. However, terrestrial sequences such as those under discussion here present a less complete picture than the marine igneous palaeomagnetic record because certain lithologies are more likely to preserve a magnetic signal than others (Tarling 1983; Dunlop & Ozdemir 1997). Furthermore, periods of erosion or nondeposition introduce intervals of missing data into the palaeomagnetic record such that terrestrial sequences are rarely complete. The Shanxi regional palaeomagnetic sequence is no exception to this and includes beds in which no data have been recovered (Embleton et al. 1996) and as such matching the palaeomagnetic bar-code cannot be achieved with absolute certainty; missing data intervals could represent range extensions of the previous and following intervals, or could include one or more additional polarity reversals. Here, the incompleteness of terrestrial sequences is apparent from coarse-grained facies, which are less likely to preserve a palaeomagnetic signal and may also represent erosional surfaces. We have therefore constructed two models for the age range of the Shanxi sequence by matching its palaeomagnetic record (Embleton et al. 1996) with the global sequence (Isozaki 2009) (Fig. 1). One model is conservative and requires the minimum change from missing data to accommodate the observed sequence, whereas the other model infers the maximum change from missing data. Specifically, for the minimum change model, where there are two beds Fig. 2. Palaeogeography and lithofacies of North China during (a) the Cisuralian Series and (b) the Guadalupian Series of the Permian. Modified from Liu (1990). L. G. STEVENS ET AL . 610 Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/168/2/607/4044533/607.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019 with the same polarity separated by a missing data interval, we assume that the missing data are of the same polarity, thus resulting in a longer interval with a single polarity. For the maximum change model, a bed with missing data that separates two intervals of the same polarity is assumed to be a reversal. In both models, where a missing interval within a bed separates normal from reversed polarities, the missing data are ignored, as they can only be interpreted to be an extension of either the normal or reversed polarities that bound this interval (the bi-state polarity does not accommodate a third state, and we assume that the missing interval would not be long enough to accommodate two or more polarity reversals). The range of the Upper Shihhotse Formation calculated using the minimum and maximum change models are shown in Figure 1. The minimum change method gives an age range for the Upper Shihhotse Formation from the latest Wordian or earliest Capitanian to the end of the Capitanian (c. 5 Ma duration), whereas the maximum change method extends the top of the formation to the middle of the Wuchiapingian (c. 10 Ma duration). In the maximum change model we note that 14 periods of normal polarity occur post-Illawara Reversal, and despite spanning a known hiatus in the Shanxi sequence, this is only two normal polarity episodes fewer than is documented in the global sequence by Isozaki (2009). Thus, this model is not an unrealistic estimate. However, we consider the minimum change method to be more appropriate for a terrestrial sequence with relatively fast depositional rates compared with marine settings from which the global palaeomagnetic scheme is constructed. The top of the overlying Shiqianfeng Group is arbitrarily correlated with the end of the Permian, with the minimum and maximum method used to determine its range as well as the length of the hiatus (shown in Fig. 1) between this and the top of the Upper Shihhotse Formation (Hu et al. 1990). It is of great significance to our discussion below of floral changes that regardless of which model is employed to constrain the duration of the Upper Shihhotse Formation, it clearly spans the time of Emeishan volcanism and the marine mass extinction in South China (dated to the mid-Capitanian on the basis of conodonts). Palaeobotanical dataset from the Pennsylvanian Permian of North China Here we investigate the plant fossils previously published by Halle (1927) and deposited in the Department of Palaeobotany at the Swedish Museum of Natural History (Stockholm) from the PennsylvanianPermian of Shanxi Province, China. This collection remains the most complete and comprehensive available for this stratigraphic interval in North China, with the collection including 128 species from 48 genera that are preserved as compressions and impressions. Specimens were collected systematically from the geological sequence and plant fossils occur in 33 Beds at six localities from the east and west sections of Taiyuan-fu in central Shanxi Province. However, the beds reported by Norin (1922) and Halle (1927) are not beds in the strict geological sense, but represent successions of beds of a similar nature that may include tens of metres of strata (Glasspool et al. 2004a). Although not from single beds, this information remains useful for subdividing formations stratigraphically and allows localized correlation between the Eastern and Western Hills sections (see Norin 1922; Halle 1927). The majority of species were identified by Halle (1927), and our reinvestigation has examined all of the materials available, and confirms identifications and provides further taxonomic consistency to the dataset. We have also incorporated results from more recently published accounts that have undertaken systematic revisions of taxa present (Glasspool et al. 2004a,b; Seyfullah & Hilton 2009; Stevens 2009; Stevens & Hilton 2009). Methods and limitations of the data Binary presenceabsence data were used to provide a detailed representation of species composition and stratigraphic range. Analysis was restricted to one organ type for each plant group to avoid counting different organs belonging to the same biological species more than once. Only species present in more than one bed were included (i.e. singletons omitted) to limit bias from atypical species occurrences (e.g. Wilf & Johnson 2004); for example, non-local species deposited by an extreme flooding event. Of the104 species counted in the Shanxi sequence, 59 were present in more than one horizon. Range-through data were used to plot stratigraphic ranges of single plant species (Fig. 3), meaning that the species turnover plot shows levels of species loss and gain in successive beds (Fig. 4). Species turnover can be used to reflect major events in floristic composition when increased diversity is taken as a measure of success and high rates of loss as an indication of stress, such as environmental disruption (e.g. Jaramillo 2002; Dimitrova et al. 2005; Dimitrova & Cleal 2007). In our species range chart (Fig. 3) Lazarus taxa (occurring intermittently in the sequence) were counted as present from their initial appearance to final disappearance from the sequence to give a broader floristic signal; that is, even if the plants were not preserved or collected, they are assumed to have been present in the surrounding area. This also means that the same taxa are never seen originating or disappearing more than once, which limits counting bias. Our species turnover plot (Fig. 4) charts the first and last stratigraphic occurrences of species. We propose that significant changes in diversity through the Shanxi sequence are origin and extinction events. Although the data represent only a local flora and may not show true origins and extinctions, this flora is from one of the best documented localities in Permian North China and our results correlate with the general trends reported from the smaller sites (Shen 1995). Further sampling and analysis at other late Permian sites in northern China would be required to prove this hypothesis. Extinctions are represented in the last beds in which the taxa occurred, so that the data in these charts correspond to the rangethrough data and the events can be observed at the same points. The average (mean) line is shown in grey and indicates the overall trend in species turnover, highlighting episodes in which the data deviate from no gain or loss. Comparison of rangethrough origination or extinction patterns with total species turnover gives a more complete picture of floristic variation, emphasizing the individual and overall contributions of taxa to the changes in diversity. For the extinction and origination levels in each bed of the Shanxi sequence, 95% binomial confidence intervals have been calculated on the diversity data. Confidence measures using sample numbers would also have been valuable but unfortunately such data were not available at the time of the study. The values were calculated as described by Buzas (1990) and Sepkoski & Koch (1995), using the formula 95% CI 14 1.96D[p(p 1)/D], where CI is the confidence interval, p is the proportion of extinctions or originations in a bed and D is the number of species present in that bed. It should be noted that as we are plotting numbers of originations, rather than proportions, we have multiplied the confidence intervals by D for each bed. As expected, low sampling numbers in some of the beds caused instability in standard deviation values, but the major origination PERMIAN FLORAL TURNOVER IN NORTH CHINA 611 Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/168/2/607/4044533/607.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019 F ig . 3 .

We believe that although sampling numbers are low, as is so often the case with data analysed from historical collections, there are several reasons why the data do show some significant results. The first is that although there is inevitable taphonomic bias, the sequence preserves plant species that are similar to those from other sites elsewhere in North China (Shen 1995; Wang 2010) and in our view are representative of the regional flora as a whole. Taphonomic bias will be evident in the older formations where a greater range of environments are sampled, resulting in a mixing of floras and time averaging in comparison with the younger floras of the Lower and Upper Shihhotse Formation, where the sediments are relatively uniform and appear to represent a narrower range of environments sampled. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the inferred palaeoenvironments also suggest that plants collected in the older part of the sequence are more likely to represent much more local floras than those from the fluvial and alluvial period in the younger formations that were transported greater distances. This is reflected in the low diversity numbers of Beds 16 (e.g. Fig. 3), but our major conclusions are drawn from diversity levels in the siltand claystone horizons in the younger formations and so the results should not be badly skewed by this bias. The sampling was also carried out over an extremely long sequence (c. 600 m in the west section) that contained many potentially fossiliferous horizons.

In kaolinite, Fe ions substitute for Al at octahedral sites. Most of these clays are dioctahedral type, show balance between net layer and interlayer charges. The interstratified illite smectite (I/S) mixed layers containing variable proportions of montmorillonite. Illite contains sheet-like, well oriented microaggregates. The parallel stacks of chlorite sheets show chlorite/smectite (C/S) mixed layers. Progressive enrichment of Fe and depletion of Al ions with the advancement of kaolinization process is observed. High order of structural and compositional maturity observed in these bole clays, indicate long hiatus between the two volcanic episodes. It is observed that the bole horizons suffered rigorous weathering, approximately 5 fold higher than the respective parent lava flows under the alternate wet and dry spells of climatic changes. Translating the production time estimates of clays associated with the 21 bole horizons, found in the eastern Deccan volcano-sedimentary succession, it is assessed that the minimum time required for their formation is approximately 7 my. Clay minerals that occur across the stratigraphic sequence show cyclic changes in the climate, favouring longer duration of volcanic activity. Late Maastrichtian Lameta beds post-date Deccan volcanism to 70 Ma or earlier to this. Considering the formation of bole clays in terms of time, it is possible that the volcanic activity started much earlier in the late Maastrichtian, and continued after 65 Ma or even later. Thus, the clay stratigraphy based estimates lend support to a prolong duration."
__label__SUPPORT	"Detailed clay mineralogy of the Triassic- Jurassic boundary section at Kendlbachgraben (Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria)  Abstract: The Triassic-Jurassic boundary (TJB) is marked by one of the five largest Phanerozoic mass extinctions. To constrain existing models for TJB events, we obtained a stratigraphically highly resolved dataset from a marine section at Kendlbachgraben, Austria. The topmost Triassic Kossen Formation contains low to medium-charged smectite and vermiculite as alteration products of mafic-ultramafic minerals. The clay minerals in the boundary mudstone are kaolinite 5 illite + muscovite >> smectite > chlorite. Predominant kaolinite suggests humid climate and abundant terrigenous input. In the lowermost Jurassic, the clay mineral pattern changes to illite + muscovite >> kaolinite >> smectite, which reflects change to less humid and more moderate climate. The topmost Kossen Formation also contains clay spherules. Their composition, shape and size indicate that they are alteration products of airborne volcanic glass droplets solidified in the air, settled in the sea and altered rapidly with negligible transport in terrestrial or marine environments. Our data are consistent with sudden climatic change at the TJB, as a result of large-scale volcanic activity of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province which produced distal airfall volcanic ash."
__label__UNRELATED	"Rifting under steamHow rift magmatism triggers methane venting from sedimentary basins  Abstract: During opening of a new ocean, magma intrudes into the surrounding sedimentary basins. Heat provided by the intrusions matures the host rock, creating metamorphic aureoles potentially releasing large amounts of hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons may migrate to the seafloor in hydrothermal vent complexes in sufficient volumes to trigger global warming, e.g., during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Mound structures at the top of buried hydrothermal vent complexes observed in seismic data off Norway were previously interpreted as sediment volcanoes, and the amount of released hydrocarbon was estimated based on this interpretation. Here, we present new geophysical and geochemical data from the Gulf of California suggesting that such mound structures could in fact be edifices constructed by the growth of black smokertype chimneys rather than sediment volcanoes. We have evidence for two buried and one active hydrothermal vent systems outside the rift axis. The active vent releases fluids of several hundred degrees Celsius containing abundant methane, mid-ocean ridge basalttype helium, and precipitating solids up to 300 m high into the water column. Our observations challenge the idea that methane is emitted slowly from rift-related vents. The association of large amounts of methane with hydrothermal fluids that enter the water column at high pressure and temperature provides an efficient mechanism to transport hydrocarbons into the water column and atmosphere, lending support to the hypothesis that rapid climate change such as during the PETM can be triggered by magmatic intrusions into organic-rich sedimentary basins. INTRODUCTION When testing climate models by hindcasts for past prominent warming events, it has become clear that significant drivers are missing (Panchuk et al., 2008; Carozza et al., 2011). Most striking, the reason for a 56 C global warming during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) remains elusive, although it has been estimated that >2000 Gt of carbon must have entered the atmosphere within a relatively short time span of a few thousand years (Dickens et al., 1995; Zachos et al., 2001). Light carbon-isotope ratios were interpreted to suggest that large amounts of biogenic carbon were released through runaway hydrate dissociation events (Kennett et al., 2000). But recent studies call this interpretation into question (Dickens, 2011; Biastoch et al., 2011). Most alternative explanations are also marred by contradictions with available data (Higgins and Schrag, 2006). This includes the hypothesis of carbon mobilization by magmatic intrusions into carbon-rich continental margin sediments during the opening of the North Atlantic (Svensen et al., 2004), because it is difficult to understand how this process could have injected large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere within a short time. THE ACTIVE HYDROTHERMAL MOUND IN THE GUAYMAS BASIN New data acquired in the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California; Fig. 1; Fig. DR1 in the GSA Data Repository1) support the tectonicmagmatic explanation for warming during the PETM. Our data show a 1050-m-wide and 100-m-high mound located above thick sediments ~1 km southeast of the northern rift axis of the Guaymas Basin that is emitting carbonrich hydrothermal fluids (Fig. 2A; Fig. DR4). 1 GSA Data Repository item 2016250, supplemental figures and references, and additional information on heat flow measurements, geochemical analysis of sediment pore water and water column samples, determination of the sedimentation rate, and further seismic information, is available online at www.geosociety .org /pubs /ft2016.htm, or on request from editing@ geosociety.org.

In the area of the mound, another chaotic and low-seismicamplitude seismic facies continues further downward to at least 2900 ms TWT or ~200250 m below seafloor. We interpret this facies as a conduit for the ascending hydrothermal fluids. At this depth, high-seismic-amplitude reflections extend southward from below the rift axis into the basin (Fig. 2A). These reflections are likely caused by magmatic intrusions which occur throughout the Guaymas Basin (Lizarralde et al., 2010), although it cannot be ruled out that some reflectors not associated with disturbed overburden may represent submarine lava flows. We observe no high-amplitude reflectors that would indicate magma emplacement within the top 200 m of sediments below the mound. The bathymetric data (Fig. 1) show the trace of a northeast-southweststriking normal fault that stretches to the mound and is dipping westward (Fig. DR2). As it strikes in the same direction as the elongate mound axis, it is probable that the shape of the mound is controlled by this fault. An ~20-m-thick chaotic seismic facies immediately below the base of the mound may indicate that hydrothermal seepage was initially occurring over a broader area and became more focused once fluid pathways had formed. The steep flanks of the mound, up to 30, suggest a high internal angle of repose of the mound-forming material. A 2.2-km-long profile of 10 heat-flow stations across the vent field and a 0.4-km-long profile of five stations along the mound consistently show heat-flow values >0.3 W/m2. The maximum heat flow on top of the mound is heterogeneous with values >10 W/m2, whereas values <3 W/m2 were measured only 100 m away from the center (Table DR1 in the Data Repository). This heatflow pattern is similar to the heat-flow distribution at sediment-free mid-ocean ridges (Rona et al., 1996). The strong lateral heat-flow variations indicate focused heat transport by hydrothermal fluids within narrow fluid pathways. Grab samples recovered from the surface of the mound close to the eastern summit show porous Fe-rich sulfides (Fig. DR3) consisting predominantly of a boxwork of pyrrhotite crystals with minor pyrite and marcasite and rare Znand Cu-sulfides (e.g., sphalerite, chalcopyrite, isocubanite). These are accompanied by a small fraction of non-sulfide minerals (e.g., carbonates, opal-A, and secondary Fe-oxyhydroxides). The mineralogy makes the samples from the northern rift axis similar to the massive sulfides recovered from the southern Guaymas Basin (Koski et al., 1985; Peter and Scott, 1988). However, they lack the abundant petroleum found in the southern rift samples. In analogy to black smoker deposits from Escanaba Trough (offshore northwest United States), the observed mineral assemblage suggests formation temperatures in the range of 270330 C (Zierenberg et al., 1993). TIMING OF HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY A 5-m-long gravity core was taken ~500 m away from the hydrothermal vent field (Fig. 3). The upper 4 m of the core consist of organic-rich, hemipelagic diatomaceous clay that is typical for most of Guaymas Basin (Von Damm et al., 1984). By contrast, the lowermost 1 m of core consists of coarse-grained hydrothermal deposits intercalated with clay lenses, suggesting that 600 m"

Sedimentary sequence and oxygen isotopic stratigraphy of high resolution in the near 200 ka of the southern SCS has been established. By the comparative analysis with GISP2's ice core, the depositional record of D/O1s events 1-21 and Heinrich's events HI-H6 in the southern SCS that reflected the quick climate change in short time scale since the last interglacial stage is revealed, which indicates that in the last 200 ka in the southern SCS and the Arctic area there was tele-connection of paleoclimate and the unstability of the Western Pacific Warm Pool. This note shows that the sedimentary layers order of this sea area classified by color identification and by oxygen isotope stratum has the very good corresponding relation. The color feature of sediment changes along with the climate and the former arranges a stagnant time of 1-1.5 ka generally. It was suggested that the paleoclimatic changes resulted in the rise and fall of sea level, the open and close of strait thoroughfare and the upwelling activity, which causes the changes of the oxidation-reduction condition of deep water along with the dynamic environment in this sea area, thus producing the different sediment features of sea bed. In addition, a volcanic ash layer, about 17 cm thick, has been found in the transition of oxygen isotope 415 stage, which is related with the Toba's volcanic eruption."
__label__UNRELATED	"Measurement of bismuth at pg g- concentrations in snow and ice samples by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry  Abstract: A technique has been developed to measure bismuth in small volumes of snow and ice at pg g-r concentrations by thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (TIMS). The analysis of Greenland snow accumulated at Summit from 1967 to 1989 and 8 ky old ice has yielded values between 0.02-0.9 pg g-r . After normalising to aluminium concentrations, enhancements in bismuth concentrations were found to correlate significantly with three volcanic events. These enhancements are consistent with high bismuth concentrations observed in emissions from volcanoes. Compared with ancient ice recent bismuth concentrations are enhanced relative to aluminium implying either increased volcanic activity in the recent times or, more likely, a contribution from anthropogenic sources. 4. Conclusions: A mass spectrometric method has been developed to measure the concentration of Bi in snow and ice at Pg g- concentrations. The method, which employs TIMS, requires small volumes of sample and has an accuracy comparable with LEAFS, however it is simple to implement and is a fortuitous by-product of lead isotope abundance measurements. The method has been used to analyse Greenland snow to test the feasibility of identifying volcanic eruption in snow and ice archives. Measurements of Bi/Al ratios in snow deposited between 1967 and 1989 show substantial enhancements in three samples which appear to correlate with the 1970 Hekla (Iceland), 1974 Fuego (Guatemala), and the 1982 El Chichon (Indonesia) eruptions.Bi from volcanic emissions was shown to representa small but significant proportion of the Bi found in 8 ky ice. Also the average bismuth concentration in snow accumulated between 1967-89 is higher than that in ancient ice probably due to anthropogenic contributions, although increased volcanic activity in recent times is a second possibility."
__label__UNRELATED	"Cuticle surfaces of fossil plants as a potential proxy for volcanic SO2 emissions: observations from the TriassicJurassic transition of East Greenland  Abstract: Flood basalt volcanism has been implicated in several episodes of mass extinctions and environmental degradation in the geological past, including at the TriassicJurassic (TrJ) transition, through global warming caused by massive outgassing of carbon dioxide. However, the patterns of biodiversity loss observed are complicated and sometimes difficult to reconcile with the effects of global warming alone. Recently, attention has turned to additional volcanic products as potential aggravating factors, in particular sulphur dioxide (SO2). SO2 acts both directly as a noxious environmental pollutant and indirectly through forming aerosols in the atmosphere, which may cause transient global dimming and cooling. Here, we present a range of morphological changes to fossil plant leaf cuticle surfaces of hundreds of Ginkgoales and Bennettitales specimens across the TrJ boundary of East Greenland. Our results indicate that morphological structures of distorted cuticles near the TrJ boundary are consistent with modern cuticle SO2-caused damage and supported by recent leaf-shape SO2 proxy results, thus identifying cuticle surface morphology as a potentially powerful proxy for SO2. Recording the timing and duration of SO2 emissions in the past may help distinguish between the driving agents responsible for mass extinction events and thus improve our understanding of the Earth System. Conclusions: The fossil cuticle analysis presented here provides strong evidence for the detrimental effects of SO2 on Ginkgoales and Bennettitales cuticle surfaces across the TrJ boundary at Astarteklft, East Greenland. When considered together with previously reported evidence for SO2-mediated leaf shape change of multiple plant taxa, the findings of this study provide compelling evidence for a major role of SO2 in the ecosystem response observed across this transition, which includes the end-Triassic mass extinction. These findings provide a means of investigating the role of SO2 in mass extinction events, something that has previously proven elusive.Acknowledgements We would like to thank Prof. Jennifer C.

__label__UNRELATED	"Regional crustal thickness and precipitation in young mountain chains  Abstract: Crustal thickness is related to climate through precipitation-induced erosion. Along the Andes, the highest mountains and thickest crust ( 70 km) occur at 25 south, a region of low precipitation. Westerly winds warm passing over the Atacama Desert; precipitation is modest in the High Andes and eastward over the Altiplano. Severe aridity, hence low erosion rates, helps to account for the elevated volcanogenic contractional arc and high, internally draining plateau in its rain shadow. Weak erosion along the northcentral arc provides scant amounts of sediment to the ChilePeru Trench, starving the subduction channel. Subcrustal removal might be expected to reduce the crustal thickness, but is not a factor at 25 south. The thickness of the gravitationally compensated continental crust cannot reflect underplating and or partial fusion of sediments, but must be caused chiefly by volcanism-plutonism and contraction. Contrasting climate typifies the terrane at 45 south where moisture-laden westerly winds encounter a cool margin, bringing abundant precipitation. The alpine landscape is of lower average elevation compared with the north-central Andes and is supported by thinner continental crust ( 35 km). Intense erosion supplies voluminous clastic debris to the offshore trench, and vast quantities are subducted. However, the southern Andean crust is only about half as thick as that at 25 south, suggesting that erosion, not subcrustal sediment accretion or anatexis, is partly responsible for the thickness of the mountain belt. The Himalayas plus Tibetan Plateau, the Sierra Nevada plus Colorado Plateau, and the Japanese Islands exhibit analogous relationships between crustal thickness and climate."
__label__UNRELATED	"EOCENE DRAINAGE EVOLUTION AND EROSION OF THE SIERRA NEVADA BATHOLITH ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA  Abstract: Detrital zircon analysis of Eocene to Oligocene fluvial sediments (auriferous gravels) in the Yuba and Feather River drainages, northern California, provides new constraints on the evolution of the paleo-drainage system, sediment provenance, and the timing of sediment deposition and erosion of the Sierra Nevada batholith. 1292 new detrital zircon U-Pb ages in 14 samples indicate a regional shift in sediment provenance, from local sources, predominantly the youngest phase of Sierra Nevada arc magmatism, to basement terranes and extra-regional sources. The majority of samples contain zircon from one of two distinct Mesozoic sources, as well as 5 to 30 percent Precambrian grains, reflecting derivation from both the Sierra Nevada batholith and basement metamorphic belts of the northern Sierra Nevada (for example, Shoo Fly Complex), as well as possible contributions from central Nevada (for example, Roberts Mountain Allochthon, western Nevada Triassic strata). Cretaceous dominated samples, primarily located in the southwestern Yuba River drainage, were sourced predominantly from 85 to 120 Ma batholithic rocks, whereas Jurassicdominated samples, primarily located further east, lack mid-Cretaceous zircon and instead reflect derivation from older Jurassic crystalline and metamorphic rocks. These Jurassicdominated samples also contain sparse Eoceneearly Oligocene zircon from 42.7 to 33.0 Ma that establish an upper bound for their depositional age and likely require some extra-regional sediment input to the fluvial system, consistent with previously published sedimentologic and stratigraphic data. Overall, sampled detrital zircon age populations show that the majority of sediment deposited within the fluvial system was supplied from local metamorphic basement and/or regional batholith sources within the ancestral Sierra Nevada, with a small component of extra-regional sediment. These results support the conclusion from stratigraphic and stable isotope paleoaltimetry studies that the Sierra Nevada had a relatively steep western gradient in the EoceneOligocene, allowing for significant paleovalley incision and regional transport of sediment from upstream. When compared with Upper Cretaceous Great Valley group sediments, samples from the southwestern Yuba River region exhibit significantly larger proportions of 85 to 100 Ma zircon, characteristic of the voluminous Tuolumne Intrusive Series of the Sierra Nevada batholith. The predominance of Late Cretaceous detritus indicates that early to middle Eocene deposition of fluvial sediments may have coincided with deep erosion of the Tuolumne Intrusive Series. Subsequently, sediment provenance shifted from Tuolumne sources in the Late Cretaceousdominated sediments to local Jurassic basement and extra-basinal sources in late Eocene Jurassicdominated sediments. This may reflect progressive canyon incision and extension of headwaters eastward, and bypass of Tuolumne Intrusive Series. The youngest single-grain detrital zircon ages are similar to the range of ages of Eocene volcanic rocks in central Nevada. The presence of these grains suggests that paleo-river headwaters extended into central Nevada by Late Eocene, and that the paleo-drainage divide must have been located in easternmost Nevada. This provides additional support for the existence of a region of high elevation across what is now Nevada by late Eocene time."

All rights reserved. single subduction zones to the global scale (e.g. Devine et al., 1984; Freundt et al., 2014; Jarrard, 2003; Pyle and Mather, 2009; Shinohara, 2013). However, an important constraint missing in these approximations has been the combined Cl and Br budgets for magmas erupted through large explosive eruptions, and their relevance for climate and atmospheric chemistry. The modern Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) is an area with one of the largest densities of active volcanoes in the world, and has produced numerous felsic tephras from highly explosive eruptions during the late Pleistocene through the Holocene. Recent volcanological studies at the CAVA have addressed the along-arc tephrostratigraphy (Kutterolf et al., 2008a, 2007), evolution of single eruptive centers (e.g. Kutterolf et al., 2011; Newhall et al., 1987; Perez et al., 2009; Peterson and Rose, 1985; Wundermann and Rose, 1984), geochemical along-arc 6. Conclusions: Our data set of Br and Cl emissions from 29 large CAVA eruptions (VEI > 5) covers the regional range of magmatic compositions for the past 200 ka. The major conclusions from this time series for explosive chlorine and bromine release along an entire arc are that:1) Melt inclusions of the Central American tephras have concentrations of 0.9 to 17.9 ppm Br and 770 to 3790 ppm Cl and are thusS.Kutterolfet al./Earth and Planetary Science Letters 429 (2015) 234246 243and respective countries of origin are give in brackets). existing with melt before eruption is determined as the ce between maximum inclusion and average matrix glass ters given in Kutterolf et al. (2013) and complement thestrongly enriched compared to their respective matrix glasses with comparatively low concentrations of 0.4 to 1.3 ppm Br and 638 to 3340 ppm Cl. The variation of melt-inclusion concentrations within a sample, i.e. the difference between maximum and minimum observed concentration expressed as a percentage of the maximum, ranges between 9 and 90% for Br and 2 to 40% for Cl. These variations result from syn-crystallization partitioning of the halogens from the melt into a co-existing fluid phase.2) Our melt-inclusion data yield fluid/melt partition coefficients of DBr = 0.321 (0.316; Kutterolf et al., 2013) and DCl = 0.0030.9 (0.0030.8; Kutterolf et al., 2013); these values are typically one order of magnitude lower compared to previous studies by Bureau et al. (2010; Br: 2375) and Webster et al. (1999; Cl: 0.96). However, these values confirm a 4 to 68 times stronger partitioning into fluid for Br than for Cl in agreement with the observed variations in Cl/Br from 136 to 2451, a much broader range than previously recognized in magmatic systems.3) The maximum Br contents and minimum Cl/Br in melt inclusions along the CAVA, the best available approximations to initial magmatic conditions, correlate well with geochemical signals inherited from subducted sediments such as Ba/Th, Ba/Nb, and Ba/La which attain maximum values at Central Nicaragua and Southern El Salvador. This suggests subducted calcareous sediments, or fluids derived from them, as a major source of the arc-magmatic bromine contents.4) Erupted halogen masses of the investigated 29 eruptions range from roughly 2 to 1100 kt Br and from 0.1 to 800 Mt Cl. If 10% of these halogens reached the stratosphere, an average CAVA eruption would add 6 ppt Br (58% of recent annual loading of the stratosphere), 5.9 ppb Cl (277% of recent annual loading), and 6.2 ppb EESC (368% of recent annual loading) to the stratosphere with probably significant effect on stratospheric ozone. The data of the entire arc presented here doubles the bromine and at least triples the chlorine and EESC loading of the Nicaraguan estimate alone (cf. Kutterolf et al., 2013; Table 1). We use magnitude-frequency relationships to estimate how often volcanic halogen emissions of a given magnitude into the stratosphere may occur along the global subduction system.We have tracked and quantified the Br transfer through the Central American arc. Our study confirms and extends the results of Kutterolf et al. (2013) regarding the impact of halogens emitted from large eruptions on the composition of the atmosphere. This study reveals that pre-eruptive partitioning into a magmatic fluid is much more efficient for bromine than for chlorine. A primary control on the bromine inventory of subduction zones appears to be exerted by the subducted components, in particular by the composition of the incoming plate sediments, potentially enhanced by serpentinite fluids. The identification of such volatile recycling processes will be of great help for refining models and budgets of subduction zone volatiles at other arc systems worldwide."
__label__SUPPORT	"End-Permian Mass Extinction in the Oceans: An Ancient Analog for the Twenty-First Century?  Abstract: The greatest loss of biodiversity in the history of animal life occurred at the end of the Permian Period (252 million years ago). This biotic catastrophe coincided with an interval of widespread ocean anoxia and the eruption of one of Earths largest continental flood basalt provinces, the Siberian Traps. Volatile release from basaltic magma and sedimentary strata during emplacement of the Siberian Traps can account for most end-Permian paleontological and geochemical observations. Climate change and, perhaps, destruction of the ozone layer can explain extinctions on land, whereas changes in ocean oxygen levels, CO2, pH, and temperature can account for extinction selectivity across marine animals. These emerging insights from geology, geochemistry, and paleobiology suggest that the end-Permian extinction may serve as an important ancient analog for twenty-first century oceans. 89 A nn u.

__label__UNRELATED	"Eight centuries of volcanic signal and climate change at Talos Dome (East Antarctica)  Abstract: [1] During the 1996 Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide-International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition traverse, two firn cores were retrieved from the Talos Dome area (East Antarctica) at elevations of 2316 m (TD, 89 m long) and 2246 m (ST556, 19 m long). Cores were dated by using seasonal variations in non-sea-salt (nss) SO4 2 concentrations coupled with the recognition of tritium marker level (19651966) and nss SO4 2 spikes due to the most important volcanic events in the past (Pinatubo 1991, Agung 1963, Krakatoa 1883, Tambora 1815, Kuwae 1452, Unknown 1259). The number of annual layers recognized in the TD and ST556 cores was 779 and 97, respectively. The dD record obtained from the TD core has been compared with other East Antarctic isotope ice core records (Dome C EPICA, South Pole, Taylor Dome). These records suggest cooler climate conditions between the middle of 16th and the beginning of 19th centuries, which might be related to the Little Ice Age (LIA) cold period. Because of the high degree of geographical variability, the strongest LIA cooling was not temporally synchronous over East Antarctica, and the analyzed records do not provide a coherent picture for East Antarctica. The accumulation rate record presented for the TD core shows a decrease during part of the LIA followed by an increment of about 11% in accumulation during the 20th century. At the ST556 site, the accumulation rate observed during the 20th century was quite stable. 6. Conclusion: [46] A record of volcanic eruptions covering the last 800 years has been reported from a 90 m firn core drilled at Talos Dome (EastAntarctica). Volcanic chronology and tritium activity provided dating of the core and allowed for reconstruction of the climate over the past 800 years on a reliable timescale. From Talos Dome isotopic record, cooler climate conditions were inferred during the 17th, 18th, and beginning of 19th centuries, which might be associated to the LIA cold period. We would like to emphasise the fact that the LIA is not present in the TD core as a long-lasting cold period. In fact, with the exception of the period from 1680 to 1820, which was a more persistent cold interval, the isotopic record shows centennial scale fluctuations with warmer and cooler spells. On this basis it is quite difficult to say whether the LIA started during the 16th century or before. When compared with other East Antarctic isotope records, some discrepancies are apparent even if the main cooling trends during the LIA are in line. Cooler, windy conditions in East Antarctica during the LIA could have increased Southern Ocean deep water formation, as suggested by Broecker et al. [1999] on the basis of physical and geochemical studies in the Southern Ocean. [47] The recent warming phase (20th century) that is recognized in some Southern Hemisphere proxy records is not so evident in our records (both TD and ST556), or if you will, it seems to start just after 1970 and occurs before 1930. [48] We presented an accumulation rate record for the TD core with a decrease during part of the LIA followed by an increment of about 11% in accumulation during the 20th century. Average increasing values are calculated among dated horizons during the 20th century at the TD site, while accumulation rate was observed to be quite stable at ST556 during the same time period. [49] The large difference in core temperature, stable isotope content, and snow accumulation between ST556 and TD pointed out a greater role of warm-air intrusions and storms close to the ice divide between Oates Coast (Southern Ocean) and the Ross Sea. [50] More and more evidence coming from ice core records, glacier extension and other proxy records are leading to the idea that the Antarctic continent or at least East Antarctica also experienced the LIA cool episode. Obviously, a large temporal and spatial variability makes comparison among different records particularly difficult. Moreover, the ice core records considered are often separated by thousands of kilometers in a continent like Antarctica which presents a complicated climate pattern nowadays as well. A better spatial coverage and more proxy from well-dated records are needed in order to better understand natural climate variability on centennial and millennial timescales (including the LIA), extending the actual spatial coverage of climate archives both in Antarctica and in the whole Southern Hemisphere. [51] Large discrepancies between the data collected and the historical data used to calculate the net surface mass balance indicate that reliable estimates of mass balance for this sector of East Antarctica cannot be made at present without new snow accumulation studies along the drainage basin. The enormous uncertainty on input parameters for mass balance is due to incompleteness and inaccuracy of old measurements (pit stratigraphy) in this sector of the ice sheet. [52] Our results pointed out that Talos Dome has a good geochemical and paleoclimate record preserved in the ice, because the accumulation (80.5 mmwe yr 1) is higher there than at other domes in East Antarctica, and the ice thickness (about 1500 m) could cover more than a glacial-interglacial period. A deep drilling at Talos Dome could improve the knowledge about the response of near-coastal sites to climate changes and Holocene histories of accumulation rates in the Ross Sea region.[53] Acknowledgments.

__label__SUPPORT	"Total sulfur dioxide emissions and preeruption vaporsaturated magma at Mount St. Helens, 198088  Abstract: SO2 from explosive volcanism can cause significant climatic and atmospheric impacts, but the source of the sulfur is controversial. TOMS, COSPEC, and ash leachate data for Mount St. Helens from the time of the climactic eruption on 18 May 1980 to the final stages of non-explosive degassing in 1988 give a total SO2 emission of 2 Mt. COSPEC data show a sharp drop in emission rate that was apparently controlled by a decreasing rate of magma supply. A total SO2 emission of only 0.08 Mt is estimated from melt inclusion data and the conventional assumption that the main sulfur source was pre-emption melt; commonly invoked sources of excess sulfur (anhydrite decomposition, basaltic magma, and degassing of non-erupted magma) are unlikely in this case. Thus melt inclusions may significantly underestimate SO2 emissions and impacts of explosive volcanism on climate and the atmosphere. Measured CO2 emissions, together with the H20 content of melt inclusions and experimental solubility data, indicate the Mount St. Helens dacite was vapor-saturated at depth prior to ascent and suggest hat a vapor phase was the main source of sulfur for the 2-Mt of SO2. A vapor source is consistent with experimental studies on the Mount St. Hetens dacite and removes the need for a much debated shallow magma body."
__label__SUPPORT	"Stratospheric loading and optical depth estimates of explosive volcanism over the last 2100 years derived from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core  Abstract: The high-resolution and lengthy records of volcanic aerosol deposition in ice cores allow assessment of the atmospheric mpact of different styles and magnitudes of past eruptions and the impact of volcanism during periods of varied climatic onditions. The 2100-year long volcanic SO42time series in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core was used to calculate the mass stratospheric loading (MD) of H2SO 4 and resulting optical depth values (XD = MD/1.5 x 10 TM g) for individual, and multiple, closely spaced eruptions. Calibration of the calculated optical depth values with other compilations panning the last 150 years provides a range of values for each eruption or set of eruptions essential to quantifying the climate forcing capabilities of each of these events. Limitations on the use of the results exist because this is only a single ice core, sampling was biannual and transport, and deposition of aerosols is not consistent among individual eruptions. The record of volcanic optical depth estimates is characterized by distinct rends within three consecutive 700-year time periods. The period from 100 B.C. to A.D. 600 is characterized by the fewest eruptions, and optical depth values are lower than those in the rest of the record. The exception is an extremely large signal of 3 years duration that is probably associated with an unknown Icelandic eruption around 53 B.C., with the possible contribution of another high-latitude ruption. The presence of another signal at 43 B.C. suggests that at least two eruptions impacted climate in the middle decade of the 1st century B.C. The period from A.D. 600 to 1300 has intermediate numbers and magnitudes of volcanic events except for the very large 1259 event. Stratospheric loading and optical depths values for the 1259 event are twice that for Tambora (A.D. 1815). The state of the climate system in the middle of the thirteenth century A.D. may not have been sensitive nough to the atmospheric perturbation of the 1259 eruption, thus the apparent lack of abundant proxy evidence of climatic cooling around A.D. 1260. The most recent 700 years (A.D. 1400-1985) are characterized by the greatest number of eruptions (half of those recorded over the 2100 years of record) and, in general, the highest stratospheric loading and optical depth values for individual and the combined effects of multiple eruptions. The large Kuwae eruption (A.D. 1450s) may have perturbe the atmosphere at least as much as Krakatau and possibly of a magnitude similar to Tambora. Multiple eruptions in the 50to 60-year periods from A.D. 1580s-1640s and A.D. 1780s-1830s may have had a significant impact on enhancing the already cool climatic conditions in those time periods, particularly around A.D. 1601 and 1641. These findings imply that multiple eruptions closely spaced in time are more likely to have a major impact on a decadal time scale when existing climatic conditions are in a more sensitive or transitional state. The GISP2 ice core record also indicates that several relatively unknown eruptions may have been large sulfur producers during the 17th and 19th centuries A.D., thereby warranting further studies of those particular events."
__label__UNRELATED	"Palaeoenvironment of Northwestern India during the late Cretaceous Deccan volcanic episode from trace-element and stable-isotope geochemistry of intertrappean ostracod shells Introduction: The transition from the Cretaceous to Tertiary periodwasmarked by extensive volcanic eruptions in peninsular India, which produced the Deccan Traps. These flood basalts presently cover about 500,000 km2 in central and western parts of peninsular India, with outlying occurrences extending as far as the southeastern coast of the subcontinent. The Deccan volcanism represents one of the largest occurrences of continentalflood basalt provinces in theworld. During the past twenty-five years or so, there has been a dramatic revival of interest in this massive volcanic activity because of its postulated links to end-Cretaceous mass extinctions. Recent high-resolution radiometric, palaeomagnetic and y, 53 University Road, Lucknow rights reserved. biostratigraphic data indicate a close time correspondence between the Deccan eruptions and the K/T boundary, pointing to a significant causative role of Deccan volcanism in the K/T mass extinctions (Archibald et al., 2010; Keller et al., 2010). The volcanic eruptions were episodic in nature and took place primarily in three phases with the earliest phase in theMaastrichtian between 67 and 68 Ma, followed by the main volcanic episode during the terminal Maastrichtian within the chron C29R, and the last during the early Palaeocene across the C29R/C29N transition (Keller et al., 2009a). Fossils occurring in sediments 5. Conclusions: Stable-isotope and trace-element determinations of ostracod shells from intertrappean sediments in India have good potential for the reconstruction of late Cretaceous palaeoenvironments. Detailed observational and geochemical analyses illustrate that preservation of ostracods is variable, although some amount of alteration does not necessarily compromise the geochemical signature. Where preservation is adequate, we have shown that meaningful palaeoenvironmental information can be derived from stable-isotope and trace-element determinations of ostracod shells. Our analyses of ostracods from one section, at Lakshmipur in Kutch, northwestern India, yielded the following information about this late Cretaceous site:(1). The late Cretaceous palaeo-lake at Lakshmipur was sourced by meteoric water, with no evidence of marine intrusion, despite likely proximity of the site to the palaeo-coastline. (2). The palaeo-lake shows signs of evaporative enrichment, in that the reconstructed water isotope values are significantly higher than those of contemporary meteoric water. This conclusion is consistent with other palaeoclimatic data for northwestern India during the late Cretaceous and suggests that the lake had a relatively long residence time and was behaving as a hydrologically-closed system. (3). The carbon-isotope values in ostracods from Lakshmipur are open to a range of possible explanations, although are consistent with a fairly productive lake with long residence time. (4). Differences in the oxygen-isotope values between different ostracod species from Lakshmipur can be explained by speciesdependent differences in offsets from oxygen-isotope equilibrium, whereas differences in carbon-isotope values are better explained by habitat preferences. (5). The actual magnitudes of the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca values for ostracods from Lakshmiupr are difficult to interpret, but the trends and the existence of covariance between the two trace-element ratios provide additional support for the conclusion that the palaeo-lake was hydrologically closed."
__label__SUPPORT	"Some aspects of the PermianTriassic boundary (PTB) and of the possible causes for the biotic crisis around this boundary  Abstract: The first appearance datum (FAD) of Hindeodus parvus is an excellent datum very close to the base of the Otoceras woodwardi Zone (priority base of the Triassic). For the first time, it allows an exact correlation of the PTB in all marine facies and faunal realms. The following features of the extinction and recovery patterns near the PTB are most important for the search for causes of the PTB biotic crisis: (1) most strongly affected were the (siliceous) plankton (radiolarians) and the warm-water benthos and nekton; (2) most of the cold-water faunas were not significantly affected; (3) the recovery of the warm-water benthos and siliceous plankton occurred only after an unusually long time (during the late Olenekian and Middle Triassic); (4) the productivity of the terrestrial plants dropped strongly and the recovery was mainly in the upper Olenekian and in the Middle Triassic; (5) several terrestrial extinction events occurred at different levels within the Upper Permian, considerable before the marine PTB; at or close to the FAD of Lystrosaurus no extinction event in the terrestrial faunas can be observed; (6) terrestrial faunal elements that survived the DzhulfianDorashamian extinctions were able to survive some months of extreme climatic conditions by hibernation-like life stages (vertebrates), or by dryand freezing-resistant eggs (conchostracans); (7) about 50% of the genera that disappeared at the PTB re-appeared in the OlenekianMiddle Triassic interval (Lazarus taxa), or in this time interval genera appeared that had undoubtedly evolved from genera that had disappeared at the PTB; and (8) the PTB is preceded by mass occurrences of marine (and continental?) fungi, and the fungal spike ends abruptly a little before the PTB. A scenario for the PTB biotic crisis is elaborated that takes into consideration: the real (not interpolated) diversity patterns of different marine and continental fossil groups, the exact correlation of bioevents in different faunal realms and facies, the strong biotic crisis in the Tethyan warm-water faunas in contrast to the much weaker biotic event in cold-water faunas, the severe DzhulfianDorashamian climate in many parts of the world caused by the continentocean configuration and by Siberian Trap volcanism, the cooling of the Boreal area by the northward drift of Pangaea that interrupted the exchange of warm-water benthos between the Tethys and western North America during the Guadalupian, the extinction event at the GuadalupianLopingian boundary that restricted most of the affected warm-water faunas to the Tethys, the importance of lower Scythian anoxia that reached an unusually shallow level, and above all the effects of the contemporaneous huge volcanic events about 250 m.y. ago on the Siberian Platform and in the eastern Tethys that caused a 36-months-lasting volcanic winter with strong cooling in low latitudes, followed by a strong global warming. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions scenario for the PTB biotic crisis: In the following, a scenario for the continental and marine biotic crisis at the PTB is presented, and those conditions before this boundary are also mentioned that prepared the setting for the PTB biotic crisis. The Permian northward drift of Pangaea brought large parts of Pangaea into the tropical subtropical belt. By this, rather severe climatic con-ditions were present on large parts of Pangaea during the Late Permian, such as aridity and strong daily and seasonal temperature differences. A part of the faunas became adapted to survive several months of very severe climate (long drought, low winter temperatures below the freezing point in areas with hot or warm summers). At the same time, northern Pangaea drifted into the Boreal realm and the Upper Permian climate there became colder. This led to the disappearance of major warm-water fossil groups in the Arctic long before the PTB, such as the fusulinids at the base of the Guadalupian. Faunal exchange of warm-water benthos between the Tethys and the western shelf of America across the northern margin of Pangaea became more difficult and was finally interrupted. As a consequence, a strong provincialism developed with different shallow, warm-water faunas on the western shelf of America and in the Tethys. A very rapid and strong regression at the Guadalupian Lopingian boundary destroyed the habitats of large shelf areas (e.g. the Delaware Basin of southwestern North America changed into a hypersaline basin). In other basins, like the Phosphoria Basin, the warmwater fauna was additionally harmed by widespread upwelling of cold bottom water during the Guadalupian. Connected regional extinctions led to the disappearance of fusulinids on the western America warm-water shelf during the lowermost Dzhulfian. As benthic warm-water faunas could no longer migrate between the Tethys and western North America through the southern margin of the Boreal sea, major groups such as the fusulinids were restricted to the Tethys and eastern Perigondwana in the upper Dzhulfian and Dorashamian.After a very warm period in the lower Dzhulfian, since the upper part of the lower Dzhulfian, the climate became periodically more severe due to the influence of the largely explosive stage of Siberian Trap volcanism. At the same time, a slight global cooling began. Warm-water faunas successively disappeared from high and medium latitudes. At the Panthalassa margin of the Boreal sea, the last representatives of the C. leveniC. subcarinata warm-water lineage disappeared at the top of the C. niuzhuanensis Zone (lower Dzhulfian). In median latitudes the disappearance of the warm-water conodonts was somewhat later, after the upper Dzhulfian C. orientalis Zone.The eruptions of the Siberian Trap became increasingly stronger during the Dorashamian. Reduced input of sunlight because of aerosols of sulphate and dust favoured the development of marine (and continental?) fungi that became very common during the late Dorashamian (fungi spike). Acid rain harmed the gymnosperm forests and other plants, but did not influence swamp floras with Lycopodiales that were adapted to acid soil. Therefore, in many parts of the world, Lycopodiales floras indicated by increasing amounts of trilete cavate spores became common and in many places dominant, whereas the amount of gymnosperms decreased in the uppermost Permian. Repeated very short periods of cooling in low latitudes connected with dust and sulphate aerosols of the Siberian Trap volcanism, led to a drop in diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and freshwater faunas well before the PTB. At first the larger terrestrial tetrapods were affected (during the Dzhulfian), later those ostracods disappeared that preferred permanently warm climate, and latest a part of the conchostracans were affected. High-latitude faunas (adapted to survive polar night) became dominant also in medium and low latitudes. By this extinction mode, in the uppermost Dorashamian a low-diversity terrestrial and freshwater fauna was present, in which forms prevailed that could survive severe climatic conditions, including short cooler periods in low-latitude areas (Lystrosaurus at the terrestrial vertebrates, Falsisca and Eueestheria among conchostracans, Darwinula among the freshwater ostracods). Forms adapted to permanently warm climate become rare (Dicynodon).Cold climate in the Boreal realm, mainly caused by the northwards drift of Pangaea that brought the present Boreal areas into Upper Permian high northern latitudes, but worsened by the huge volcanic activity of the Siberian Trap, and a regression followed by a transgression led to the establishment of the very low-diversity Boreal Otoceras fauna during the late Dorashamian. At the beginning, beside cold and cool water conodonts of the C. carinata and H. typicalis lineages, there were last representatives of those conodonts that lived in low latitudes both in warm water and in cool bottom water (C. deflecta), but they soon disappeared. Highly diverse marine warm-water faunas were in that time restricted to the Tethys, low to moderately diverse marine faunas occurred in Perigondwana.In this situation, around 250 m.y. ago, the effusion of the Siberian Trap basalts culminated over an area of at least 2.5 million km2, possibly even up to 45 million km2, and huge highly explosive eruptions of acid to intermediate volcanism occurred in the eastern Tethys or at the TethyanPanthalassa margin, likewise in the Northern Hemisphere. Huge amounts of dust and sulphate aerosols came into the atmosphere and at least in the eastern Tethys a fall-out of volcanic dust over an area of at least 2 million km2 occurred. A drastic drop in temperature occurred also in the low latitudes, which lasted about 36 month (volcanic winter). Probably two such events occurred close to the PTB, one a little before the PTB (at the base of the C. meishanensisH. latidentatus praeparvus Zone) and the other a little after the PTB (at the base of the I. isarcica Zone). The time difference between both events was short (100,000 200,000 years). Most of the extinctions occurred in this time interval.The shallow water of the Tethyan shelves, the refugium for most of the latest Permian warm-water benthos, was cooled down below the critical temperatures for reef communities and the entire warmwater benthos, but in many places the entire warmwater nekton also disappeared on the shelves. Drastically reduced input of sunlight destroyed the feed source and ultimately nearly all the skeleton-bearing plankton (Radiolaria). The climatic catastrophe was more severe in the Northern Hemisphere, where the two huge volcanic centres were situated.The cold-water Otoceras fauna of the Boreal realm was not affected by this climatic catastrophe. The temperate- to cool-water eastern Perigondwana shelf was moderately affected because the number of warm-water adapted species was lower than in the tropical Tethys, and the climatic catastrophe was not as severe as in the Northern Hemisphere. A bipolar fauna was established, as Otoceras from the Boreal realm invaded this area at the base of the Triassic. The low-diversity uppermost Dorashamian terrestrial and freshwater fauna, to a large part already adapted to shorter periods of severe climate (freezing temperatures or drought), survived to a large part (e.g. Lystrosaurus that could also live in high southern latitude areas with polar night, conchostracans with dry- and freezing-resistant eggs, Darwinula that occurred both in tropical and Boreal areas), afterthose faunal elements that were adapted to permanent warm climate had died out earlier during the Dzhulfian and Dorashamian. Only the last representatives of the latter fauna, like Dicynodon, became extinct. The opportunistic swamp flora was not much affected by a short-lasting temperature drop also in low latitudes and acid rain, but some Permian gymnosperms disappeared. Only in the eastern Tethyan humid-tropical Cathaysia province, rather abrupt distinct changes in the flora can be observed. The tropical FilicalesPteridospermophyta rain forest flora largely disappeared, and the tropical highland flora of gymnosperms survived. Therefore, the Cathaysia flora became rich in gymnosperms (sudden increase in bisaccate pollen) during the biotic crisis in connection with the volcanic dust fall-out, whereas in other floral realms the spores (especially of the Lycopodiales swamp flora) became dominant over the bisaccate pollen. The explosive eruptions of the eastern Tethyan volcanic centre were so strong that even the ozone layer was depleted. By the strong UV radiation the mass occurrences of marine (or continental?) fungi suddenly disappeared nearly completely. The drop in water temperature in the central tropical Panthalassa was not so severe that the warm-water fauna disappeared from the narrow shelves of intraoceanic insular areas, where many warm-water taxa survived.The high content of dust in the atmosphere caused strong precipitation in those Boreal areas that were previously rather dry, and in the low-latitude dry girdles. By strong freshwater input in the Boreal sea, the downward sinking of the cold heavy surface water was interrupted or became insignificant. As a consequence, the cold oxygen-rich bottom water currents towards the low latitudes became insignificant. This caused widespread oceanic anoxia that reached to an unusually shallow level and prevented the recovery of the shallow, warm-water benthos in the Tethys.After the end of the Siberian Trap volcanism within the upper Gangetian, the global warming caused by the greenhouse gases (CO2 and high amount of water vapour) was no longer counterbalanced by the volcanic dust and sulphate aerosols. This caused a strong global warming at the beginning of the Gandarian (Dienerian) that was especially strong in the high latitudes. As a consequence, there was a minor extinction event in cold-waterfaunas that had survived the PTB biotic crisis (e.g. hindeodid conodonts), but above all, the oceanic anoxia continued. Thus, the warm-water benthos that had largely survived on the narrow shelves of inner oceanic islands in the tropical Panthalassa could not return to the Tethyan shelves for more than 5 m.y. As oceanic islands are unstable biotopes, during this long time many refuges were destroyed. Thus, finally, the strongly delayed recovery led to a delayed extinction, but many taxa survived this long interval of relative isolation. After the end of the anoxia they re-appeared on the Tethyan shelves during the late Olenekian or during the Middle Triassic. The anoxia was not the reason for the biotic crisis on a global scale (but an important reason for regional extinctions), but played an important role in the global extinction because this caused an unusually long delay in recovery. The survival of the warm-water benthos on inner oceanic insular relic areas explains the high percentage of Lazarus taxa, which constitute in some groups more than 90% of the genera that disappeared close to the PTB.A good example of insular survival of warmwater faunas that died out on the continental shelves long before, was given by Stanley (1993). He reported Sinemurian reefs with Triassic corals from Cordilleran volcanic terranes, whereas on the known shelves less than 1% of the Triassic corals survived into the Jurassic. The difference from the PTB biotic crisis is the rapid recovery of the faunas at the TriassicJurassic boundary because of the absence of a long and severe anoxic event.This scenario explains nearly all details of the extinction patterns in continental and marine biotopes. Only a few details are more difficult to explain. One is the strongly delayed recovery of the siliceous plankton that only began in the upper Olenekian. A possible explanation is that nearly all skeleton-bearing Radiolaria became extinct near the PTB, and the Triassic radiolarian fauna developed new from skeleton-less or spicular radiolarians (Kozur et al., 1996a). As the recovery of the high productivity of terrestrial plants was also in the upper Olenekian, there may be additionally still some unknown environmental factors that prevented the lower and middle Scythian recovery of the marine warm-water benthos, the siliceous plankton and the terrestrial plant communities."
__label__UNRELATED	"The dawn of CAMP volcanism and its bearing on the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption  Abstract: The cause-and-effect relationship between the c. 201 Ma eruption of the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) and the end-Triassic abrupt climate change and mass extinction is at present based on controversial temporal correlations. Upper Triassic sedimentary strata underlying CAMP basalts in Morocco illustrate a clear mineralogical and geochemical fingerprint of early CAMP basaltic eruptions, namely unusually high contents of MgO (1032 wt%) and of mafic clay minerals (1184%). In the same rocks a coincident negative carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) is present, equivalent to the so-called initial negative CIE recorded worldwide shortly before the TriassicJurassic boundary. The new data show that the onset of CAMP activity preceded the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption and that the initial negative CIE is unequivocally synchronous with CAMP volcanism. The results of this study strongly support the hypothesis that the culmination of pollution of atmosphere and seawater by CAMP-derived volcanic gases was the proximate cause of the end-Triassic mass extinction.

The initial negative CIE was followed by a long-term 3.5 main negative CIE (sensu Hesselbo et al. 2002) coincident with the first appearance of Jurassic biota. A recently defined minor (2 to 3) late Rhaetian precursor negative CIE (sensu Ruhl & kurschner 2011) in organic matter preceded the initial negative CIE (Fig. 1). As suggested by several researchers, one of the trigger mechanisms of the end-Triassic mass extinction and accompanying negative CIEs may have been the release of volcanic gases (mainly CO2 and SO2) from the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) into the oceanatmosphere system (Hesselbo et al. 2002; Guex et al. 2004; Marzoli et al. 2004; Palfy et al. 2007; Deenen et al. 2010; Whiteside et al. 2010; Ruhl et al. 2011; Schaller et al. 2011; Lindstrom et al. 2012; Mander et al. 2013). The relative timing of the magmatic event and of the negative CIEs, however, remains controversial. Radioisotopic dating (e.g. Schoene et al. 2010; Marzoli et al. 2011; Blackburn et al. 2013) suggests a synchrony between CAMP and mass extinction. A new zircon UPb radioisotopic age for a CAMP intrusion (Amelal sill), which possibly fed the second volcanic unit of the Argana Basin, Morocco, is indistinguishable in age (201.564 0.23 Ma) from the calculated age of a palynological turnover; that is, the disappearance of Patinasporites densus and the fern spike, recorded in the newark Basin and considered as recording the end-Triassic extinction (Blackburn et al. 2013). Radioisotopic dating of CAMP basalts does not resolve the relative timing of the onset of CAMP volcanism and of the carbon cycle perturbation and mass extinction. In fact, previous studies recording the initial negative CIE in continental sediments fixed it at a level below the first CAMP lava flows both in north America and Morocco (Deenen et al. 2010, 2011; Whiteside et al. 2010). Geochemical and mineralogical data from the marine section of kendlbachgraben in the northern Calcareous Alps (Austria) give evidence of distal deposition of mafic volcanic material, possibly deriving from early explosive CAMP activity that is coeval with or slightly precedes the initial CIE and the mass extinction level (Palfy & zajzon 2012). However, the extinction among various marine and terrestrial fauna and flora seems to have started before the initial CIE (e.g. Wignall & Bond 2008; Lindstrom et al. 2012; Mander et al. 2013). Hence, potential cause-and-effect relationships between CAMP volcanism, the initial negative CIE, and extinction on land and in the oceans are not rigorously established, given that existing data from below-CAMP continental sedimentary successions only suggest that the initial negative CIE and extinction stratigraphically preceded the initial outpouring of CAMP basalt. To constrain the relative timing between CAMP volcanism and the perturbation of the carbon cycle and thus elucidate further the possible role of the CAMP in triggering the end-Triassic environmental disruption and, by association, the mass extinction, two continental sedimentary successions cropping out below the oldest CAMP flood basalts in the Central High Atlas (Morocco) were investigated. Combined CTOC ( 13C of total organic carbon), palynology, major and trace elements, and mineralogy of the sediments precisely constrain the sequence of end-Triassic events. Conclusions: The new C-isotope, mineralogical, elemental and palynological data from two stratigraphic sections in Morocco that crop out below the oldest CAMP basalt flow give crucial new information about the links and the relative timing between end-Triassic volcanism, carbon cycle disruption and, by inference, mass extinction.(1) The studied sections are biostratigraphically constrained to the Late Triassic owing to the presence of a distinctive norian Rhaetian sporomorph assemblage (e.g. Classopollis murphyae, Classopollis torosus, Classopollis meyeranus, Patinasporites densus).(2) Immediately below the first CAMP flood basalt an up to c. 6 negative CIE has been recorded in organic matter and can be correlated with the initial end-Triassic CIE recognized worldwide in both continental and marine sections.(3) The studied sediments are characterized by unusually high mafic clay-mineral (up to 84%) and MgO (up to 32 wt%) content with peaks at multiple levels. Given the geological history of the region, and excluding the possibility of contact metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration, the presence of these minerals is best explained by the alteration and transport of early erupted CAMP basaltic material into the Central High Atlas basins.(4) The initial negative CIE in the Central High Atlas coincides with an abrupt increase in sedimentary levels of mafic CAMP-derived minerals. This relative maximum in mafic mineral abundance could correspond in time to a distinct peak of CAMP volcanism that exposed large areas of basalt to superficial weathering.(5) The data show that CAMP volcanism was already active when the positive rebound from the precursor negative CIE and the initial negative CIE occurred. These results show that the outpouring of CAMP basalt preceded the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption and, by inference, the mass extinction.(6) This study supports the hypotheses that the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption was triggered by CAMP volcanism, and that relative long-term pollution of the atmosphere and ocean by CAMP volcanic gases, such as CO2 and SO2, could have caused a progressive loss of marine and terrestrial species culminating in the endTriassic mass extinction.We thank P.

__label__SUPPORT	"Calcareous nannofossils and Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events  Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were documented and formalised as intervals of widespread to global deposition of organic matter. The Toarcian, Early Aptian (OAE1a) and latest Cenomanian (OAE2) OAEs are truly global in nature, commonly carbonate-poor, and typically represented by organic carbon-rich black shales. In some areas, these OAEs are also characterised by abundant radiolarian-sands and silts. They are associated with negative and positive excursions in the Sr/Sr record, in addition to large global carbon-isotope anomalies in carbonate and/or organic matter, caused by a major perturbation of the global carbon budget. Increased rates of volcanism during the formation of the Ontong Java (and Manihiki) and Caribbean Plates, and the Karoo-Ferrar Traps, are believed to have caused the geological responses associated with OAE1a, OAE2, and the Toarcian OAE, respectively. Excess volcanogenic CO2 in the atmosphere most probably turned the climate into a greenhouse mode, accelerating continental weathering and increasing nutrient content in oceanic surface-waters via river run-off. Higher fertility in the global ocean was also probably triggered directly by submarine igneous events that introduced enormous quantities of biolimiting metals within hydrothermal plumes. Because Mesozoic OAEs are often represented by carbonate-poor sediments, quantitative studies of calcareous nannofossils have been applied to explore (a) the causes and effects of igneous/tectonic events and climate changes, relative to nannofloral increases and crises, as well as (b) dissolution events, and (c) diagenetic modifications. Characterization of calcareous nannofloras in OAE intervals can improve our understanding of the marine ecosystem and biological processes such as photosynthesis (biological pump) and biomineralisation (carbonate pump) that affect the organic and inorganic carbon cycle, as well as adsorption of atmospheric CO2 in the oceans. Types and rates of nannoplankton production and evolution are interpreted to trace the impact of major palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic events. In selected sections, it has been documented that calcareous nannofloras rapidly reacted to new conditions of fertility and higher pCO2 by drastically reducing calcification. As in the modern oceans, during OAEs the increase of nutrients and atmospheric CO2 induced higher abundances of nannoplankton producing small placoliths and inhibited the deep-photic zone nannoconids and schizosphaerellids. Similarly to the nannoconid crisis preceding deposition of the Early Aptian OAE1a black shales, a schizosphaerellid crisis is detected prior to the Toarcian OAE. Both OAEs are further characterised by a rapid nannofloral speciation, beginning approximately 1.5 myr before the OAE, but without extinctions. Global changes during the latest Cenomanian OAE 2 exerted different influences on calcareous nannoplankton that experienced a turnover due to most extreme environmental conditions. This event, in fact, was a time of extinctions followed by originations within calcareous 0377-8398/$ see front matter D 2004 Elsevier B.V.

__label__UNRELATED	"Why tropical island endemics are acutely susceptible to global change  Abstract: Tropical islands are species foundries, formed either as a by-product of volcanism, when previously submerged seabed is thrust upwards by tectonics, or when a peninsula is isolated by rising sea level. After colonisation, the geographical isolation and niche vacancies provide the competitive impetus for an evolutionary radiation of distinct speciesisland endemics. Yet the very attributes which promote speciation in evolutionary time also leave island endemics highly vulnerable to recent and rapid impacts by modern people. Indeed, the majority of documented human-driven extinctions have been exacted upon island endemics. The causes include over-exploitation, invasive species brought by people and destruction of islands naturally constrained habitats. Imminent threats include inundation by rising sea levels and other adaptive pressures related to anthropogenic global warming. We review recent work which underscores the susceptibility of island endemics to the drivers of global change, and suggest a methodological framework under which, we argue, the science and mitigation of island extinctions can be most productively advanced."
__label__SUPPORT	"Significant radiative impact of volcanic aerosol in the lowermost stratosphere  Abstract: Despite their potential to slow global warming, until recently, the radiative forcing associated with volcanic aerosols in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS) had not been considered. Here we study volcanic aerosol changes in the stratosphere using lidar measurements from the NASA CALIPSO satellite and aircraft measurements from the IAGOS-CARIBIC observatory. Between 2008 and 2012 volcanism frequently affected the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere aerosol loadings, whereas the Southern Hemisphere generally had loadings close to background conditions. We show that half of the global stratospheric aerosol optical depth following the Kasatochi, Sarychev and Nabro eruptions is attributable to LMS aerosol. On average, 30% of the global stratospheric aerosol optical depth originated in the LMS during the period 20082011. On the basis of the two independent, high-resolution measurement methods, we show that the LMS makes an important contribution to the overall volcanic forcing. DOI: 10.1038/ncomms8692 OPEN"
__label__UNRELATED	"Fire or ice: Anticorrelation of volcanism and glaciation in California over the past 800,000 years  Abstract: Compilation of published ages of Quaternary volcanism in eastern California indicates that volcanism was episodic, with maxima occurring during interglacial periods. The smoothed age distribution shows peaks at 10, 100, 185, 320, and 690 kyr, corresponding to interglacial cycles 1, 5, 7, 9, and 17. This implies that volcanism was modulated by changes in climate, although the processes that link the two are not well understood. Several factors, including transient loads imposed across rugged topography by ice and water and changes in groundwater regime, may provide the link. Although climatic modulation of volcanism is generally tied to changes in sea level, these data indicate that even volcanoes far from the coast can be affected by climatic change."
__label__UNRELATED	"Indian monsoon and North Atlantic Oscillation signals reflected by Cl- and Na+ in a shallow ice core from Dasuopu glacier, Xixabangma, Himalaya  Abstract: Information about past atmospheric circulation and climate change can be revealed by the chemical constituents of ice cores. Based on the analytical results of Cl and Na concentrations in an 18.5 m ice core, which contains 14 annual layers, from the Dasuopu glacier, central Himalaya, a significant correlation is found between Cl and Na concentrations. This, along with the average Cl/Na weight ratio of 1.9, indicates that moisture at the drilling site came mostly from oceans. Furthermore, there was a high positive correlation between the Cl/Na ratio in the summer monsoon layers and the monsoon rainfall in northeast India, and there exists a teleconnection between the Cl and Na concentrations in this shallow ice core and the North Atlantic Oscillation. CONCLUSIONS: Here we present preliminary studies on the climatic and environmental significances of Cl^ and Na+ concentrations recorded in an 18.5 m long ice core from Dasuopu glacier, central Himalaya. Snow chemistry and meteorological data suggest that the vapor arriving at this high drilling site comes mostly from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon season, and possibly from the North Atlantic Ocean duringthe non-monsoon season.The high Cl^ and Na+ concentrations reflect the influence of the strong westerlies on the high central Himalaya. The trend of variations in the Cl^/Na+ ratio in the MS layers was similar to that of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall. Consequently, the comprehensive analyses tell us that the records of deep ice cores from this glacier could be used to study the impact of the Indian monsoon on climate change over the Tibetan Plateau, and the interaction between the variations in the Indian monsoon and the NAO or the westerlies."
__label__UNRELATED	"Late Quaternary sedimentation in the Lesser Antilles island arc  Abstract: Investigation of patterns and processes of late Quaternary sedimentation in the Lesser Antilles island arc indicates that the major components of deep-water sediment are volcaniclastic silt and clay, redeposited shallow-water carbonate (mainly aragonite and high-Mg calcite), pelagic carbonate (mainly low-Mg calcite), and windblown dust from Africa. Although sediment derived from the adjacent South American continent is included in accreted trench deposits, marine deposition of this sediment within the arc is insignificant, except at the south end of the forearc. Distribution of sedimentary components within the Lesser Antilles arc is controlled primarily by arc volcanism. A Miocene shift in the locus of volcanism, which caused the arc to bifurcate, created two sedimentologic regimes. In the southern part of the arc, which is characterized by volcanically active islands with high relief, deep-water sediment is dominantly volcaniclastic. In contrast, in the northern part of the arc, where a broad arc platform separates high-relief, active volcanoes from low-relief, extinct volcanoes surrounded by wide carbonate shelves, deep-water sediment is composed mainly of redeposited shallow-water carbonate, pelagic carbonate, and eolian-transported Saharan dust. Superposed on the facies patterns determined by arc volcanism is a subtle, but distinct record of Quaternary climate change. Glacial-interglacial periods are recorded in deep-water sediment by variations in sedimentation rate, composition, and texture. Volcaniclastic sedimentation responded to lowstands of sea level by increased sedimentation rates and thicker and/or more frequent turbidites, reflecting intensified currents in interisland passages and increased erosion of exposed insular shelves. Deepwater carbonate sedimentation records decreased carbonate productivity on exposed shelves and in the open ocean during glacial lowstands, as well as variations in carbonate preservation associated with changes in ocean circulation. Deposition of Saharan dust increased during glacial periods because of intensified wind strengths. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS: Deep-water sedimentation within the Lesser Antilles arc reflects the complex interaction of the carbonate, volcanogenic, and siliciclastic depositional processes described above.

__label__UNRELATED	"The Effects of Habitat Type and Volcanic Eruptions on the Breeding Demography of Icelandic Whimbrels Numenius phaeopus  Abstract: Distinct preference of species for habitats is most often driven by long term differences in demographic rates between habitats. Estimating variation in those rates is key for developing successful conservation strategies. Stochastic events can interact with underlying variation in habitat quality in regulating demography but the opportunities to explore such interactions are rare. Whimbrels in Iceland show a strong preference for sparsely vegetated riverplains. Such habitats in Iceland face various threats, e.g., climate change, river regulation and spread of alien plant species. In this study we compared demographic parameters of breeding Whimbrels between riverplains and other habitats before, during and after volcanic eruption events to estimate the importance of the habitats for the species and the effect of ash deposit on breeding success. We found that an estimated minimum of 23% of the Icelandic population of Whimbrels and c. 10% of the world population of the species breed in riverplain habitats in Iceland. Whimbrels bred consistently at much higher densities in riverplain habitats than in other habitats and riverplains also had higher densities of pairs with fledglings although the proportion of successful breeders was similar between habitats. Predation by livestock may have had a considerable negative effect on breeding success on our study sites. Breeding was negatively affected by the volcanic activity, probably through the effects of ash on the invertebrate food supply, with breeding success being gradually worse closer to the eruption. Breeding success was equally affected by volcanism across habitats which differed in underlying habitat quality. This study gives an example of how populations can be regulated by factors which operate at different spatial scales, such as local variation in habitat quality and stochastic events which impact larger areas.

__label__UNRELATED	"Phanerozoic geological evolution of Northern and Central Africa: An overview  Abstract: The principal paleogeographic characteristics of North and Central Africa during the Paleozoic were the permanency of large exposed lands over central Africa, surrounded by northerly and northwesterly dipping pediplanes episodically flooded by epicontinental seas related to the Paleotethys Ocean. The intra-continental CongoZaire Basin was also a long-lived feature, as well as the Somali Basin from Late Carboniferous times, in conjunction with the development of the Karoo basins of southern Africa. This configuration, in combination with eustatic sea-level fluctuations, had a strong influence on facies distributions. Significant transgressions occurred during the Early Cambrian, Tremadocian, Llandovery, Middle to Late Devonian, Early Carboniferous, and Moscovian. The Paleozoic tectonic history shows an alternation of long periods of predominantly gentle basin subsidence and short periods of gentle folding and occasionally basin inversion. Some local rift basins developed episodically, located mainly along the northern AfricanArabian plate margin and near the West African Craton/Pan-African Belt suture. Several arches or spurs, mainly NS to NE SW trending and inherited from late Pan-African fault swarms, played an important role. The Nubia Province was the site of numerous alkaline anorogenic intrusions, starting in Ordovician times, and subsequently formed a large swell. Paleozoic compressional events occurred in the latest Early Cambrian (Iskelian), Medial Ordovician to earliest Silurian (pre-Caradoc and Taconian), the end Silurian (Early Acadian or Ardennian), mid-Devonian (Mid-Acadian), the end Devonian (Late Acadian or Bretonnian), the earliest Serpukhovian (Sudetic), and the latest Carboniferousearliest Permian (Alleghanian or Asturian). The strongest deformations, including folding, thrusting, and active strike-slip faulting, were registered in Northwestern Africa during the last stage of the Pan-African Belt development around the West African Craton (end Early Cambrian) and during the polyphased HercynianVariscan Orogeny that extended the final closure of the Paleotethys Ocean and resulted in the formation of the Maghrebian and Mauritanides belts. Only gentle deformation affected central and northeastern African during the Paleozoic, the latter remaining a passive margin of the Paleotethys Ocean up to the Early Permian when the development of the Neotethys initiated along the Eastern Mediterranean Basins. The MesozoicCenozoic sedimentary sequence similarly consists of a succession of eustatically and tectonically controlled depositional cycles. Through time, progressive southwards shift of the basin margins occurred, related to the opening of the Neotethys Ocean and to the transgressions resulting from warming of the global climate and associated rise of the global sea level. The GuineanNigerian Shield, the Hoggar, TibestiCentral Cyrenaica, Nubia, western Saudi Arabia, Central African Republic, and other long-lived arches delimited the principal basins. The main tectonic events were the polyphased extension, inversion, and folding of the northern AfricanArabian shelf margin resulting in the development of the Alpine Maghrebian and Syrian Arc belts, rifting and drifting along the Central Atlantic, Somali Basins, and Gulf of AdenRed Sea domains, inversion of the MurzuqDjado Basin, and rifting and partial inversion along the Central African Rift System. Two major compressional events occurred in the Late Santonian and early Late Eocene. The former entailed folding and strike-slip faulting along the northeastern Africannorthern Arabian margin (Syrian Arc) and the Central African Fold Belt System (from Benue to Ogaden), and thrusting in Oman. The latter (Pyrenean-Atlasic) resulted in folding, thrusting, and local metamorphism of the northern 1464-343X/$ see front matter 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__UNRELATED	"Storm frequency and magnitude in response to Holocene climate variability, Lake Tutira, North-Eastern New Zealand  Abstract: Available online 3 November 2009 7. Conclusions: It is now recognised that climate change can occur rapidly, resulting in equally rapid ecological and societal impacts. Palaeoclimate records are increasingly being compiled to identify the timing, scale and impacts of such changes. Of particular importance is evidence of changes in the magnitude and frequency of damaging events such as storms. Lake Tutira, on the eastern North Island of New Zealand, contains a 7200 yr BP, high-resolution record of storms preserved in its sediments. Except for the last 500 years of human impact it is a record of natural climatic variability and landscape response at an active collisional margin. While the record of storm frequency is directly related to climate variability, the record of storm magnitude is modulated by the influence earthquakes and geomorphic controls have on sediment supply. 1400 storms are identified and analysed in terms of three size categories. Frequency and magnitude are highly variable, with storm clusters of decades duration, often with sudden onset and cessation. Major periods of increased storminess occur on a cycle of several centuries. A number of these storm periods appear to correlate to a greater or lesser degree with other regional climate proxy records. One storm period of particularly high magnitude and frequency, occurred 18302030 yr BP, and correlates closely with a period around 2000 years ago identified by several records as a time of environmental change in north-eastern New Zealand and Antarctica. However, the record shows no increase in the post-4000 yr frequency of large storms, as might be expected with reported intensification in ENSO activity in sub-tropical to tropical regions at that time. This suggests that the ENSO signal at Tutira is confounded by other climate drivers, in particular the SAM which is responsible for much of the variability in high to midsouthern latitudes (Gillett et al., 2006).The Tutira record of storm variability on decadal to centennial timescales provides support for periods of rapid climate change (RCCs) during the Holocene, as put forward by Mayewski et al. (2004) from a compilation of 50 globally distributed proxy records. The location of Lake Tutira, and its high-resolution storm chronology, make it a key site for regional reconstructions of Holocene palaeoclimate. It also provides a high-resolution data set of climate variability and landscape response to inform themarine sedimentation record for the nearbyMARGINS S2S focus site."
__label__SUPPORT	"Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene climate and sea-level uctuations: the Tunisian record  Abstract: Climate and sea-level fluctuations across the Cretaceous^Tertiary (K^T) transition in Tunisia were examined based on bulk rock and clay mineralogies, biostratigraphy and lithology in five sections (El Melah, El Kef, Elles, Ain Settara and Seldja) spanning from open marine to shallow inner neritic environments. Late Campanian to early Danian trends examined at El Kef and Elles indicate an increasingly more humid climate associated with sea-level fluctuations and increased detrital influx that culminates at the K^T transition. This long-term trend in increasing humidity and runoff in the Tethys region is associated with middle and high latitude cooling. Results of short-term changes across the K^T transition indicate a sea-level lowstand in the latest Maastrichtian about 25^100 ka below the K^T boundary with the regression marked by increased detrital influx at El Kef and Elles and a short hiatus at Ain Settara. A rising sea-level at the end of the Maastrichtian is expressed at Elles and El Kef by deposition of a foraminiferal packstone. A flooding surface and condensed sedimentation mark the K^T boundary clay which is rich in terrestrial organic matter. The P0^ P1a transition is marked by a sea-level lowstand corresponding to a short hiatus at Ain Settara where most of P0 is missing and a period of non-deposition and erosion in the lower part of P1a (64.95 Ma). At Seldja, P0 and possibly the topmost part of CF1 are missing. These sea-level fluctuations are associated with maximum humidity. These data suggest that in Tunisia, long-term environmental stresses during the last 500 ka before the K^T boundary and continuing into the early Danian are primarily related to climate and sea-level fluctuations. Within this long-term climatic trend the pronounced warm and humid event within the latest Maastrichtian Zone CF1 may be linked to greenhouse conditions induced by Deccan volcanism. The absence of any significant clay mineral variations at or near the K^T boundary and Ir anomaly suggests that the bolide impact had a relatively incidental short-term effect on climate in the Tethys region. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This sea-level fall is marked by increased detrital input at El Kef and Elles and a short hiatus at Ain Settara. A rising sea-level marks the end of the Maastrichtian and is expressed at Elles and El Kef by deposition of a foraminiferal packstone. A ooding surface marks the K^T boundary clay associated with condensed sedimentation and maximum inux of terrestrial organic matter. The P0^P1a transition is marked by a sea-level lowstand corresponding to a short hiatus at Ain Settara where the upper part of P0 is missing and a period of non-deposition and erosion marks the lower part of P1a. At Seldja, P0 and possibly the topmost part of CF1 is missing.(3) All the identied clay minerals are known from normal deposition or pedogenic environments and exist in various amounts within the Cretaceous and Paleogene. Thus there are no mineralogical components that are unique or that could be related to an exotic event. Kaolinite increases from the late Maastrichtian into the early Danian and indicates overall increased humidity. Smectite peaks just below the K^T boundary and near the base of Pla indicate a sea-level rise linkedPALAEO 2754 1-5-02with drier climatic conditions. At both El Kef and Elles sections, the K/SM ratios in Zone P0 suggest a series of alternating warm humid and seasonal temperate climate (Fig. 7). Sea-level and climate uctuations inferred from bulk rock and clay mineral data indicate a consistent relationship of low sea-levels with high humidity and high sea-levels with low humidity (increasing seasonality) in the southwestern Tethys region (Fig. 8B).(4) Terrestrial organic matter, as well as Ir and other trace elements, are concentrated at the K^T boundary clay layer which globally coincides with a sea-level rise (maximum ooding) and implies sediment starvation and a condensed interval (Fig. 8B). These trace elements are therefore signicantly elevated as a result of concentration and additional inux due to extraterrestrial event must be evaluated with respect to normal ux.(5) Late Campanian to early Danian trends in bulk rock compositions indicate an increasing detrital inux that culminated during the K^T transition and reect a global change in weathering and climate. At the same time, clay minerals indicate a long-term trend towards a more humid climate which also culminated during the K^T transition. For the same interval, middle and high southern latitude oxygen isotope records indicate long-term climate cooling. This suggests that during the Maastrichtian humidity increased in low latitudes whereas high latitudes cooled. The short-term warming just below the K^T boundary may be linked to Deccan volcanism and may have enhanced already humid conditions in the Tethys region and increased continental runo.(6) The species richness patterns of planktic foraminifera, invertebrates (except inoceramids and rudistids) and palynoora correlate signicantly with the observed changes in climate and weathering. Doubling of species richness between Zones CF6 and CF5, following a major cool event, may be related to increased humidity and precipitation and the resultant increase in terrigenous inux, including terrestrial organic matter. The decrease in species richness in CF2^CF1 and subsequent mass extinction of tropical and subtropical taxa coincides with maximum humidity and terrestrial nutrient export to the oceanswhich may have been associated with Deccan volcanism and a bolide impact."

Atmospheric CO2, CH 4, and N20 concentrations over this period are well established on the basis of fossil air trapped in ice cores and instrumental measurements over the last few decades. Estimates of solar irradiance, ranging between 1364.2 and 1368.2 W/m :, are presented using calibrated historical observations of the Sun back to 1610, along with cosmogenic isotope variations extending back to 1500. Tropospheric aerosol distributions are calculated by scaling the modern distribution of sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol optical depths back to 1860 using reconstructed regional CO2 emissions; prior to 1860 the anthropogenic tropospheric aerosol optical depths are assumed to be zero. Finally, the first continuous, annually dated record of zonally averaged stratospheric (volcanic) optical depths back to 1500 is constructed using sulfate flux data from multiple ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica, in conjunction with historical and instrumental (satellite and pyrheliometric) observations. The climate forcings generated here are currently being used as input to a suite of transient (time dependent) paleoclimate model simulations of the past 500 years. These forcings are also available for comparison with instrumental and proxy paleoclimate data of the same period."

__label__UNRELATED	"The Paleoproterozoic Mg And Mg-Fe Borate Deposits of Liaoning and Jilin Provinces, Northeast China  Abstract: A Paleoproterozoic sequence of metasediments and metavolcanics in Liaoning and Jilin provinces, northeast China, plays host to a large number of borate deposits that are a significant source of boron to China. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the deposits allow them to be divided into Mg-rich, Fe-poor deposits (mainly comprised of suanite and szaibelyite) and Mg-Fe-rich deposits in which the borates are mainly present as ludwigite. There are regional variations in the lithology and thickness of the greenschist-amphibolite-grade metasediments that host the borate orebodies, but they share many common features. The exclusive host to the borates is provided by Mg-rich carbonate intercalations within tourmaline-bearing leptynites, which are interpreted to be the metamorphosed equivalents of evaporites enclosed within volcanic tuffs. This unit is immediately underlain by biotite leptynites, which are also interpreted to be metamorphosed tuffs, and is further underlain by magnetite-microcline leptites that are thought to have formed by metamorphism of primary red beds. The orebodies are overlain by albite-microcline-rich leptites, which are believed to be the equivalents of tuffs and pyroclastic rocks that were altered by Na-K-rich evaporite brines. Overall, geological, geochemical, and boron isotope studies indicate that the borates are metamorphosed nonmarine evaporites. The morphology and geology of the Mg-rich deposits suggests they formed in shallow, wide playa lakes, in which small Fe-rich deposits precipitated on the basin margins, while brines rich in boron and Mg accumulated and precipitated salts in the basin centers. The Fe-rich borate bodies tend to be larger and lack the spatial zonation of the Mg-rich deposits, suggesting that they were deposited in narrower and deeper basins. The regional geology and geochronology of northeast China indicate that tectonic evolution of the area started with subduction of oceanic crust below an Archean craton, followed by continental collision and later development of extensional basins. In modern collisional settings, subduction and crustal thickening both result in metasomatism of the upper lithosphere with boron-enriched fluids, and the associated volcanism is generally accompanied by geothermal activity that leaches the crust of this boron. In the case of the Liaoning deposits, we suggest the geothermal fluids accumulated in local basins, where they underwent evaporation in an arid climate that had already led to the formation of red beds. The overlying leptynites indicate the evaporites were subsequently buried below layers of volcanic ash and pyroclastic rocks. Later granitic intrusions led to metamorphism and dehydration of the original hydrated borate minerals, the development of skarn-type alteration in some areas of the borate deposits, and the transport of boron-rich fluids into immediate hanging walls of the orebodies. These boron-rich fluids reacted with the overlying aluminosilicate rocks to form tourmaline-rich layers and veins. Economic Geology Vol. 97, 2002, pp. 93108 Corresponding author: e-mail, martin.r.palmer@soc.soton.ac.uk Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/economicgeology/article-pdf/97/1/93/3495976/93.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019 recent studies have suggested that this margin of the North China craton records evidence of an active margin that was involved in continental collision (Kroner et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1998). This contrasts with previous interpretations of the area as a paleorift system (Zhang, 1988; Sun et al., 1993) and, as discussed below, has important implications for understanding of the genesis of the borate deposits. We present here new geological and geochemical data in an effort to more tightly constrain the setting of the LiaoningJilin borate deposits. Geochemistry Methods Whole-rock geochemistry Major and trace element compositions of the silicate samples were determined by XRF, and those of the carbonateand borate-rich samples by ICP-AES. REE were determined by ICP-MS. Analyses of international standards indicate that errors for all of these techniques were within 5 percent. Representative data are included in Table 1. Tourmaline chemistry Tourmaline compositions were analyzed by wave-dispersive electron microprobe (JEOL-8600 superprobe). Operating conditions were accelerating voltage 15 kV, beam current 15 nA, beam size 1 to 2 m, and counting times of 15 sec on peak and 8 sec on background. The standards were SiO2 (Si), MgAl2O4 (Al), SrTiO3 (Ti), Fe2O3 (Fe), olivine (Mg), MnO (Mn), CaSiO3 (Ca), albite (Na), and adularia (K). Repeat analyses of an internal standard indicate that errors were within 2 percent. The 95 analyses that were performed on 15 samples cover most of the different occurrences of the tourmaline-bearing rocks. Representative data are included in Table 2 and sample descriptions are given in the Appendix. The B2O3 concentrations were calculated on the basis of three boron atoms in the structural formula. As the amount of H2O is not known, the structural formula was calculated on the basis of 29 oxygens. Although this assumes full occupancy of four hydroxyl anions in the hydroxyl site, the generally low F contents of tourmaline from elsewhere in the Liaoning area (Jiang et al., 1997) and the low Al and Fe concentrations in samples from this study mean this assumption is reasonable (Henry and Guidotti, 1985). Conclusions: The Precambrian borate deposits in Liaoning and Jilin, northeast China, are metamorphosed nonmarine evaporites that are hosted in a Proterozoic sequence of metasediments and metavolcanics. The tectonic evolution of the area was characterized by subduction of oceanic crust below an Archean craton, followed by continental collision and development of postcollisional extensional basins. The subduction of oceanic crust and the crustal thickening associated with collision both resulted in metasomatism of the upper lithosphere with boron-enriched fluids.Volcanism associated with development of the extensional basins was accompanied by geothermal activity that leached the volcanics and the local crust of the boron with which they had been enriched. These geothermal fluids accumulated in local extensional basins and underwent evaporation in an arid climate that had already led to the formation of continental red beds. Differences in the morphology of these basins can be used to rationalize the development of two different types of borate depositsFe poor and Fe rich.The borate mineralogy of the Fe-poor deposits is mainly comprised of suanite and szaibelyite. The geology andgeochemistry of these deposits indicate that they formed in shallow, wide playa lakes that allowed for chemical fractionation of the evaporite brines. During this process, small Ferich deposits were precipitated in the margins of a basin, while brines rich in boron and Mg accumulated and precipitated in the center of the basin.The boron within the Fe-rich deposits is chiefly hosted by ludwigite. In this case, the geological and geochemical evidence indicates that the borates were deposited in narrower and deeper basins that allowed for considerably less spatial zonation of the evaporite deposits.After the evaporites were deposited they were buried below layers of volcanic ash and pyroclastic rocks that protected them from physical erosion. Later metamorphism and intrusion of A-type granites led to dehydration of the original hydrated borate minerals and may have protected the borates from chemical erosion as dehydrated borates are relatively insoluble. Prograde metamorphism resulted in the development of skarn-type alteration in some areas of the borate deposits and in the transport of boron-rich fluids into immediate hanging walls of the orebodies. These boron-rich fluids reacted with the overlying alumino-silicate rocks to form tourmaline-rich layers and veins that inherited the boron isotope composition of the borate minerals.This study also provides guides to borate exploration in the area. The presence of tourmaline-rich rocks with boron isotope compositions characteristic of boron derived from borate minerals may be indicative of the nearby presence of blind borate deposits. In addition, the presence of small Ferich deposits in basin margins may be indicative of large Mgrich borate bodies in the center of the basin."
__label__UNRELATED	"Oxygen isotopes from conodont apatite of the midcontinent, US: Implications for Late Ordovician climate evolution Introduction: The end of the Ordovician coincides with the second largest mass extinction event of the Phanerozoic as well as a major glacial event (e.g., Sepkoski, 1996; Sheehan, 2001; Kaljo et al., 2008; Harper et al., 2013). Cooling and the formation of ice sheets in the southern polar regions during the Late Ordovician (Frakes et al., 1992; Sheehan, 2001; Delabroye and Vecoli, 2010) represents a dramatic climatic shift away from the greenhouse conditions that dominated the Early Ordovician, and the change is often invoked as a forcing mechanism for the extinction. However, the timing and rate of the transition from greenhouse to icehouse conditions are uncertain due to a lack of constraints on the temperature history over the last 1015 million yr of the Ordovician. In one climate scenario cooling is proposed to be rapid and glaciation is thought to be largely confined to the Hirnantian (445.2443.4 Ma). This model is supported by the presence of well-documented Hirnantian-aged glacial deposits, evidence of global sea level fall, and parallel positive excursions in 13C and 18O values during the final two million years of the Ordovician (Brenchley et al., 1994, 2003; Bergstrom et al., 2006; Trotter et al., 2008). Other studies, though, have 5. Conclusions: The oxygen isotope data from species specific conodont elements of themidcontinentUS suggest that the Katian stagewas an interval of relative climatic stability. Combining the new data with data from recent conodont studies (Buggisch et al., 2010; Herrmann et al., 2010; Rosenau et al., 2012) indicates that this period of climatic stability extends below the base of the Katian into the upper Sandbian. Strong stratigraphic and sedimentological evidence suggests that extensive ice sheets existed during theHirnantian, but, whereas some sedimentological evidence of Katian glaciation exists (Frakes et al., 1992), the ages of these deposits are difficult to constrain (Hambrey, 1985). Our results test for progressive change in temperature or ice volume during the Katian but do not constrain ice extent at the start of the Katian. Therefore, evidence for stable conditions during the Katian implies that Late Ordovician cooling and glaciation was either short lived and confined to the Hirnantian, began at the base of the Sandbian but then conditions stabilized for millions of years prior to the Hirnantian event, or was not unidirectional with an early period of glaciation at the base of theSandbian (Shields et al., 2003) followed by a period of stable warmer temperatures during the Katian prior to Hirnantian glaciation.Our results also demonstrate that there is a statistically significant offset in 18O values among conodont taxa. In this study Drepanoistodus suberectus and Plectodina tenuis elements consistently yielded lower 18O values than co-occurring Phragmodus undatus elements suggesting that P. undatus lived in water ~2 C colder than the environment of the other two taxa. This observation suggests that therewas resolvable ecological partitioning among conodont species and supports conclusions of other studies that suggest vertical partitioning of taxa within the water column."

__label__UNRELATED	"Fluvial landforms on fresh impact ejecta on Mars  Abstract: Fluvial valleys provide critical clues to the distribution and state of water throughout the history of the planet Mars. Early in Mars history (o3.7 Gy), the climate may have been warmer than at present leading to the development of valley networks. Younger valleys formed on volcanic and glacial landforms under colder conditions than experienced in Mars early history. Only rare examples of fluvial valleys over fresh impact craters have been reported. In the present study, a survey of hundreds of fresh post-Noachian impact craters (of 12 to 150 km in diameter) has been done to identify fluvial landforms, especially in regions lacking ancient valleys, using images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) instrument onboard Mars Express and from the Context Camera (CTX) instrument onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Observations show that these valleys are locally sinuous, display isolated channels, a poor connectivity and frequent braiding. Valleys were most likely formed over a short duration with high discharge rates, estimated from 500 to 40,000 m s . In Arabia Terra, a total of 27 out of the 204 surveyed craters were found to have fluvial landforms on the ejecta blanket, exclusively in the mid-latitude band (25451). Dating of impact ejecta gives young ages from the Late Hesperian to the Middle Amazonian, thus providing a temporal constraint for the fluvial activity. Late climatic episodes of snow deposition and subsequent melting scattered in space and time could explain observations. Alternatively, the thermal anomaly of impacts and their ejecta over ice-bearing terrains is a possible triggering mechanism for the observed fluvial valleys. Calculations show that the thermal anomaly can persist in the ejecta over several hundreds of years for mid-size craters (2040 km). Such a process would not explain all Martian fluvial activity because of the marked difference between the pristine landforms described and Late Noachian valley networks. Nevertheless, fluvial landforms on preserved ejecta blankets can be used as a new proxy for the temporal distribution of water on Mars. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: Only rare examples of fluvial valleys over fresh craters have been reported in previous studies. In the present study, fluvial landforms were identified on tens of crater ejecta using images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) instrument onboard Mars Express and from the Context Camera (CTX) instrument onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It was shown that:(i) These fluvial landforms were observed preferentially on ejecta blankets for craters larger than 12 km in diameter, and on inner rims for a few craters larger than 90 km in diameter. Outside the ejecta, fluvial landforms are generally absent.(ii) Fluvial landforms on ejecta follow the regional slope as expected for fluid flows. They display patterns suggesting episodes of transient activity, including braided channels, poor connectivity, and limited length. High calculated discharge rates compared to terrestrial or other martian valleys confirm the episodic activity.(iii) Most fluvial landforms have amphitheater heads, with heads scattered on ejecta and not on topographic highs, suggesting local water outbursts rather than precipitation. (iv)Craters ejecta incised by fluvial erosion have ages scattered from the Late Hesperian to the Middle Amazonian epochs, suggesting erosional episodes were young and not coeval.(v) The identification of valleys on impact ejecta provides a timing constraint for the formation of the valleys if a dating of the impact formation is possible.(vi) Regional mapping shows that craters with fluvial incision on ejecta form only at mid-latitudes (25451), showing a link with climatic processes such as the presence of shallow ice at midlatitudes.(vii) A process of shallow ice melted below warm ejecta can explain most of these observations. Snow deposition and subsequent melting as well as hydrothermal activity may be associated with this process, especially for the largest craters.Before this study, it was known that impact craters play a huge role in the evolution of planetary surfaces, especially on Mars, but for past martian fluvial activity, this process was suggested being either irrelevant (e.g., Craddock and Howard, 2002) or predominant (e.g., Toon et al., 2010). Such conflicting viewpoints are a result of the lack of observations demonstrating a clear link between impacts and fluvial activity. This study focused on postNoachian craters and has shown that this link may exist through the heating of shallow ground ice. However, this process cannotTable B1 (continued )Latitude Longitude Diameter (km) Class36,8 22,3 25 A 40,7 31,7 60 A 35,2 21,2 35 Aexplain all past fluvial activity because of the marked difference between the pristine landforms described (poorly connected channels) and Late Noachian valley networks (branching valleys with small inner channels).

__label__SUPPORT	"Estimates of volcanic-induced cooling in the Northern Hemisphere over the past 1,500 years  Abstract: Explosive volcanism can alter global climate, and hence trigger economic, political and demographic change1,2. The climatic impact of the largest volcanic events has been assessed in numerous modelling studies and tree-ring-based hemispheric temperature reconstructions36. However, volcanic surface cooling derived from climate model simulations is systematically much stronger than the cooling seen in tree-ring-based proxies, suggesting that the proxies underestimate cooling7,8; and/or the modelled forcing is unrealistically high9. Here, we present summer temperature reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere from tree-ring width and maximum latewood density over the past 1,500 years. We also simulate the climate e ects of two large eruptions, in AD 1257 and 1815, using a climate model that accounts explicitly for self-limiting aerosol microphysical processes3,10. Our tree-ring reconstructions show greater cooling than reconstructions with lower spatial coverage and based on tree-ring width alone, whereas our simulations show less cooling than previous simulations relying on poorly constrained eruption seasons and excluding nonlinear aerosol microphysics. Our tree-ring reconstructions and climate simulations are in agreement, with a mean NorthernHemisphere extra-tropical summer cooling over land of 0.8 to 1.3 C for these eruptions. This reconciliation of proxy and model evidence paves the way to improved assessment of the role of both past and future volcanism in climate forcing. Drawing on glaciochemical and volcanological evidence, the largest eruptions of the past 1,500 years occurred in Indonesia in 1257 (Samalas11) and April 1815 (Tambora1,12,13). The cooling induced by the Tambora eruption led to the year without a summer1,13, in central and western Europe and northeastern America. Based on sulphate deposition in bipolar ice cores, previous estimates assumed that the radiative forcing from both eruptions was several times greater than that associated with the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. Contradictory results have emerged in previous assessments of the response to such perturbations: whereas global climate models predict a mean Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer cooling of 2.5 C, the temperature response in tree-ring reconstructions has been described as largely muted, being a factor of two to four times smaller8. Here, we investigate the cooling response to large volcanic eruptions in dendroclimatic series by developing new annually resolved 1500-year summer (JuneAugust, JJA) NH extra-tropical (4090N) land temperature reconstructions. These are based on careful selection of published chronologies combined with new data sets from formerly under-represented regions (including Quebec, Qilian Mountains, Central Europe, French Alps; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The selection incorporates 233 JJA temperature-sensitive chronologies (127 tree-ring width (TRW) and 106 maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies) of which an unprecedented 47 cover the thirteenth century. MXD data show a stronger high-frequency response to climate because of lower biological persistence than TRW, making them more suitable for the quantification of abrupt summer cooling induced by volcanic eruptions14. We construct two hemispheric records (NH1, NH2) from site series, grouped into 30 clusters (16 MXD, 14 TRW, amongst which 8 and 12 cover the thirteenth century, respectively; Fig. 1a). The spatial coverage is denser and more balanced than in previous work5 that used only 19 clusters (of which only 8, 1 of them MXD, extended back to 1200) from sites mostly located in northwest America (>60 N). In NH1, a nested reconstruction method was used to stabilize variance, with a new nest created at each decrease in the number of available chronologies (Methods). The 32 nests, calibrated with instrumental JJA temperatures15, passed all verification tests (Methods and Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Table 2). NH2 (Fig. 1d) represents the average of 22 regional reconstructions; they correlate with series of JJA temperatures15,16 over the areas corresponding to the chronology clusterswithR2 values varying between 0.19 and 0.74 (19011990; p< 0.01; Supplementary Table 3). NH1 and NH2 are significantly correlated (r=0.85, from 500 to 2003). Both reconstructions show pronounced cooling after the largest eruptions of the Common Era. Among the ten coldest years of the NH1 (NH2) reconstruction (5002003), seven (six) coincide with major sulphate spikes identified in ice-core records (Supplementary Table 4). In contrast to previous tree-ring reconstructions of NH temperature5,17, which were not designed for studies of climate response at inter-annual timescales14, our reconstructions reveal cooling induced by eruptions in 535 (unidentified volcano;"
__label__SUPPORT	"Seabed gas emissions and submarine landslides off SW Taiwan  Abstract: Methane emissions out of the seabed could seriously affect Earths climate and are usually associated with the dissociation of gas hydrates stored in marine sediments on the continental margins. Spatially, gas emissions out of the seafloor are not evenly distributed in continental margins. Gas emissions out of the seabed generally occur through submarine mud volcanoes and gas seeps. To understand the seabed gas emissions off SW Taiwan, we investigate the distributions of active submarine mud volcanoes, gas seeps, and gas plumes off SW Taiwan. We examine all of the available sub-bottom profiler and EK echo sounder data. We identified 19 submarine mud volcanoes, 220 gas seeps, and 295 gas plumes. The gas emissions are generally distributed at the crests of mud diapiric ridges. Most of the active mud volcanoes and gas seeps cluster at the KASMVG (Kaoping submarine mud volcanoes group) area. We speculate that the intensive mud volcanism and gas seepage at the KASMVG area are ascribed to submarine channel erosion along the continental slope base. The erosion causes a deep V-shaped channel and a steep BSR (Bottom-Simulating Reflector) slope curve across the continental margin. The upward migration rate of free gas beneath the BSR is thus increased and intensifies mud volcanism and gas seepage at the KASMVG area. The gas seeps can reduce the slope stability and generate small-scale slides. The development of mud volcanoes in an area could effectively disturb the seabed morphology so that large-scale submarine landslides cannot easily happen. Article history: Received 16 August 2016 Revised 28 September 2016 Accepted 4 October 2016 4. CONCLUSION: A complete distribution of submarine mud volcanoes, gas seeps and gas plumes off SW Taiwan is compiled, which helps to better understand the seabed gas flow off SW Taiwan. The gas emissions off SW Taiwan occur mainly at the crests of mud diapiric ridges. The submarine mud volcanoes and gas seeps display a clustering phenomenon at the KASMVG area. The middle reach of the Kaoping submarine canyon coincides with the base of the continental slope and is subject to strong erosion. The eroded V-shaped channel has caused a steep BSR slope across the continental slope, which has significantly increased the upward flow rate of free gas beneath the BSR. Consequently, the active mud volcanism and gas seepage have been intensified and clustered at the KASMVG area. The relatively deeper BSRto the SW of the middle reach of the Kaoping Canyon is probably another consequence of the steep channel. The submarine landslides between the Kaoping and Fanliao Canyons are closely related to the gas seeps and mud volcanoes distribution. Large-scale submarine landslides are generally absent in the area full of active mud volcanoes.Acknowledgements This work has received research grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan and the gas-hydrate program of Central Geological Survey of Taiwan.

These vehicles have returned enormous amounts of data that are transforming our understanding of what Mars is like and how it arrived at its present state. The purpose of this paper is to summarize what the new data might imply for the geologic evolution of the planet (Fig. 1). It focuses l rights reserved. mainly on surficial processes such as erosion, sedimentation and weathering, rather than primary terrain-building processes such as impact, tectonism and volcanism since surficial processes arguably present the most puzzling aspects of Mars' geologic evolution. The role of liquid water is particularly puzzling. With a mean annual temperature close to 215 K at the equator and amean surface pressure of 6.1 mbar, the surface pressure is below the critical pressure for liquid water over half the planet's surface and everywhere temperatures are such that any liquid water that forms will rapidly freeze. Yet geologic evidence for the widespread presence of liquid water is compelling, particularly for early Mars, and claims have also been made of present-day water activity. Thus while the emphasis of the paper is on geology, the"
__label__SUPPORT	"Effects of volcanism on tropical variability  Abstract: The effects of large tropical volcanic eruptions on Indo-Pacific tropical variability are investigated using 122 historical ensemble members from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5. Radiative forcing due to volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere is found to increase the likelihood of a model climatic response that projects onto both the El NinoSouthern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Large eruptions are associated with co-occurring El Nino and positive IOD events in the ensemble means that peak 612 months after the volcanic forcing peaks, marking a significant increase in the likelihood of each event occurring in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) spring/summer posteruption. There is also an ensemble mean La Nina-like response in the third SH summer posteruption, which coincides with a significant increase in the likelihood of a La Nina occurring. Taken together with the initial cooling, this La Nina-like response may increase the persistence of the cool global average surface temperature anomaly after an eruption. 4. Discussion and Conclusions: Volcanic eruptions significantly cool SAT on timescales of 13 years after an eruption, with a recovery timescale of 67 years [Hegerl, 2003; Thompson et al., 2009]. The response of the CMIP5 models to the fiveMAHER ET AL. EFFECTS OF VOLCANISM 6030largest tropical eruptions over the last century roughly agrees with these observed timescales, with the peak volcanic cooling occurring around 1.5 years.Focusing on the tropical response to the five largest tropical eruptions over the last century, we examine whether there is a robust response in Indo-Pacific variability. While we consider both SST and SSH, SST is more difficult to interpret as changes in ENSO and IOD variability are superimposed on volcanic cooling. When considering the multimodel multivolcano mean, we find that between the eruption start and peak, in the equatorial band (5N to 5S) there is a global cooling signal consistent with a large-scale volcanic cooling due to aerosols across both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After the eruption peak there is a tendency for a zonal gradient to develop in both the equatorial Pacific and Indian Oceans, which strengthens into a positive IOD and El Nino-like pattern in the first SH spring/summer after the eruption.The initial zonal gradient in SST is consistent with mechanisms relating to changes in zonal gradients of albedo and mean upwelling (dynamical thermostat) [e.g., Seager et al., 1988] highlighted in McGregor and Timmermann [2011], although the spatial structure appears to be more consistent with a dynamical thermostat mechanism [see McGregor and Timmermann, 2011, Figure 8d]. This zonal gradient is intensified over the year after the eruption. The El Nino response is also consistent with the study of Meehl et al. [2008]. albeit reversed, who showed that an increase in solar radiation causes an atmospheric response similar to a La Nina event. While the SST zonal gradient and changes in SSH are similar to those occurring during an El Nino event, the signal is not seen in eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies. This result agrees well with many previous studies such as Adams et al. [2003] but was not seen by Ding et al. [2014] in the CMIP5 models; likely as they did not have enough ensemble members and only considered the SST response and not SSH. The El Nino tends to co-occur with a positive IOD signal, although rather than a warm and cool anomaly, this manifests as a change in the zonal SST gradients superimposed on large-scale volcanic cooling. When considering the individual eruptions (supporting information Figures S2S7), the response of each is largely consistent with the multimodel mean. The exception is the Agung eruption which looks quite different from the other eruptions at the time of the eruption and the first SH summer/spring after the eruption. We hypothesize that this is due to the location of the Agung eruption as it is the furthest eruption from the equator. Supporting information Figure S8 illustrates the zonal shortwave radiation response after each eruption and demonstrates that Agung is the only eruption which does not show a cross-equatorial response.In the third summer after the eruption there is a flip in the east-west Pacific gradient, with cooler SST and lower SSH in the east equatorial Pacific compared to the west. This SSH response is weaker than the El Nino like response seen directly after event, but is still statistically significant. The ongoing volcanic signal acts to enhance the Pacific cooling. The equatorial zonal wind is anomalously westward consistent with a La Nina and provides the forcing to drive the SST and SSH response. Izumo et al. [2010] find that La Nina events tend to occur approximately 14 months after a positive IOD event in the Indian Ocean, due to a collapse of the wind anomalies in the Pacific induced by a breakdown of the IOD. This mechanism could explain the occurrence of this pattern in the models approximately 14 months after the positive IOD composite. This is also consistent with the fact that La Nina events tend to follow El Nino events [e.g., Okumura and Deser, 2011]. The occurrence of a La Nina pattern at this time is consistent with a previous study of McGregor et al. [2010], who use proxy records to show that there is a significant increase in the probability of a La Nina event occurring 3 years posteruption. Again, the response of each eruption is largely consistent with the multimodel mean (supporting information Figures S2S7). The exception here, however, is the Santa Maria eruption, which does not exhibit the drop in SSH or pronounced east Pacific cooling in the third SH summer after the eruption.It is widely known that the CMIP5 models have biases in the mean state and the representation of the modes of variability [Bellenger et al., 2014; Guilyardi et al., 2012; Weller and Cai, 2013], as such the question arises as to whether these biases impact on the projection of volcanic forcing onto ENSO and the IOD. In an attempt to answer this question we assess the impact of volcanic forcing on the subset of CMIP5 identified by Kim et al. [2014] that have more realistic ENSO (indicated in supporting information Table S1). As these models have a noticeably reduced equatorial Pacific cold tongue bias when compared to the remaining models, we also expect them to have a more realistic IOD location. With this subset of models we find that while there are model biases in ENSO and IOD, our results are robust to subsampling for the least biased models.Models also have different treatments of volcanic aerosols, which may influence the ENSO/IOD evolution. To test this, we subset the models by their underlying forcing data sets. While some differences exist (probablyMAHER ET AL. EFFECTS OF VOLCANISM 6031due to the small number of models in each subset and the larger aerosol depth in the Ammann data sets) our overall conclusions are robust.We propose that a volcanic eruption causes global cooling that increases the likelihood of an El Nino-like response in the Pacific Ocean and a co-occurring positive IOD event in the Indian Ocean. There is also an increased likelihood of a La Nina pattern occurring in the third DJF posteruption (i.e., 14 months later that the peak of the El Nino), which is enhanced in the SST field due to volcanic cooling. This signal, coherent with a weak negative IOD may enhance the persistence of postvolcanic cooling seen in CMIP5 models and the global climate system."
__label__SUPPORT	"Upheavals during the Late Maastrichtian: Volcanism, climate and faunal events preceding the end-Cretaceous mass extinction Introduction: The last five million years of the Maastrichtian experienced the coldest climate of the Cretaceous interrupted by two warm periods, major sea level fluctuations and faunal turnovers ending in the CretaceousTertiary boundary (KTB also known as KPg) mass extinction (Li and Keller, 1998a,b; Li et al., 2000; Keller, 2001; Nordt et al., 2003). Planktic foraminifera responded to these environmental upheavals by dramatically reduced diversity after the late Campanianearly Maastrichtian cooling. This cooling was followed by rapid evolution and diversification reaching maximum Cretaceous diversity during the first warm period of the early lateMaastrichtian (Keller, 2001). The second warm period near the end of the Maastrichtian marks the onset of the terminal decline leading to the mass extinction (Fig. 1). South Atlantic DSDP Site 525A has excellent climate and faunal records that mirror global climate changes through the Maastrichtian and yield insights into the environmental conditions that led to the KTB mass extinction (e.g., Li and Keller, 1998a,b,c, 1999; Keller, 2001; Abramovich and Keller, 2002, 2003; Thibault and Gardin, 2006, 2007; rsity, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA. Friedrich et al., 2009; Abramovich et al., 2010). From the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian, deep ocean waters cooled from an average of 16 C to 5. Conclusions: Evaluation of high-stress planktic foraminiferal assemblages from the Indian Ocean to the Eastern Tethys and Gulf of Mexico (Texas)during the late Maastrichtian reveals two faunal upheavals during rapid climate warming, each associated with major volcanism.The early late Maastrichtian warming of 23 C in intermediate waters spans from ~69.5 to 68 Ma (upper C31r to base C30n, zones CF5CF4) and resulted in rapid evolutionary diversification in intermediate and surface waters increasing species assemblages by 43% marking the highest planktic foraminifer diversity in their history. At the same time high-stress conditions prevailed in surface and subsurface waters as marked by blooms of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria blooms and low oxygen tolerant small Heterohelix species.This evolution streak ends abruptly near the end of the warm event (top C31n)with a cluster of extinctions marking the onset of the terminal diversity decline that ends at the KTB mass extinction.The early late Maastrichtian climate warming and faunal upheaval correlate with major volcanic activity at DSDP Site 216 on Ninetyeast Ridge (Kerguelen hotspot) where volcanic sediments above basement basalt are dated ~69.5 Ma (nannofossil zone UC20a, planktic foraminiferal zones CF5CF4) and continued for about 2 million years. Deccan volcanism (phase-1) also began during this time interval although we are still uncertain about their age and duration.The latest Maastrichtian warm event in C29r (zones CF2CF1, UC20d) increased intermediate water temperatures by 34 C and resulted in extreme stress conditions marked by Guembelitria blooms, species dwarfing, reduced diversity and abundances of specialized species that ended with rapid mass extinction of nearly all species. Documentation of the mass extinction in intertrappean sediments between massive Deccan lava flows reveals Deccan volcanism phase-2 as the cause for the rapid warming and mass extinction.Global warming and high-stress conditions associated with early late and latest Maastrichtian volcanic events, are marked by Guembelitria blooms and reduced diversity and abundance of large specialized species particularly Globotruncanidae, with stress conditions at a maximum near volcanic centers and diminishing with distance. The highest stress condition (maximum Guembelitria blooms) mark maximum warming in C29r prior to the rapid mass extinction.Massive Deccan outgassing, climate warming and ocean acidification at the end of the Maastrichtian appear to be the direct causes for the mass extinction. The Chicxulub impact, now considered to predate themass extinction by ~100 kymay have contributed to this catastrophe but was not likely the cause."
__label__UNRELATED	"Ice core paleovolcanic records from the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada  Abstract: [1] We previously reported a record of regionally significant volcanic eruptions in the North Pacific using an ice core from Eclipse Icefield (St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada). The acquisition of two new ice cores from Eclipse Icefield, along with the previously available Eclipse Icefield and Mount Logan Northwest Col ice cores, allows us to extend our record of North Pacific volcanism to 550 years before present using a suite of four ice cores spanning an elevation range of 35 km. Comparison of volcanic sulfate flux records demonstrates that the results are highly reproducible, especially for the largest eruptions such as Katmai (A.D. 1912). Correlation of volcanic sulfate signals with historically documented eruptions indicates that at least one-third of the eruptions recorded in St. Elias ice cores are from Alaskan and Kamchatkan volcanoes. Although there are several moderately large (volcanic explosivity index (VEI) 4) eruptions recorded in only one core from Eclipse Icefield, the use of multiple cores provides signals in at least one core from all known VEI 4 eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka since A.D. 1829. Tephrochronological evidence from the Eclipse ice cores documents eruptions in Alaska (Westdahl, Redoubt, Trident, and Katmai), Kamchatka (Avachinsky, Kliuchevoskoi, and Ksudach), and Iceland (Hekla). Several unidentified tephra-bearing horizons, with available geochemical evidence suggesting Alaskan and Kamchatkan sources, were also found. We present a reconstruction of annual volcanic sulfate loading for the North Pacific troposphere based on our ice core data, and we provide a detailed assessment of the atmospheric and climatic effects of the Katmai eruption. 7. Conclusions: [64] We have presented records of regionally significant volcanic eruptions using a suite of three ice cores from Eclipse Icefield and one ice core from Mount Logan in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada. These cores cover variously 90, 100, 290, and 550+ years. Volcanic horizonsD08102 YALCIN ET AL.: ICE CORE VOLCANIC RECORDS18 of 21D08102were identified by statistical analysis of the ice core SO4 2 and Cl records. Comparison of results from an EOF analysis and from using non-sea-salt residuals above a robust spline demonstrates that the EOF analysis provides a more conservative estimation of volcanic SO42 for sites affected by anthropogenic SO42 deposition. However, ice core sites with no or negligible anthropogenic SO42 deposition will yield comparable results using either technique. Comparisons of volcanic SO42 flux records using linear regression demonstrate a high degree of reproducibility of the results, especially for the largest sulfur producing eruptions such as Katmai, which are also the eruptions of greatest interest in climate forcing studies. [65] Correlation of volcanic SO42 signals with eruptions documented in the historical record indicates that one-third of the eruptions recorded in St. Elias ice cores are from Alaskan and Kamchatkan volcanoes. This is a minimum proportion, because many of the unidentified signals in these records are undoubtedly also from eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka, regions where the number of historically documented eruptions decreases markedly prior to the twentieth century. Although there are several moderately large (VEI 4) eruptions recorded in only one of the three available cores from Eclipse Icefield, the use of multiple records provides signals from all known VEI 4 eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka since A.D. 1829 in at least one core. Clearly, multiple cores can provide a more complete picture of regionally significant volcanic events than is possible from any one core. The large number of eruptions in Alaska and Kamchatka recorded in the St. Elias cores provides a Northern Hemisphere volcanic aerosol record complementary to the records already available from Greenland where Icelandic eruptions predominate. [66] The St. Elias ice cores record a large volcanic SO4 2 signal in the early sixteenth century that is not prominent in the eastern Arctic. Analysis of volcanic glass shards from this eruption in the Eclipse ice core suggest it could be from an undocumented eruption in the Wrangell Volcanic Field of southeast Alaska. Tephrochronological evidence from the Eclipse ice core also documents eruptions in Alaska (Redoubt, Trident, Katmai), Kamchatka (Avachinsky, Kliuchevoskoi, Ksudach), and Iceland (Hekla). Several unidentified tephra-bearing horizons, with available geochemical evidence suggesting Alaskan and Kamchatkan sources, are also found in the Eclipse ice core. Trace and rare earth element analysis of glass shards via ICP-MS could provide more robust identifications of source volcanoes, with the potential for identifying previously unrecognized volcanic eruptions, as many of the tephras older than A.D. 1900 cannot be correlated to any known eruption. [67] Using multiple ice cores from a single site, we have presented a robust reconstruction of volcanic sulfate aerosol mass loading for the North Pacific troposphere. The use of multiple cores also allows us to quantify the uncertainty in our reconstruction. Our results show that the Katmai eruption produced the largest volcanic sulfate perturbation affecting the regional troposphere in at least the last 550 years. Thirteen other events also resulted in a regional volcanic sulfate loading greater than or equal to that resulting from Tambora. The results presented here contribute to our understanding of the atmospheric and climactic effects of volcanic eruptions in the North Pacific region.[68] Acknowledgments. We thank E.

__label__UNRELATED	"Denudation history and landscape evolution of the northern East-Brazilian continental margin from apatite fission-track thermochronology  Abstract: We reconstruct the history of denudation and landscape evolution of the northern EastBrazilian continental margin using apatite fission-track thermochronology and thermal history modeling. This part of the Brazilian Atlantic margin is morphologically characterized by inland and coastal plateaus surrounding a wide low-lying inland region, the Sertaneja Depression. The apatite fission track ages and mean track lengths vary from 39 4 to 350 57 Ma and from 10.0 0.3 to 14.2 0.2 mm, respectively, implying a protracted history of spatially variable denudation since the Permian at relatively low rates (<50 m My 1). The Sertaneja Depression and inland plateaus record Permian-Early Jurassic (300e180 Ma) denudation that precedes rifting of the margin by > 60 Myrs. In contrast, the coastal regions record up to 2.5 km of Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (150e120 Ma) denudation, coeval with rifting of the margin. The samples from elevated coastal regions, the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range, record cooling from temperatures above 120 C since the Late Cretaceous extending to the Cenozoic. We interpret this denudation as related to post-rift uplift of these parts of the margin, possibly resulting from compressional stresses transmitted from the Andes and/or magmatism at that time. Several samples from these areas also record accelerated Neogene (<30 Ma) cooling, which may record landscape response to a change from a tropical to a more erosive semi-arid climate during this time. The inferred denudation history is consistent with the offshore sedimentary record, but not with evolutionary scenarios inferred from the recognition of planation surfaces on the margin. The denudation history of the northeastern Brazilian margin implies a control of pre-, synand post-rift tectonic and climatic events on landscape evolution. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: From the study of the AFT, geological, and geomorphological data, it is evident that the continental margin of northeastern and eastern Brazil underwent a protracted and spatially variable history of denudation, which is only in part related to continental rifting.The AFT data and models allow us to determine the timing and relative importance of four cooling/denudation episodes: Permiane Early Jurassic denudation is recorded in the samples from the S~ao Francisco Craton and the Sertaneja Depression to thewest of the RTJ rift system, followed by a second episode of cooling in the Early Cretaceous, recorded by the samples from along the coastline, the flanks of the RTJ rift, the Conquista Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range. Samples from the Borborema Plateau, theMantiqueira Range and the adjacent areas record cooling from temperatures above 120 C since the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene, whereas Neogene cooling from temperatures ~60e70 C is recorded by a subgroup of samples from throughout the study region, in particular in the Mantiqueira Range, Borborema Plateau and coastal region. Although such a late-stage cooling event is a well-known artifact of thermal historymodeling usingAFT length data, both themodeling approach used in the study and the evidence from the offshore sedimentary record provide us with confidence in this model outcome.The timing of these various cooling and denudation events are broadly consistent with those inferred in and around the study areausing the same method by Harman et al. (1998), Turner et al. (2008), Morais Neto et al. (2009) and Japsen et al. (2012b). We associate the Permian-Early Jurassic denudation to erosion of topography that was built during the final stages of the Gondwanides orogeny, Early Cretaceous denudation to rift-shoulder erosion during the rifting and break-up of the South Atlantic, Late Cretaceous-Paleogene denudation to possible thermal-isostatic uplift and magmatic underplating of the Borborema Plateau and the Mantiqueira Range, and final Neogene denudation to a transition to a more erosive semi-arid climate. Overall, the landscape evolved at a slow pace and denudation rates did not exceed ~75 m My 1 since the Mesozoic anywhere in the study area. The inferred denudation history of the margin is consistent with the sedimentary record preserved in the offshore basins. It appears, however, at odds with the inferences from geomorphologic studies based on the interpretation of regionally correlative paleo-surfaces. We interpret these upland low-relief surfaces as relict landscapes predating the Neogene transition to localized erosion of the landscape.Our results imply that the present-day elevated Diamantina Plateau and its escarpment were not formed during opening of the South Atlantic but instead developed well before the onset of rifting. Obtaining thermochronological data from the elevated plateau surface would be useful to better define the age of landscape evolution and scarp retreat of the Diamantina Plateau. In contrast, the onset of denudation of the coastal region, the Conquista and Borborema Plateaus, and the Mantiqueira Range appears to be controlled by rift-shoulder uplift, whereas the pattern of denudation suggests significant segmentation of the margin.Landscape evolution of the Brazilian continental margin is considerably more complex than predicted by simple models of continental-margin development and exhibits evidence for pre, syn- and post-rift tectonic and climatic controls. Further thermochronological studies are required to better constrain the spatial and temporal variation in the onshore denudation and the nature and rate of sediment supply to the offshore basins; future studies should also refine themodel of landscape evolution in this segment of the Brazilian continental margin. Particular emphasis should be placed on extending the dataset for the northern and eastern continental margin of Brazil to lower temperatures by the application of apatite (UeTh)/He thermochronology (e.g., Cogn e et al., 2011, 2012), combined with quantitative geomorphological tools and advanced numerical surface-process models."
__label__UNRELATED	"Radiation and extinction patterns in Permian floras from North China as indicators for environmental and climate change  Abstract: Permian continental sequences from North China contain previously unrecognized episodes of plant radiation and elevated extinction. The earliest extinction, in the Lower Shihhotse Formation (Roadian, Guadalupian), records a 45% floral species loss and is tentatively correlated with global extinctions amongst dinocephalian reptiles. Two younger extinctions are dated by correlating the Illawara Reversal and palaeomagnetic polarity sequences from Shanxi Province against global palaeomagnetic history. Missing data from the Shanxi sequence are evaluated using a novel approach estimating likely maximum and minimum sequence changes that provide age estimates for post-Illawara events in North China. The second extinction in the middle Upper Shihhotse Formation is more significant and is dated to the mid-Capitanian, with a loss of 56% of plant species coinciding with two phases of volcanism of the Emeishan Large Igneous Province in South China, previously linked to the mid-Capitanian marine mass extinction. The youngest extinction in the upper Upper Shihhotse Formation (late Capitanian to mid-Wuchapingian) is catastrophic and represents the end of range in the sequence. Changes in sedimentary facies suggest it to be related to global climatic warming and drying. Other viable causal mechanisms for the extinction episodes include plate motion and collision, global climate change, volcanism and biological competition. The Permian of the northern hemisphere is often regarded as a dry interval in Earth history, although it is now widely appreciated that extensive wetland ecosystems developed in lowland settings such as the North China block during the Cisuralian to Guadalupian Series, and in the South China block during the Guadalupian and Lopingian Series (Rees et al. 2002; Hilton & Cleal 2007; Wang 2010). The Pennsylvanian and Permian North and South China blocks have traditionally been viewed as comprising distinct phytogeographical regions bearing the Northern and Southern Cathaysian floras respectively, but episodes of floral mixing and interchange have been inferred from postCarboniferous plant occurrences and distributions (e.g. Laveine et al. 1992; Li & Wu 1996; Wang et al. 1998; Fluteau et al. 2001; Hilton & Cleal 2007). During the Pennsylvanian and Cisuralian the North China block occupied low northern palaeolatitudes and is believed to have been an island that collided with Mongolia during the Lopingian, bringing it into contact with a landmass containing representatives of the Angaran flora (Xiao et al. 2003; Cope et al. 2005). Accretion of the North and South China blocks was, in contrast, more complex, and according to Meng & Zhang (1999) involved accretion of the Qinling Terrane with the southern part of North China, and separation of South Qinling from the South China block during the Carboniferous and continuing into the Permian. The North China block and Qinling Terrane then accreted with the South China block during the Late Triassic (Metcalfe 2002). This complex tectonic framework provides controls on floral composition and phytogeography, with connection of the Northern Cathaysian floral province and the Angaran floral province during the Lopingian, mixing of the Northern and Southern Cathaysian floras during the Lopingian, and final accretion into a single phytogeographical realm in the late Triassic. In the present paper we investigate those fossil plant assemblages from the Pennsylvanian and Permian of North China that were initially documented in a now classic monographic treatment by Halle (1927) and compare them with recent studies on plants from the same stratigraphic sequence in North China (Wang 1989; Wang 2010). The floral assemblages are abundant, diverse, and were collected in a geological framework that allows their relative stratigraphic position and order to be identified within the regional sedimentary sequence. The fossil plant assemblages represent the Benxi (formerly Penxi; see Cleal & Wang 2002), Taiyuan, Shanxi (formerly Shansi), and Lower and Upper Shihhotse (formerly Shihezi) Formations that span a range of depositional environments from paralic peat-forming mires with or without marine influence, through fluvio-deltaic, and finally into fluvial and lacustrine settings (Norin 1922, 1924; He et al. 1995; Kong et al. 1996). These assemblages record changing floral composition and diversity through time and provide an unrivalled window into the floral history of North China during this stratigraphic interval. In previous investigations, the fossil plant composition from North China through this sequence has been used to identify floral assemblages and to provide insights into biostratigraphy and correlation (Shen 1995; Wang 2010), but here we conclude that the same data include previously unrecognized information on palaeoecology, community change and floristic turnover including episodes of floral radiation and extinction. However, stratigraphic control on the Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/168/2/607/4044533/607.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019 age of single assemblages within the sequence is poorly constrained and based primarily on plant megafossil stratigraphy, palynostratigraphy, and regional-scale lithostratigraphic correlation, leading us to explore other potentially viable methods of stratigraphic correlation using palaeomagnetism. Sedimentology and palaeoenvironments of North China during the Permian The Upper Palaeozoic and tentatively Lower Mesozoic sediments of Central Shanxi were divided into three series by Norin (1922) that are now reclassified as formations: the Lower and Upper Shihhotse Formations, and the overlying Shiqianfeng (formerly Shihchienfeng) Formation. An additional three formations have subsequently been recognized below this level (Shen 1995; Cleal & Wang 2002; Hilton & Cleal 2007), extending back to the Moscovian Stage of the Carboniferous (Fig. 1): the Benxi, Taiyuan and Shanxi formations. The lowermost is the Late Moscovian Benxi Formation that rests unconformably on Ordovician limestones (Cleal & Wang 2002), and contains marine limestones along with coal seams, estuarine sandstones, mudstones and shales. The Benxi Formation is overlain conformably (but probably in a diachronous manner) by the Cisuralian (AsselianSakmarian) Taiyuan Formation, which comprises black shales, coal seams, quartz sandstones and calcareous shales, intercalated with marine limestones (Kong et al. 1996; Hilton et al. 2001; Hilton & Cleal 2007). The Shanxi Formation rests conformably on the Taiyuan Formation and is of broadly similar composition but lacks the marginal marine facies and limestones of marine incursions (Shen 1995; Geng & Hilton 1999). Present evidence considers the Shanxi Formation to be of SakmarianArtinskian age within the Cisuralian, but it also may extend into the early (Shen 1995) or late Kungurian (Wang 2010), and again may be diachronous on a continental scale. The Taiyuan and Shanxi formations are interpreted to have been dominated by marginal marine to paralic swamp environments (He et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2003), with the plant communities preserved representing lowland basinal settings. The overlying Lower Shihhotse Formation and Upper Shihhotse Formation contain little coal but are rich in fossil plants. These formations, dominated by alluvial sandstones, siltstones and clays, are c. 450 m thick (Norin 1922), and constitute the main plant-bearing units of the monograph by Halle (1927). Plant-bearing facies of the Lower Shihhotse Formation are dominated by browngreen homogeneous siltstones and clays, interpreted by Norin (1922) as alluvial and fluvial sediments, the plants deposited in a lowland, basinal environment from marginal and overbank growth areas. The Upper Shihhotse Formation contains plant beds of a similar lithological nature, but with a higher proportion of yellow laminated clays, suggestive of lacustrine influence (Norin 1922, 1924). The Shiqianfeng Formation lies unconformably above the Upper Shihhotse Formation following a regional-scale hiatus (Hu et al. 1990; Wang 2010) and is characterized by red or brown claystones and sandstones containing few fossil plants that Wang (1985, 1989) interpreted as evidence of arid conditions. The lower part of this formation contains gypsum, indicating evaporitic conditions, and the upper 700 m include numerous finegrained aeolian sandstones suggestive of dry desert conditions (Norin 1922, 1924; Wang & Wang 1986; Wang & Chen 2001). Other parts of the Shiqianfeng Formation contain plant fossils that record a dramatic demise in elements of wetland vegetation towards the top of the sequence, which corresponds to the PermianTriassic boundary (Wang & Chen 2001). Liu (1990) reconstructed the palaeogeography and lithofacies of Late Palaeozoic North China (Fig. 2) with Taiyuan city (the Shanxi locality analysed in the present study), positioned at the centre of the microcontinent. During the Cisuralian, Taiyuan city bordered the marginal marine and paralic sediments of southern North China and the fluvial and alluvial sediments of the northern part of the landmass. This is consistent with the sedimentary record of the Taiyuan and Shanxi formations. During the Guadalupian, Taiyuan city is shown as a lowland basin that saw deposition of fluvial and lacustrine siltstones and shales from the surrounding upland areas. These reconstructions and the extended duration of time recorded in the Shanxi sequence point to a complex sedimentary history, in which there were a variety of environments and variable rates of deposition and erosion. The entire sequence from the Taiyuan to the Shiqianfeng Formations was interpreted by Norin (1922) to be a prograding delta, but given the length of time represented by the sequence and the range in sedimentary environments, it is likely that there were multiple episodes of deposition and erosion within a broad suite of marginal marine to fully terrestrial environments (He et al. 1995; Kong et al. 1996). Overall, we consider that the plants in the Shanxi sequence developed in three broad environmental settings: (1) a paralic sequence of interlayer terrestrial and marine rocks that record regular fluctuations in sea level and climate during the Benxi and Taiyuan formations; (2) a more terrestrial sequence with cyclic alteration of coals and shales or mudrocks in the Shanxi and Lower Shihhotse formations; (3) transition to a more terrestrial sequence of red beds, gypsum evaporites and fluvial deposits in the Upper Shihhotse Formation. This records a continuing trend toward reduced climatic variability and increasing average aridity in the equatorial and paratropical regions of Pangaea, as seen globally (e.g. Montanez et al. 2007). Although the plants from the Shanxi sequence are on the whole allochthonous (e.g. Stevens 2009; Stevens & Hilton 2009), the majority are large, well-preserved and often articulated foliage fragments that have not been transported a great distance. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the presence and distribution of plants found in the sequence would have been influenced by palaeoenvironmental changes, such as disruption caused by shifting river deltas and the low energy level and low nutrient flow typical of swamp environments. Correlation of terrestrial sequences in the Permian of North China Correlation and stratigraphy of Carboniferous and Permian terrestrial sequences in China is notoriously difficult as in most cases they lack appropriate marine species for high-resolution biostratigraphy, and also lack suitable lithologies for radiometric dating methods. Palynostratigraphy often provides good stratigraphic resolution but palynomorphs are prone to reworking in sedimentary environments, are heterogeneously deposited across facies, may not be present in some settings, and are subject to a variety of taphonomic processes including non-preservation in oxidizing environments or coarse-grained lithologies (Bateman 1991; Batten 1999). In the Carboniferous and Permian of China, the palynostratigraphy of the PennsylvanianCisuralian Benxi, Taiyuan and Shanxi sequences has been compared with interbedded marine faunal associations to develop good stratigraphic constraint (e.g. Liu et al. 2008). In contrast, stratigraphically L. G.

Fossil plant biostratigraphy offers the potential to correlate fossiliferous sequences within single basins, but on a regional scale this is more problematic and where adopted provides only a basic level of correlation (e.g. Bateman 1991; Cleal 1991). Biostratigraphy based on terrestrial plant fossils is limited by a variety of factors with different kinds of effects, including those taphonomic processes that lead to fragmentation of plant remains, floral migration and provinciality, variable preservation potential of different facies and convergence of morphological features among plant groups, making identification difficult in fragmentary preservation. However, where other methods are unavailable, palynostratigraphy and fossil plant biostratigraphy are widely Fig. 1.

For the lithostratigraphy in Shanxi Province, two stratigraphic frameworks are presented based on correlation of the palaeomagnetic data from Embleton et al.

Wang (2010) synthesized the current understanding of the stratigraphy of the CarboniferousPermian sequences from Shanxi Province based on information recovered from marine faunal assemblages (restricted to the Benxi and Taiyuan formations), plant fossil biostratigraphy and regional correlation, summarized here in Figure 1. The correlation presented by Wang (2010) represents a broad-based synthesis of total data in North China. In our view, however, aspects of his stratigraphic conclusions must be examined critically and with caution, as he directly correlates international stage boundaries with geological formation boundaries and megafossil plant and spore assemblages (see fig. 10 of Wang (2010)). It is now imperative that radiometric and other dating methods are applied to the Permian terrestrial sequences of North China to generate a more accurate framework to study organismal and environmental change at this time. In the present study we employ existing palaeomagnetic data as a viable stratigraphic method for parts of the terrestrial sequence in Shanxi Province, and see this as an important first step in increasing the stratigraphic resolution in the terrestrial facies from this stratigraphic interval. In the Permian, the Illawara palaeomagnetic reversal marks the boundary between the reversed polarity CarboniferousPermian Kiaman Superchron and the PermianTriassic mixed polarity superzone of the Illawara Superchron (Irving & Parry 1963; Steiner 2006; Isozaki 2009). Glen et al. (2009) undertook a magnetostratigraphic study of the Permian marine and terrestrial sequences of NW China that used the Illawara Reversal for correlation purposes; however, they did not include the sedimentary sequences of Shanxi Province in North China in their treatment. By contrast, Embleton et al. (1996) identified the Illawara Reversal in the type section at Ximing near Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, and concluded that the reversal occurred during the base of the Upper Shihhotse Formation, within the Ufimian regional stage (Roadian in the latest global stratigraphy). However, Menning & Jin (1998) reinterpreted the age of the Illawara Reversal based on correlation across Asia and concluded that it was of mid-Capitanian age, whereas more recent studies, including that by Isozaki (2009), concluded that it was earliest Capitanian based on global correlation, an age that we follow here. We infer the Illawara Reversal as documented in the Shanxi Sequence, identified in Bed 73 of Embleton et al. (1996), to be a fixed stratigraphic datum of earliest Capitanian age, occurring in the middle of the lowermost member of the Upper Shihhotse Formation (Shihezi A of Embleton et al. 1996). We therefore consider the lowest part of the Upper Shihhotse Formation, occurring beneath the Illawara Reversal to be either latest Wordian or earliest Capitanian. Unfortunately, it has proven impossible to determine the exact position in the Shanxi regional sequence of Bed 73 in which Embleton et al. (1996) identified the Illawara Reversal; although they cited that the section is the type section near Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, North China, the bed numbers do not agree with any of those we have been able to find in the literature for the same formations in the same region (e.g. Norin 1922, 1924; Halle 1927: Editorial Group for Shanxi Province Stratigraphy 1979; He et al. 1995; Kong et al. 1996; Wang 2010). As Embleton et al. (1996) did not provide locations for their sampling sites, we can only locate the Illawara Reversal to the middle of the lowermost member in the formation. Placement of the Illawara Reversal in the lower part of the Upper Shihhotse Formation allows correlation of the post-Illawara Reversal magnetic sequence in Shanxi Province with the global sequence (e.g. Isozaki 2009), matching the bar-code of consecutive normal and reversed polarities from different areas. However, terrestrial sequences such as those under discussion here present a less complete picture than the marine igneous palaeomagnetic record because certain lithologies are more likely to preserve a magnetic signal than others (Tarling 1983; Dunlop & Ozdemir 1997). Furthermore, periods of erosion or nondeposition introduce intervals of missing data into the palaeomagnetic record such that terrestrial sequences are rarely complete. The Shanxi regional palaeomagnetic sequence is no exception to this and includes beds in which no data have been recovered (Embleton et al. 1996) and as such matching the palaeomagnetic bar-code cannot be achieved with absolute certainty; missing data intervals could represent range extensions of the previous and following intervals, or could include one or more additional polarity reversals. Here, the incompleteness of terrestrial sequences is apparent from coarse-grained facies, which are less likely to preserve a palaeomagnetic signal and may also represent erosional surfaces. We have therefore constructed two models for the age range of the Shanxi sequence by matching its palaeomagnetic record (Embleton et al. 1996) with the global sequence (Isozaki 2009) (Fig. 1). One model is conservative and requires the minimum change from missing data to accommodate the observed sequence, whereas the other model infers the maximum change from missing data. Specifically, for the minimum change model, where there are two beds Fig. 2. Palaeogeography and lithofacies of North China during (a) the Cisuralian Series and (b) the Guadalupian Series of the Permian. Modified from Liu (1990). L. G. STEVENS ET AL . 610 Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/168/2/607/4044533/607.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019 with the same polarity separated by a missing data interval, we assume that the missing data are of the same polarity, thus resulting in a longer interval with a single polarity. For the maximum change model, a bed with missing data that separates two intervals of the same polarity is assumed to be a reversal. In both models, where a missing interval within a bed separates normal from reversed polarities, the missing data are ignored, as they can only be interpreted to be an extension of either the normal or reversed polarities that bound this interval (the bi-state polarity does not accommodate a third state, and we assume that the missing interval would not be long enough to accommodate two or more polarity reversals). The range of the Upper Shihhotse Formation calculated using the minimum and maximum change models are shown in Figure 1. The minimum change method gives an age range for the Upper Shihhotse Formation from the latest Wordian or earliest Capitanian to the end of the Capitanian (c. 5 Ma duration), whereas the maximum change method extends the top of the formation to the middle of the Wuchiapingian (c. 10 Ma duration). In the maximum change model we note that 14 periods of normal polarity occur post-Illawara Reversal, and despite spanning a known hiatus in the Shanxi sequence, this is only two normal polarity episodes fewer than is documented in the global sequence by Isozaki (2009). Thus, this model is not an unrealistic estimate. However, we consider the minimum change method to be more appropriate for a terrestrial sequence with relatively fast depositional rates compared with marine settings from which the global palaeomagnetic scheme is constructed. The top of the overlying Shiqianfeng Group is arbitrarily correlated with the end of the Permian, with the minimum and maximum method used to determine its range as well as the length of the hiatus (shown in Fig. 1) between this and the top of the Upper Shihhotse Formation (Hu et al. 1990). It is of great significance to our discussion below of floral changes that regardless of which model is employed to constrain the duration of the Upper Shihhotse Formation, it clearly spans the time of Emeishan volcanism and the marine mass extinction in South China (dated to the mid-Capitanian on the basis of conodonts). Palaeobotanical dataset from the Pennsylvanian Permian of North China Here we investigate the plant fossils previously published by Halle (1927) and deposited in the Department of Palaeobotany at the Swedish Museum of Natural History (Stockholm) from the PennsylvanianPermian of Shanxi Province, China. This collection remains the most complete and comprehensive available for this stratigraphic interval in North China, with the collection including 128 species from 48 genera that are preserved as compressions and impressions. Specimens were collected systematically from the geological sequence and plant fossils occur in 33 Beds at six localities from the east and west sections of Taiyuan-fu in central Shanxi Province. However, the beds reported by Norin (1922) and Halle (1927) are not beds in the strict geological sense, but represent successions of beds of a similar nature that may include tens of metres of strata (Glasspool et al. 2004a). Although not from single beds, this information remains useful for subdividing formations stratigraphically and allows localized correlation between the Eastern and Western Hills sections (see Norin 1922; Halle 1927). The majority of species were identified by Halle (1927), and our reinvestigation has examined all of the materials available, and confirms identifications and provides further taxonomic consistency to the dataset. We have also incorporated results from more recently published accounts that have undertaken systematic revisions of taxa present (Glasspool et al. 2004a,b; Seyfullah & Hilton 2009; Stevens 2009; Stevens & Hilton 2009). Methods and limitations of the data Binary presenceabsence data were used to provide a detailed representation of species composition and stratigraphic range. Analysis was restricted to one organ type for each plant group to avoid counting different organs belonging to the same biological species more than once. Only species present in more than one bed were included (i.e. singletons omitted) to limit bias from atypical species occurrences (e.g. Wilf & Johnson 2004); for example, non-local species deposited by an extreme flooding event. Of the104 species counted in the Shanxi sequence, 59 were present in more than one horizon. Range-through data were used to plot stratigraphic ranges of single plant species (Fig. 3), meaning that the species turnover plot shows levels of species loss and gain in successive beds (Fig. 4). Species turnover can be used to reflect major events in floristic composition when increased diversity is taken as a measure of success and high rates of loss as an indication of stress, such as environmental disruption (e.g. Jaramillo 2002; Dimitrova et al. 2005; Dimitrova & Cleal 2007). In our species range chart (Fig. 3) Lazarus taxa (occurring intermittently in the sequence) were counted as present from their initial appearance to final disappearance from the sequence to give a broader floristic signal; that is, even if the plants were not preserved or collected, they are assumed to have been present in the surrounding area. This also means that the same taxa are never seen originating or disappearing more than once, which limits counting bias. Our species turnover plot (Fig. 4) charts the first and last stratigraphic occurrences of species. We propose that significant changes in diversity through the Shanxi sequence are origin and extinction events. Although the data represent only a local flora and may not show true origins and extinctions, this flora is from one of the best documented localities in Permian North China and our results correlate with the general trends reported from the smaller sites (Shen 1995). Further sampling and analysis at other late Permian sites in northern China would be required to prove this hypothesis. Extinctions are represented in the last beds in which the taxa occurred, so that the data in these charts correspond to the rangethrough data and the events can be observed at the same points. The average (mean) line is shown in grey and indicates the overall trend in species turnover, highlighting episodes in which the data deviate from no gain or loss. Comparison of rangethrough origination or extinction patterns with total species turnover gives a more complete picture of floristic variation, emphasizing the individual and overall contributions of taxa to the changes in diversity. For the extinction and origination levels in each bed of the Shanxi sequence, 95% binomial confidence intervals have been calculated on the diversity data. Confidence measures using sample numbers would also have been valuable but unfortunately such data were not available at the time of the study. The values were calculated as described by Buzas (1990) and Sepkoski & Koch (1995), using the formula 95% CI 14 1.96D[p(p 1)/D], where CI is the confidence interval, p is the proportion of extinctions or originations in a bed and D is the number of species present in that bed. It should be noted that as we are plotting numbers of originations, rather than proportions, we have multiplied the confidence intervals by D for each bed. As expected, low sampling numbers in some of the beds caused instability in standard deviation values, but the major origination PERMIAN FLORAL TURNOVER IN NORTH CHINA 611 Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article-pdf/168/2/607/4044533/607.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019 F ig . 3 .

We believe that although sampling numbers are low, as is so often the case with data analysed from historical collections, there are several reasons why the data do show some significant results. The first is that although there is inevitable taphonomic bias, the sequence preserves plant species that are similar to those from other sites elsewhere in North China (Shen 1995; Wang 2010) and in our view are representative of the regional flora as a whole. Taphonomic bias will be evident in the older formations where a greater range of environments are sampled, resulting in a mixing of floras and time averaging in comparison with the younger floras of the Lower and Upper Shihhotse Formation, where the sediments are relatively uniform and appear to represent a narrower range of environments sampled. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the inferred palaeoenvironments also suggest that plants collected in the older part of the sequence are more likely to represent much more local floras than those from the fluvial and alluvial period in the younger formations that were transported greater distances. This is reflected in the low diversity numbers of Beds 16 (e.g. Fig. 3), but our major conclusions are drawn from diversity levels in the siltand claystone horizons in the younger formations and so the results should not be badly skewed by this bias. The sampling was also carried out over an extremely long sequence (c. 600 m in the west section) that contained many potentially fossiliferous horizons. Plants were collected at every productive horizon and Fig. 4.

The grey line represents mean species turnover and emphasizes changes in balance between gain and loss. Extinction episodes from Figure 3 are set against frequent and cyclical turnover in floral assemblage composition in this figure. Bed numbers are from Halle (1927).

In kaolinite, Fe ions substitute for Al at octahedral sites. Most of these clays are dioctahedral type, show balance between net layer and interlayer charges. The interstratified illite smectite (I/S) mixed layers containing variable proportions of montmorillonite. Illite contains sheet-like, well oriented microaggregates. The parallel stacks of chlorite sheets show chlorite/smectite (C/S) mixed layers. Progressive enrichment of Fe and depletion of Al ions with the advancement of kaolinization process is observed. High order of structural and compositional maturity observed in these bole clays, indicate long hiatus between the two volcanic episodes. It is observed that the bole horizons suffered rigorous weathering, approximately 5 fold higher than the respective parent lava flows under the alternate wet and dry spells of climatic changes. Translating the production time estimates of clays associated with the 21 bole horizons, found in the eastern Deccan volcano-sedimentary succession, it is assessed that the minimum time required for their formation is approximately 7 my. Clay minerals that occur across the stratigraphic sequence show cyclic changes in the climate, favouring longer duration of volcanic activity. Late Maastrichtian Lameta beds post-date Deccan volcanism to 70 Ma or earlier to this. Considering the formation of bole clays in terms of time, it is possible that the volcanic activity started much earlier in the late Maastrichtian, and continued after 65 Ma or even later. Thus, the clay stratigraphy based estimates lend support to a prolong duration."

To constrain existing models for TJB events, we obtained a stratigraphically highly resolved dataset from a marine section at Kendlbachgraben, Austria. The topmost Triassic Kossen Formation contains low to medium-charged smectite and vermiculite as alteration products of mafic-ultramafic minerals. The clay minerals in the boundary mudstone are kaolinite 5 illite + muscovite >> smectite > chlorite. Predominant kaolinite suggests humid climate and abundant terrigenous input. In the lowermost Jurassic, the clay mineral pattern changes to illite + muscovite >> kaolinite >> smectite, which reflects change to less humid and more moderate climate. The topmost Kossen Formation also contains clay spherules. Their composition, shape and size indicate that they are alteration products of airborne volcanic glass droplets solidified in the air, settled in the sea and altered rapidly with negligible transport in terrestrial or marine environments. Our data are consistent with sudden climatic change at the TJB, as a result of large-scale volcanic activity of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province which produced distal airfall volcanic ash."
__label__UNRELATED	"Rifting under steamHow rift magmatism triggers methane venting from sedimentary basins  Abstract: During opening of a new ocean, magma intrudes into the surrounding sedimentary basins. Heat provided by the intrusions matures the host rock, creating metamorphic aureoles potentially releasing large amounts of hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons may migrate to the seafloor in hydrothermal vent complexes in sufficient volumes to trigger global warming, e.g., during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Mound structures at the top of buried hydrothermal vent complexes observed in seismic data off Norway were previously interpreted as sediment volcanoes, and the amount of released hydrocarbon was estimated based on this interpretation. Here, we present new geophysical and geochemical data from the Gulf of California suggesting that such mound structures could in fact be edifices constructed by the growth of black smokertype chimneys rather than sediment volcanoes. We have evidence for two buried and one active hydrothermal vent systems outside the rift axis. The active vent releases fluids of several hundred degrees Celsius containing abundant methane, mid-ocean ridge basalttype helium, and precipitating solids up to 300 m high into the water column. Our observations challenge the idea that methane is emitted slowly from rift-related vents. The association of large amounts of methane with hydrothermal fluids that enter the water column at high pressure and temperature provides an efficient mechanism to transport hydrocarbons into the water column and atmosphere, lending support to the hypothesis that rapid climate change such as during the PETM can be triggered by magmatic intrusions into organic-rich sedimentary basins. INTRODUCTION When testing climate models by hindcasts for past prominent warming events, it has become clear that significant drivers are missing (Panchuk et al., 2008; Carozza et al., 2011). Most striking, the reason for a 56 C global warming during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) remains elusive, although it has been estimated that >2000 Gt of carbon must have entered the atmosphere within a relatively short time span of a few thousand years (Dickens et al., 1995; Zachos et al., 2001). Light carbon-isotope ratios were interpreted to suggest that large amounts of biogenic carbon were released through runaway hydrate dissociation events (Kennett et al., 2000). But recent studies call this interpretation into question (Dickens, 2011; Biastoch et al., 2011). Most alternative explanations are also marred by contradictions with available data (Higgins and Schrag, 2006). This includes the hypothesis of carbon mobilization by magmatic intrusions into carbon-rich continental margin sediments during the opening of the North Atlantic (Svensen et al., 2004), because it is difficult to understand how this process could have injected large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere within a short time. THE ACTIVE HYDROTHERMAL MOUND IN THE GUAYMAS BASIN New data acquired in the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California; Fig. 1; Fig. DR1 in the GSA Data Repository1) support the tectonicmagmatic explanation for warming during the PETM. Our data show a 1050-m-wide and 100-m-high mound located above thick sediments ~1 km southeast of the northern rift axis of the Guaymas Basin that is emitting carbonrich hydrothermal fluids (Fig. 2A; Fig. DR4). 1 GSA Data Repository item 2016250, supplemental figures and references, and additional information on heat flow measurements, geochemical analysis of sediment pore water and water column samples, determination of the sedimentation rate, and further seismic information, is available online at www.geosociety .org /pubs /ft2016.htm, or on request from editing@ geosociety.org.

In the area of the mound, another chaotic and low-seismicamplitude seismic facies continues further downward to at least 2900 ms TWT or ~200250 m below seafloor. We interpret this facies as a conduit for the ascending hydrothermal fluids. At this depth, high-seismic-amplitude reflections extend southward from below the rift axis into the basin (Fig. 2A). These reflections are likely caused by magmatic intrusions which occur throughout the Guaymas Basin (Lizarralde et al., 2010), although it cannot be ruled out that some reflectors not associated with disturbed overburden may represent submarine lava flows. We observe no high-amplitude reflectors that would indicate magma emplacement within the top 200 m of sediments below the mound. The bathymetric data (Fig. 1) show the trace of a northeast-southweststriking normal fault that stretches to the mound and is dipping westward (Fig. DR2). As it strikes in the same direction as the elongate mound axis, it is probable that the shape of the mound is controlled by this fault. An ~20-m-thick chaotic seismic facies immediately below the base of the mound may indicate that hydrothermal seepage was initially occurring over a broader area and became more focused once fluid pathways had formed. The steep flanks of the mound, up to 30, suggest a high internal angle of repose of the mound-forming material. A 2.2-km-long profile of 10 heat-flow stations across the vent field and a 0.4-km-long profile of five stations along the mound consistently show heat-flow values >0.3 W/m2. The maximum heat flow on top of the mound is heterogeneous with values >10 W/m2, whereas values <3 W/m2 were measured only 100 m away from the center (Table DR1 in the Data Repository). This heatflow pattern is similar to the heat-flow distribution at sediment-free mid-ocean ridges (Rona et al., 1996). The strong lateral heat-flow variations indicate focused heat transport by hydrothermal fluids within narrow fluid pathways. Grab samples recovered from the surface of the mound close to the eastern summit show porous Fe-rich sulfides (Fig. DR3) consisting predominantly of a boxwork of pyrrhotite crystals with minor pyrite and marcasite and rare Znand Cu-sulfides (e.g., sphalerite, chalcopyrite, isocubanite). These are accompanied by a small fraction of non-sulfide minerals (e.g., carbonates, opal-A, and secondary Fe-oxyhydroxides). The mineralogy makes the samples from the northern rift axis similar to the massive sulfides recovered from the southern Guaymas Basin (Koski et al., 1985; Peter and Scott, 1988). However, they lack the abundant petroleum found in the southern rift samples. In analogy to black smoker deposits from Escanaba Trough (offshore northwest United States), the observed mineral assemblage suggests formation temperatures in the range of 270330 C (Zierenberg et al., 1993). TIMING OF HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY A 5-m-long gravity core was taken ~500 m away from the hydrothermal vent field (Fig. 3). The upper 4 m of the core consist of organic-rich, hemipelagic diatomaceous clay that is typical for most of Guaymas Basin (Von Damm et al., 1984). By contrast, the lowermost 1 m of core consists of coarse-grained hydrothermal deposits intercalated with clay lenses, suggesting that 600 m"

Sedimentary sequence and oxygen isotopic stratigraphy of high resolution in the near 200 ka of the southern SCS has been established. By the comparative analysis with GISP2's ice core, the depositional record of D/O1s events 1-21 and Heinrich's events HI-H6 in the southern SCS that reflected the quick climate change in short time scale since the last interglacial stage is revealed, which indicates that in the last 200 ka in the southern SCS and the Arctic area there was tele-connection of paleoclimate and the unstability of the Western Pacific Warm Pool. This note shows that the sedimentary layers order of this sea area classified by color identification and by oxygen isotope stratum has the very good corresponding relation. The color feature of sediment changes along with the climate and the former arranges a stagnant time of 1-1.5 ka generally. It was suggested that the paleoclimatic changes resulted in the rise and fall of sea level, the open and close of strait thoroughfare and the upwelling activity, which causes the changes of the oxidation-reduction condition of deep water along with the dynamic environment in this sea area, thus producing the different sediment features of sea bed.

The analysis of Greenland snow accumulated at Summit from 1967 to 1989 and 8 ky old ice has yielded values between 0.02-0.9 pg g-r . After normalising to aluminium concentrations, enhancements in bismuth concentrations were found to correlate significantly with three volcanic events. These enhancements are consistent with high bismuth concentrations observed in emissions from volcanoes. Compared with ancient ice recent bismuth concentrations are enhanced relative to aluminium implying either increased volcanic activity in the recent times or, more likely, a contribution from anthropogenic sources. 4. Conclusions: A mass spectrometric method has been developed to measure the concentration of Bi in snow and ice at Pg g- concentrations. The method, which employs TIMS, requires small volumes of sample and has an accuracy comparable with LEAFS, however it is simple to implement and is a fortuitous by-product of lead isotope abundance measurements. The method has been used to analyse Greenland snow to test the feasibility of identifying volcanic eruption in snow and ice archives. Measurements of Bi/Al ratios in snow deposited between 1967 and 1989 show substantial enhancements in three samples which appear to correlate with the 1970 Hekla (Iceland), 1974 Fuego (Guatemala), and the 1982 El Chichon (Indonesia) eruptions.Bi from volcanic emissions was shown to representa small but significant proportion of the Bi found in 8 ky ice. Also the average bismuth concentration in snow accumulated between 1967-89 is higher than that in ancient ice probably due to anthropogenic contributions, although increased volcanic activity in recent times is a second possibility."
__label__UNRELATED	"Cuticle surfaces of fossil plants as a potential proxy for volcanic SO2 emissions: observations from the TriassicJurassic transition of East Greenland  Abstract: Flood basalt volcanism has been implicated in several episodes of mass extinctions and environmental degradation in the geological past, including at the TriassicJurassic (TrJ) transition, through global warming caused by massive outgassing of carbon dioxide. However, the patterns of biodiversity loss observed are complicated and sometimes difficult to reconcile with the effects of global warming alone. Recently, attention has turned to additional volcanic products as potential aggravating factors, in particular sulphur dioxide (SO2). SO2 acts both directly as a noxious environmental pollutant and indirectly through forming aerosols in the atmosphere, which may cause transient global dimming and cooling. Here, we present a range of morphological changes to fossil plant leaf cuticle surfaces of hundreds of Ginkgoales and Bennettitales specimens across the TrJ boundary of East Greenland. Our results indicate that morphological structures of distorted cuticles near the TrJ boundary are consistent with modern cuticle SO2-caused damage and supported by recent leaf-shape SO2 proxy results, thus identifying cuticle surface morphology as a potentially powerful proxy for SO2. Recording the timing and duration of SO2 emissions in the past may help distinguish between the driving agents responsible for mass extinction events and thus improve our understanding of the Earth System. Conclusions: The fossil cuticle analysis presented here provides strong evidence for the detrimental effects of SO2 on Ginkgoales and Bennettitales cuticle surfaces across the TrJ boundary at Astarteklft, East Greenland. When considered together with previously reported evidence for SO2-mediated leaf shape change of multiple plant taxa, the findings of this study provide compelling evidence for a major role of SO2 in the ecosystem response observed across this transition, which includes the end-Triassic mass extinction. These findings provide a means of investigating the role of SO2 in mass extinction events, something that has previously proven elusive.Acknowledgements We would like to thank Prof. Jennifer C.

__label__UNRELATED	"Regional crustal thickness and precipitation in young mountain chains  Abstract: Crustal thickness is related to climate through precipitation-induced erosion. Along the Andes, the highest mountains and thickest crust ( 70 km) occur at 25 south, a region of low precipitation. Westerly winds warm passing over the Atacama Desert; precipitation is modest in the High Andes and eastward over the Altiplano. Severe aridity, hence low erosion rates, helps to account for the elevated volcanogenic contractional arc and high, internally draining plateau in its rain shadow. Weak erosion along the northcentral arc provides scant amounts of sediment to the ChilePeru Trench, starving the subduction channel. Subcrustal removal might be expected to reduce the crustal thickness, but is not a factor at 25 south. The thickness of the gravitationally compensated continental crust cannot reflect underplating and or partial fusion of sediments, but must be caused chiefly by volcanism-plutonism and contraction. Contrasting climate typifies the terrane at 45 south where moisture-laden westerly winds encounter a cool margin, bringing abundant precipitation. The alpine landscape is of lower average elevation compared with the north-central Andes and is supported by thinner continental crust ( 35 km). Intense erosion supplies voluminous clastic debris to the offshore trench, and vast quantities are subducted. However, the southern Andean crust is only about half as thick as that at 25 south, suggesting that erosion, not subcrustal sediment accretion or anatexis, is partly responsible for the thickness of the mountain belt. The Himalayas plus Tibetan Plateau, the Sierra Nevada plus Colorado Plateau, and the Japanese Islands exhibit analogous relationships between crustal thickness and climate."
__label__UNRELATED	"EOCENE DRAINAGE EVOLUTION AND EROSION OF THE SIERRA NEVADA BATHOLITH ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA  Abstract: Detrital zircon analysis of Eocene to Oligocene fluvial sediments (auriferous gravels) in the Yuba and Feather River drainages, northern California, provides new constraints on the evolution of the paleo-drainage system, sediment provenance, and the timing of sediment deposition and erosion of the Sierra Nevada batholith. 1292 new detrital zircon U-Pb ages in 14 samples indicate a regional shift in sediment provenance, from local sources, predominantly the youngest phase of Sierra Nevada arc magmatism, to basement terranes and extra-regional sources. The majority of samples contain zircon from one of two distinct Mesozoic sources, as well as 5 to 30 percent Precambrian grains, reflecting derivation from both the Sierra Nevada batholith and basement metamorphic belts of the northern Sierra Nevada (for example, Shoo Fly Complex), as well as possible contributions from central Nevada (for example, Roberts Mountain Allochthon, western Nevada Triassic strata). Cretaceous dominated samples, primarily located in the southwestern Yuba River drainage, were sourced predominantly from 85 to 120 Ma batholithic rocks, whereas Jurassicdominated samples, primarily located further east, lack mid-Cretaceous zircon and instead reflect derivation from older Jurassic crystalline and metamorphic rocks. These Jurassicdominated samples also contain sparse Eoceneearly Oligocene zircon from 42.7 to 33.0 Ma that establish an upper bound for their depositional age and likely require some extra-regional sediment input to the fluvial system, consistent with previously published sedimentologic and stratigraphic data. Overall, sampled detrital zircon age populations show that the majority of sediment deposited within the fluvial system was supplied from local metamorphic basement and/or regional batholith sources within the ancestral Sierra Nevada, with a small component of extra-regional sediment. These results support the conclusion from stratigraphic and stable isotope paleoaltimetry studies that the Sierra Nevada had a relatively steep western gradient in the EoceneOligocene, allowing for significant paleovalley incision and regional transport of sediment from upstream. When compared with Upper Cretaceous Great Valley group sediments, samples from the southwestern Yuba River region exhibit significantly larger proportions of 85 to 100 Ma zircon, characteristic of the voluminous Tuolumne Intrusive Series of the Sierra Nevada batholith. The predominance of Late Cretaceous detritus indicates that early to middle Eocene deposition of fluvial sediments may have coincided with deep erosion of the Tuolumne Intrusive Series. Subsequently, sediment provenance shifted from Tuolumne sources in the Late Cretaceousdominated sediments to local Jurassic basement and extra-basinal sources in late Eocene Jurassicdominated sediments. This may reflect progressive canyon incision and extension of headwaters eastward, and bypass of Tuolumne Intrusive Series. The youngest single-grain detrital zircon ages are similar to the range of ages of Eocene volcanic rocks in central Nevada. The presence of these grains suggests that paleo-river headwaters extended into central Nevada by Late Eocene, and that the paleo-drainage divide must have been located in easternmost Nevada. This provides additional support for the existence of a region of high elevation across what is now Nevada by late Eocene time."

However, an important constraint missing in these approximations has been the combined Cl and Br budgets for magmas erupted through large explosive eruptions, and their relevance for climate and atmospheric chemistry. The modern Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA) is an area with one of the largest densities of active volcanoes in the world, and has produced numerous felsic tephras from highly explosive eruptions during the late Pleistocene through the Holocene. Recent volcanological studies at the CAVA have addressed the along-arc tephrostratigraphy (Kutterolf et al., 2008a, 2007), evolution of single eruptive centers (e.g. Kutterolf et al., 2011; Newhall et al., 1987; Perez et al., 2009; Peterson and Rose, 1985; Wundermann and Rose, 1984), geochemical along-arc 6. Conclusions: Our data set of Br and Cl emissions from 29 large CAVA eruptions (VEI > 5) covers the regional range of magmatic compositions for the past 200 ka. The major conclusions from this time series for explosive chlorine and bromine release along an entire arc are that:1) Melt inclusions of the Central American tephras have concentrations of 0.9 to 17.9 ppm Br and 770 to 3790 ppm Cl and are thusS.Kutterolfet al./Earth and Planetary Science Letters 429 (2015) 234246 243and respective countries of origin are give in brackets). existing with melt before eruption is determined as the ce between maximum inclusion and average matrix glass ters given in Kutterolf et al. (2013) and complement thestrongly enriched compared to their respective matrix glasses with comparatively low concentrations of 0.4 to 1.3 ppm Br and 638 to 3340 ppm Cl. The variation of melt-inclusion concentrations within a sample, i.e. the difference between maximum and minimum observed concentration expressed as a percentage of the maximum, ranges between 9 and 90% for Br and 2 to 40% for Cl. These variations result from syn-crystallization partitioning of the halogens from the melt into a co-existing fluid phase.2) Our melt-inclusion data yield fluid/melt partition coefficients of DBr = 0.321 (0.316; Kutterolf et al., 2013) and DCl = 0.0030.9 (0.0030.8; Kutterolf et al., 2013); these values are typically one order of magnitude lower compared to previous studies by Bureau et al. (2010; Br: 2375) and Webster et al. (1999; Cl: 0.96). However, these values confirm a 4 to 68 times stronger partitioning into fluid for Br than for Cl in agreement with the observed variations in Cl/Br from 136 to 2451, a much broader range than previously recognized in magmatic systems.3) The maximum Br contents and minimum Cl/Br in melt inclusions along the CAVA, the best available approximations to initial magmatic conditions, correlate well with geochemical signals inherited from subducted sediments such as Ba/Th, Ba/Nb, and Ba/La which attain maximum values at Central Nicaragua and Southern El Salvador. This suggests subducted calcareous sediments, or fluids derived from them, as a major source of the arc-magmatic bromine contents.4) Erupted halogen masses of the investigated 29 eruptions range from roughly 2 to 1100 kt Br and from 0.1 to 800 Mt Cl. If 10% of these halogens reached the stratosphere, an average CAVA eruption would add 6 ppt Br (58% of recent annual loading of the stratosphere), 5.9 ppb Cl (277% of recent annual loading), and 6.2 ppb EESC (368% of recent annual loading) to the stratosphere with probably significant effect on stratospheric ozone. The data of the entire arc presented here doubles the bromine and at least triples the chlorine and EESC loading of the Nicaraguan estimate alone (cf. Kutterolf et al., 2013; Table 1). We use magnitude-frequency relationships to estimate how often volcanic halogen emissions of a given magnitude into the stratosphere may occur along the global subduction system.We have tracked and quantified the Br transfer through the Central American arc. Our study confirms and extends the results of Kutterolf et al. (2013) regarding the impact of halogens emitted from large eruptions on the composition of the atmosphere. This study reveals that pre-eruptive partitioning into a magmatic fluid is much more efficient for bromine than for chlorine. A primary control on the bromine inventory of subduction zones appears to be exerted by the subducted components, in particular by the composition of the incoming plate sediments, potentially enhanced by serpentinite fluids. The identification of such volatile recycling processes will be of great help for refining models and budgets of subduction zone volatiles at other arc systems worldwide."
__label__UNRELATED	"End-Permian Mass Extinction in the Oceans: An Ancient Analog for the Twenty-First Century?  Abstract: The greatest loss of biodiversity in the history of animal life occurred at the end of the Permian Period (252 million years ago). This biotic catastrophe coincided with an interval of widespread ocean anoxia and the eruption of one of Earths largest continental flood basalt provinces, the Siberian Traps. Volatile release from basaltic magma and sedimentary strata during emplacement of the Siberian Traps can account for most end-Permian paleontological and geochemical observations. Climate change and, perhaps, destruction of the ozone layer can explain extinctions on land, whereas changes in ocean oxygen levels, CO2, pH, and temperature can account for extinction selectivity across marine animals. These emerging insights from geology, geochemistry, and paleobiology suggest that the end-Permian extinction may serve as an important ancient analog for twenty-first century oceans. 89 A nn u.

__label__UNRELATED	"Eight centuries of volcanic signal and climate change at Talos Dome (East Antarctica)  Abstract: [1] During the 1996 Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide-International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition traverse, two firn cores were retrieved from the Talos Dome area (East Antarctica) at elevations of 2316 m (TD, 89 m long) and 2246 m (ST556, 19 m long). Cores were dated by using seasonal variations in non-sea-salt (nss) SO4 2 concentrations coupled with the recognition of tritium marker level (19651966) and nss SO4 2 spikes due to the most important volcanic events in the past (Pinatubo 1991, Agung 1963, Krakatoa 1883, Tambora 1815, Kuwae 1452, Unknown 1259). The number of annual layers recognized in the TD and ST556 cores was 779 and 97, respectively. The dD record obtained from the TD core has been compared with other East Antarctic isotope ice core records (Dome C EPICA, South Pole, Taylor Dome). These records suggest cooler climate conditions between the middle of 16th and the beginning of 19th centuries, which might be related to the Little Ice Age (LIA) cold period. Because of the high degree of geographical variability, the strongest LIA cooling was not temporally synchronous over East Antarctica, and the analyzed records do not provide a coherent picture for East Antarctica. The accumulation rate record presented for the TD core shows a decrease during part of the LIA followed by an increment of about 11% in accumulation during the 20th century. At the ST556 site, the accumulation rate observed during the 20th century was quite stable. 6. Conclusion: [46] A record of volcanic eruptions covering the last 800 years has been reported from a 90 m firn core drilled at Talos Dome (EastAntarctica). Volcanic chronology and tritium activity provided dating of the core and allowed for reconstruction of the climate over the past 800 years on a reliable timescale. From Talos Dome isotopic record, cooler climate conditions were inferred during the 17th, 18th, and beginning of 19th centuries, which might be associated to the LIA cold period. We would like to emphasise the fact that the LIA is not present in the TD core as a long-lasting cold period. In fact, with the exception of the period from 1680 to 1820, which was a more persistent cold interval, the isotopic record shows centennial scale fluctuations with warmer and cooler spells. On this basis it is quite difficult to say whether the LIA started during the 16th century or before. When compared with other East Antarctic isotope records, some discrepancies are apparent even if the main cooling trends during the LIA are in line. Cooler, windy conditions in East Antarctica during the LIA could have increased Southern Ocean deep water formation, as suggested by Broecker et al. [1999] on the basis of physical and geochemical studies in the Southern Ocean. [47] The recent warming phase (20th century) that is recognized in some Southern Hemisphere proxy records is not so evident in our records (both TD and ST556), or if you will, it seems to start just after 1970 and occurs before 1930. [48] We presented an accumulation rate record for the TD core with a decrease during part of the LIA followed by an increment of about 11% in accumulation during the 20th century. Average increasing values are calculated among dated horizons during the 20th century at the TD site, while accumulation rate was observed to be quite stable at ST556 during the same time period. [49] The large difference in core temperature, stable isotope content, and snow accumulation between ST556 and TD pointed out a greater role of warm-air intrusions and storms close to the ice divide between Oates Coast (Southern Ocean) and the Ross Sea. [50] More and more evidence coming from ice core records, glacier extension and other proxy records are leading to the idea that the Antarctic continent or at least East Antarctica also experienced the LIA cool episode. Obviously, a large temporal and spatial variability makes comparison among different records particularly difficult. Moreover, the ice core records considered are often separated by thousands of kilometers in a continent like Antarctica which presents a complicated climate pattern nowadays as well. A better spatial coverage and more proxy from well-dated records are needed in order to better understand natural climate variability on centennial and millennial timescales (including the LIA), extending the actual spatial coverage of climate archives both in Antarctica and in the whole Southern Hemisphere. [51] Large discrepancies between the data collected and the historical data used to calculate the net surface mass balance indicate that reliable estimates of mass balance for this sector of East Antarctica cannot be made at present without new snow accumulation studies along the drainage basin. The enormous uncertainty on input parameters for mass balance is due to incompleteness and inaccuracy of old measurements (pit stratigraphy) in this sector of the ice sheet. [52] Our results pointed out that Talos Dome has a good geochemical and paleoclimate record preserved in the ice, because the accumulation (80.5 mmwe yr 1) is higher there than at other domes in East Antarctica, and the ice thickness (about 1500 m) could cover more than a glacial-interglacial period. A deep drilling at Talos Dome could improve the knowledge about the response of near-coastal sites to climate changes and Holocene histories of accumulation rates in the Ross Sea region.[53] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Total sulfur dioxide emissions and preeruption vaporsaturated magma at Mount St. Helens, 198088  Abstract: SO2 from explosive volcanism can cause significant climatic and atmospheric impacts, but the source of the sulfur is controversial. TOMS, COSPEC, and ash leachate data for Mount St. Helens from the time of the climactic eruption on 18 May 1980 to the final stages of non-explosive degassing in 1988 give a total SO2 emission of 2 Mt. COSPEC data show a sharp drop in emission rate that was apparently controlled by a decreasing rate of magma supply. A total SO2 emission of only 0.08 Mt is estimated from melt inclusion data and the conventional assumption that the main sulfur source was pre-emption melt; commonly invoked sources of excess sulfur (anhydrite decomposition, basaltic magma, and degassing of non-erupted magma) are unlikely in this case. Thus melt inclusions may significantly underestimate SO2 emissions and impacts of explosive volcanism on climate and the atmosphere. Measured CO2 emissions, together with the H20 content of melt inclusions and experimental solubility data, indicate the Mount St. Helens dacite was vapor-saturated at depth prior to ascent and suggest hat a vapor phase was the main source of sulfur for the 2-Mt of SO2. A vapor source is consistent with experimental studies on the Mount St. Hetens dacite and removes the need for a much debated shallow magma body."
__label__UNRELATED	"Stratospheric loading and optical depth estimates of explosive volcanism over the last 2100 years derived from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core  Abstract: The high-resolution and lengthy records of volcanic aerosol deposition in ice cores allow assessment of the atmospheric mpact of different styles and magnitudes of past eruptions and the impact of volcanism during periods of varied climatic onditions. The 2100-year long volcanic SO42time series in the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core was used to calculate the mass stratospheric loading (MD) of H2SO 4 and resulting optical depth values (XD = MD/1.5 x 10 TM g) for individual, and multiple, closely spaced eruptions. Calibration of the calculated optical depth values with other compilations panning the last 150 years provides a range of values for each eruption or set of eruptions essential to quantifying the climate forcing capabilities of each of these events. Limitations on the use of the results exist because this is only a single ice core, sampling was biannual and transport, and deposition of aerosols is not consistent among individual eruptions. The record of volcanic optical depth estimates is characterized by distinct rends within three consecutive 700-year time periods. The period from 100 B.C. to A.D. 600 is characterized by the fewest eruptions, and optical depth values are lower than those in the rest of the record. The exception is an extremely large signal of 3 years duration that is probably associated with an unknown Icelandic eruption around 53 B.C., with the possible contribution of another high-latitude ruption. The presence of another signal at 43 B.C. suggests that at least two eruptions impacted climate in the middle decade of the 1st century B.C. The period from A.D. 600 to 1300 has intermediate numbers and magnitudes of volcanic events except for the very large 1259 event. Stratospheric loading and optical depths values for the 1259 event are twice that for Tambora (A.D. 1815). The state of the climate system in the middle of the thirteenth century A.D. may not have been sensitive nough to the atmospheric perturbation of the 1259 eruption, thus the apparent lack of abundant proxy evidence of climatic cooling around A.D. 1260. The most recent 700 years (A.D. 1400-1985) are characterized by the greatest number of eruptions (half of those recorded over the 2100 years of record) and, in general, the highest stratospheric loading and optical depth values for individual and the combined effects of multiple eruptions. The large Kuwae eruption (A.D. 1450s) may have perturbe the atmosphere at least as much as Krakatau and possibly of a magnitude similar to Tambora. Multiple eruptions in the 50to 60-year periods from A.D. 1580s-1640s and A.D. 1780s-1830s may have had a significant impact on enhancing the already cool climatic conditions in those time periods, particularly around A.D. 1601 and 1641. These findings imply that multiple eruptions closely spaced in time are more likely to have a major impact on a decadal time scale when existing climatic conditions are in a more sensitive or transitional state. The GISP2 ice core record also indicates that several relatively unknown eruptions may have been large sulfur producers during the 17th and 19th centuries A.D., thereby warranting further studies of those particular events."

These flood basalts presently cover about 500,000 km2 in central and western parts of peninsular India, with outlying occurrences extending as far as the southeastern coast of the subcontinent. The Deccan volcanism represents one of the largest occurrences of continentalflood basalt provinces in theworld.

Conclusions: Stable-isotope and trace-element determinations of ostracod shells from intertrappean sediments in India have good potential for the reconstruction of late Cretaceous palaeoenvironments. Detailed observational and geochemical analyses illustrate that preservation of ostracods is variable, although some amount of alteration does not necessarily compromise the geochemical signature. Where preservation is adequate, we have shown that meaningful palaeoenvironmental information can be derived from stable-isotope and trace-element determinations of ostracod shells. Our analyses of ostracods from one section, at Lakshmipur in Kutch, northwestern India, yielded the following information about this late Cretaceous site:(1). The late Cretaceous palaeo-lake at Lakshmipur was sourced by meteoric water, with no evidence of marine intrusion, despite likely proximity of the site to the palaeo-coastline. (2). The palaeo-lake shows signs of evaporative enrichment, in that the reconstructed water isotope values are significantly higher than those of contemporary meteoric water. This conclusion is consistent with other palaeoclimatic data for northwestern India during the late Cretaceous and suggests that the lake had a relatively long residence time and was behaving as a hydrologically-closed system. (3). The carbon-isotope values in ostracods from Lakshmipur are open to a range of possible explanations, although are consistent with a fairly productive lake with long residence time. (4). Differences in the oxygen-isotope values between different ostracod species from Lakshmipur can be explained by speciesdependent differences in offsets from oxygen-isotope equilibrium, whereas differences in carbon-isotope values are better explained by habitat preferences. (5). The actual magnitudes of the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca values for ostracods from Lakshmiupr are difficult to interpret, but the trends and the existence of covariance between the two trace-element ratios provide additional support for the conclusion that the palaeo-lake was hydrologically closed."
__label__SUPPORT	"Some aspects of the PermianTriassic boundary (PTB) and of the possible causes for the biotic crisis around this boundary  Abstract: The first appearance datum (FAD) of Hindeodus parvus is an excellent datum very close to the base of the Otoceras woodwardi Zone (priority base of the Triassic). For the first time, it allows an exact correlation of the PTB in all marine facies and faunal realms. The following features of the extinction and recovery patterns near the PTB are most important for the search for causes of the PTB biotic crisis: (1) most strongly affected were the (siliceous) plankton (radiolarians) and the warm-water benthos and nekton; (2) most of the cold-water faunas were not significantly affected; (3) the recovery of the warm-water benthos and siliceous plankton occurred only after an unusually long time (during the late Olenekian and Middle Triassic); (4) the productivity of the terrestrial plants dropped strongly and the recovery was mainly in the upper Olenekian and in the Middle Triassic; (5) several terrestrial extinction events occurred at different levels within the Upper Permian, considerable before the marine PTB; at or close to the FAD of Lystrosaurus no extinction event in the terrestrial faunas can be observed; (6) terrestrial faunal elements that survived the DzhulfianDorashamian extinctions were able to survive some months of extreme climatic conditions by hibernation-like life stages (vertebrates), or by dryand freezing-resistant eggs (conchostracans); (7) about 50% of the genera that disappeared at the PTB re-appeared in the OlenekianMiddle Triassic interval (Lazarus taxa), or in this time interval genera appeared that had undoubtedly evolved from genera that had disappeared at the PTB; and (8) the PTB is preceded by mass occurrences of marine (and continental?) fungi, and the fungal spike ends abruptly a little before the PTB. A scenario for the PTB biotic crisis is elaborated that takes into consideration: the real (not interpolated) diversity patterns of different marine and continental fossil groups, the exact correlation of bioevents in different faunal realms and facies, the strong biotic crisis in the Tethyan warm-water faunas in contrast to the much weaker biotic event in cold-water faunas, the severe DzhulfianDorashamian climate in many parts of the world caused by the continentocean configuration and by Siberian Trap volcanism, the cooling of the Boreal area by the northward drift of Pangaea that interrupted the exchange of warm-water benthos between the Tethys and western North America during the Guadalupian, the extinction event at the GuadalupianLopingian boundary that restricted most of the affected warm-water faunas to the Tethys, the importance of lower Scythian anoxia that reached an unusually shallow level, and above all the effects of the contemporaneous huge volcanic events about 250 m.y. ago on the Siberian Platform and in the eastern Tethys that caused a 36-months-lasting volcanic winter with strong cooling in low latitudes, followed by a strong global warming. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions scenario for the PTB biotic crisis: In the following, a scenario for the continental and marine biotic crisis at the PTB is presented, and those conditions before this boundary are also mentioned that prepared the setting for the PTB biotic crisis. The Permian northward drift of Pangaea brought large parts of Pangaea into the tropical subtropical belt. By this, rather severe climatic con-ditions were present on large parts of Pangaea during the Late Permian, such as aridity and strong daily and seasonal temperature differences. A part of the faunas became adapted to survive several months of very severe climate (long drought, low winter temperatures below the freezing point in areas with hot or warm summers). At the same time, northern Pangaea drifted into the Boreal realm and the Upper Permian climate there became colder. This led to the disappearance of major warm-water fossil groups in the Arctic long before the PTB, such as the fusulinids at the base of the Guadalupian. Faunal exchange of warm-water benthos between the Tethys and the western shelf of America across the northern margin of Pangaea became more difficult and was finally interrupted. As a consequence, a strong provincialism developed with different shallow, warm-water faunas on the western shelf of America and in the Tethys. A very rapid and strong regression at the Guadalupian Lopingian boundary destroyed the habitats of large shelf areas (e.g. the Delaware Basin of southwestern North America changed into a hypersaline basin). In other basins, like the Phosphoria Basin, the warmwater fauna was additionally harmed by widespread upwelling of cold bottom water during the Guadalupian. Connected regional extinctions led to the disappearance of fusulinids on the western America warm-water shelf during the lowermost Dzhulfian. As benthic warm-water faunas could no longer migrate between the Tethys and western North America through the southern margin of the Boreal sea, major groups such as the fusulinids were restricted to the Tethys and eastern Perigondwana in the upper Dzhulfian and Dorashamian.After a very warm period in the lower Dzhulfian, since the upper part of the lower Dzhulfian, the climate became periodically more severe due to the influence of the largely explosive stage of Siberian Trap volcanism. At the same time, a slight global cooling began. Warm-water faunas successively disappeared from high and medium latitudes. At the Panthalassa margin of the Boreal sea, the last representatives of the C. leveniC. subcarinata warm-water lineage disappeared at the top of the C. niuzhuanensis Zone (lower Dzhulfian). In median latitudes the disappearance of the warm-water conodonts was somewhat later, after the upper Dzhulfian C. orientalis Zone.The eruptions of the Siberian Trap became increasingly stronger during the Dorashamian. Reduced input of sunlight because of aerosols of sulphate and dust favoured the development of marine (and continental?) fungi that became very common during the late Dorashamian (fungi spike). Acid rain harmed the gymnosperm forests and other plants, but did not influence swamp floras with Lycopodiales that were adapted to acid soil. Therefore, in many parts of the world, Lycopodiales floras indicated by increasing amounts of trilete cavate spores became common and in many places dominant, whereas the amount of gymnosperms decreased in the uppermost Permian. Repeated very short periods of cooling in low latitudes connected with dust and sulphate aerosols of the Siberian Trap volcanism, led to a drop in diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and freshwater faunas well before the PTB. At first the larger terrestrial tetrapods were affected (during the Dzhulfian), later those ostracods disappeared that preferred permanently warm climate, and latest a part of the conchostracans were affected. High-latitude faunas (adapted to survive polar night) became dominant also in medium and low latitudes. By this extinction mode, in the uppermost Dorashamian a low-diversity terrestrial and freshwater fauna was present, in which forms prevailed that could survive severe climatic conditions, including short cooler periods in low-latitude areas (Lystrosaurus at the terrestrial vertebrates, Falsisca and Eueestheria among conchostracans, Darwinula among the freshwater ostracods). Forms adapted to permanently warm climate become rare (Dicynodon).Cold climate in the Boreal realm, mainly caused by the northwards drift of Pangaea that brought the present Boreal areas into Upper Permian high northern latitudes, but worsened by the huge volcanic activity of the Siberian Trap, and a regression followed by a transgression led to the establishment of the very low-diversity Boreal Otoceras fauna during the late Dorashamian. At the beginning, beside cold and cool water conodonts of the C. carinata and H. typicalis lineages, there were last representatives of those conodonts that lived in low latitudes both in warm water and in cool bottom water (C. deflecta), but they soon disappeared. Highly diverse marine warm-water faunas were in that time restricted to the Tethys, low to moderately diverse marine faunas occurred in Perigondwana.In this situation, around 250 m.y. ago, the effusion of the Siberian Trap basalts culminated over an area of at least 2.5 million km2, possibly even up to 45 million km2, and huge highly explosive eruptions of acid to intermediate volcanism occurred in the eastern Tethys or at the TethyanPanthalassa margin, likewise in the Northern Hemisphere. Huge amounts of dust and sulphate aerosols came into the atmosphere and at least in the eastern Tethys a fall-out of volcanic dust over an area of at least 2 million km2 occurred. A drastic drop in temperature occurred also in the low latitudes, which lasted about 36 month (volcanic winter). Probably two such events occurred close to the PTB, one a little before the PTB (at the base of the C. meishanensisH. latidentatus praeparvus Zone) and the other a little after the PTB (at the base of the I. isarcica Zone). The time difference between both events was short (100,000 200,000 years). Most of the extinctions occurred in this time interval.The shallow water of the Tethyan shelves, the refugium for most of the latest Permian warm-water benthos, was cooled down below the critical temperatures for reef communities and the entire warmwater benthos, but in many places the entire warmwater nekton also disappeared on the shelves. Drastically reduced input of sunlight destroyed the feed source and ultimately nearly all the skeleton-bearing plankton (Radiolaria). The climatic catastrophe was more severe in the Northern Hemisphere, where the two huge volcanic centres were situated.The cold-water Otoceras fauna of the Boreal realm was not affected by this climatic catastrophe. The temperate- to cool-water eastern Perigondwana shelf was moderately affected because the number of warm-water adapted species was lower than in the tropical Tethys, and the climatic catastrophe was not as severe as in the Northern Hemisphere. A bipolar fauna was established, as Otoceras from the Boreal realm invaded this area at the base of the Triassic. The low-diversity uppermost Dorashamian terrestrial and freshwater fauna, to a large part already adapted to shorter periods of severe climate (freezing temperatures or drought), survived to a large part (e.g. Lystrosaurus that could also live in high southern latitude areas with polar night, conchostracans with dry- and freezing-resistant eggs, Darwinula that occurred both in tropical and Boreal areas), afterthose faunal elements that were adapted to permanent warm climate had died out earlier during the Dzhulfian and Dorashamian. Only the last representatives of the latter fauna, like Dicynodon, became extinct. The opportunistic swamp flora was not much affected by a short-lasting temperature drop also in low latitudes and acid rain, but some Permian gymnosperms disappeared. Only in the eastern Tethyan humid-tropical Cathaysia province, rather abrupt distinct changes in the flora can be observed. The tropical FilicalesPteridospermophyta rain forest flora largely disappeared, and the tropical highland flora of gymnosperms survived. Therefore, the Cathaysia flora became rich in gymnosperms (sudden increase in bisaccate pollen) during the biotic crisis in connection with the volcanic dust fall-out, whereas in other floral realms the spores (especially of the Lycopodiales swamp flora) became dominant over the bisaccate pollen. The explosive eruptions of the eastern Tethyan volcanic centre were so strong that even the ozone layer was depleted. By the strong UV radiation the mass occurrences of marine (or continental?) fungi suddenly disappeared nearly completely. The drop in water temperature in the central tropical Panthalassa was not so severe that the warm-water fauna disappeared from the narrow shelves of intraoceanic insular areas, where many warm-water taxa survived.The high content of dust in the atmosphere caused strong precipitation in those Boreal areas that were previously rather dry, and in the low-latitude dry girdles. By strong freshwater input in the Boreal sea, the downward sinking of the cold heavy surface water was interrupted or became insignificant. As a consequence, the cold oxygen-rich bottom water currents towards the low latitudes became insignificant. This caused widespread oceanic anoxia that reached to an unusually shallow level and prevented the recovery of the shallow, warm-water benthos in the Tethys.After the end of the Siberian Trap volcanism within the upper Gangetian, the global warming caused by the greenhouse gases (CO2 and high amount of water vapour) was no longer counterbalanced by the volcanic dust and sulphate aerosols. This caused a strong global warming at the beginning of the Gandarian (Dienerian) that was especially strong in the high latitudes. As a consequence, there was a minor extinction event in cold-waterfaunas that had survived the PTB biotic crisis (e.g. hindeodid conodonts), but above all, the oceanic anoxia continued. Thus, the warm-water benthos that had largely survived on the narrow shelves of inner oceanic islands in the tropical Panthalassa could not return to the Tethyan shelves for more than 5 m.y. As oceanic islands are unstable biotopes, during this long time many refuges were destroyed. Thus, finally, the strongly delayed recovery led to a delayed extinction, but many taxa survived this long interval of relative isolation. After the end of the anoxia they re-appeared on the Tethyan shelves during the late Olenekian or during the Middle Triassic. The anoxia was not the reason for the biotic crisis on a global scale (but an important reason for regional extinctions), but played an important role in the global extinction because this caused an unusually long delay in recovery. The survival of the warm-water benthos on inner oceanic insular relic areas explains the high percentage of Lazarus taxa, which constitute in some groups more than 90% of the genera that disappeared close to the PTB.A good example of insular survival of warmwater faunas that died out on the continental shelves long before, was given by Stanley (1993). He reported Sinemurian reefs with Triassic corals from Cordilleran volcanic terranes, whereas on the known shelves less than 1% of the Triassic corals survived into the Jurassic. The difference from the PTB biotic crisis is the rapid recovery of the faunas at the TriassicJurassic boundary because of the absence of a long and severe anoxic event.This scenario explains nearly all details of the extinction patterns in continental and marine biotopes. Only a few details are more difficult to explain. One is the strongly delayed recovery of the siliceous plankton that only began in the upper Olenekian. A possible explanation is that nearly all skeleton-bearing Radiolaria became extinct near the PTB, and the Triassic radiolarian fauna developed new from skeleton-less or spicular radiolarians (Kozur et al., 1996a). As the recovery of the high productivity of terrestrial plants was also in the upper Olenekian, there may be additionally still some unknown environmental factors that prevented the lower and middle Scythian recovery of the marine warm-water benthos, the siliceous plankton and the terrestrial plant communities."
__label__SUPPORT	"The dawn of CAMP volcanism and its bearing on the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption  Abstract: The cause-and-effect relationship between the c. 201 Ma eruption of the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) and the end-Triassic abrupt climate change and mass extinction is at present based on controversial temporal correlations. Upper Triassic sedimentary strata underlying CAMP basalts in Morocco illustrate a clear mineralogical and geochemical fingerprint of early CAMP basaltic eruptions, namely unusually high contents of MgO (1032 wt%) and of mafic clay minerals (1184%). In the same rocks a coincident negative carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) is present, equivalent to the so-called initial negative CIE recorded worldwide shortly before the TriassicJurassic boundary. The new data show that the onset of CAMP activity preceded the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption and that the initial negative CIE is unequivocally synchronous with CAMP volcanism. The results of this study strongly support the hypothesis that the culmination of pollution of atmosphere and seawater by CAMP-derived volcanic gases was the proximate cause of the end-Triassic mass extinction.

The initial negative CIE was followed by a long-term 3.5 main negative CIE (sensu Hesselbo et al. 2002) coincident with the first appearance of Jurassic biota. A recently defined minor (2 to 3) late Rhaetian precursor negative CIE (sensu Ruhl & kurschner 2011) in organic matter preceded the initial negative CIE (Fig. 1). As suggested by several researchers, one of the trigger mechanisms of the end-Triassic mass extinction and accompanying negative CIEs may have been the release of volcanic gases (mainly CO2 and SO2) from the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) into the oceanatmosphere system (Hesselbo et al. 2002; Guex et al. 2004; Marzoli et al. 2004; Palfy et al. 2007; Deenen et al. 2010; Whiteside et al. 2010; Ruhl et al. 2011; Schaller et al. 2011; Lindstrom et al. 2012; Mander et al. 2013). The relative timing of the magmatic event and of the negative CIEs, however, remains controversial. Radioisotopic dating (e.g. Schoene et al. 2010; Marzoli et al. 2011; Blackburn et al. 2013) suggests a synchrony between CAMP and mass extinction. A new zircon UPb radioisotopic age for a CAMP intrusion (Amelal sill), which possibly fed the second volcanic unit of the Argana Basin, Morocco, is indistinguishable in age (201.564 0.23 Ma) from the calculated age of a palynological turnover; that is, the disappearance of Patinasporites densus and the fern spike, recorded in the newark Basin and considered as recording the end-Triassic extinction (Blackburn et al. 2013). Radioisotopic dating of CAMP basalts does not resolve the relative timing of the onset of CAMP volcanism and of the carbon cycle perturbation and mass extinction. In fact, previous studies recording the initial negative CIE in continental sediments fixed it at a level below the first CAMP lava flows both in north America and Morocco (Deenen et al. 2010, 2011; Whiteside et al. 2010). Geochemical and mineralogical data from the marine section of kendlbachgraben in the northern Calcareous Alps (Austria) give evidence of distal deposition of mafic volcanic material, possibly deriving from early explosive CAMP activity that is coeval with or slightly precedes the initial CIE and the mass extinction level (Palfy & zajzon 2012). However, the extinction among various marine and terrestrial fauna and flora seems to have started before the initial CIE (e.g. Wignall & Bond 2008; Lindstrom et al. 2012; Mander et al. 2013). Hence, potential cause-and-effect relationships between CAMP volcanism, the initial negative CIE, and extinction on land and in the oceans are not rigorously established, given that existing data from below-CAMP continental sedimentary successions only suggest that the initial negative CIE and extinction stratigraphically preceded the initial outpouring of CAMP basalt. To constrain the relative timing between CAMP volcanism and the perturbation of the carbon cycle and thus elucidate further the possible role of the CAMP in triggering the end-Triassic environmental disruption and, by association, the mass extinction, two continental sedimentary successions cropping out below the oldest CAMP flood basalts in the Central High Atlas (Morocco) were investigated. Combined CTOC ( 13C of total organic carbon), palynology, major and trace elements, and mineralogy of the sediments precisely constrain the sequence of end-Triassic events. Conclusions: The new C-isotope, mineralogical, elemental and palynological data from two stratigraphic sections in Morocco that crop out below the oldest CAMP basalt flow give crucial new information about the links and the relative timing between end-Triassic volcanism, carbon cycle disruption and, by inference, mass extinction.(1) The studied sections are biostratigraphically constrained to the Late Triassic owing to the presence of a distinctive norian Rhaetian sporomorph assemblage (e.g. Classopollis murphyae, Classopollis torosus, Classopollis meyeranus, Patinasporites densus).(2) Immediately below the first CAMP flood basalt an up to c. 6 negative CIE has been recorded in organic matter and can be correlated with the initial end-Triassic CIE recognized worldwide in both continental and marine sections.(3) The studied sediments are characterized by unusually high mafic clay-mineral (up to 84%) and MgO (up to 32 wt%) content with peaks at multiple levels. Given the geological history of the region, and excluding the possibility of contact metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration, the presence of these minerals is best explained by the alteration and transport of early erupted CAMP basaltic material into the Central High Atlas basins.(4) The initial negative CIE in the Central High Atlas coincides with an abrupt increase in sedimentary levels of mafic CAMP-derived minerals. This relative maximum in mafic mineral abundance could correspond in time to a distinct peak of CAMP volcanism that exposed large areas of basalt to superficial weathering.(5) The data show that CAMP volcanism was already active when the positive rebound from the precursor negative CIE and the initial negative CIE occurred. These results show that the outpouring of CAMP basalt preceded the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption and, by inference, the mass extinction.(6) This study supports the hypotheses that the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption was triggered by CAMP volcanism, and that relative long-term pollution of the atmosphere and ocean by CAMP volcanic gases, such as CO2 and SO2, could have caused a progressive loss of marine and terrestrial species culminating in the endTriassic mass extinction.We thank P.

__label__SUPPORT	"Calcareous nannofossils and Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events  Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were documented and formalised as intervals of widespread to global deposition of organic matter. The Toarcian, Early Aptian (OAE1a) and latest Cenomanian (OAE2) OAEs are truly global in nature, commonly carbonate-poor, and typically represented by organic carbon-rich black shales. In some areas, these OAEs are also characterised by abundant radiolarian-sands and silts. They are associated with negative and positive excursions in the Sr/Sr record, in addition to large global carbon-isotope anomalies in carbonate and/or organic matter, caused by a major perturbation of the global carbon budget. Increased rates of volcanism during the formation of the Ontong Java (and Manihiki) and Caribbean Plates, and the Karoo-Ferrar Traps, are believed to have caused the geological responses associated with OAE1a, OAE2, and the Toarcian OAE, respectively. Excess volcanogenic CO2 in the atmosphere most probably turned the climate into a greenhouse mode, accelerating continental weathering and increasing nutrient content in oceanic surface-waters via river run-off. Higher fertility in the global ocean was also probably triggered directly by submarine igneous events that introduced enormous quantities of biolimiting metals within hydrothermal plumes. Because Mesozoic OAEs are often represented by carbonate-poor sediments, quantitative studies of calcareous nannofossils have been applied to explore (a) the causes and effects of igneous/tectonic events and climate changes, relative to nannofloral increases and crises, as well as (b) dissolution events, and (c) diagenetic modifications. Characterization of calcareous nannofloras in OAE intervals can improve our understanding of the marine ecosystem and biological processes such as photosynthesis (biological pump) and biomineralisation (carbonate pump) that affect the organic and inorganic carbon cycle, as well as adsorption of atmospheric CO2 in the oceans. Types and rates of nannoplankton production and evolution are interpreted to trace the impact of major palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic events. In selected sections, it has been documented that calcareous nannofloras rapidly reacted to new conditions of fertility and higher pCO2 by drastically reducing calcification. As in the modern oceans, during OAEs the increase of nutrients and atmospheric CO2 induced higher abundances of nannoplankton producing small placoliths and inhibited the deep-photic zone nannoconids and schizosphaerellids. Similarly to the nannoconid crisis preceding deposition of the Early Aptian OAE1a black shales, a schizosphaerellid crisis is detected prior to the Toarcian OAE. Both OAEs are further characterised by a rapid nannofloral speciation, beginning approximately 1.5 myr before the OAE, but without extinctions. Global changes during the latest Cenomanian OAE 2 exerted different influences on calcareous nannoplankton that experienced a turnover due to most extreme environmental conditions. This event, in fact, was a time of extinctions followed by originations within calcareous 0377-8398/$ see front matter D 2004 Elsevier B.V.

__label__UNRELATED	"Why tropical island endemics are acutely susceptible to global change  Abstract: Tropical islands are species foundries, formed either as a by-product of volcanism, when previously submerged seabed is thrust upwards by tectonics, or when a peninsula is isolated by rising sea level. After colonisation, the geographical isolation and niche vacancies provide the competitive impetus for an evolutionary radiation of distinct speciesisland endemics. Yet the very attributes which promote speciation in evolutionary time also leave island endemics highly vulnerable to recent and rapid impacts by modern people. Indeed, the majority of documented human-driven extinctions have been exacted upon island endemics. The causes include over-exploitation, invasive species brought by people and destruction of islands naturally constrained habitats. Imminent threats include inundation by rising sea levels and other adaptive pressures related to anthropogenic global warming. We review recent work which underscores the susceptibility of island endemics to the drivers of global change, and suggest a methodological framework under which, we argue, the science and mitigation of island extinctions can be most productively advanced."
__label__SUPPORT	"Significant radiative impact of volcanic aerosol in the lowermost stratosphere  Abstract: Despite their potential to slow global warming, until recently, the radiative forcing associated with volcanic aerosols in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS) had not been considered. Here we study volcanic aerosol changes in the stratosphere using lidar measurements from the NASA CALIPSO satellite and aircraft measurements from the IAGOS-CARIBIC observatory. Between 2008 and 2012 volcanism frequently affected the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere aerosol loadings, whereas the Southern Hemisphere generally had loadings close to background conditions. We show that half of the global stratospheric aerosol optical depth following the Kasatochi, Sarychev and Nabro eruptions is attributable to LMS aerosol. On average, 30% of the global stratospheric aerosol optical depth originated in the LMS during the period 20082011. On the basis of the two independent, high-resolution measurement methods, we show that the LMS makes an important contribution to the overall volcanic forcing. DOI: 10.1038/ncomms8692 OPEN"
__label__UNRELATED	"Fire or ice: Anticorrelation of volcanism and glaciation in California over the past 800,000 years  Abstract: Compilation of published ages of Quaternary volcanism in eastern California indicates that volcanism was episodic, with maxima occurring during interglacial periods. The smoothed age distribution shows peaks at 10, 100, 185, 320, and 690 kyr, corresponding to interglacial cycles 1, 5, 7, 9, and 17. This implies that volcanism was modulated by changes in climate, although the processes that link the two are not well understood. Several factors, including transient loads imposed across rugged topography by ice and water and changes in groundwater regime, may provide the link. Although climatic modulation of volcanism is generally tied to changes in sea level, these data indicate that even volcanoes far from the coast can be affected by climatic change."
__label__UNRELATED	"Indian monsoon and North Atlantic Oscillation signals reflected by Cl- and Na+ in a shallow ice core from Dasuopu glacier, Xixabangma, Himalaya  Abstract: Information about past atmospheric circulation and climate change can be revealed by the chemical constituents of ice cores. Based on the analytical results of Cl and Na concentrations in an 18.5 m ice core, which contains 14 annual layers, from the Dasuopu glacier, central Himalaya, a significant correlation is found between Cl and Na concentrations. This, along with the average Cl/Na weight ratio of 1.9, indicates that moisture at the drilling site came mostly from oceans. Furthermore, there was a high positive correlation between the Cl/Na ratio in the summer monsoon layers and the monsoon rainfall in northeast India, and there exists a teleconnection between the Cl and Na concentrations in this shallow ice core and the North Atlantic Oscillation. CONCLUSIONS: Here we present preliminary studies on the climatic and environmental significances of Cl^ and Na+ concentrations recorded in an 18.5 m long ice core from Dasuopu glacier, central Himalaya. Snow chemistry and meteorological data suggest that the vapor arriving at this high drilling site comes mostly from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon season, and possibly from the North Atlantic Ocean duringthe non-monsoon season.The high Cl^ and Na+ concentrations reflect the influence of the strong westerlies on the high central Himalaya. The trend of variations in the Cl^/Na+ ratio in the MS layers was similar to that of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall. Consequently, the comprehensive analyses tell us that the records of deep ice cores from this glacier could be used to study the impact of the Indian monsoon on climate change over the Tibetan Plateau, and the interaction between the variations in the Indian monsoon and the NAO or the westerlies."
__label__UNRELATED	"Late Quaternary sedimentation in the Lesser Antilles island arc  Abstract: Investigation of patterns and processes of late Quaternary sedimentation in the Lesser Antilles island arc indicates that the major components of deep-water sediment are volcaniclastic silt and clay, redeposited shallow-water carbonate (mainly aragonite and high-Mg calcite), pelagic carbonate (mainly low-Mg calcite), and windblown dust from Africa. Although sediment derived from the adjacent South American continent is included in accreted trench deposits, marine deposition of this sediment within the arc is insignificant, except at the south end of the forearc. Distribution of sedimentary components within the Lesser Antilles arc is controlled primarily by arc volcanism. A Miocene shift in the locus of volcanism, which caused the arc to bifurcate, created two sedimentologic regimes. In the southern part of the arc, which is characterized by volcanically active islands with high relief, deep-water sediment is dominantly volcaniclastic. In contrast, in the northern part of the arc, where a broad arc platform separates high-relief, active volcanoes from low-relief, extinct volcanoes surrounded by wide carbonate shelves, deep-water sediment is composed mainly of redeposited shallow-water carbonate, pelagic carbonate, and eolian-transported Saharan dust. Superposed on the facies patterns determined by arc volcanism is a subtle, but distinct record of Quaternary climate change. Glacial-interglacial periods are recorded in deep-water sediment by variations in sedimentation rate, composition, and texture. Volcaniclastic sedimentation responded to lowstands of sea level by increased sedimentation rates and thicker and/or more frequent turbidites, reflecting intensified currents in interisland passages and increased erosion of exposed insular shelves. Deepwater carbonate sedimentation records decreased carbonate productivity on exposed shelves and in the open ocean during glacial lowstands, as well as variations in carbonate preservation associated with changes in ocean circulation. Deposition of Saharan dust increased during glacial periods because of intensified wind strengths. SYNTHESIS AND CONCLUSIONS: Deep-water sedimentation within the Lesser Antilles arc reflects the complex interaction of the carbonate, volcanogenic, and siliciclastic depositional processes described above.

__label__UNRELATED	"The Effects of Habitat Type and Volcanic Eruptions on the Breeding Demography of Icelandic Whimbrels Numenius phaeopus  Abstract: Distinct preference of species for habitats is most often driven by long term differences in demographic rates between habitats. Estimating variation in those rates is key for developing successful conservation strategies. Stochastic events can interact with underlying variation in habitat quality in regulating demography but the opportunities to explore such interactions are rare. Whimbrels in Iceland show a strong preference for sparsely vegetated riverplains. Such habitats in Iceland face various threats, e.g., climate change, river regulation and spread of alien plant species. In this study we compared demographic parameters of breeding Whimbrels between riverplains and other habitats before, during and after volcanic eruption events to estimate the importance of the habitats for the species and the effect of ash deposit on breeding success. We found that an estimated minimum of 23% of the Icelandic population of Whimbrels and c. 10% of the world population of the species breed in riverplain habitats in Iceland. Whimbrels bred consistently at much higher densities in riverplain habitats than in other habitats and riverplains also had higher densities of pairs with fledglings although the proportion of successful breeders was similar between habitats. Predation by livestock may have had a considerable negative effect on breeding success on our study sites. Breeding was negatively affected by the volcanic activity, probably through the effects of ash on the invertebrate food supply, with breeding success being gradually worse closer to the eruption. Breeding success was equally affected by volcanism across habitats which differed in underlying habitat quality. This study gives an example of how populations can be regulated by factors which operate at different spatial scales, such as local variation in habitat quality and stochastic events which impact larger areas.

__label__UNRELATED	"Phanerozoic geological evolution of Northern and Central Africa: An overview  Abstract: The principal paleogeographic characteristics of North and Central Africa during the Paleozoic were the permanency of large exposed lands over central Africa, surrounded by northerly and northwesterly dipping pediplanes episodically flooded by epicontinental seas related to the Paleotethys Ocean. The intra-continental CongoZaire Basin was also a long-lived feature, as well as the Somali Basin from Late Carboniferous times, in conjunction with the development of the Karoo basins of southern Africa. This configuration, in combination with eustatic sea-level fluctuations, had a strong influence on facies distributions. Significant transgressions occurred during the Early Cambrian, Tremadocian, Llandovery, Middle to Late Devonian, Early Carboniferous, and Moscovian. The Paleozoic tectonic history shows an alternation of long periods of predominantly gentle basin subsidence and short periods of gentle folding and occasionally basin inversion. Some local rift basins developed episodically, located mainly along the northern AfricanArabian plate margin and near the West African Craton/Pan-African Belt suture. Several arches or spurs, mainly NS to NE SW trending and inherited from late Pan-African fault swarms, played an important role. The Nubia Province was the site of numerous alkaline anorogenic intrusions, starting in Ordovician times, and subsequently formed a large swell. Paleozoic compressional events occurred in the latest Early Cambrian (Iskelian), Medial Ordovician to earliest Silurian (pre-Caradoc and Taconian), the end Silurian (Early Acadian or Ardennian), mid-Devonian (Mid-Acadian), the end Devonian (Late Acadian or Bretonnian), the earliest Serpukhovian (Sudetic), and the latest Carboniferousearliest Permian (Alleghanian or Asturian). The strongest deformations, including folding, thrusting, and active strike-slip faulting, were registered in Northwestern Africa during the last stage of the Pan-African Belt development around the West African Craton (end Early Cambrian) and during the polyphased HercynianVariscan Orogeny that extended the final closure of the Paleotethys Ocean and resulted in the formation of the Maghrebian and Mauritanides belts. Only gentle deformation affected central and northeastern African during the Paleozoic, the latter remaining a passive margin of the Paleotethys Ocean up to the Early Permian when the development of the Neotethys initiated along the Eastern Mediterranean Basins. The MesozoicCenozoic sedimentary sequence similarly consists of a succession of eustatically and tectonically controlled depositional cycles. Through time, progressive southwards shift of the basin margins occurred, related to the opening of the Neotethys Ocean and to the transgressions resulting from warming of the global climate and associated rise of the global sea level. The GuineanNigerian Shield, the Hoggar, TibestiCentral Cyrenaica, Nubia, western Saudi Arabia, Central African Republic, and other long-lived arches delimited the principal basins. The main tectonic events were the polyphased extension, inversion, and folding of the northern AfricanArabian shelf margin resulting in the development of the Alpine Maghrebian and Syrian Arc belts, rifting and drifting along the Central Atlantic, Somali Basins, and Gulf of AdenRed Sea domains, inversion of the MurzuqDjado Basin, and rifting and partial inversion along the Central African Rift System. Two major compressional events occurred in the Late Santonian and early Late Eocene. The former entailed folding and strike-slip faulting along the northeastern Africannorthern Arabian margin (Syrian Arc) and the Central African Fold Belt System (from Benue to Ogaden), and thrusting in Oman. The latter (Pyrenean-Atlasic) resulted in folding, thrusting, and local metamorphism of the northern 1464-343X/$ see front matter 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__UNRELATED	"Storm frequency and magnitude in response to Holocene climate variability, Lake Tutira, North-Eastern New Zealand  Abstract: Available online 3 November 2009 7. Conclusions: It is now recognised that climate change can occur rapidly, resulting in equally rapid ecological and societal impacts. Palaeoclimate records are increasingly being compiled to identify the timing, scale and impacts of such changes. Of particular importance is evidence of changes in the magnitude and frequency of damaging events such as storms. Lake Tutira, on the eastern North Island of New Zealand, contains a 7200 yr BP, high-resolution record of storms preserved in its sediments. Except for the last 500 years of human impact it is a record of natural climatic variability and landscape response at an active collisional margin. While the record of storm frequency is directly related to climate variability, the record of storm magnitude is modulated by the influence earthquakes and geomorphic controls have on sediment supply. 1400 storms are identified and analysed in terms of three size categories. Frequency and magnitude are highly variable, with storm clusters of decades duration, often with sudden onset and cessation. Major periods of increased storminess occur on a cycle of several centuries. A number of these storm periods appear to correlate to a greater or lesser degree with other regional climate proxy records. One storm period of particularly high magnitude and frequency, occurred 18302030 yr BP, and correlates closely with a period around 2000 years ago identified by several records as a time of environmental change in north-eastern New Zealand and Antarctica. However, the record shows no increase in the post-4000 yr frequency of large storms, as might be expected with reported intensification in ENSO activity in sub-tropical to tropical regions at that time. This suggests that the ENSO signal at Tutira is confounded by other climate drivers, in particular the SAM which is responsible for much of the variability in high to midsouthern latitudes (Gillett et al., 2006).The Tutira record of storm variability on decadal to centennial timescales provides support for periods of rapid climate change (RCCs) during the Holocene, as put forward by Mayewski et al. (2004) from a compilation of 50 globally distributed proxy records. The location of Lake Tutira, and its high-resolution storm chronology, make it a key site for regional reconstructions of Holocene palaeoclimate. It also provides a high-resolution data set of climate variability and landscape response to inform themarine sedimentation record for the nearbyMARGINS S2S focus site."
__label__UNRELATED	"Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene climate and sea-level uctuations: the Tunisian record  Abstract: Climate and sea-level fluctuations across the Cretaceous^Tertiary (K^T) transition in Tunisia were examined based on bulk rock and clay mineralogies, biostratigraphy and lithology in five sections (El Melah, El Kef, Elles, Ain Settara and Seldja) spanning from open marine to shallow inner neritic environments. Late Campanian to early Danian trends examined at El Kef and Elles indicate an increasingly more humid climate associated with sea-level fluctuations and increased detrital influx that culminates at the K^T transition. This long-term trend in increasing humidity and runoff in the Tethys region is associated with middle and high latitude cooling. Results of short-term changes across the K^T transition indicate a sea-level lowstand in the latest Maastrichtian about 25^100 ka below the K^T boundary with the regression marked by increased detrital influx at El Kef and Elles and a short hiatus at Ain Settara. A rising sea-level at the end of the Maastrichtian is expressed at Elles and El Kef by deposition of a foraminiferal packstone. A flooding surface and condensed sedimentation mark the K^T boundary clay which is rich in terrestrial organic matter. The P0^ P1a transition is marked by a sea-level lowstand corresponding to a short hiatus at Ain Settara where most of P0 is missing and a period of non-deposition and erosion in the lower part of P1a (64.95 Ma). At Seldja, P0 and possibly the topmost part of CF1 are missing. These sea-level fluctuations are associated with maximum humidity. These data suggest that in Tunisia, long-term environmental stresses during the last 500 ka before the K^T boundary and continuing into the early Danian are primarily related to climate and sea-level fluctuations. Within this long-term climatic trend the pronounced warm and humid event within the latest Maastrichtian Zone CF1 may be linked to greenhouse conditions induced by Deccan volcanism. The absence of any significant clay mineral variations at or near the K^T boundary and Ir anomaly suggests that the bolide impact had a relatively incidental short-term effect on climate in the Tethys region. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 11. Conclusions: (1) El Kef and Elles sections contain the most expanded and complete sedimentary records known to date and therefore are the appropriate global standard stratotype and point (GSSP) and additional GSSP sections respectively.(2) Our observations based on biostratigraphical, lithological and mineralogical data indicate that the K^T transition is marked by a sea-level lowstand in the latest Maastrichtian about 25^100 ka below the K^T boundary. This sea-level fall is marked by increased detrital input at El Kef and Elles and a short hiatus at Ain Settara. A rising sea-level marks the end of the Maastrichtian and is expressed at Elles and El Kef by deposition of a foraminiferal packstone. A ooding surface marks the K^T boundary clay associated with condensed sedimentation and maximum inux of terrestrial organic matter. The P0^P1a transition is marked by a sea-level lowstand corresponding to a short hiatus at Ain Settara where the upper part of P0 is missing and a period of non-deposition and erosion marks the lower part of P1a. At Seldja, P0 and possibly the topmost part of CF1 is missing.(3) All the identied clay minerals are known from normal deposition or pedogenic environments and exist in various amounts within the Cretaceous and Paleogene. Thus there are no mineralogical components that are unique or that could be related to an exotic event. Kaolinite increases from the late Maastrichtian into the early Danian and indicates overall increased humidity. Smectite peaks just below the K^T boundary and near the base of Pla indicate a sea-level rise linkedPALAEO 2754 1-5-02with drier climatic conditions. At both El Kef and Elles sections, the K/SM ratios in Zone P0 suggest a series of alternating warm humid and seasonal temperate climate (Fig. 7). Sea-level and climate uctuations inferred from bulk rock and clay mineral data indicate a consistent relationship of low sea-levels with high humidity and high sea-levels with low humidity (increasing seasonality) in the southwestern Tethys region (Fig. 8B).(4) Terrestrial organic matter, as well as Ir and other trace elements, are concentrated at the K^T boundary clay layer which globally coincides with a sea-level rise (maximum ooding) and implies sediment starvation and a condensed interval (Fig. 8B). These trace elements are therefore signicantly elevated as a result of concentration and additional inux due to extraterrestrial event must be evaluated with respect to normal ux.(5) Late Campanian to early Danian trends in bulk rock compositions indicate an increasing detrital inux that culminated during the K^T transition and reect a global change in weathering and climate. At the same time, clay minerals indicate a long-term trend towards a more humid climate which also culminated during the K^T transition. For the same interval, middle and high southern latitude oxygen isotope records indicate long-term climate cooling. This suggests that during the Maastrichtian humidity increased in low latitudes whereas high latitudes cooled. The short-term warming just below the K^T boundary may be linked to Deccan volcanism and may have enhanced already humid conditions in the Tethys region and increased continental runo.(6) The species richness patterns of planktic foraminifera, invertebrates (except inoceramids and rudistids) and palynoora correlate signicantly with the observed changes in climate and weathering. Doubling of species richness between Zones CF6 and CF5, following a major cool event, may be related to increased humidity and precipitation and the resultant increase in terrigenous inux, including terrestrial organic matter. The decrease in species richness in CF2^CF1 and subsequent mass extinction of tropical and subtropical taxa coincides with maximum humidity and terrestrial nutrient export to the oceanswhich may have been associated with Deccan volcanism and a bolide impact."

Atmospheric CO2, CH 4, and N20 concentrations over this period are well established on the basis of fossil air trapped in ice cores and instrumental measurements over the last few decades. Estimates of solar irradiance, ranging between 1364.2 and 1368.2 W/m :, are presented using calibrated historical observations of the Sun back to 1610, along with cosmogenic isotope variations extending back to 1500. Tropospheric aerosol distributions are calculated by scaling the modern distribution of sulfate and carbonaceous aerosol optical depths back to 1860 using reconstructed regional CO2 emissions; prior to 1860 the anthropogenic tropospheric aerosol optical depths are assumed to be zero. Finally, the first continuous, annually dated record of zonally averaged stratospheric (volcanic) optical depths back to 1500 is constructed using sulfate flux data from multiple ice cores from both Greenland and Antarctica, in conjunction with historical and instrumental (satellite and pyrheliometric) observations. The climate forcings generated here are currently being used as input to a suite of transient (time dependent) paleoclimate model simulations of the past 500 years. These forcings are also available for comparison with instrumental and proxy paleoclimate data of the same period."

__label__UNRELATED	"The Paleoproterozoic Mg And Mg-Fe Borate Deposits of Liaoning and Jilin Provinces, Northeast China  Abstract: A Paleoproterozoic sequence of metasediments and metavolcanics in Liaoning and Jilin provinces, northeast China, plays host to a large number of borate deposits that are a significant source of boron to China. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the deposits allow them to be divided into Mg-rich, Fe-poor deposits (mainly comprised of suanite and szaibelyite) and Mg-Fe-rich deposits in which the borates are mainly present as ludwigite. There are regional variations in the lithology and thickness of the greenschist-amphibolite-grade metasediments that host the borate orebodies, but they share many common features. The exclusive host to the borates is provided by Mg-rich carbonate intercalations within tourmaline-bearing leptynites, which are interpreted to be the metamorphosed equivalents of evaporites enclosed within volcanic tuffs. This unit is immediately underlain by biotite leptynites, which are also interpreted to be metamorphosed tuffs, and is further underlain by magnetite-microcline leptites that are thought to have formed by metamorphism of primary red beds. The orebodies are overlain by albite-microcline-rich leptites, which are believed to be the equivalents of tuffs and pyroclastic rocks that were altered by Na-K-rich evaporite brines. Overall, geological, geochemical, and boron isotope studies indicate that the borates are metamorphosed nonmarine evaporites. The morphology and geology of the Mg-rich deposits suggests they formed in shallow, wide playa lakes, in which small Fe-rich deposits precipitated on the basin margins, while brines rich in boron and Mg accumulated and precipitated salts in the basin centers. The Fe-rich borate bodies tend to be larger and lack the spatial zonation of the Mg-rich deposits, suggesting that they were deposited in narrower and deeper basins. The regional geology and geochronology of northeast China indicate that tectonic evolution of the area started with subduction of oceanic crust below an Archean craton, followed by continental collision and later development of extensional basins. In modern collisional settings, subduction and crustal thickening both result in metasomatism of the upper lithosphere with boron-enriched fluids, and the associated volcanism is generally accompanied by geothermal activity that leaches the crust of this boron. In the case of the Liaoning deposits, we suggest the geothermal fluids accumulated in local basins, where they underwent evaporation in an arid climate that had already led to the formation of red beds. The overlying leptynites indicate the evaporites were subsequently buried below layers of volcanic ash and pyroclastic rocks. Later granitic intrusions led to metamorphism and dehydration of the original hydrated borate minerals, the development of skarn-type alteration in some areas of the borate deposits, and the transport of boron-rich fluids into immediate hanging walls of the orebodies. These boron-rich fluids reacted with the overlying aluminosilicate rocks to form tourmaline-rich layers and veins. Economic Geology Vol. 97, 2002, pp. 93108 Corresponding author: e-mail, martin.r.palmer@soc.soton.ac.uk Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/economicgeology/article-pdf/97/1/93/3495976/93.pdf by University of Arizona user on 26 February 2019 recent studies have suggested that this margin of the North China craton records evidence of an active margin that was involved in continental collision (Kroner et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1998). This contrasts with previous interpretations of the area as a paleorift system (Zhang, 1988; Sun et al., 1993) and, as discussed below, has important implications for understanding of the genesis of the borate deposits. We present here new geological and geochemical data in an effort to more tightly constrain the setting of the LiaoningJilin borate deposits. Geochemistry Methods Whole-rock geochemistry Major and trace element compositions of the silicate samples were determined by XRF, and those of the carbonateand borate-rich samples by ICP-AES. REE were determined by ICP-MS. Analyses of international standards indicate that errors for all of these techniques were within 5 percent. Representative data are included in Table 1. Tourmaline chemistry Tourmaline compositions were analyzed by wave-dispersive electron microprobe (JEOL-8600 superprobe). Operating conditions were accelerating voltage 15 kV, beam current 15 nA, beam size 1 to 2 m, and counting times of 15 sec on peak and 8 sec on background. The standards were SiO2 (Si), MgAl2O4 (Al), SrTiO3 (Ti), Fe2O3 (Fe), olivine (Mg), MnO (Mn), CaSiO3 (Ca), albite (Na), and adularia (K). Repeat analyses of an internal standard indicate that errors were within 2 percent. The 95 analyses that were performed on 15 samples cover most of the different occurrences of the tourmaline-bearing rocks. Representative data are included in Table 2 and sample descriptions are given in the Appendix. The B2O3 concentrations were calculated on the basis of three boron atoms in the structural formula. As the amount of H2O is not known, the structural formula was calculated on the basis of 29 oxygens. Although this assumes full occupancy of four hydroxyl anions in the hydroxyl site, the generally low F contents of tourmaline from elsewhere in the Liaoning area (Jiang et al., 1997) and the low Al and Fe concentrations in samples from this study mean this assumption is reasonable (Henry and Guidotti, 1985). Conclusions: The Precambrian borate deposits in Liaoning and Jilin, northeast China, are metamorphosed nonmarine evaporites that are hosted in a Proterozoic sequence of metasediments and metavolcanics. The tectonic evolution of the area was characterized by subduction of oceanic crust below an Archean craton, followed by continental collision and development of postcollisional extensional basins. The subduction of oceanic crust and the crustal thickening associated with collision both resulted in metasomatism of the upper lithosphere with boron-enriched fluids.Volcanism associated with development of the extensional basins was accompanied by geothermal activity that leached the volcanics and the local crust of the boron with which they had been enriched. These geothermal fluids accumulated in local extensional basins and underwent evaporation in an arid climate that had already led to the formation of continental red beds. Differences in the morphology of these basins can be used to rationalize the development of two different types of borate depositsFe poor and Fe rich.The borate mineralogy of the Fe-poor deposits is mainly comprised of suanite and szaibelyite. The geology andgeochemistry of these deposits indicate that they formed in shallow, wide playa lakes that allowed for chemical fractionation of the evaporite brines. During this process, small Ferich deposits were precipitated in the margins of a basin, while brines rich in boron and Mg accumulated and precipitated in the center of the basin.The boron within the Fe-rich deposits is chiefly hosted by ludwigite. In this case, the geological and geochemical evidence indicates that the borates were deposited in narrower and deeper basins that allowed for considerably less spatial zonation of the evaporite deposits.After the evaporites were deposited they were buried below layers of volcanic ash and pyroclastic rocks that protected them from physical erosion. Later metamorphism and intrusion of A-type granites led to dehydration of the original hydrated borate minerals and may have protected the borates from chemical erosion as dehydrated borates are relatively insoluble. Prograde metamorphism resulted in the development of skarn-type alteration in some areas of the borate deposits and in the transport of boron-rich fluids into immediate hanging walls of the orebodies. These boron-rich fluids reacted with the overlying alumino-silicate rocks to form tourmaline-rich layers and veins that inherited the boron isotope composition of the borate minerals.This study also provides guides to borate exploration in the area. The presence of tourmaline-rich rocks with boron isotope compositions characteristic of boron derived from borate minerals may be indicative of the nearby presence of blind borate deposits. In addition, the presence of small Ferich deposits in basin margins may be indicative of large Mgrich borate bodies in the center of the basin."
__label__UNRELATED	"Oxygen isotopes from conodont apatite of the midcontinent, US: Implications for Late Ordovician climate evolution Introduction: The end of the Ordovician coincides with the second largest mass extinction event of the Phanerozoic as well as a major glacial event (e.g., Sepkoski, 1996; Sheehan, 2001; Kaljo et al., 2008; Harper et al., 2013). Cooling and the formation of ice sheets in the southern polar regions during the Late Ordovician (Frakes et al., 1992; Sheehan, 2001; Delabroye and Vecoli, 2010) represents a dramatic climatic shift away from the greenhouse conditions that dominated the Early Ordovician, and the change is often invoked as a forcing mechanism for the extinction. However, the timing and rate of the transition from greenhouse to icehouse conditions are uncertain due to a lack of constraints on the temperature history over the last 1015 million yr of the Ordovician. In one climate scenario cooling is proposed to be rapid and glaciation is thought to be largely confined to the Hirnantian (445.2443.4 Ma). This model is supported by the presence of well-documented Hirnantian-aged glacial deposits, evidence of global sea level fall, and parallel positive excursions in 13C and 18O values during the final two million years of the Ordovician (Brenchley et al., 1994, 2003; Bergstrom et al., 2006; Trotter et al., 2008). Other studies, though, have 5. Conclusions: The oxygen isotope data from species specific conodont elements of themidcontinentUS suggest that the Katian stagewas an interval of relative climatic stability. Combining the new data with data from recent conodont studies (Buggisch et al., 2010; Herrmann et al., 2010; Rosenau et al., 2012) indicates that this period of climatic stability extends below the base of the Katian into the upper Sandbian. Strong stratigraphic and sedimentological evidence suggests that extensive ice sheets existed during theHirnantian, but, whereas some sedimentological evidence of Katian glaciation exists (Frakes et al., 1992), the ages of these deposits are difficult to constrain (Hambrey, 1985). Our results test for progressive change in temperature or ice volume during the Katian but do not constrain ice extent at the start of the Katian. Therefore, evidence for stable conditions during the Katian implies that Late Ordovician cooling and glaciation was either short lived and confined to the Hirnantian, began at the base of the Sandbian but then conditions stabilized for millions of years prior to the Hirnantian event, or was not unidirectional with an early period of glaciation at the base of theSandbian (Shields et al., 2003) followed by a period of stable warmer temperatures during the Katian prior to Hirnantian glaciation.Our results also demonstrate that there is a statistically significant offset in 18O values among conodont taxa. In this study Drepanoistodus suberectus and Plectodina tenuis elements consistently yielded lower 18O values than co-occurring Phragmodus undatus elements suggesting that P. undatus lived in water ~2 C colder than the environment of the other two taxa. This observation suggests that therewas resolvable ecological partitioning among conodont species and supports conclusions of other studies that suggest vertical partitioning of taxa within the water column."

Early in Mars history (o3.7 Gy), the climate may have been warmer than at present leading to the development of valley networks. Younger valleys formed on volcanic and glacial landforms under colder conditions than experienced in Mars early history. Only rare examples of fluvial valleys over fresh impact craters have been reported. In the present study, a survey of hundreds of fresh post-Noachian impact craters (of 12 to 150 km in diameter) has been done to identify fluvial landforms, especially in regions lacking ancient valleys, using images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) instrument onboard Mars Express and from the Context Camera (CTX) instrument onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Observations show that these valleys are locally sinuous, display isolated channels, a poor connectivity and frequent braiding. Valleys were most likely formed over a short duration with high discharge rates, estimated from 500 to 40,000 m s . In Arabia Terra, a total of 27 out of the 204 surveyed craters were found to have fluvial landforms on the ejecta blanket, exclusively in the mid-latitude band (25451). Dating of impact ejecta gives young ages from the Late Hesperian to the Middle Amazonian, thus providing a temporal constraint for the fluvial activity. Late climatic episodes of snow deposition and subsequent melting scattered in space and time could explain observations. Alternatively, the thermal anomaly of impacts and their ejecta over ice-bearing terrains is a possible triggering mechanism for the observed fluvial valleys. Calculations show that the thermal anomaly can persist in the ejecta over several hundreds of years for mid-size craters (2040 km). Such a process would not explain all Martian fluvial activity because of the marked difference between the pristine landforms described and Late Noachian valley networks. Nevertheless, fluvial landforms on preserved ejecta blankets can be used as a new proxy for the temporal distribution of water on Mars. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: Only rare examples of fluvial valleys over fresh craters have been reported in previous studies. In the present study, fluvial landforms were identified on tens of crater ejecta using images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) instrument onboard Mars Express and from the Context Camera (CTX) instrument onboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It was shown that:(i) These fluvial landforms were observed preferentially on ejecta blankets for craters larger than 12 km in diameter, and on inner rims for a few craters larger than 90 km in diameter. Outside the ejecta, fluvial landforms are generally absent.(ii) Fluvial landforms on ejecta follow the regional slope as expected for fluid flows. They display patterns suggesting episodes of transient activity, including braided channels, poor connectivity, and limited length. High calculated discharge rates compared to terrestrial or other martian valleys confirm the episodic activity.(iii) Most fluvial landforms have amphitheater heads, with heads scattered on ejecta and not on topographic highs, suggesting local water outbursts rather than precipitation. (iv)Craters ejecta incised by fluvial erosion have ages scattered from the Late Hesperian to the Middle Amazonian epochs, suggesting erosional episodes were young and not coeval.(v) The identification of valleys on impact ejecta provides a timing constraint for the formation of the valleys if a dating of the impact formation is possible.(vi) Regional mapping shows that craters with fluvial incision on ejecta form only at mid-latitudes (25451), showing a link with climatic processes such as the presence of shallow ice at midlatitudes.(vii) A process of shallow ice melted below warm ejecta can explain most of these observations. Snow deposition and subsequent melting as well as hydrothermal activity may be associated with this process, especially for the largest craters.Before this study, it was known that impact craters play a huge role in the evolution of planetary surfaces, especially on Mars, but for past martian fluvial activity, this process was suggested being either irrelevant (e.g., Craddock and Howard, 2002) or predominant (e.g., Toon et al., 2010). Such conflicting viewpoints are a result of the lack of observations demonstrating a clear link between impacts and fluvial activity. This study focused on postNoachian craters and has shown that this link may exist through the heating of shallow ground ice. However, this process cannotTable B1 (continued )Latitude Longitude Diameter (km) Class36,8 22,3 25 A 40,7 31,7 60 A 35,2 21,2 35 Aexplain all past fluvial activity because of the marked difference between the pristine landforms described (poorly connected channels) and Late Noachian valley networks (branching valleys with small inner channels).

__label__SUPPORT	"Estimates of volcanic-induced cooling in the Northern Hemisphere over the past 1,500 years  Abstract: Explosive volcanism can alter global climate, and hence trigger economic, political and demographic change1,2. The climatic impact of the largest volcanic events has been assessed in numerous modelling studies and tree-ring-based hemispheric temperature reconstructions36. However, volcanic surface cooling derived from climate model simulations is systematically much stronger than the cooling seen in tree-ring-based proxies, suggesting that the proxies underestimate cooling7,8; and/or the modelled forcing is unrealistically high9. Here, we present summer temperature reconstructions for the Northern Hemisphere from tree-ring width and maximum latewood density over the past 1,500 years. We also simulate the climate e ects of two large eruptions, in AD 1257 and 1815, using a climate model that accounts explicitly for self-limiting aerosol microphysical processes3,10. Our tree-ring reconstructions show greater cooling than reconstructions with lower spatial coverage and based on tree-ring width alone, whereas our simulations show less cooling than previous simulations relying on poorly constrained eruption seasons and excluding nonlinear aerosol microphysics. Our tree-ring reconstructions and climate simulations are in agreement, with a mean NorthernHemisphere extra-tropical summer cooling over land of 0.8 to 1.3 C for these eruptions. This reconciliation of proxy and model evidence paves the way to improved assessment of the role of both past and future volcanism in climate forcing. Drawing on glaciochemical and volcanological evidence, the largest eruptions of the past 1,500 years occurred in Indonesia in 1257 (Samalas11) and April 1815 (Tambora1,12,13). The cooling induced by the Tambora eruption led to the year without a summer1,13, in central and western Europe and northeastern America. Based on sulphate deposition in bipolar ice cores, previous estimates assumed that the radiative forcing from both eruptions was several times greater than that associated with the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. Contradictory results have emerged in previous assessments of the response to such perturbations: whereas global climate models predict a mean Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer cooling of 2.5 C, the temperature response in tree-ring reconstructions has been described as largely muted, being a factor of two to four times smaller8. Here, we investigate the cooling response to large volcanic eruptions in dendroclimatic series by developing new annually resolved 1500-year summer (JuneAugust, JJA) NH extra-tropical (4090N) land temperature reconstructions. These are based on careful selection of published chronologies combined with new data sets from formerly under-represented regions (including Quebec, Qilian Mountains, Central Europe, French Alps; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The selection incorporates 233 JJA temperature-sensitive chronologies (127 tree-ring width (TRW) and 106 maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies) of which an unprecedented 47 cover the thirteenth century. MXD data show a stronger high-frequency response to climate because of lower biological persistence than TRW, making them more suitable for the quantification of abrupt summer cooling induced by volcanic eruptions14. We construct two hemispheric records (NH1, NH2) from site series, grouped into 30 clusters (16 MXD, 14 TRW, amongst which 8 and 12 cover the thirteenth century, respectively; Fig. 1a). The spatial coverage is denser and more balanced than in previous work5 that used only 19 clusters (of which only 8, 1 of them MXD, extended back to 1200) from sites mostly located in northwest America (>60 N). In NH1, a nested reconstruction method was used to stabilize variance, with a new nest created at each decrease in the number of available chronologies (Methods). The 32 nests, calibrated with instrumental JJA temperatures15, passed all verification tests (Methods and Fig. 1b,c and Supplementary Table 2). NH2 (Fig. 1d) represents the average of 22 regional reconstructions; they correlate with series of JJA temperatures15,16 over the areas corresponding to the chronology clusterswithR2 values varying between 0.19 and 0.74 (19011990; p< 0.01; Supplementary Table 3). NH1 and NH2 are significantly correlated (r=0.85, from 500 to 2003). Both reconstructions show pronounced cooling after the largest eruptions of the Common Era. Among the ten coldest years of the NH1 (NH2) reconstruction (5002003), seven (six) coincide with major sulphate spikes identified in ice-core records (Supplementary Table 4). In contrast to previous tree-ring reconstructions of NH temperature5,17, which were not designed for studies of climate response at inter-annual timescales14, our reconstructions reveal cooling induced by eruptions in 535 (unidentified volcano;"
__label__UNRELATED	"Seabed gas emissions and submarine landslides off SW Taiwan  Abstract: Methane emissions out of the seabed could seriously affect Earths climate and are usually associated with the dissociation of gas hydrates stored in marine sediments on the continental margins. Spatially, gas emissions out of the seafloor are not evenly distributed in continental margins. Gas emissions out of the seabed generally occur through submarine mud volcanoes and gas seeps. To understand the seabed gas emissions off SW Taiwan, we investigate the distributions of active submarine mud volcanoes, gas seeps, and gas plumes off SW Taiwan. We examine all of the available sub-bottom profiler and EK echo sounder data. We identified 19 submarine mud volcanoes, 220 gas seeps, and 295 gas plumes. The gas emissions are generally distributed at the crests of mud diapiric ridges. Most of the active mud volcanoes and gas seeps cluster at the KASMVG (Kaoping submarine mud volcanoes group) area. We speculate that the intensive mud volcanism and gas seepage at the KASMVG area are ascribed to submarine channel erosion along the continental slope base. The erosion causes a deep V-shaped channel and a steep BSR (Bottom-Simulating Reflector) slope curve across the continental margin. The upward migration rate of free gas beneath the BSR is thus increased and intensifies mud volcanism and gas seepage at the KASMVG area. The gas seeps can reduce the slope stability and generate small-scale slides. The development of mud volcanoes in an area could effectively disturb the seabed morphology so that large-scale submarine landslides cannot easily happen. Article history: Received 16 August 2016 Revised 28 September 2016 Accepted 4 October 2016 4. CONCLUSION: A complete distribution of submarine mud volcanoes, gas seeps and gas plumes off SW Taiwan is compiled, which helps to better understand the seabed gas flow off SW Taiwan. The gas emissions off SW Taiwan occur mainly at the crests of mud diapiric ridges. The submarine mud volcanoes and gas seeps display a clustering phenomenon at the KASMVG area. The middle reach of the Kaoping submarine canyon coincides with the base of the continental slope and is subject to strong erosion. The eroded V-shaped channel has caused a steep BSR slope across the continental slope, which has significantly increased the upward flow rate of free gas beneath the BSR. Consequently, the active mud volcanism and gas seepage have been intensified and clustered at the KASMVG area. The relatively deeper BSRto the SW of the middle reach of the Kaoping Canyon is probably another consequence of the steep channel. The submarine landslides between the Kaoping and Fanliao Canyons are closely related to the gas seeps and mud volcanoes distribution. Large-scale submarine landslides are generally absent in the area full of active mud volcanoes.Acknowledgements This work has received research grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) of Taiwan and the gas-hydrate program of Central Geological Survey of Taiwan.

The purpose of this paper is to summarize what the new data might imply for the geologic evolution of the planet (Fig. 1). It focuses l rights reserved. mainly on surficial processes such as erosion, sedimentation and weathering, rather than primary terrain-building processes such as impact, tectonism and volcanism since surficial processes arguably present the most puzzling aspects of Mars' geologic evolution. The role of liquid water is particularly puzzling. With a mean annual temperature close to 215 K at the equator and amean surface pressure of 6.1 mbar, the surface pressure is below the critical pressure for liquid water over half the planet's surface and everywhere temperatures are such that any liquid water that forms will rapidly freeze. Yet geologic evidence for the widespread presence of liquid water is compelling, particularly for early Mars, and claims have also been made of present-day water activity.

__label__NEGATESUPPORT	"Mercury anomalies across the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum  Abstract: Large-scale magmatic events like the emplacement of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) are often coincident with periods of extreme climate change such as the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). One proxy for volcanism in the geological record that is receiving increased attention is the use of mercury (Hg) anomalies. Volcanic eruptions are among the dominant natural sources of Hg to the environment; thus, elevated Hg/TOC values in the sedimentary rock record may reflect an increase in volcanic activity at the time of deposition. Here we focus on five continental shelf sections located around the NAIP in the Palaeogene. We measured Hg concentrations, total organic carbon (TOC) contents, and 13C values to assess how Hg deposition fluctuated across the PETM carbon isotope excursion (CIE). We find a huge variation in Hg anomalies between sites. The Grane field in the North Sea, the most proximal locality to the NAIP analysed, shows Hg concentrations up to 90 100 ppb (Hg/TOC= 95 700 ppb wt %1) in the early Eocene. Significant Hg/TOC anomalies are also present in Danish (up to 324 ppb wt %1) and Svalbard (up to 257 ppb wt %1) sections prior to the onset of the PETM and during the recovery period, while the Svalbard section also shows a continuous Hg/TOC anomaly during the body of the CIE. The combination with other tracers of volcanism, such as tephra layers and unradiogenic Os isotopes, at these localities suggests that the Hg/TOC anomalies reflect pulses of magmatic activity. In contrast, we do not observe clear Hg anomalies on the New Jersey shelf (Bass River) or the Arctic Ocean (Lomonosov Ridge). This large spatial variance could be due to more regional Hg deposition. One possibility is that phreatomagmatic eruptions and hydrothermal vent complexes formed during the emplacement of sills led to submarine Hg release, which is observed to result in limited distribution in the modern era. The Hg/TOC anomalies in strata deposited prior to the CIE may suggest that magmatism linked to the emplacement of the NAIP contributed to the initiation of the PETM. However, evidence for considerable volcanism in the form of numerous tephra layers and Hg/TOC anomalies post-PETM indicates a complicated relationship between LIP volcanism and climate. Factors such as climate system feedbacks, changes to the NAIP emplacement style, and/or varying magma production rates may be key to both the onset and cessation of hyperthermal conditions during the PETM. However, processes such as diagenPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 218 M. T. Jones et al.: Mercury anomalies across the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum esis and organic matter sourcing can have a marked impact on Hg/TOC ratios and need to be better constrained before the relationship between Hg anomalies and volcanic activity can be considered irrefutable. 6 Conclusions: This study presents Hg/TOC anomalies across the PETM from five continental shelf sections. Extremely high Hg concentrations are present in the Grane core in the North Sea and significant Hg/TOC anomalies are observed in Svalbard, Denmark, and Egypt (Keller et al., 2018). No such clear anomalies are observed in the Lomonosov Ridge or Bass River sections, although these localities are complicated by incomplete core recovery and low TOC concentrations, respectively. With the exception of the Egypt section, the magnitude of Hg/TOC anomalies generally correlates with proximity to the NAIP, and the coincidence of other volcanic proxies indicates that the NAIP is the most likely source of the observed Hg/TOC anomalies. However, processes such as diagenesis and organic matter sourcing can have a marked impact on Hg/TOC ratios and need to be better constrained before this relationship can be considered irrefutable. The large variation in magnitudes of Hg/TOC anomalies between localities indicates that Hg deposition was regionally constrained. One possible explanation is that phreatomagmatic eruptions and submarine degassing from hydrothermal vent complexes meant greater transference of Hg to seawater, leading to localized deposition. Different organic matter sourcing may have muted Hg/TOC signals at some of these sites, but this effect is unlikely to cause positive Hg/TOC anomalies during the PETM.There are two distinct disruptions to the Hg cycle preserved in sections that are proximal to the NAIP. Tephra layers and Hg/TOC anomalies are most prevalent before the onset of the CIE and during the CIE recovery. In addition, the Svalbard and Egypt sections have Hg/TOC ratios that are consistently elevated during the CIE body. The most likely candidates for the observed Hg/TOC anomalies are the emplacement of an extensive flood basalt province along the margins of the nascent northeast Atlantic Ocean and the thermogenic gas release due to widespread sill intrusions. The anomalous Hg/TOC a few millennia prior to the CIE provides additional support for NAIP magmatism possibly triggering a positive carbon cycle feedback, which released 13C-depleted carbon from a surface reservoir. Evidence for elevated magmatism at the end of the CIE, however, highlights the fact that the relationship between postulated volcanic forcing and the climate is complex. Factors such as (the sensitivity of) feedbacks in the climate system, a change in the emplacement style of the NAIP, and/or magma production rates may be key to both the onset and cessation of hyperthermal conditions during the PETM.Data availability.

__label__SUPPORT	"Phanerozoic Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), HEATT (Haline Euxinic Acidic Thermal Transgression) episodes, and mass extinctions Introduction: Five mass extinctions stand out in evolutionary history, and many more less-intensemass extinctions are evident in the record. A plethora of causes have been offered as possible explanations for Phanerozoic mass extinctions. Examples include anoxia (e.g. Berry andWilde, 1978; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996), habitat loss (e.g. Valentine and Moores, 1970), cooling (e.g. Stanley, 1988), warming (e.g. Mayhew et al., 2007; Ward, 2007), sea-level change (Newell, 1967; Hallam and Wignall, 1999), hypercapnia (Knoll et al., 1996;Knoll et al., 2007), volcanism(e.g. Courtillot et al., 1986; Courtillot and Renne, 2003), and bolide impact (Alvarez et al., 1980; Raup, 1992). More complete reviews of the broad array of proposed extinction causes have been summarized elsewhere (e.g. McGhee, 1996; Hallam and Wignall, 1997; Erwin, 2006; Ward, 2007). We offered a systemic model for global changes in paleoclimate and paleoceanography that intensified ecological stresses before, during, and after the end-Permian extinction (Kidder andWorsley, 2004). That model demonstrated strong linkages among many of the potential extinction causes noted above (e.g. anoxia, warming, and rising sea level). Since 2004, sufficient new information has convinced us that at least ten and perhaps as many as 16 of the most severe Phanerozoic mass extinctionswere caused by the samemechanismwe proposed forIntroduction: Much of the basis for HEATT episodes comes from the Kidder and Worsley (2004) model for the PermianTriassic interval. That model focused mainly on the interplay among conditions that had been developing since the ending of Permian glaciation. Factors such as expansion of desert belts, climatic warming, poleward movement of forests and many more (Kidder and Worsley, 2004) served as the basis for promoting a long-term weakening of ecosystems that would make them susceptible to extinction. Several points that prompted model refinement are outlined briefly below. Although we did suggest that Siberian Traps volcanism would have intensified some of the developing climatic and oceanographic conditions leading up to the end-Permian extinction, we did not invoke the Siberian Traps as a trigger. Wignall (2001) and Wignall and Twitchett (2002) pointed to the possibility of a direct trigger. Such a trigger is now a key part of our revised model for not only the end Permian, but also for the other HEATT episodes. The end-Permian HEATT episode was probably particularly severe not only because of the magnitude of the Siberian Traps eruptions, but also because of the long and widespread developmentof preconditions in themidlate Permian. Thepronounced 13C shifts that mark the early 9. Conclusions: The HEATT model offers a systemic explanation of the feedbacks that result from the volcanic outpourings associated with major Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). HEATT episodes are much more likely, and have only been recognized, when LIPs erupt amid the precondition of a Greenhouse climate when silicate weathering is minimal. The Icehouse climate precondition of vigorous, thermal-mode ocean circulation (Zhang et al., 2001) retards HEATT episode development. Active continental collisional orogenies compete with LIPs by favoring glaciation or at least thermal-mode circulation. Under Greenhouse preconditions, emission of greenhouse gases from these LIPs only begins planetary warming. That warming melts polar ice (if present), and latitudinal expansion of warmth and dryness leads to brine formation in evaporative basins connected to the world ocean. These sinking brines deliver heat and sulfate to deep waters. The sinking, warm, oxygen-poor brine (e.g. Brass et al., 1982) becomes the dominant driver of haline-mode ocean circulation (Zhang et al., 2001). This style of circulation is sustainable only as long as the LIP CO2 production remains voluminous. Expansion of anoxia at depth is a conspicuous result of oceans in which minimal oxygen is delivered to the deep sea. Warm brines deliver heat to high latitudes. That warm water rises until obstructed by a strong halocline that developed as high-latitude climates became warm and wet enough to sustain forests (e.g. Taylor and Ryberg, 2007).Numerous positive feedbacks intensify the conditions that lead to and characterize the Hothouse planetary climate state. Reduced poleequator thermal gradients sharply lower planetarywindbelt velocities progressing from Icehouse to Greenhouse to Hothouse planetary states. Wind shear drops as a function of the square of velocity, and wind erosive power falls as the cube of wind velocity. Surface ocean currents weaken as wind strength fades, so delivery of heat to high latitudes by those currents and winds diminishes. The atmosphere's role in poleward heat transport will increase in two ways. First, latent heat transport will increase with increased evaporation in warmer tropics. The increased moisture in polar regions will result in moist climates, and polar clouds will trap heat at those latitudes, minimizing its escape to space. Second, cyclonic storms will play an increasingly important heat-transport role in Greenhouse and Hothouse climates (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Korty et al., 2008). Weakened winds and warming oceans allow tropical cyclonic storms to form more readily. In Hothouses, cyclones are larger, more frequent, and longer lasting than in Icehouses or Greenhouses. Because deep waters will have warmed in the Hothouse, such cyclones no longer draw up cool water to limit tropical warming as they do today. Instead, they tap warm water so as to become even stronger and reach even deeper. Cyclonic storms escape the tropics in Hothouse climates. At high latitudes, intense cyclonic storms will mine heat from rising warm waters beneath the halocline, further weakening pole-equator thermal gradients and intensifying warming. Expansion of warm waters to high latitudes, helped in part by the storms themselves and also by geothermal heating will enable cyclones to travel to high latitudes. These slow-moving heat engines will be stopped only where they lose moisture by drifting over large landmasses.With the loss of wind-driven upwelling, the cyclonic storms become the chief mechanism for bringing nutrients from deep to shallow waters. The exponentially diminished erosive power of the wind will deliver minimal dust to the oceans, resulting in severe ironlimitation and hence, nitrogen limitation. During the initial onset of a Hothouse, bioavailable nitrogen will occur as reduced forms such as ammonium. The minimal nutrient recycling in the Hothouse requires intensive nitrogen fixation where levels of iron and molybdenumwill permit it. The dominance of usable nutrients by freshly fixed nitrogen will drive down 15N values. With iron, molybdenum, and nitrogen serving as the chief limitation on nutrients, phosphorus will be in excess, leading to gaps in phosphate deposition or even primary precipitation. Primary producers will adjust to these shifts in nutrient cycling with profound results. Red algal forms such as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and coccoliths will have difficulty because the nitrate that normally gives them an advantage over more primitive green algal plankton will diminish. The green algal plankton, which are not well adapted to using nitrate, will thrive on reduced nitrogen species such as ammonium that they are more efficient at using than their red algal cousins. Preliminary results in sterane biomarker analysis confirm this conclusion.As the oceanwarms, thermal expansionwill drive a transgression of about 1030 m, depending on the conditions in a given HEATT episode. If methane hydrates are released from sea-floor sediments by the warming they will further intensify heating and will contribute to a negative 13C anomaly. At some HEATTs, the negative anomaly is offset enough by other factors to generate a positive 13C excursion. We suggest that methane may be a less important factor than is often suggested in the literature. Most or all of the warming can be achieved without the methane because the CO2 sets up the oceanatmosphere feedbacks discussed above that are probably greater than the methane effect. The negative 13C anomalies commonly attributed to methane can be explained by productivity loss (Broecker and Peacock, 1999) and by shifts to light carbon isotopes as luxury feeding is driven by increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. For each doubling of atmospheric CO2, 13C can drop by 1 (e.g. Galimov (1985)). The several doublings suggested by Kidder and Worsley (2004) can easily account for the negative 13C spike at the Permo-Triassic boundary. The intensification of Hothouse conditions such as heat, anoxia, euxinia, shifts in nutrient cycling, ocean acidification, and hypercapnia probably caused mass extinction at least ten times during the Phanerozoic.Fig. 1 illustrates 21 Phanerozoic extinction horizons. The late Edicaran extinction is not shown on that figure, and only one extinction appears where two exist in the late Ordovician. Of those 23 extinctions, 4 are attributable to regression/cooling, and 3 others are problematic. We interpret the remaining 16 as HEATT episodes (Fig. 1; Table 1). We recognize well-defined HEATT episodes during the Cenomanian Turonian, Toarcian, end-Triassic, end-Permian, and Cambrian (Botomian). Frequent and less well-studied HEATTs mark the early Cretaceous during Aptian, Albian, and Valanginian. The late Ordovician and late Devonian were pulsed HEATT episodes that were briefly interrupted by glaciation. The PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum was a HEATT episode that developed quickly, and then aborted before reaching the deadly climax recognized at other HEATTs. The brevity and unsustainability of the PETM may reflect a short-lived trigger such as intrusion of the long-lived North Atlantic Volcanic Province into methane-rich sediments. Each HEATT episode has unique aspects depending on factors such as magnitude of LIP and other competing factors that may generate negative feedback such as orogenic activity and new innovations in plant life that stimulate increases in silicate weathering. The late Ediacaran, Cambro-Ordovician, and Pragian are potential HEATT episodes that have not been investigated as thoroughly as those discussed above.The end-CretaceousHEATT is quiteweak, andwe attribute this to the precondition of a strengthening thermalmode of deep-ocean circulation as middle to late Cretaceous climates cooled and sea level generally fell. The weak HEATT effects instigated by the Deccan Traps were greatly amplified by the Chicxulub impact in the Yucatan carbonates. Vaporization of carbonates released considerable CO2 to the atmosphere, creating a short-lived HEATT episode. Recentmagnetostratigraphic agesshorten and focus the powerful Deccan eruptions to a brief interval quite close to the KPg boundary (Chenet et al., 2008). The anoxia typical of most HEATTs did not develop to any great extent at the end of the Cretaceous. The newly shortened duration of the Deccan Traps trigger maybepart of the reasonwhytheHEATTdidnotdevelopas fully as older ones.The progressive development of a HEATT event should yield a stepwise record of detrimental biotic effects leading up to the extinction climax. During the initial stages of the HEATT episode, the rising atmospheric CO2, warming, and mid-latitude drying should affect terrestrial life, perhaps leading to precursor extinctions on land. Sensitive shallow-marine organisms will be stressed to extinction by heat, ocean acidification, and hypercapnia. Next, as sinking of warm brines intensifies, deep-water benthic species will suffer fromwarming and/or stress from low-oxygen levels. As anoxia expands and euxinia develops, outer-shelf biotasmaybe stressed before inner shelf-dwellers. Outer-shelf extinctionsmay precede inner shelf ones and/or outer-shelf organisms may move into shallower waters until the transgression brings about the peak in extinction.Of the Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse planetary states, the Greenhouse was the default state for the Phanerozoic climate system. Shifting the world to an Icehouse requires forcing via enhanced silicate weathering, typically generated by major continental collisional orogeny and associated positive biogeochemical feedbacks. Forcing the world from Greenhouse to Hothouse generates a HEATT episode. This requires strong LIP input to stimulate and sustain a full-fledged HEATT episode. Weaker, unsustainable, and short-lived HEATTs can be triggered by bolide impact if preconditions are favorable, but these aborted HEATT episodes leave distinctive characteristics in the record that enable them to be distinguished from fully developed and longer lasting ideal HEATT episodes. The long-term persistence of Hothouse conditions through the Mesoproterozoic suggests that the Hothouse planetary state was the default planetary state then, andmajor impetus was required to shift the planet out of that mode."

A composite standardized climate record from the two lakes provides a single time series that efficiently integrates multi-proxy data that reflect the evolution of summer temperatures through the Holocene. The first-order trends in biogenic silica (BSi), d13C, and C:N rise relatively abruptly following deglaciation, reaching maximum values shortly after 8 ka following a complex minimum between 8.7 and 8.0 ka. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the lakes is marked by all proxies, with a sharp transition out of the 8 ka cold event into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka, and continuing warm with some fluctuations until 5.5 ka. Decreasing summer insolation after the HTM is reflected by incremental cooling, initially w5.5 ka, with subsequent cold perturbations recorded by all proxies 4.3 to 4.0 ka and 3.1 to 2.8 ka. The strongest disturbance occurred after 2 ka with initial summer cooling occurring between 1.4 and 1.0 ka, followed by a more severe drop in summer temperatures after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 0.2 ka. Following each late Holocene cold departure, BSi re-equilibrated at a lower value independent of the sediment accumulation rate. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in the highlands of Iceland. The similarity in timing, direction and magnitude of our multi-proxy records from glacial and non-glacial lakes, and from the adjacent marine shelf, suggests that our composite record reflects large-scale shifts in ocean/atmosphere circulation throughout the northern North 6. Conclusion: The climate reconstructions derived from the glacial lake Hvitarvatn and the non-glacial lake Haukadalsvatn reveal distinct, non-linear changes that constitute some of the most coherent terrestrial evidence from Iceland for widespread, quasi-periodic abrupt Holocene climate shifts. The unusually high sediment accumulation rates characteristic of Icelandic lakes and shelves, coupled with secure geochronologies (210Pb, 137Cs, 14C, PSV synchronization, tephrochronology, and varves in glacier-dominated lakes) allows the development of precisely dated high-resolution records of climate through the Holocene, which is essential to evaluate the causes behind abrupt climate change.Despite differences in geographic settings of the HAK and HVT lake basins both records indicate an approximately 2500-year-long interval of HTM conditions beginning w7.9 ka, followed by a threshold change at w5.5 ka and the onset of Neoglaciation. The orbitally forced first-order cooling trend reflected in the lake records after 5.5 ka is interrupted by abrupt step-function shifts, recording changes in the state of the catchments, including increases in periglacial activity and decreases in vegetation cover at 4.2 ka, 3.0 ka and 1.5 ka, and culminating in the Little Ice Age (LIA) between 0.7 and 0.1 ka. The combined lake records demonstrate that landscape instability and soil erosion preceded human colonization of Iceland by several centuries, and that for several centuries after settlement soil erosion was reduced. Although changes in land use and deforestation associated with the settlement, probably made the region more susceptible to disturbance from natural climate variability, the initiation of landscape instability at the beginning of the LIA appears to be unrelated to human activity. Because Icelands climate is dominated by North Atlantic circulation, our synchronized records may provide a template for other land areas around the northern North Atlantic and GreenlandIceland and the Norwegian (GIN) seas."
__label__UNRELATED	"The initial break-up of Panga elicited by Late Palozoic deglaciation  Abstract: The break-up of Panga was principally facilitated by tensional plate stress acting on pre-existing suture zones. The rifting of Panga began during the Early Permian along the southern Tethys margin and produced the lenticular-shaped continent known as Cimmeria. A mantle-plume model is ascribed to explain the rift-related volcanism but the NW-SE oriented Cimmerian rifts do not correlate well with pre-existing suture zones or structural heterogeneities but appear to have a pertinent spatial and temporal association with Late Palozoic glacial-interglacial cycles. Mantle potential temperature estimates of Cimmerian rift-related basalts (1410 C 50 C) are similar to ambient mantle conditions rather than an active mantle-plume rift as previously suggested. Moreover, we find that the distribution of glacial deposits shows significant temporal and spatial concurrence between the glacial retreat margins and rifting sites. We conclude that the location and timing of Cimmerian rifting resulted from the exploitation of structural heterogeneities within the crust that formed due to repeated glacialinterglacial cycles during the Late Palozoic. Such effects of continental deglaciation helped to create the lenticular shape of Cimmeria and Neotethys Ocean suggesting that, in some instances, climate change may directly influence the location of rifting. Conclusions: There is a spatial and temporal association between glacial retreat and rifting of Cimmerian terranes from Gondwana during the Late Palozoic. Ambient mantle potential temperatures estimates of Early Permian Cimmerian rift-related basalts from Oman, Kashmir and Tibet are supportive of an archetypical passive continental rift rather than an active mantle-plume rift with anomalously hot mantle (TP > 1550 C). Although no inherent structural heterogeneity zones or icosahedral tessellation boundaries were present for rift margins to act upon, it is likely that a large differential stress environment, strong postglacial rebound stress, and the shielding effect of the ice sheet created regions of structural heterogeneities for a later extensional tectonic stress to exploit. Therefore, it is very likely that the eruption of flood basalts, rifting of Cimmeria and the formation of the Neotethys Ocean are directly related to deglaciation of the Late Palozoic ice sheet. Such a relationship between environmental change and supercontinent break-up may be unique to the Late Palozoic."
__label__UNRELATED	"Synchronous Wildfire Activity Rise and Mire Deforestation at the TriassicJurassic Boundary  Abstract: The end-Triassic mass extinction event (,201.4 million years ago) caused major faunal and floral turnovers in both the marine and terrestrial realms. The biotic changes have been attributed to extreme greenhouse warming across the Triassic Jurassic (TJ) boundary caused by massive release of carbon dioxide and/or methane related to extensive volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), resulting in a more humid climate with increased storminess and lightning activity. Lightning strikes are considered the primary source of wildfires, producing charcoal, microscopically recognized as inertinite macerals. The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of pyrolytic origin and allochthonous charcoal in siliciclastic TJ boundary strata has suggested widespread wildfire activity at the time. We have investigated largely autochthonous coal and coaly beds across the TJ boundary in Sweden and Denmark. These beds consist of predominantly organic material from the in situ vegetation in the mires, and as the coaly beds represent a substantial period of time they are excellent environmental archives. We document a remarkable increase in inertinite content in the coal and coaly beds across the TJ boundary. We show estimated burning temperatures derived from inertinite reflectance measurements coupled with palynological data and conclude that pre-boundary late Rhaetian mire wildfires included high-temperature crown fires, whereas latest RhaetianSinemurian mire wildfires were more frequent but dominated by lower temperature surface fires. Our results suggest a major change in the mire ecosystems across the TJ boundary from forested, conifer dominated mires to mires with a predominantly herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. Contrary to the overall regional vegetation for which onset of recovery commenced in the early Hettangian, the sensitive mire ecosystem remained affected during the Hettangian and did not start to recover until around the HettangianSinemurian boundary. Decreasing inertinite content through the Lower Jurassic suggests that fire activity gradually resumed to considerable lower levels.

This was associated with a change from more forested mires in the late Rhaetian to more fern- and shrub-dominated mire floras in the latest Rhaetian, Hettangian and early Sinemurian as indicated both by calculated burning temperatures and palynology. Increased fire activity and deforestation thus appeared to start in the latest Rhaetian below the TJ boundary. These changes are in agreement with other studies that have shown deforestation [7,15,26,69] and charcoal abundance in the latest Rhaetian close to the TJ boundary [16,23,24]. High concentrations of PAHs in Hettangian strata from Poland [24] suggest the most intense fire activity occurred during this period, followed by a decrease, with calculated burning temperatures ranging from 295377uC indicating predominance of surface fires and maybe ground fires [24]. This is in excellent agreement with our results, however our data show continued high wildfire activity in mires during the entire Hettangian (Fig. 5). The causes for the increase in fire activity across the TJ boundary can possibly be linked to two principal factors causing a more wild climate: (1) the establishment of a large sea in a seasonal climate and (2) the contemporaneous CAMP volcanism. It is tempting to select the CAMP volcanism as the main factor as its immediate effect would have been a warmer climate with increased water vapour triggered by extensive CO2 and aerosol release. Evaporation from the sea would possibly have accentuated humidity. High water vapour and seasonality likely increased the frequency of thunderstorms and lightning significantly and it is well-established that lightning strikes are the main cause of wildfire ignition [48]. Initially, thefloral change to less forested mires may have been a shorter-term effect of SO2 pollution associated with CAMP volcanism [7]. The high fire activity possibly helped to sustain more open mire environments, preventing regrowth of arborescent plants. Removal of the canopy may potentially also have made it easier to dry out surface litter in drier months making it more flammable. However, while the regional palynological record indicates early Hettangian recovery of arborescent vegetation, the mire flora remained affected indicating that the environmental changes had a more long-term effect on the sensitive mire ecosystem. The high fire activity and dominance of surface fires during the Hettangian likely indicates a change to at least periodically less waterlogged mires enabling frequent burning of dried surface fuels, maybe promoted by a fluctuating watertable facilitated by a seasonal climate with unevenly distributed rainfall through the year [35]. The TJ boundary was thus a high-stress period that forced the vegetation to adapt to new environmental conditions. Although recovery of the regional terrestrial ecosystem appears to have started already in the early Hettangian [26], recovery of the sensitive mire floras did not commence until around the HettangianSinemurian boundary and decreasing inertinite content through the Lower Jurassic (Fig. 2) suggests that fire activity gradually resumed to considerable lower and possibly more normal levels."
__label__UNRELATED	"The influence of soil age and regional climate on clay mineralogy and cation exchange capacity of moist tropical soils_ A case study from Late Quaternary chronosequences in Costa Rica  Abstract: Tropical soils exhibit large differences across landscapes in many attributes, notably clay mineralogy (2:1 vs. 1:1 clays), bulk geochemistry (Ca, Al), pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter and soil texture. In order to examine the factors controlling these variables, a series of three chronosequences (120 ka) of tropical soils on uplifted terraces along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica were studied. The three study locations differ mainly as a function of soil moisture and leaching, with conditions ranging from 2700 mm/yr mean annual precipitation (MAP) on the southern Nicoya Peninsula (4-month dry season), to 3200 mm/yr in the Esterillos region (3-month dry season), and 4250 mm/yr on the Osa Peninsula (no dry season). Analytical methods include X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission-analytical electron microscopy (TEM-AEM), inductively coupled plasma optical emission and mass spectrometry (ICP-OES, ICP-MS), ammonium acetate extraction (1 M NH4OAc, pH = 7, for CEC) and C:N analysis. Soil weathering reactions and related decrease in CEC occur three-to-four times faster in a sequence of Inceptisol-to-Oxisol soils in the wettest climate (Osa) compared to the less-moist Esterillos area; in the even drier monsoon climate soils (Nicoya), this evolved, low-CEC (< 10 cmolc/kg) state does not occur, even after 120 ka of soil formation, and rate of compositional alteration is approximately five to ten times slower than at Osa. The dominant exchangeable cation at all sites is Ca. Interlayer K and Al increase relative to Ca over time, resulting in interstratified K-S with smectite layers that become progressively more vermiculite-like and illite-like. The age-related evolution of tropical soils appears to be a predictable sequence in lowland tropical landscapes where periodic tectonism, erosion or volcanism produces unweathered parent material at the land surface. Empirical data from this project enables the extrapolation of simple equations applicable to tropical volcanic arc landscapes where presence of uplifted marine terrace soils facilitates determination of soil age. The two variables controlling soil composition can be combined into an effective age (ageeff) that takes into account soil age and weathering intensity (factoring in MAP and wet-dry months from climate data), and equations are of the form, e.g. ECEC =18.1 ln(ageeff) + 77, with R values of 0.75 to 0.87. Greatest scatter occurs in the youngest soils. Given the apparent prevalence of this sequence and the systematic nature of its reaction progression, these results could be useful for modeling tropical soils. 6. Conclusions: XRD, TEM-AEM, and FTIR analyses indicate that, with increasing soil age in all three chronosequences, early pedogenic smectite transforms into K-S and eventually to an assemblage dominated by kaolinite and halloysite. This shift in mineralogy causes a drop in CEC from 67 12 cmolc/ kg in smectite-dominated Holocene soils to 31 9 cmolc/kg in K-S dominated soils to 7 6 in Late Pleistocene halloysite + kaolinitedominated soils. These changes occur approximately three-to-four times more rapidly in the humid rainforest ecosystem of the Osa Peninsula (4250 mm MAP) compared to the drier Esterillos region (3200 MAP) and likely five-to-ten times more rapidly than the more savanna-like ecosystem of the southern Nicoya Peninsula (2700 mm MAP). The two primary factors controlling soil composition in the moist tropics age and climate can be combined into an effective age (ageeff) that accounts for weathering duration and intensity and facilitates prediction of soil properties including CEC and mineralogy."
__label__UNRELATED	"Evidence for a spike in mantle carbon outgassing during the Ediacaran period  Abstract: 1Department of Geology, University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, Oshkosh, WI, USA. 2Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA. 3Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, Department of Earth Sciences, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. *e-mail: paulsen@uwosh.edu The largest reservoir of carbon on Earth resides in the mantle, but how it has evolved over the planets history and influenced global climate remains an unresolved fundamental problem1. According to standard models, there were times when the exogenic carbon inputs (igneous and metamorphic degassing) outweighed the outputs (silicate weathering, burial sequestration and subduction), leading to global warming and rising sea levels2. The balance of exogenic atmospheric inputs and outputs during the Neoproterozoic is of particular interest because this period was marked by major perturbations in the global carbon cycle that have been hypothetically connected to changing climate, atmospheric oceanic oxygenation and biodiversification before the Cambrian explosion of life3,4. Although the details of changes in the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2) throughout the Neoproterozoic are poorly understood, it seems to have risen from relatively low levels as the Earth transitioned from its Snowball Earth state in the Cryogenian (approximately 720635 million years ago (Ma)) to a maximum Phanerozoic level during its greenhouse state in the Cambrian5. Recent analyses of a growing worldwide detrital zircon database have led to the conclusion that late Neoproterozoic Phanerozoic transitions from Earths ice to greenhouse states coincide with increases in zircon abundance6. Long-term global warming has, therefore, been linked to the notion that increases in pCO2 are governed by widespread expansion of continental arc magmatism6,7. Although increasing exogenic CO2 input has commonly been taken to mark surges in carbonate subduction8, significant calcareous pelagic deposition did not commence until the Cretaceous9. Subduction of carbonated ocean crust and mantle, as well as the carbonates stripped off continents and shed into adjacent trenches, offer possible carbon inputs into Precambrian subduction zones. However, there are fundamental uncertainties about the palaeo-temperature and -pressure regimes of ancient arcs and whether they met the conditions that are required for efficient decarbonation of subducted slabs to fuel substantial CO2 emissions1. It has also been noted that time periods of increased carbonatite magmatism seem to correlate with past warmer climates (for example, during the Cretaceous and Eocene10, as well as the Ediacaran11). A plausible causal link exists, as carbonatite melts can degas on ascent, releasing significant amounts of CO2 when they reach relatively shallow depths (< 90 km)12. Carbonatites are typically made up of 50% carbonate minerals13. Therefore, even if the total magma production rate is low, they emit an anomalously large amount of CO2 compared with the average arc magma, which typically has less than 5,000 ppm of CO2. Equally important is the fact that this magma type erupts with other alkaline magmas that are also highly enriched in CO2. The global impact of alkaline and carbonatite magmatism is highlighted by studies that have shown the potential for these magma types to emit tenand up to fifty-times more CO2 into the atmosphere, respectively, than arc magmas16,17. Therefore, the record of alkaline and carbonatite magmatism in the rock record may point to significant, punctuated CO2 releases from the subcontinental mantle reservoir10; a potentially important process operating outside of the steady state within the carbon cycle that warrants investigation. We carried out a coupled UPb age and trace element analysis of 5,715 detrital zircons from 46 sandstone samples (primarily Neoproterozoicearly Palaeozoic in age) widely distributed along a ~3,000-km-long swath of the Neoproterozoicearly Palaeozoic Pacific-Gondwana margin in Antarctica (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These sandstones are of interest because they are known to contain high concentrations of the prototypical 700500 Ma zircon UPb age population that overlaps with the EdiacaranCambrian global warming phase that has been linked to higher CO2 emissions from continental arcs6. The sources of this zircon age population may include exposed and ice-covered igneous provinces in Antarctica, such as the Ross orogen1820, for Evidence for a spike in mantle carbon outgassing during the Ediacaran period"
__label__UNRELATED	"Preservation of glacial and interglacial phases in Tethys Himalaya: evidence from geochemistry and petrography of Permo-Carboniferous sandstones from the Spiti region, Himachal Pradesh, India  Abstract: Through a multidisciplinary approach, including petrology and geochemistry, the sedimentary provenance and paleo-weathering of the Permo-Carboniferous Spiti sandstones of Tethys Himalaya are investigated. The Spiti region consists of texturally immature to mature sandstones composed of unsorted to sorted and subangular to subrounded clastic grains dominated by variable amounts of quartz and feldspar accompanied by lithic fragments (mostly metasedimentary, sedimentary, and plutonic grains). They are characterized bymoderate to high SiO2 contents, moderate K2O/Na2O ratios, but relatively low mafic contents. Uniform rare earth element (REE) patterns similar to upper continental crustal (UCC) with light REE (LREE) enrichment (LaN/ SmN=3.91), flat heavy REE (HREE; GdN/YbN=1.212.5), and negative Eu anomalies with variable amounts of REE and Eu anomalies (0.40.8) suggest that hydraulic sorting played a significant role. The striking similarities of the multi-elemental spider diagrams of the Spiti sandstones and the Himalayan granitoids indicate that sediments are sourced from the Proterozoic and Cambro-Ordovician orogenic belts of the Himalayan region. The nature of the feldspar observed in thin sections frommost altered to euhedral pristine minerals corresponding to Carboniferous to lower Permian sandstones strongly indicates a change in climate from most favorable conditions for rapid feldspar alteration (humid) to conditions where negligible alteration is possible (arid and glacial). It is found that the chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of these sandstones accorded with inferences based on modified chemical index of alteration (CIX) andCa values, and sedimentologic and paleontological evidence, discriminating well between warm-humid (indicated by high CIA values) and aridglacial (representing low CIA) conditions in the Spiti basin. Thus, these results document a complete record of glacial and interglacial phases in the Permocarboniferous Spiti sandstones, and the interpretations are consistent with other such studies on the Phanerozoic glaciation events on Gondwana supercontinent. Conclusions: The Permo-Carboniferous sandstones of the NW Tethys Himalaya, Spiti region, northern India, display considerable variations in their mineralogy, and major and trace element compositions, which are dominantly controlled by the source rocks, weathering conditions of the provenance, hydraulic sorting, and the then prevailing climatic conditions. Petrographic analysis revealed that these sandstones contain varied types and amount of detritus which was mainly derived from coarse grained plutonic rocks, recycled quartzose sediments with subordinate amounts of metamorphic rocks. This inference in turn strongly endorses our argument that the source for the Spiti basin lies very near and south of the Spiti basin such as Precambrian Higher Himalayan Vaikrita granites and gneisses and Cambro-Ordovician granites occurring all along the Lesser Himalayan zone. Quartzarenites, sublitharenites, and subarkose of the Kanawar Group of sandstones have petrographic (texture, framework mineralogy, quartz type, and inclusions in quartz) and geochemical characteristics (such as REE patterns, Th/Sc, La/Sc, Cr/Th, and Eu/Eu* ratios) that suggest quartzoze recycled sedimentary rocks as the source rocks in addition to high-grade metamorphic and plutonic igneous rocks. The obtained data are consistent with the passive continental margin tectonic setting or intra-continental rift environment for the Spiti sandstones. Thesource area was affected by deferential degree of weathering from intense to low as recorded in the detrital mineralogy and CIA values. The span of CIA values (7853) recorded in the Spiti sandsones corresponding to different formations of the Kanawar Group may result from varying (more intense to low) degrees of weathering conditions which in turn reflect variable climate conditions during the Permo-Carboniferous period. Geochemical proxies (e.g., CIA values), paleontologi ca l ( fo ss i l ) ev idence coup led wi th sys temat i c lithostratigraphic variations in the compositional maturity of the Kanawar Group sandstones (i.e., from base to top, maturesubmature to immature) are very well linked to the changing paleo-climate of Indian subcontinent (i.e., warm, humid to glacial, and arid) associated with the Carboniferous to Permian drift of the landmass through differential latitudinal zones and the overall change in global climate (Scheffler et al. 2003). Thus, the Permo-Carboniferous Tethys Himalayan sequence in the Spiti region documents progressive long-term cooling from cool humid climates in Visean to cold sub-polar climate in the Asselian period.Detrital zircon peaks in the Tethyan sediments ranging from Paleoproterozoic (1.81.9 Ga) and Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic ages (0.9Ga to 570 Ma) have been reported by many workers, and similar peak ages have been documented in correlative Lesser Himalayan and Higher Himalayan granitoid belts along strike of the Himalaya. This in turn indicates a southern provenance for the clastic Tethyan Himalayan units in Nepal and northwest India attributed to Cambro-Ordovician tectonic activity on the northern Indian margin. A good similarity between multi-elemental spider diagrams of Spiti sandstones and the Proterozoic and Paleozoic granitoids from the Himalayas is obtainedwhich substantiates the above inference and suggests that Tethyan sediments may have been derived from these granitoid belts.Acknowledgments We are thankful to the Chairman, Department of Geology, AMU, Aligarh, for providing necessary facilities.

__label__SUPPORT	"Gas emissions due to magmasediment interactions during flood magmatism at the Siberian Traps Gas dispersion and environmental consequences  Abstract: We estimate the fluxes of extremely reduced gas emissions produced during the emplacement of the Siberian Traps large igneous province, due to magma intrusion in the coaliferous sediments of the Tunguska Basin. Using the results of a companion paper (Iacono-Marziano et al., accepted for publication), and a recent work about low temperature interaction between magma and organic 10 g/yr for a single magmatic/volcanic event. These fluxes are 720 times higher than those calculated for purely magmatic gas emissions, in the absence of interaction with organic matter-rich sediments. We investigate, by means of atmospheric modelling employing present geography of Siberia, the short and mid-term dispersion of these gas emissions into the atmosphere. The lateral propagation of CO and CH4 leads to an important perturbation of the atmosphere chemistry, consisting in a strong reduction of the radical OH concentration. As a consequence, both CO and CH4 lifetimes in the lower atmosphere are enhanced by a factor of at least 3, at the continental scale, as a consequence of 30 days of magmatic activity. The short-term effect of the injection of carbon monoxide and methane into the atmosphere is therefore to increase the residence times of these two species and, in turn, their capacity of geographic expansion. The estimated CO and CH4 volume mixing ratios (i.e. the number of molecules of CO or CH4 per cm , divided by the total number of molecules per cm) in the low atmosphere are 25 ppmv at the continental scale and locally higher than 50 ppmv. The dimension of the area affected by these high volume mixing ratios decreases in the presence of a lava flow accompanying magma intrusion at depth. Complementary calculations for a 10-yr duration of the magmatic activity suggest (i) an increase in the mean CH4 volume mixing ratio of the whole atmosphere up to values 315 times higher than the current one, and (ii) recovery times of 100 yr to bring back the atmospheric volume mixing ratio of CH4 to the pre-magmatic value. Thermogenic methane emissions from the Siberian Traps have already been proposed to crucially contribute to end PermianEarly Triassic global warming and to the negative carbon isotopic shift observed globally in both marine and terrestrial sediments. Our results corroborate these hypotheses and suggest that concurrent high temperature CO emissions also played a key role by contributing to increase (i) the radiative forcing of methane and therefore in its global warming potential, and (ii) the input of isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere that generated the isotopic excursion. We also speculate a poisoning effect of high carbon monoxide concentrations on end-Permian fauna, at a local scale. & 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 5. Conclusions: LIP eruptions coincide with major mass extinctions (Vogt, 1972; Courtillot and Renne, 2003). The possible causal link has been ascribed to both short and long term effects of volcanic gas emissions (Wignall, 2001; Scaillet, 2008). Here we show that the environmental consequences of magmatic activity are, inter alia, strongly dependent on magmahost rock interactions, in particular when the host rocks are composed of carbonates, sulphates, salts, or organic compounds (as already proposed by Svensen et al., 2004, 2007, 2009; Ganino and Arndt, 2009). Such a mechanism leads to atmospheric injection of volatiles in amounts greatly exceeding the original magmatic content and possibly departing significantly from the redox state of the magma source. The atmospheric modelling of COCH4 dominated gas emissions resulting from magmaorganic matter interactions at the Siberian Traps shows that (i) carbon monoxide levels attained in the low atmosphere at the continental scale were comparable to those currently measured in polluted urban areas (25 ppmv), and significantly higher close to the degassing zone (450 ppmv); (ii) important perturbations of atmosphere chemistry were attained leading to substantial decrease in the radical OH concentration; (iii) CO and CH4 lifetimes were consequently enhanced (320 times at the continental scale),therefore increasing the residence time of these two species in the atmosphere. Ten years of magmatic/volcanic activity are calculated to increase by factor of 1050 the mean concentration of methane in the whole atmosphere, yielding a radiative forcing comparable or superior to that due to the increase of both CO2 and CH4 concentration between 1765 and 1990. Short-term poisoning of local fauna by carbon monoxide and long-term global warming by methane are therefore the most likely implications of gas emissions due to magmaorganic matter interactions at the Siberian Traps."
__label__UNRELATED	"Controls on clay minerals assemblages in an early paleogene nonmarine succession: Implications for the volcanic and paleoclimatic record of extra-andean patagonia, Argentina  Abstract: The distribution of the clay minerals of the Banco Negro Inferior-Rio Chico Group succession (BNI-RC), a middle Danianemiddle Eocene mainly continental epiclasticepyroclastic succession exposed in the Golfo San Jorge Basin, extra-Andean Patagonia (w46 LS), is assessed in order to determine the possible origin of clay and specific non-clay minerals using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The control over the clay mineralogy of the sedimentary settings, contemporary volcanism, paleoclimate and weathering conditions is considered. A paleoclimatic reconstruction is provided and correlated with the main global warming events that occurred during the early Paleogene. Mineralogical analyses of BNI-RC demonstrate that smectite and kaolin minerals (kaolinite, halloysite and kaolinite/smectite mixed layers) are the main clay minerals, whereas silica polymorphs (volcanic glass and opal) are common non-clay minerals. Throughout the succession, smectite and kaolin minerals are arranged in different proportions in the three clayemineral assemblages. These show a general vertical trend in which the smectite-dominated assemblage (S1) is replaced by the smectite-dominated assemblage associated with other clays (S2) and the kaolinite-dominated assemblage (K), and finally by S2 up-section. The detailed micromorphological analysis of the clay and non-clay minerals allows us to establish that the origins of these are by volcanic ash weathering, authigenic and pedogenic, and that different stages in the evolution of mineral transformations have occurred. The supply of labile pyroclastic material from an active volcanic area located to the northwest of the study area could have acted as precursor of the authigenic and volcanogenic minerals of the analyzed succession. Diverse fine-grained lithological facies (muddy and tuffaceous facies) and sedimentary settings (coastal swamp and transitional environments, and different fluvial systems) together with variable climate and weathering conditions controlled the mineralogical transformations and the arrangement of clayemineral assemblages. The paleoclimatic reconstruction suggests a general warm and humid climate. However, the temporal trend of the clayemineral assemblages, the ratios between smectite and kaolinite and the micromorphological analysis of clay minerals contrasted with evidence from sedimentological analyses suggest a warm and seasonal climate for the basal part of the unit, a warm and humid climate with a relatively more perennial rainfall regime in the middle part of the unit, and a warm and less humid, probably subhumid, climate up-section. Such a reconstruction makes it possible to establish a correlation with some of the hyperthermal events of the Early Paleogene Global Warming (EPGW) and, consequently, constitute one of the most complete time records of the EPGW in South America. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Conclusions: The Banco Negro Inferior-Rio Chico Group, a middle Daniane middle Eocene in age mainly continental epiclasticepyroclastic succession in the Golfo San Jorge Basin (extra-Andean Patagonia,Argentina), was deposited under the global greenhouse conditions of the early Paleogene and is contemporarywith an important period of explosive volcanic activity toward the northwest of the basin. The BNI-RC succession shows that sedimentary settings of deposition vary from coastal swamp and transitional environments (BNI and NT) through a low- and high-sinuosity fluvial system (LV, PC, LF) to a distal fluvial system with loess and ash-fall deposits (KK). Tuff and tuffaceous facies and associated paleosols are common and increase up-section. Previous petrographic and paleocurrent analyses of the succession show that such volcaniclastic materials come from the volcanoes located less than 400 km to the northwest of the study area, and that BNI-RC was only affected by shallow-burial diagenetic conditions.XRD and SEM analyses demonstrate that smectite and kaolin minerals (kaolinite, halloysite and kaolinite/smectite mixed layers) prevail over other clay minerals (illite/smectite mixed layers, illite and chlorite) in the fine-grained facies of BNI-RC. Quartz, feldspar, other silica polymorphs in the form of volcanic glass and different types of opal, together with clinoptilolite and Fe-oxides are the most abundant non-clay minerals. Such analyses provide evidence that smectite is in general well crystallized and is defined as a mixture of montmorilloniteebeidellite series. The micromorphological study confirms that such smectite was produced by the alteration of volcanic glass. Smectites with a lower degree of crystallization are also present and suggest a pedogenic origin. Wellcrystallized kaolinite with book-like, vermiform texture and vermicular stacks of plates suggests an authigenic origin. The relationship between halloysite and/or smectite and volcanic glass reveals local in situ dissolution and precipitation. The micromorphological evolution from halloysite to kaolinite and the characteristics of the kaolinite/smectite mixed layers are interpreted as pedogenic in origin. The relationship between opal and volcanic materials indicates that the silica phases came from the in situ alteration of volcanic glass. For the clinoptilolite, an authigenic origin is proposed, whereas for Fe-oxides a pedogenic origin is accepted.The clay minerals mentioned are arranged in three clayemineral assemblages: S1: rich in smectite; S2: with smectite and other clay minerals; K: kaolinite-rich. These assemblages show a trend up-section from S1 (BNIebase of LV) through S2 and K (upper part of LV and PCemiddle part of KK) to S2 (lower part of KK). Such a trend is in concordance with the change in the sedimentary settings mentioned above and with the increase in volcaniclastic materials and paleosols up-section.The presence of smectite and kaolinite suggests chemical weathering conditions under warm and humid conditions. However, the ratio between them (S/K ratio) together with the sedimentary facies analyses, makes it possible to recognize several pulses of seasonality or less intense precipitation throughout the succession, such as at BNIebase of LV and at the upper part of KK. Besides, the occurrence of halloysite in paleosols of the top of PC, tuffs of the base of LF and in some samples of the middle part of KK against the presence of kaolinite in the basalemiddle part of KK allows us to distinguish relatively more perennial e though not abundant e rainfall when the first mineral appears, and a more year-round regime where kaolinite is concentrated.Paleoclimatic reconstructions of the BNI-RC succession strongly suggest a possible correlation of these with global warm climatic events of the Early Paleogene Global Warming (EPGW). The probable presence of some of these warm events constitutes one of the most complete time records of the EPGW in South America and could contribute to the resolution of the global character of these events.Thus, the clay-mineralogical arrangement throughout the BNIRC succession is interpreted as being a consequence of theinterplay of several control factors, such as the supply of labile pyroclastic materials, sedimentary paleoenvironments and lithologies of the facies, sedimentation/pedogenesis rates, paleoclimate and weathering conditions."
__label__UNRELATED	"Beyond methane: Towards a theory for the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum  Abstract: Extreme global warmth and an abrupt negative carbon isotope excursion during the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have been attributed to a massive release of methane hydrate from sediments on the continental slope [G.R. Dickens, J.R. O'Neil, D.K. Rea, R.M. Owen, Dissociation of oceanic methane hydrate as a cause of the carbon isotope excursion at the end of the Paleocene, Paleoceanography 10 (1995) 965971.]. However, the magnitude of the warming (5 to 6 C [J.C. Zachos, M.W. Wara, S. Bohaty, M.L. Delaney, M.R. Petrizzo, A. Brill, T.J. Bralower, I. Premoli-Silva, A transient rise in tropical sea surface temperature during the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum, Science 302 (2003) 15511554.,J.P. Kennett, L.D. Stott, Abrupt deep-sea warming, paleoceanographic changes and benthic extinctions at the end of the Paleocene, Nature 353 (1991) 225228.]) and rise in the depth of the CCD (N2 km; [J.C. Zachos, U. Rohl, S.A. Schellenberg, D. Hodell, E. Thomas, A. Sluijs, C. Kelly, H. McCarren, D. Kroon, I. Raffi, L.J. Lourens, M. Nicolo, Rapid acidification of the ocean during the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum, Science 308 (2005) 16111615.]) indicate that the size of the carbon addition was larger than can be accounted for by the methane hydrate hypothesis. Additional carbon sources associated with methane hydrate release (e.g. pore-water venting and turbidite oxidation) are also insufficient. We find that the oxidation of at least 5000 Gt C of organic carbon is the most likely explanation for the observed geochemical and climatic changes during the PETM, for which there are several potential mechanisms. Production of thermogenic CH4 and CO2 during contact metamorphism associated with the intrusion of a large igneous province into organic rich sediments [H. Svensen, S. Planke, A. Malthe-Sorenssen, B. Jamtveit, R. Myklebust, T.R. Eidem, S.S. Rey, Release of methane from a volcanic basin as a mechanism for initial Eocene global warming, Nature 429 (2004).] is capable of supplying large amounts of carbon, but is inconsistent with the lack of extensive carbon loss in metamorphosed sediments, as well as the abrupt onset and termination of carbon release during the PETM. A global conflagration of Paleocene peatlands [A.C. Kurtz, L.R. Kump, M.A. Arthur, J.C. Zachos, A. Paytan, Early Cenozoic decoupling of the global carbon and sulfur cycles, Paleoceanography 18 (2003).] highlights a large terrestrial carbon source, but massive carbon release by fire seems unlikely as it would require that all peatlands burn at once and then for only 10 to 30 ky. In addition, this hypothesis requires an order of magnitude increase in the amount of carbon stored in peat. The isolation of a large epicontinental seaway by tectonic uplift associated with volcanism or continental collision, followed by desiccation and bacterial respiration of the aerated organic matter is another potential mechanism for the rapid release of large amounts of CO2.

Potential mechanisms of carbon release include complete combustion of an extremely large terrestrial carbon pool, metamorphism associated with a large intrusive complex in the North Atlantic, and the desiccation of a major epicontinental seaway. Further research on the timing and duration of intrusive volcanism and the organic carbon content of the metamorphic aureoles, the size of the late Paleocene terrestrial carbon pool, and the depositional histories of early Cenozoic epicontinental seaways is needed to test these hypotheses. Regardless of the specific mechanism, the PETM is a natural analogue for increases in atmospheric CO2 due to fossil fuel burning over the next century, and implies a relatively high climate sensitivity."
__label__UNRELATED	"Mass-production of CambroOrdovician quartz-rich sandstone as a consequence of chemical weathering of Pan-African terranes: Environmental implications  Abstract: A vast sheet of mature quartz sand blanketed north Africa and Arabia from the Atlantic coast to the Persian Gulf in Cambro Ordovician times. UPb geochronology of a representative section of Cambrian sandstone in southern Israel shows that these sediments are dominated by 550650 Ma detrital zircons derived from Neoproterozoic Pan-African basement. The short time lag between magmatic consolidation of a Pan-African source and deposition of its erosional products indicates that, despite their significant mineralogical maturity, the voluminous quartz-rich sandstones on the northern margin of Gondwana are essentially firstcycle sediments. Mass production of these voluminous first-cycle quartz-rich sandstones resulted from widespread chemical weathering of the Pan-African continental basement. We suggest that conditions favoring silicate weathering, particularly a warm and humid climate, low relief and low sedimentation rates prevailed over large tracts of Gondwana in the aftermath of the Pan-African orogeny. An unusually corrosive CambroOrdovician atmosphere and humid climate enhanced chemical weathering on the vegetation-free landscape. We infer that late NeoproterozoicCambroOrdovician atmospheric pCO2 rose as a consequence of widespread late Neoproterozoic volcanism, followed by an uptake of CO2 by chemical weathering to produce the CambroOrdovician sandstone as a negative feedback.

__label__SUPPORT	"Bipolar correlation of volcanism with millennial climate change  Abstract: Analyzing data from our optical dust logger, we find that volcanic ash layers from the Siple Dome (Antarctica) borehole are simultaneous (with >99% rejection of the null hypothesis) with the onset of millennium-timescale cooling recorded at Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2; Greenland). These data are the best evidence yet for a causal connection between volcanism and millennial climate change and lead to possibilities of a direct causal relationship. Evidence has been accumulating for decades that volcanic eruptions can perturb climate and possibly affect it on long timescales and that volcanism may respond to climate change. If rapid climate change can induce volcanism, this result could be further evidence of a southern-lead NorthSouth climate asynchrony. Alternatively, a volcanic-forcing viewpoint is of particular interest because of the high correlation and relative timing of the events, and it may involve a scenario in which volcanic ash and sulfate abruptly increase the soluble iron in large surface areas of the nutrientlimited Southern Ocean, stimulate growth of phytoplankton, which enhance volcanic effects on planetary albedo and the global carbon cycle, and trigger northern millennial cooling. Large global temperature swings could be limited by feedback within the volcanoclimate system."
__label__UNRELATED	"Petrology of Rifted-Margin Sand (Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, Yemen)  Abstract: The Red SeaGulf of Aden rift system, displaying a complete record of magmatic activity and characterized by arid climate and negligible anthropic modifications, provides an ideal natural laboratory for studies aimed at defining actualistic references for both volcanic and nonvolcanic rifted-margin provenances. Rifted-margin sands are derived in various proportions from volcanic to plutonic rocks emplaced before, during, or after the climax of tectonic extension (volcanic rifted-margin provenance) and from prerift sedimentary successions and underlying crystalline basements progressively unroofed during uplift of rift blocks (rift-shoulder provenance). Volcaniclastic rifted-margin sands are feldspatholithic, as are those shed by Pacific-type magmatic arcs, but are characterized by bimodal (basalt/rhyolite) lithics, abundant granophyre grains, and low plagioclase/total feldspar (P/F) ratios due to supply from synrift hypersolvus alkali granites, representing the upper levels of rift-generated juvenile crust. Augite dominates among dense minerals; detritus from postrift alkali-basalt fields includes olivine and, locally, enstatite and spinel. Sedimentary detritus from undissected rift shoulders consists of recycled quartz and carbonate sedimentary lithics; dense mineral assemblages include largely rounded to subrounded, recycled durable grains, zircon, and rutile being concentrated locally due to their higher density. Arkosic sands from basement rocks exposed on dissected rift shoulders display remarkably consistent compositions, with excess quartz with respect to ideal arkose; hornblende-rich assemblages from amphibolite-facies gneiss terranes contrast with epidote-dominated assemblages from greenschist-facies arc terranes. Diagnostic signatures and compositional trends recorded by modern Yemen sands may help in interpreting provenance of ancient rift-related sandstone suites. Conclusions: This work provides detailed information on both framework grain and dense-mineral composition of modern sand from the Red SeaGulf of Aden rift system, a classic laboratory for actualistic rift studies. The Yemen case is particularly significant because, due to arid climates and low population density, sand composition can be safely held as primary and not modified by either chemical weathering or mans activities. Processes in the depositional environment also have a minor effect, as documented by negligible compositional differences between major wadi and beach sands (second- to third-order sampling scale of Ingersoll 1990; Critelli et al. 1997).Along the young continental margins of Yemen, detritus is supplied in various proportions by riftrelated magmatic rocks and by sedimentary successions and underlying Pan-African basement exposed on the uplifted shoulders of the rift. Contrasting feldspatholithic volcano-plutonic (volcanic rifted-margin provenance) and quartzolithic sedimentaclastic to arkosic basementaclastic sig-natures (rift-shoulder provenance) are clearly differentiated on classic Dickinsons QFL diagrams.Rift-related volcano-plutonic detrital suitesnot previously recognizedplot within the magmatic arc provenance field (fig. 3; Dickinson 1985) and are not easily discriminated from sediment shed by Pacific-type magmatic arcs. Diagnostic criteria include low P/F ratios due to supply from hypersolvus alkali-granite stocks and bimodal (basalt/rhyolite) volcanic lithic populations (fig. 8).Rift-shoulder detrital suites plot in the continental block provenance field at increasing distance from the Q pole with increasing depth of erosion level (undissected to dissected stages; fig. 10); however, sand from arc terranes (including paleovolcanic to metabasite lithics) straddles the boundary with the recycled orogen field. Sand from undissected rift-shoulders entirely consists of recycled quartz and carbonate grains from prerift sedimentary successions. Arkosic sand from Precambrian basement rocks shows remarkably consistent composition from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and invariably includes significant amounts of excess quartz with respect to ideal arkose.Transitional rift-shoulder to mixed compositions occur where basement rocks are sparsely exposed beneath sedimentary or volcanic sequences, as along the Jurassic Marib-Balhaf graben or at the periphery of the Yemen Traps plateau. Occurrence of ancient fault lineaments, reactivated repeatedly at successive stages of geologic evolution, can significantly affect detrital modes of modern sand (fig. 4) and cause marked compositional changes between adjacent drainage basins (first- to second-order sampling scales).Volcanic rifted-margin and rift-shoulder provenances are characterized by markedly contrasting dense-mineral assemblages (fig. 6). Volcaniclastic Red Sea sands contain mostly brown augite from the Yemen Traps, locally associated with orthopyroxenes (chiefly hypersthene) from deeper-seated gabbroic rocks; alkali-basalt fields of the Gulf of Aden also shed common olivine and locally, spinel and enstatite. Rift-shoulder detritus is dominated by metamorphic minerals because sedimentary successions provide few dense grains. Amphibolitefacies gneiss terranes supply dominant hornblende, associated with either tremolite-actinolite and epidote (e.g., sand from the Asir terrane) or garnet (sand from the Abas terrane); greenschist-facies arc terranes mostly shed epidote (e.g., Mukalla terrane; fig. 11). Comparable mineralogical suites characterize the Nile sands (fig. 9), fed from the western shoulder of the Red Sea rift and Ethiopian volcanic plateau.This content downloaded from 150.135.135.069 on February 26, 2019 12:43:51 PM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Journal of Geology R I F T - M A R G I N S A N D P E T R O L O G Y 295A C K N O W L E D G M E N T SWe thank our friends in Yemen, Ali Mohsin Hassan, Ahmed Mugbil Hassan, and Hussein, for their kind help in the field.

__label__UNRELATED	"Palaeoflood-generating mechanisms on Earth, Mars, and Titan Introduction: The scientific study of palaeoflooding has risen and fallen largely in concert with prevailing scientific paradigms (Baker, 1998). The paradigm in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was catastrophism, the idea that the geological record and landscape change is the product of sudden, short, violent events. In palaeoflood science this paradigm was expressed as diluvialism the view that the Biblical flood was historically accurate and could explain various geological formations and fossil remains. Catastrophism gave way to uniformitarianism, first introduced in 1830, which stipulated that the Earth's formations are the product of slow, gradual change. Under this paradigm, geological formations previously explained by catastrophic (Biblical) flooding were often transmuted into the effects of sustained river flow or glaciation. The Channeled Scabland in Washington, USA, was originally interpreted at glacial in origin, either directly (through flow of glacial ice) or indirectly (through diversion of rivers). Consequently, the proposal by J Harlan Bretz of massive flooding as an explanation for the Channeled Scabland was originally treated as an absurd or outrageous hypothesis (cf. Davis, 1926; Baker, 1978). Decades of study demonstrated the verity of this hypothesis, establishing palaeoflood hydrology and geomorphology as a subdiscipline of geology (e.g. Kochel and Baker, 1982). During"
__label__NEGATE	"Vegetation and climate change, fire-regime shifts and volcanic disturbance in ChiloE Continental (43S) during the last 10,000 years  Abstract: Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chilo e Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ~10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ~7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years. Our results indicate a primary role of climate change as driver of long-term vegetation change and as a modulator of vegetation responses to volcanic disturbance at multidecadal and centennial timescales. 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: The pollen record from Lago Teo shows multi-millennial dominance of Valdivian rainforest between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP, followed by a gradual replacement by North Patagonian rainforests over the last ~7500 years in the Andean foothills of Chilo e Continental. Aspects of this transition can be explained by a multimillennial cooling trend concomitant with a shift from weakerthan-present SWW during the early Holocene to stronger SWW since 7500 cal yrs BP (Moreno, 2004).The tephrostratigraphy of Lago Teo shows 26 airfall deposits which precede conspicuous changes in the fossil pollen record. We found consistent statistically significant declines in T. stipularis and increases in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia following the deposition of tephras between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP, and increases in T. stipularis over the last 10,000 years. We also observe consistent and significant increases in Hydrangea after the deposition of tephras between 0 and 7500 cal yrs BP and after tephras originating from the Michinmahuida Volcanic Center, and consistent significant increases inW. trichosperma after tephras originating from the Volc an Chait en. Thick tephras also precede major vegetation changes, however, the paucity of these events prevents us from drawing firm conclusions. In sum, our results suggest that explosive volcanism has influenced the structure and composition of the temperate rainforests of Chilo e Continental over the last 10,000 years, and that the response of different opportunistic tree species is modulated by the mean climate state.We identify high paleofire activity between 8250 and 9850 cal yrs BP and during the last 520 years, and lack of consistent statistical significance association between tephra deposition and local fire. This sporadic nature of local fire close to Lago Teo contrasts with the multi-millennial pattern at regional scale (Power et al., 2008; Whitlock et al., 2007), suggesting that climate and vegetation changes in this hyperhumid sector of Chilo e Continental were not conducive for persistent long-term shifts in fire regime during the last 10,000 years and that explosive volcanism did not influence fire regimes near Lago Teo during the Holocene."

A Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model was draped with geo-referenced geological and topographical maps and air photos. The entire RVP region was inspected systematically for tectonic lineaments and volcanic vents. Tectonic lineaments show two distinct directions, NWSE and NNESSW, consistent with the idea of a current stress regime of local NESW compression. We find that there is tectonic control on the regional location for at least two of the three major volcanoes as well as for local distribution of eruptive vents on each of these three volcanoes. Field data show that major volcano instability events occurred in the Holocene for Ngozi caldera and Rungwe. These instability events are possibly associated with the faults controlling the location of both volcanoes. This study highlights the need for monitoring RVP tectonic and volcanic activity. 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: The RVP volcanotectonic architecture was investigated with RS imagery. Air photos were geo-referenced to an SRTM DEM to investigate the spatial distribution and relation between volcanic centres and tectonic lineaments. The tectonic lineament analysis revealed two distinct directions (NWSE and NNESSW), consistent with tectonic models for the region.A spatial distribution analysis of volcanic vents reveals a strong tectonic control on vent distribution. At Ngozi and Rungwe, there is a narrow NWSE elongated zone of vents passing through the volcano summits and consistent with the effect of a major NWSE buried rift fault intersecting with NNESSW faults. Ngozi and Rungwe both show evidence of destabilizing events likely as a result of tectonic activity. At Kyejo, there is a separate cluster of vents also elongated NWSE but with more scatter. There is also an increased role for secondary control by the Mbaka Fault directed obliquely from the main Kyejo trend. Both RS imagery and field studies have shown that the phonolite dome field in the SW Usangu Basin should not be considered the result of recent RVP activity. Leaving this dome field out of the RVP, the recent volcanic vents are confined to one NWSE elongated fault block bounded by the MbakaMbeya Range and Livingstone Faults."

The pyroclastic rocks present a maximum outcropping thickness of 120 m and are dominated by vitreous lapilli and minor lithic tuffs, the products of active volcanism nearby. About 10% of the tuffs consist of lenses of fine banded tuffs with a high leaf content that were deposited in shallow lakes during quiescent periods between periods of volcanic activity. This tuff sequence is pervasively transformed to clinoptilolite/heulandite and mordenite with variable amounts of plagioclase, minor quartz and smectite. Factors thought to have influenced this conversion to zeolites are a humid climate following deposition combined with a slightly elevated heat flow. Local hydrogeological conditions have modified the cation-hydrogen ion ratios across the study area favoring the formation of clinoptilolite/heulandite and mordenite with medium-minor smectite in the center and south, and a more abundant presence of smectite in the north of the study area.

__label__UNRELATED	"Giant evaporite belts of the Neogene central Andes  Abstract: Large volumes of continental evaporites accumulated within the central Andes during Neogene uplift of the Altiplano-Puna plateau and development of the Andean volcanic arc. Halite and gypsum are dominant minerals, along with local and economically important borates. Play a conditions have existed since ca. 15 Ma; halite and borate deposition has occurred for the past 7 to 8 m.y. Evaporites formed in salar environments (e.g., playa lakes) and are characterized by complex mineral assemblages, occurrence, zonation, and geochemistry. Evaporite deposition was controlled by volcanism, geothermal activity, closed drainage, and climate. These Andean deposits, and their controls, differ from evaporites in other continental and marine environments. INTRODUCTION It is widely known that an extensive continental plateau and volcanic arc developed in the central Andes beginning in the Miocene, caused by subduction of the Nazca plate beneath South America. An unappreciated feature of the central Andes is that vast quantities of nonmarine evaporites accumulated in sedimentary basins in the midst of the Neogene Andean uplift. Neogene basins evolved in close relation to arc construction and plateau uplift. New chronological data, presented here, indicate that playa environments have existed since 15 Ma. Neogene and Quaternary evaporitic basins, which locally exceed 5 km in thickness, are an outstanding illustration of mass transfer within the Andean edifice by chemical and physical means. Volcanism, thermal activity, closed basins, and an arid environment together formed a unique surface and crustal environment that controlled evaporite occurrence and mineral assemblages. GEODYNAMIC SETTING OF THE PUNA PLATEAU The Altiplano-Puna plateau, 3 5 0 0 m in base elevation, dominates the physiography of the central Andes (Isacks, 1988). The Puna forms the southern third of the plateau system. A volcanic arc has been active along the western margin of the Altiplano-Puna from Miocene time to the present (Jordan and Gardeweg, 1989). A plateau-scale, internally drained, hydrologic basin is bounded by the volcanic arc on the west and a tectonic highland on the east. Salt flats cover the interior basins of the plateau, totaling thousands of square kilometres. Together, the volcanoes and salt flats are the most spectacular features of the central Andes (Fig. 1). CONDITIONS THAT FAVOR EVAPORITE ACCUMULATION IN THE PUNA Conditions that led to accumulation of evaporite deposits include characteristics of the surface environment and of magmatic and tectonic Figure 1.

A combination of theoretical reasoning and empirical data indicates that the following elements are of critical importance in Puna evaporite deposition. Closed Basins Hydrologically closed drainages in an arid climate, where evaporation exceeds inflow, form conditions favorable for evaporite deposition (Sonnenfeld, 1984). Within the regional Puna basin, several westnorth west-trending volcanic fingers cross the plateau (Fig. 1) (Salfity et al., 1984; Viramonte et al., 1984a) and divide the plateau into separate basins. These basins are further divided by north-south-trending structural blocks, producing numerous stagnant compartments (Igarzabal, 1982).

Eolian dunes locally close parts of surface drainage systems. Volcanism Volcanic activity plays several roles in establishing a favorable evaporite environment and in controlling evaporite mineral assemblages. Beyond the direct controls described here, volcanism is a source of heat that drives geothermal activity. Mass Transfer. Volcanic flows are weathered and eroded, and the volcanic rock-derived detritus and ions are transported to basins where they mix with other clastic and dissolved components. Ash falls have an important content of adsorbed chemical elements (Coradossi et al., 1984; Viramonte et al., 1984b) that are transferred to brines. The amount of ash-adsorbed chemical elements incorporated into the basins could be very large, considering that one volcanic complex, Galan caldera, erupted 1000 km of material in a single eruptive interval (Fig. 1) (Francis et al., 1983). Ignimbrites of the central Andes have high salt contents; even minor weathering releases salts to the air and to surface waters (Ericksen, 1961; Ericksen and Salas, 1989). Closure of Drainage Basins. As noted above, in the Puna, topographic barriers of volcanic origin contribute to closed drainages. Some Puna basins are completely surrounded and can be considered to be intravolcanic basins. Subsidence. Subsidence mechanisms in the Altiplano-Puna are poorly understood (Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Sebrier et al., 1988) but may involve volcanic activity. In some cases a clear spatial and apparent temporal coincidence exists between subsidence and volcanism, and subsidence may be enhanced in the vicinity of the volcanoes. Arizaro Siete Curvas"
__label__SUPPORT	"Source, genesis, and timing of giant ignimbrite deposits associated with Ethiopian continental flood basalts  Abstract: The Ethiopian continental flood basalt (CFB) province ( 30 Ma, 3 10 km) was formed as the result of the impingement of the Afar mantle plume beneath the Ethiopian lithosphere. This province includes major sequences of rhyolitic ignimbrites generally found on top of the flood basalt sequence. Their volume is estimated to be at least 6 10km, which represents 20% of that of the trap basalts. Their phenocryst assemblage (alkali feldspar, quartz, aegyrine-augite, ilmenite Ti-magnetite, richterite, and eckermanite) suggests temperatures in the range of 740 to 900C. Four units were recognized in the field (Wegel Tena, Jima, Lima Limo, and Debre Birhan areas), each with its own geochemical specificity. Zr/Nb ratios remain constant between basalt and rhyolite in each area, and rhyolites associated with high-Ti or low-Ti basalts are, respectively, enriched or depleted in titanium. Their trace element and isotope (Sr, Nd, O) signatures (high Nd/Nd and low Sr/Sr ratios, compared to those of rhyolites from other CFB provinces) are clearly different from those of typical crustal melts and indicate that the Ethiopian rhyolites are among the most isotopically primitive rhyolites. Their major and trace element patterns suggest that they are likely to be derived from fractional crystallization of basaltic magmas similar in composition to the exposed flood basalts with only limited crustal contribution. Since Ethiopian high-Ti basalts have been shown to form from melting of a mantle plume, it is likely that Ethiopian ignimbrites, at least those that are Ti-rich, also incorporated material from the deep mantle. Rb-Sr isochrons on whole rocks and mineral separates (30.1 0.4 Ma for Wegel Tena and 30.5 0.4 Ma for Jima ignimbrites) show that most of the silicic volcanism occurred within 2 Ma during the Oligocene. Ignimbritic eruptions resumed in the Miocene during two episodes dated at 15.4 0.2 Ma and 8.0 0.2 Ma for the Debre Birhan area. The Rb-Sr isochron ages of ignimbrites (both Oligocene and Miocene rhyolites) are indistinguishable within uncertainties from the Ar/Ar ages of the underlying flood basalts. The Oligocene ignimbrites and the underlying trap basalts are synchronous with a shift in the oxygen composition of foraminifera recorded in Indian and Atlantic Ocean cores. The temporal coincidence of Ethiopian Oligocene volcanism, which released immense volumes of S ( 1.4 10 mol) and Cl (6.4 10 mol) into the atmosphere over a short time span, with the global cooling event at 30.3 Ma suggests that this volcanism might have accelerated the climate change that was already underway.

It is compared with available proxy time series for the same period and with more refined data for more recent years. Contrary to previous speculations, the stratosphere from 1671 to 1881 seems to have been mostly undisturbed volcanically, with only two or three eruptions having injected into it truly significant amounts of aerosol-producing and climate-altering sulfur gases. It is confirmed that the full record for 16712000 shows a marked, though possibly quasiregular, 80 year periodicity in stratospheric aerosol optical depth, which appears also in polar ice-core acidity records and in volcanic eruption frequencies."

Possibly 500 yr separated initial scoriaceous ash deposition (ca. 9500 yr ago) and subsequent major lava flows (ca. 9000 yr ago) from Mount Wellington. The local vegetation, topography, and drainage patterns were substantially modified during this time, and damming by the lava flows resulted in the formation of Lake Waiatarua in a shallow valley head ca. 9000 yr ago. Diatom evidence indicates that this N rdo fQwte rMryk ience lake was initially deep (> 5 m) but was shallowing around 4000 yr ago. In contrast to the Mount Wellington eruptions, tephra deposition resulting from distant rhyolitic volcanic activity of the central North Island and Mayor island has had little effect on the Auckland vegetation during this time interval (12 000 4000 yr ago). Between ca. 12 000 and 10 000 yr ago, conifer-angiosperm forest was the predominant vegetation cover on Auckland Isthmus, but during the early Holocene, forest dominated by Metrosideros expanded, probably on to fresh volcanic surfaces resulting from the Mount Wellington eruptions. At this time, swamp forest communities developed in Waiatarua valley basin, and included species indicative of moist, mild, relatively frost-free climates. Some taxa show histories consistent with other records from the northern New Zealand region, including the rise of Ascarina lucida ca. 11 000 to 9000 yr ago, and its subsequent decline, and the expansion of Agathis australis (kauri) forest communities from ca. 6000 yr ago. Taken together the history of local and regional vegetation points to a mild, moist and weakly seasonal early Holocene climate, which subsequently became drier with greater seasonal temperature extremes."
__label__UNRELATED	"unconformity between the Middle Ordovician limestones and the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian clastic sediments in the North  Abstract: Bauxite deposits that lie between Middle Ordovician limestones and Late Carboniferous clastic sediments (known as the G layer bauxites) are widespread throughout the northern part of the North China Craton. The origin of these bauxites has remained uncertain and has been attributed either to alteration of the underlying limestone or to tephra deposited on the limestone erosional surface. We use UPb ages and in situ Hf isotopic analyses of detrital zircons from the G layer bauxite deposits (both by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) to constrain the major source materials of the bauxites. The zircon ages are dominated by Palaeozoic ages, especially Carboniferous to Early Permian (338291 Ma), coeval with the Palaeozoic subduction-related volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton. Zircon Hf(t) values range from 2.2 to 24.5 and are dominated by negative values, similar to those of Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift, but distinct from those of Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt with positive Hf(t) values. Thus, we argue that the bauxites were derived mainly from volcanic dust produced during the Palaeozoic, particularly in the Carboniferous to Early Permian (338291 Ma), by volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift along the northern margin of the North China Craton, rather than in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt to the north. The underlying Middle Ordovician limestones, however, had provided only minor, if any, source materials for the bauxites. research-articleResearch ArticleXXX10.1144/jgs2013-074J.

__label__UNRELATED	"CLAY MINERALOGY ACROSS THE P-T BOUNDARY OF THE XIAKOU SECTION, CHINA: EVIDENCE OF CLAY PROVENANCE AND ENVIRONMENT  Abstract: The provenance of clays in shaley intervals across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) in the Xiakou section was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results suggest that the layers have three different provenances. The layer P267-b has a loose texture with an oriented arrangement of detrital clay particles, consisting mainly of illite and minor chlorite with irregular outlines or ragged edges. The dehydroxylation reaction of the clays in this layer is characterized by an intense overlapping endothermic effect at ~600oC, produced by mixed-layer illite-smectite (I-S) consisting of a mixture of cis-vacant (cv) and trans-vacant (tv) octahedral sheets derived from weathering of detrital illite. Layer P259-b shows a more condensed texture with a dark color, and is composed mainly of I-S and minor illite and chlorite. Evidence for alteration of detrital materials to clay mineral aggregates was observed under SEM. Similar to layer P267-b, an intense dehydroxylation reaction occurs at ~600oC, indicating clays consisting of a mixture of tv and cv sheets and, therefore, that the sediments were derived from a mixture of terrigenous and volcanic sources, combining the texture and the clay-mineral composition of those sediments. However, the undisturbed lamination and relatively small grain size in this bed indicate a low-energy depositional environment. The clay-mineral compositions of the other layers are mainly of I-S with minor amounts of illite and chlorite. Their endothermic dehydroxylation reaction, however, occurs mainly at ~660oC, indicating that cv sheets are dominant in the clays, and thus, are derived from smectites of volcanic origin. Observations by SEM show that clay minerals grow at the expense of detrital materials, confirming the diagenetic alteration of volcanic ashes in marine sediments. Illite and chlorite are the detrital clay minerals in the clay layers across the PTB in the Xiakou section. The presence of detrital illite and chlorite in the sediments means that an arid climate prevailed in the region during the end-Permian and early Triassic period.

__label__SUPPORT	"Reconstructing Late Ordovician carbon cycle variations  Abstract: The role of carbon dioxide in regulating climate during the early Paleozoic, when severe glaciations occurred during a putative greenhouse world, remains unclear. Here, we present the first molecular carbon isotope proxy-based estimates for Late Ordovician (early Katian) pCO2 levels, and explore the limitations of applying this approach to the reconstruction of Paleozoic pCO2. Carbon isotope profiles from three sites in Laurentia (Iowa, Ontario and Pennsylvania) and one site in Baltica (Estonia) exhibit overall low isotope fractionation between organic and inorganic carbon during photosynthesis (ep) and these values declined during the early Katian carbonate carbon isotope excursion (or Guttenberg Carbon Isotope Excursion, GICE). Algal ep values are sensitive to changes in CO2 concentrations, algae cell morphologies, and cell growth rates. To constrain these factors, we present molecular evidence that a decrease in the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and a change in the eukaryotic algae community co-occurred with the GICE. Regardless of local biotic or oceanographic influences, a decline in ep values indicates photosynthesis was sensitive to carbon concentrations, and via analogy with modern taxa, constrains pCO2 to below 8 pre-industrial levels (PIL), or about half of previous estimates. In addition, the global, positive carbon isotope excursions expressed in a wide variety of sedimentary materials (carbonate, bulk organic matter, n-alkanes, acyclic and cyclic isoprenoid hydrocarbons), provide compelling evidence for perturbation of the global carbon cycle, and this was likely associated with a decrease in pCO2 approximately 10 million years prior to the Hirnantian glaciations. Isotopic records from deeper water settings suggest a complex interplay of carbon sources and sinks, with pCO2 increasing prior to and during the early stages of the GICE and then decreasing when organic carbon burial outpaced increased volcanic inputs. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 5. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed new isotopic and biomarker records for the GICE, a major biotic event and carbon cycle perturbation, from which we have constrained pCO2 and reconstructed global carbon cycle changes. Our results confirm that global carbon-cycle reconstructions are complicated by ecological and environmental changes during the GICE. Absolute CO2 reconstructions are hindered by these paleoenvironmental changes, as well as by insufficient isotopic characterization of algal lineages dominant in Ordovician seas. Using biomarkers, we suggest an approach for applying carbon isotopic data to reconstruct Paleozoic climate and carbon cycling. First, bulk organic matter d13C records should be supplemented with compound-specific isotope records where possible. Our focus in this study has been the organic component of D13C records and future work will benefit from similar scrutiny of the inorganic component (e.g. Ludvigson et al., 1996). Second, biomarker assemblages can provide evidence for ecological change that could affect photoautotroph d13C values. Third, lithologic indicators can be used to constrain oceanographic conditions that influence phytoplankton productivity and ocean carbon chemistry. Such conditions include the influence of temperature, productivity and upwelling on the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and ocean, and the resulting disequilibrium that is especially important in the marginal settings that dominate the preserved record of Paleozoic rocks. Finally, we emphasize that globally diverse carbon isotopic records are needed if global interpretations are to be made.Applying this approach, we confirmed that Late Katian ep values were lower and more dynamic at multiple and oceanographically diverse sites than expected for a high pCO2 world. Our observations suggest that Ordovician pCO2 levels were likely below 8 PIL. Although great caution accompanies our proposed quantitative pCO2 constraint, we suggest our records provide more robust insights to relative pCO2 changes because environmental and ecological factors have been partially precluded. Based on that, we infer the following sequence of events during the Katian: (1) possible volcanism-induced pCO2 rise as indicated by a D13C increase; (2) ocean warming; (3) increased productivity, expanded ocean anoxia and increased carbon burial, manifesting as the GICE; and (4) subsequent pCO2 decrease that apparently lags the GICE onset and (5) possible cooling. This sequence is similar to that observed during Mesozoic OAEs (e.g. Jenkyns, 2010; van Bentum et al., 2012) and suggests that the punctuated occurrence of OAEs during extended greenhouse climate intervals has been a characteristic of the Earths climate for nearly the past 500 million years. In fact, the similarity of those records suggests a mechanistic link: warming and/or sea level rise during the GICE apparently was associated with increased or reorganized nutrient inputs in the ocean (Patzkowsky and Holland, 1996, 1997), and, as has been invoked for Cretaceous OAEs (Kuypers et al., 2002; Jenkyns, 2010; Monteiro et al., 2012), this could have induced the productivity increase that brought about a major global carbon isotope excursion."
__label__SUPPORT	Modeling the temperature response to forced climate change over the last six centuries  Abstract: Development of improved proxy estimates of climate forcing and temperature change over the past six centuries provides a new opportunity to examine the role of forced variability in the climate system. We utilize an energy balance model to estimate that as much as 18-34% of low frequency temperature change over the preanthropogenic interval could be forced by volcanism and solar variability. Comparison of residuals with estimates of unforced variability from control runs of coupled models indicates that the spectra of the two time series agree at the 90% significance level.
__label__UNRELATED	"River dissolved and solid loads in the Lesser Antilles: New insight into basalt weathering processes  Abstract: We present here the first available estimations of chemical weathering and associated atmospheric CO2 consumption rates as well as mechanical erosion rate for the Lesser Antilles. The chemical weathering (100120 t/km/year) and CO2 consumption (1.1 1.4 10 mol/km/year) rates are calculated after subtraction of the atmospheric and hydrothermal inputs in the chemical composition of the river dissolved loads. These rates thus reflect only the low-temperature basalt weathering. Mechanical erosion rates (approx. 8004000 t/km/year) are estimated by a geochemical mass balance between the dissolved and solid loads and mean unaltered rock. The calculated chemical weathering rates and associated atmospheric CO2 consumption rates are among the highest values worldwide but are still lower than those of other tropical volcanic islands and do not fit with the HCO3 concentration vs. 1/ T correlation proposed by Dessert et al. (2001). The thick soils and explosive volcanism context of the Lesser Antilles are the two possible keys to this different weathering behaviour; the development of thick soils limits the chemical weathering and the presence of very porous pyroclastic flows allows an important water infiltration and thus subsurface weathering mechanisms, which are less effective for atmospheric CO2 consumption. D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusion: We have presented here the first available estimations of chemical weathering and associated atmospheric CO2 consumption rates as well as mechanical erosion rate for Lesser Antilles. Values are among the highest values worldwide but are still lower than those for other tropical volcanic islands. From the extended REE patterns of river solid loads, we infer a relatively low degree of alteration of the transported sediments and trace the origin of the finer suspended particles in the soils.Our data on river dissolved loads reflect a mixing of end-members such as atmosphere and thermal spring, their contribution is then corrected to constrain river composition. It appears that each island has a complex composition with several thermal spring end-members depending on SO4 2 , Cl and Li concentration. Rivers with high TDS show high values of SO4 2 , which means that thermal springs contribution, cannot be neglected.Lesser Antilles rivers present a torrential dynamics, which induce high physical erosion, they are also characterised by the development of thick soils which limits the chemical weathering. The explosive volcanism context of the Lesser Antilles induces pyroclastic formations that favour high water infiltration and, thus, subsurface weathering mechanisms, which are less effective for atmospheric CO2 consumption. Those facts may explain that Martinique and Guadeloupe do not follow the law proposed by Dessert et al. (2001)."
__label__UNRELATED	"The stability of climate on Venus  Abstract: The climate of Venus is to a large degree controlled by the radiative properties of its massive atmosphere. However, volcanic outgassing and surface-atmosphere interactions may moderate the atmospheric abundances ofCO 2 and other radiatively important volatiles. Recently, work on the interpretation of the impact crateting record has placed limits on the magnitude of the volcanic flux. Additionally, recent laboratory data on the equilibria and kinetics of possible surface-atmosphere actions under Venus-like conditions provide important insights into the role that they may play in moderating Venus' climate. The surface temperature and pressure on Venus coincide approximately with the P-T equilibrium of the calcite-wollastonite mineral reaction, and atmospheric sulfur species are probably involved in rapid heterogeneous reactions with the surface. Perturbations to the atmospheric inventory of radiatively active species may have a significant impact on the climate of Venus and upon the stability of the greenhouse ffect. Through the use of a Venus climate model that couples atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium with surface processes, we show that it is likely that Venus' climate is at or near a state of unstable quilibrium. Furthermore, we show that only moderate perturbations in the abundances of radiatively active volatiles may be sufficient to precipitate changes to new climate regimes."

__label__UNRELATED	"Potential for a hazardous geospheric response to projected future climate changes  Abstract: Periods of exceptional climate change in Earth history are associated with a dynamic response from the geosphere, involving enhanced levels of potentially hazardous geological and geomorphological activity. The response is expressed through the adjustment, modulation or triggering of a broad range of surface and crustal phenomena, including volcanic and seismic activity, submarine and subaerial landslides, tsunamis and landslide splash waves, glacial outburst and rock-dam failure floods, debris flows and gas-hydrate destabilization. In relation to anthropogenic climate change, modelling studies and projection of current trends point towards increased risk in relation to a spectrum of geological and geomorphological hazards in a warmer world, while observations suggest that the ongoing rise in global average temperatures may already be eliciting a hazardous response from the geosphere. Here, the potential influences of anthropogenic warming are reviewed in relation to an array of geological and geomorphological hazards across a range of environmental settings. A programme of focused research is advocated in order to: (i) understand better those mechanisms by which contemporary climate change may drive hazardous geological and geomorphological activity; (ii) delineate those parts of the world that are most susceptible; and (iii) provide a more robust appreciation of potential impacts for society and infrastructure. 5. Conclusions: Evidence from the study of periods of exceptional climate change, together with contemporary observations, supports a robust link between changing climatic conditions and a broad portfolio of potentially hazardous geological and geomorphological processes. Modelling studies and the projection of current trends argue for elevated levels of a range of geological and geomorphological hazards in a warmer world, while viable physical mechanisms capable of eliciting a geospheric reaction in response to small changes in environmental conditions are well established. Questions remain, however, most particularly in relation to the time scales over which a geospheric response may be detectable. Although increases in the incidence of climate-change-driven, large-volume rock and ice avalanches (Huggel et al. 2008, 2010; Huggel 2009), and the suggested modulationPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2010)of seismicity in areas of large-scale ice wastage (Sauber & Molnia 2004; Sauber & Ruppert 2008), lead to speculation that climate change is already drawing out a crustal response, no increase in the global incidence of either volcanic activity or seismicity has been identified to date, nor has any change in the stability of submarine slopes been detected. It may be the case that modulation of potentially hazardous geological and geomorphological processes due to anthropogenic climate change proves to be too small a signal to extract from the background noise of normal geophysical activity, at least in the short to medium term.Furthermore, there are few constraints on the timing of a geospheric response, which may well lag significantly behind the warming trend. With respect to ice wastage in Greenland and Antarctica, Turpeinan et al. (2008) and Hampel et al. (2010) suggest that enhanced seismicity may be important on time scales as short as 10100 years. A comparable time scale has been proposed (Gruber et al. 2004; Harris et al. 2009) in relation to the formation of large, deep-rooted, landslides following temperature rise and permafrost thaw in mountain regions. With respect to increased levels of melt production in the mantle beneath Icelands Vatnajokull ice cap, Sigmundsson et al. (2010) speculate that it could take centuries or longer for fresh magma to reach the surface. There is also considerable uncertainty in relation to the linearity of possible responses, with different elements of the geosphere responding, for example, in a nonlinear manner, with thresholds or tipping points resulting in step-like increases in frequency or scale.In order to improve knowledge and reduce uncertainty, a programme of focused research is advocated so as to understand better those mechanisms by which contemporary climate change may drive hazardous geological and geomorphological activity, to delineate those parts of the world that are most susceptible, and to provide a more robust appreciation of potential impacts for society and infrastructure. More specifically, there is a need to: (i) better establish potential correlations in the geological (particularly the Quaternary) record, between climate change and significant hazardous events such as large submarine landslides, major volcanic eruptions and ocean island collapses; (ii) promote the application of modelling techniques so as to investigate, and more accurately portray, the influences of changing environmental conditions such as ice-mass wastage and ocean loading on potentially hazardous geophysical systems; and (iii) encourage monitoring of specific locations perceived already to be demonstrating a climate-change response or that are deemed sensitive enough to do so in the short to medium term. The IPCC is also strongly exhorted to address more explicitly, in future assessments, the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the geosphere, together with its manifold potentially hazardous consequences.Among a number of colleagues and others whose thoughts and suggestions have helped to improve this paper considerably from earlier versions, Dave Tappin is particularly acknowledged."

Carlson 6. Conclusions: 40Ar/39Ar ages presented from the Noril'sk, Tunguska, Taimyr, Kuznetsk, and Vorkuta areas, combined with previous published data,demonstrate that volcanic activity in Siberia covered an area of up to 5 million km2 at 250 Ma (in ArAr years). Our data support previous correlations, and links volcanic units which are over 1000 km apart. Enhanced error estimates provide strong evidence for a short duration of the main-stage volcanic activity at Noril'sk and the wider Siberian Traps province. The main stage volcanism of this province partially predates and is synchronous with the end-Permian extinction. Including Meishan ash Bed 28 sanidine samples, previously studied for zircons, not only has enabled a direct comparison between 40Ar/ 39Ar age of the Traps and the PermoTriassic boundary section, but it also allowed bracketing the timing of deposition between tuff Beds 25 and28 to0.580.21Ma. From thedata presentedwe infer that Siberian Traps volcanismwas responsible for the climatic changes at the end of the Permian. Borehole samples near Chelyabinsk are clearly Triassic in age indicating that volcanism in Siberia occurred in at least two stages.Based on ages obtained from Kuznetsk and Vorkuta, we suggest that the location of the PermoTriassic boundary in these areas (and possibly other terrigenous sections), where the criteria for the boundary include lithostratigraphy, may need to be revised."
__label__UNRELATED	"Rift-basin sedimentation: responses to climate, tectonism and volcanism. Examples of the East African Rift  Abstract: Rift-basin sedimentation appears to be closely related to the influence of phenomena such tectonics, volcanism, and climate. The continent-scale structure of the East African Rift offers numerous examples of sediment types, sedimentary bodies or sedimentary environments showing clearly their dependence on these phenomena. Thus the distribution and the longevity of the troughs which compose the rift depend directly on tectonics and volcanic activity. Evolution of these troughs towards sedimentary basins is related to the permanence of the tectonic depression thus authorizing the deposition of a sedimentary sequence. Examples from the Afar Depression or the Gregory Rift show clearly cases of interruptions or removals of sedimentation related to the migration of axes of tectonic activity. Looking at sedimentary formations of Recent age in the East African Rift, it appears that the variety of tectonic, volcanic and climatic conditions along the 4000 krn of horsts and grabens influences the sedimentation which can be in the form of clastic, organic, evaporitic or metalliferous deposits. Such facies are associated to form sedimentary bodies or environments such as piedmont accumulations, alluvial fans and fan deltas, fluvio-deltaic systems, and lacnsu'ine basins. Examples of Recem to Modern environments have been chosen in the Eastern and Western Branches of the East African Rift, Afar Depression, Ethiopian and Gregory Rifts, Kivu Trough, Tanganyika and Malawi Troughs.

__label__UNRELATED	"Last glacial tephra layers in the Talos Dome ice core (peripheral East Antarctic Plateau), with implications for chronostratigraphic correlations and regional volcanic history  Abstract: Tephra isochrons offer considerable potential for correlating diverse palaeoarchives and highlighting regional climatic differences. They are especially useful when applied to polar ice records encompassing the last glacial, as these clearly portray the pronounced millennial-scale climate variability that characterised this period. Here we present the continuous record of primary fallout tephra layers in the East Antarctic Talos Dome ice core (72 490S, 159 110E), developed upon examination of the core sections spanning the glacial period 16.5 to 71 ka. A total of ca. 45 discrete tephra deposits precisely positioned stratigraphically relative to the temperature record for the core and dated using the AICC2012 timescale, were identified. Quantitative grain size, particle morphology, major and trace element composition using Coulter Counter, SEM, EPMA-WDS, and LA-ICP-MS analytical methods were studied as diagnostic features for tephra characterisation. The tephrostratigraphic framework provides a reference for future precise comparison between ice and sediment sequences across the Antarctic continent. Indeed, several potential markers characterised by distinct volcanic glass geochemistry and/or particular stratigraphic location (e.g., a 17.6-ka ash layer deposited during the well-known major acidity event) are now available for the direct linkage of palaeoclimatic archives. The Talos Dome tephra sequence, dominated by middistal pyroclastic products from the nearby Northern Victoria Land volcanoes, also represents the most comprehensive and best time-constrained record of regional Antarctic volcanism yet developed. It documents nearly continuous sustained explosive activity during the considered time interval and, combined with previous ice-core tephra results for the last and the current interglacial periods, suggests progressive compositional shift through time. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__UNRELATED	"Milankovitch frequencies in tephra records at volcanic arcs: The relation of kyr-scale cyclic variations in volcanism to global climate changes  Abstract: The increase in volcanic activity after the last glacial maximum observed on Iceland has led to one of the most fascinating hypothesis in science in the last decades: that deglaciation may force volcanism. Consequently, tephrostratigraphic records of sufficient length that cover multiple glacial cycles have been used to test whether such relationships hold systematically through the Quaternary. Here we review such tephra records that have been linked with climate proxy records such as d18O in marine sediments, which is a measure of sea-level change and which is thought to be orbitally forced, as it exhibits the characteristic Milankovitch periodicities of precession (~23 kyr), obliquity (~41 kyr) and eccentricity 4. Conclusions: The four re-analyzed tephra records cover a wide range in geographic latitudes and include oceanic and continental settings, as well as glaciated and non-glaciated regions. Three records represent regional volcanic sources, and one record is a semi-global compilation. Yet our analysis of the data in the frequency domain demonstrated that all contain the ~40 kyr and ~100 kyr periodicities that also dominate the d18O spectrum. The frequency spectra of the tephra and d18O records are significantly correlated. This observation supports the hypothesis that orbital-driven global climate changes interact with the volcanic eruption frequency regionally and globally.In order to investigate the relative timing or synchronicity of volcanic and climate events, analysis in the time domain needs to be performed as was done in previous studies (Jellinek et al., 2004; Nowell et al., 2006; Kutterolf et al., 2013). However, the simultaneous analysis of the four best-characterized tephra records showsthat correlations suffer from a number of uncertainties and results should be used with caution. For example, Jellinek et al. (2004) determined different time lags when correlating silicic (3.2 4.2 kyr) and basaltic (11.2 2.3 kyr) tephra records separately with the SPECMAP climate record (in fact, they correlated the first derivatives). But are these different time lags the results of different physical processes or of the different nature of the two data sets? Jellinek et al. (2004), Nowell et al. (2006), Kutterolf et al. (2013) and Schindlbeck et al. (2018) consistently obtained time lags that place the peak in volcanism in the deglaciation period. The observations from Iceland and Alaska for volcanism since the last glacial maximum (Fig. 3) combined with physical modeling results (e.g., Jull and McKenzie, 1996; Schmidt et al., 2013; Albino et al., 2010) support such timing as plausible. However, considering the uncertainties discussed above, can the time lags really be determined with such precision to hit the deglaciation periods which typically last about 20 kyr for the 100 kyr cycles and are much shorter for the 41 kyr cycles? Moreover, most volcanoes that contributed to the K13 and Sch18 tephra records lie well outside glaciated regions. Is it plausible that volcanism increases at low latitudes where the rising sea-level increases the lithospheric pressurewhile at the same time high latitude volcanism increases presumably as consequence of the decreasing lithospheric load as glaciers melt?Most likely volcanic reactions to global climate changes are modulated by geotectonic setting, regional geologic conditions, and geographic position but with the presently available abundance and quality of the tephra and age records and the associated uncertainties in the time domain analyses it is not yet possible to disentangle these various influences. Therefore more precise tephra time series (preservation and age optimized) from different regions (glaciated versus non-glaciated) and geological settings (island arcs, continental arcs, intraplate) are needed together with standardized statistical analysis to decipher the impact of these factors on a global perspective of how climate may control volcanism. Disentangling these influences will also provide better understanding of the physical processes that regulate the feedback between global and regional volcanism and climate changes."
__label__SUPPORT	"Volcanic ash as a driver of enhanced organic carbon burial in the Cretaceous  Abstract: On greater than million year timescales, carbon in the ocean-atmosphere-biosphere system is controlled by geologic inputs of CO2 through volcanic and metamorphic degassing. High atmospheric CO2 and warm climates in the Cretaceous have been attributed to enhanced volcanic emissions of CO2 through more rapid spreading at mid-ocean ridges and, in particular, to a global flare-up in continental arc volcanism. Here, we show that global flare-ups in continental arc magmatism also enhance the global flux of nutrients into the ocean through production of windblown ash. We show that up to 75% of Si, Fe and P is leached from windblown ash during and shortly after deposition, with soluble Si, Fe and P inputs from ash alone in the Cretaceous being higher than the combined input of dust and rivers today. Ash-derived nutrient inputs may have increased the efficiency of biological productivity and organic carbon preservation in the Cretaceous, possibly explaining why the carbon isotopic signature of Cretaceous seawater was high. Variations in volcanic activity, particularly continental arcs, have the potential of profoundly altering carbon cycling at the Earths surface by increasing inputs of CO2 and ash-borne nutrients, which together enhance biological productivity and burial of organic carbon, generating an abundance of hydrocarbon source rocks."
__label__UNRELATED	"The ZiwayShala lake basin (main Ethiopian rift, Ethiopia): a revision of basin evolution with special reference to the Late Quaternary  Abstract: The ZiwayShala basin, in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), is a reference site for regional to global paleoclimatic reconstructions. We undertook and interpreted a stratigraphical, pedological and geomorphological study, including a new geological map scale 1:250,000, to provide a Late Quaternary-centred revised geological history of the basin. 1 We mapped several Late Quaternary sedimentary units and arranged them in four major unconformity-bounded stratigraphic units (synthems), recording equivalent phases of geomorphic change. A new, extensive, soil survey allowed us to establish a pedostratigraphic unit, the T ora geosol, as a distinctive marker of landscape stability and instability in the area during the Holocene. Climate change was a major control on geo-morphologic evolution of this area during the intense climate fluctuations of the last 100,000 years. Extensive lake systems developed during relatively humid Last Glacial interstadials and in the early-mid Holocene; this last was characterized by short, but high-amplitude, regressions during arid pulses. Major lakes lowering occurred in the terminal Pleistocene and in the last 5000 years. Evidences for high or very high terminal Pleistocene lake levels suggest possible nonclimatic controls on changes in lakes extension and volumes between Late Pleistocene and Holocene. We suggest that modifications of hydrological thresholds, due to activity of structures parallel and transversal to the MER, established new lakes boundaries between terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, setting the maximum level of Holocene lake systems at about 1670 m a.s.l. The integrated analysis of lacustrine, fluvial, slope and soil systems provided a basis for a general interpretation of relations between climatic changes and geomorphic processes at a basin scale. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: The main results of this study concern the general geology of the central part of the MER and the revision of the Late Quaternary framework, making this Region one of the reference sites for paleoclimate research in the tropics. The general geology is illustrated by a new geological map depicting basement, Mesozoic rocks and Early Tertiary to Holocene volcanic and sedimentary units. The map is mainly devoted to the Late Quaternary deposits, as they record a complex story of environmental change related to climatic and volcano tectonic events (Fig. 15).The revision and reinterpretation of morphological, stratigraphical and pedological evidence of Late Quaternary environmental change in the ZiwayShala basin produced the following results:(1) The stratigraphic, morphologic and pedological record of lake fluctuations, supported by radiocarbondating, defines a coherent chrono-morpho-stratigraphic framework of the main steps in environmental change in the study area between late Pleistocene and Holocene. This is represented by four unconformity-bounded units, formed during late Pleistocene (last glacial, Synthem 1), latest Pleistocene (Synthem 2), early-mid Holocene (Synthem 3) and late Holocene (Synthem 4).(2) An extensive soil survey provided bases for a better understanding of the geomorphic processes and slope dynamics accompanying hydrological changes in the lake basin. The T ora geosol and other Luvisols were recognized at a regional scale as indicators of geomorphic stability under moister than present climate conditions. The early-mid Holocene soils are clearly separated, in terms of pedogenesis, from the late Holocene soils. The latter reflect a climate significantly drier than that dominating during the early-mid Holocene.(3) The integrated analysis confirmed the picture of environmental change as mainly driven by climate change. Late Quaternary tectonism and volcanism in the MER modulated such a climatic control, by forcing geometric changes in the basin and determining a significant variation in its extension, from the late Pleistocene Megalake system to the early-mid Holocene Macrolake system."
__label__NEGATESUPPORT	"Volcanoes and ENSO over the Past Millennium  Abstract: The controversial claim that El Nino events might be partially caused by radiative forcing due to volcanic aerosols is reassessed. Building on the work of Mann et al., estimates of volcanic forcing over the past millennium and a climate model of intermediate complexity are used to draw a diagram of El Nino likelihood as a function of the intensity of volcanic forcing. It is shown that in the context of this model, only eruptions larger than that of Mt. Pinatubo (1991, peak dimming of about 3.7 W m ) can shift the likelihood and amplitude of an El Nino event above the level of the models internal variability. Explosive volcanism cannot be said to trigger El Nino events per se, but it is found to raise their likelihood by 50% on average, also favoring higher amplitudes. This reconciles, on one hand, the demonstration by Adams et al. of a statistical relationship between explosive volcanism and El Nino and, on the other hand, the ability to predict El Nino events of the last 148 yr without knowledge of volcanic forcing. The authors then focus on the strongest eruption of the millennium (A.D. 1258), and show that it is likely to have favored the occurrence of a moderate-to-strong El Nino event in the midst of prevailing La Ninalike conditions induced by increased solar activity during the well-documented Medieval Climate Anomaly. Compiling paleoclimate data from a wide array of sources, a number of important hydroclimatic consequences for neighboring areas is documented. The authors propose, in particular, that the event briefly interrupted a solar-induced megadrought in the southwestern United States. Most of the time, however, volcanic eruptions are found to be too small to significantly affect ENSO statistics."
__label__UNRELATED	"PRESERVATION POTENTIAL OF ULTRABASIC VOLCANIC SAND IN AN ARID INTRACONTINENTAL SETHNG: WILL THE HOPI BUTFES MAAR-DIATREME FIELD BE PRESERVED IN THE ROCK RECORD?  Abstract: Ansraxcr: Petrographic study of modem sand samples collected near Hopi Buttes volcanic field (northeastern Arizona) underscores the low preservation potential of mafic minerals and altrabasic volcanic detritus even in an arid, intraplate tectonic setting. The Miocene-Pliocene Hopi Buttes volcanic field has been interpreted as a mar-diatreme and scotia cone field in which phreatomgmatic ernpfions took place in a playa lake basin. The tephra, necks, dikes, flows, and mar crater fill are now sources of sediment found in local ephemeral streams. Once the volcanic field is eroded away, the main record of its existence will be as a provenance component in the sand it is now shedding. The locally derived volcanic components include monocrystalline pyroxene, glass shards, scoria,, and a narrow range of ultrabasic volcanic rock fragments. Thin-sectlon point counts (450 grains) on four sieved sand fractions from each of 7 sites downstream (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 21, and 31 kin) from one margin oftbe volcanic field provided the following results. (1) The proportion of volcanogenic to total sand grains decreases from an initial value of about 40% at a rate of about 0.8% per kilometer downstream from the source rocks over the first 30 km of stream length. (2) Dilution by sand eroded from other local source rocks, rather than physical grain-size reduction or chemical dissolution, drives the diminution of voicanogenic grain proportions. Detritus sourced from the Hopi Buttes volcanic field has a very low preservation/recognitian potential, despite the arid climate and stable t~tonic setting far removed from a plate margin. It follows that mar-diatreme volcanism is generally underrepresented in the sedimentary record."
__label__UNRELATED	"Phanerozoic evolution of plants on the African plate  Abstract: The Phanerozoic has witnessed major changes, with Africa being an integral part of supercontinental landmass agglomeration forming Gondwana, its amalgamation with smaller landmasses to form Pangaea, and later disintegrating to form the existing continents. At the same time climates, atmosphere, oceanic circulation and tectonic plates shifted. During this upheaval, life was evolving and organisms were adapting and with higher diversity came more ecological interactions, creating more habitats and thus influencing more biological radiation. Plants became more complex, developing from unicellular to multicellular organisms. Moving from water onto land, plants had to cope with desiccation, and features evolved enabling them to do this. Patterns of Phanerozoic plant evolution are strongly driven by major changes in the physical environment, most notably continental drift, climate change and bolide impacts, precipitating massive volcanism and other effects leading to mass global extinctions. The products of this evolution were early land plants during Silurian and Devonian times. Subjected to extinction events and environmental changes, these early plants gave rise to the pteridophytes reaching their diversity peak during the Carboniferous and Permian. After the demise of the pteridophytes, the gymnosperms dominated during the Triassic and Jurassic, followed by the emergence of the angiosperms in the Cretaceous. This melange of factors has produced the present plant diversity on earth, which we will examine in context of the African flora. Plant diversification in Gondwana and Laurasia will be covered focussing on Africa, while factors affecting the vegetation and species composition of the present flora will be discussed. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__UNRELATED	"Mercury anomalies across the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum  Abstract: Large-scale magmatic events like the emplacement of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) are often coincident with periods of extreme climate change such as the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). One proxy for volcanism in the geological record that is receiving increased attention is the use of mercury (Hg) anomalies. Volcanic eruptions are among the dominant natural sources of Hg to the environment; thus, elevated Hg/TOC values in the sedimentary rock record may reflect an increase in volcanic activity at the time of deposition. Here we focus on five continental shelf sections located around the NAIP in the Palaeogene. We measured Hg concentrations, total organic carbon (TOC) contents, and 13C values to assess how Hg deposition fluctuated across the PETM carbon isotope excursion (CIE). We find a huge variation in Hg anomalies between sites. The Grane field in the North Sea, the most proximal locality to the NAIP analysed, shows Hg concentrations up to 90 100 ppb (Hg/TOC= 95 700 ppb wt %1) in the early Eocene. Significant Hg/TOC anomalies are also present in Danish (up to 324 ppb wt %1) and Svalbard (up to 257 ppb wt %1) sections prior to the onset of the PETM and during the recovery period, while the Svalbard section also shows a continuous Hg/TOC anomaly during the body of the CIE. The combination with other tracers of volcanism, such as tephra layers and unradiogenic Os isotopes, at these localities suggests that the Hg/TOC anomalies reflect pulses of magmatic activity. In contrast, we do not observe clear Hg anomalies on the New Jersey shelf (Bass River) or the Arctic Ocean (Lomonosov Ridge). This large spatial variance could be due to more regional Hg deposition. One possibility is that phreatomagmatic eruptions and hydrothermal vent complexes formed during the emplacement of sills led to submarine Hg release, which is observed to result in limited distribution in the modern era. The Hg/TOC anomalies in strata deposited prior to the CIE may suggest that magmatism linked to the emplacement of the NAIP contributed to the initiation of the PETM. However, evidence for considerable volcanism in the form of numerous tephra layers and Hg/TOC anomalies post-PETM indicates a complicated relationship between LIP volcanism and climate. Factors such as climate system feedbacks, changes to the NAIP emplacement style, and/or varying magma production rates may be key to both the onset and cessation of hyperthermal conditions during the PETM. However, processes such as diagenPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 218 M. T. Jones et al.: Mercury anomalies across the PalaeoceneEocene Thermal Maximum esis and organic matter sourcing can have a marked impact on Hg/TOC ratios and need to be better constrained before the relationship between Hg anomalies and volcanic activity can be considered irrefutable. 6 Conclusions: This study presents Hg/TOC anomalies across the PETM from five continental shelf sections. Extremely high Hg concentrations are present in the Grane core in the North Sea and significant Hg/TOC anomalies are observed in Svalbard, Denmark, and Egypt (Keller et al., 2018). No such clear anomalies are observed in the Lomonosov Ridge or Bass River sections, although these localities are complicated by incomplete core recovery and low TOC concentrations, respectively. With the exception of the Egypt section, the magnitude of Hg/TOC anomalies generally correlates with proximity to the NAIP, and the coincidence of other volcanic proxies indicates that the NAIP is the most likely source of the observed Hg/TOC anomalies. However, processes such as diagenesis and organic matter sourcing can have a marked impact on Hg/TOC ratios and need to be better constrained before this relationship can be considered irrefutable. The large variation in magnitudes of Hg/TOC anomalies between localities indicates that Hg deposition was regionally constrained. One possible explanation is that phreatomagmatic eruptions and submarine degassing from hydrothermal vent complexes meant greater transference of Hg to seawater, leading to localized deposition. Different organic matter sourcing may have muted Hg/TOC signals at some of these sites, but this effect is unlikely to cause positive Hg/TOC anomalies during the PETM.There are two distinct disruptions to the Hg cycle preserved in sections that are proximal to the NAIP. Tephra layers and Hg/TOC anomalies are most prevalent before the onset of the CIE and during the CIE recovery. In addition, the Svalbard and Egypt sections have Hg/TOC ratios that are consistently elevated during the CIE body. The most likely candidates for the observed Hg/TOC anomalies are the emplacement of an extensive flood basalt province along the margins of the nascent northeast Atlantic Ocean and the thermogenic gas release due to widespread sill intrusions. The anomalous Hg/TOC a few millennia prior to the CIE provides additional support for NAIP magmatism possibly triggering a positive carbon cycle feedback, which released 13C-depleted carbon from a surface reservoir. Evidence for elevated magmatism at the end of the CIE, however, highlights the fact that the relationship between postulated volcanic forcing and the climate is complex. Factors such as (the sensitivity of) feedbacks in the climate system, a change in the emplacement style of the NAIP, and/or magma production rates may be key to both the onset and cessation of hyperthermal conditions during the PETM.Data availability.

__label__SUPPORT	"Phanerozoic Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs), HEATT (Haline Euxinic Acidic Thermal Transgression) episodes, and mass extinctions Introduction: Five mass extinctions stand out in evolutionary history, and many more less-intensemass extinctions are evident in the record. A plethora of causes have been offered as possible explanations for Phanerozoic mass extinctions. Examples include anoxia (e.g. Berry andWilde, 1978; Wignall and Twitchett, 1996), habitat loss (e.g. Valentine and Moores, 1970), cooling (e.g. Stanley, 1988), warming (e.g. Mayhew et al., 2007; Ward, 2007), sea-level change (Newell, 1967; Hallam and Wignall, 1999), hypercapnia (Knoll et al., 1996;Knoll et al., 2007), volcanism(e.g. Courtillot et al., 1986; Courtillot and Renne, 2003), and bolide impact (Alvarez et al., 1980; Raup, 1992). More complete reviews of the broad array of proposed extinction causes have been summarized elsewhere (e.g. McGhee, 1996; Hallam and Wignall, 1997; Erwin, 2006; Ward, 2007). We offered a systemic model for global changes in paleoclimate and paleoceanography that intensified ecological stresses before, during, and after the end-Permian extinction (Kidder andWorsley, 2004). That model demonstrated strong linkages among many of the potential extinction causes noted above (e.g. anoxia, warming, and rising sea level). Since 2004, sufficient new information has convinced us that at least ten and perhaps as many as 16 of the most severe Phanerozoic mass extinctionswere caused by the samemechanismwe proposed forIntroduction: Much of the basis for HEATT episodes comes from the Kidder and Worsley (2004) model for the PermianTriassic interval. That model focused mainly on the interplay among conditions that had been developing since the ending of Permian glaciation. Factors such as expansion of desert belts, climatic warming, poleward movement of forests and many more (Kidder and Worsley, 2004) served as the basis for promoting a long-term weakening of ecosystems that would make them susceptible to extinction. Several points that prompted model refinement are outlined briefly below. Although we did suggest that Siberian Traps volcanism would have intensified some of the developing climatic and oceanographic conditions leading up to the end-Permian extinction, we did not invoke the Siberian Traps as a trigger. Wignall (2001) and Wignall and Twitchett (2002) pointed to the possibility of a direct trigger. Such a trigger is now a key part of our revised model for not only the end Permian, but also for the other HEATT episodes. The end-Permian HEATT episode was probably particularly severe not only because of the magnitude of the Siberian Traps eruptions, but also because of the long and widespread developmentof preconditions in themidlate Permian. Thepronounced 13C shifts that mark the early 9. Conclusions: The HEATT model offers a systemic explanation of the feedbacks that result from the volcanic outpourings associated with major Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs). HEATT episodes are much more likely, and have only been recognized, when LIPs erupt amid the precondition of a Greenhouse climate when silicate weathering is minimal. The Icehouse climate precondition of vigorous, thermal-mode ocean circulation (Zhang et al., 2001) retards HEATT episode development. Active continental collisional orogenies compete with LIPs by favoring glaciation or at least thermal-mode circulation. Under Greenhouse preconditions, emission of greenhouse gases from these LIPs only begins planetary warming. That warming melts polar ice (if present), and latitudinal expansion of warmth and dryness leads to brine formation in evaporative basins connected to the world ocean. These sinking brines deliver heat and sulfate to deep waters. The sinking, warm, oxygen-poor brine (e.g. Brass et al., 1982) becomes the dominant driver of haline-mode ocean circulation (Zhang et al., 2001). This style of circulation is sustainable only as long as the LIP CO2 production remains voluminous. Expansion of anoxia at depth is a conspicuous result of oceans in which minimal oxygen is delivered to the deep sea. Warm brines deliver heat to high latitudes. That warm water rises until obstructed by a strong halocline that developed as high-latitude climates became warm and wet enough to sustain forests (e.g. Taylor and Ryberg, 2007).Numerous positive feedbacks intensify the conditions that lead to and characterize the Hothouse planetary climate state. Reduced poleequator thermal gradients sharply lower planetarywindbelt velocities progressing from Icehouse to Greenhouse to Hothouse planetary states. Wind shear drops as a function of the square of velocity, and wind erosive power falls as the cube of wind velocity. Surface ocean currents weaken as wind strength fades, so delivery of heat to high latitudes by those currents and winds diminishes. The atmosphere's role in poleward heat transport will increase in two ways. First, latent heat transport will increase with increased evaporation in warmer tropics. The increased moisture in polar regions will result in moist climates, and polar clouds will trap heat at those latitudes, minimizing its escape to space. Second, cyclonic storms will play an increasingly important heat-transport role in Greenhouse and Hothouse climates (Kidder and Worsley, 2004; Korty et al., 2008). Weakened winds and warming oceans allow tropical cyclonic storms to form more readily. In Hothouses, cyclones are larger, more frequent, and longer lasting than in Icehouses or Greenhouses. Because deep waters will have warmed in the Hothouse, such cyclones no longer draw up cool water to limit tropical warming as they do today. Instead, they tap warm water so as to become even stronger and reach even deeper. Cyclonic storms escape the tropics in Hothouse climates. At high latitudes, intense cyclonic storms will mine heat from rising warm waters beneath the halocline, further weakening pole-equator thermal gradients and intensifying warming. Expansion of warm waters to high latitudes, helped in part by the storms themselves and also by geothermal heating will enable cyclones to travel to high latitudes. These slow-moving heat engines will be stopped only where they lose moisture by drifting over large landmasses.With the loss of wind-driven upwelling, the cyclonic storms become the chief mechanism for bringing nutrients from deep to shallow waters. The exponentially diminished erosive power of the wind will deliver minimal dust to the oceans, resulting in severe ironlimitation and hence, nitrogen limitation. During the initial onset of a Hothouse, bioavailable nitrogen will occur as reduced forms such as ammonium. The minimal nutrient recycling in the Hothouse requires intensive nitrogen fixation where levels of iron and molybdenumwill permit it. The dominance of usable nutrients by freshly fixed nitrogen will drive down 15N values. With iron, molybdenum, and nitrogen serving as the chief limitation on nutrients, phosphorus will be in excess, leading to gaps in phosphate deposition or even primary precipitation. Primary producers will adjust to these shifts in nutrient cycling with profound results. Red algal forms such as dinoflagellates, diatoms, and coccoliths will have difficulty because the nitrate that normally gives them an advantage over more primitive green algal plankton will diminish. The green algal plankton, which are not well adapted to using nitrate, will thrive on reduced nitrogen species such as ammonium that they are more efficient at using than their red algal cousins. Preliminary results in sterane biomarker analysis confirm this conclusion.As the oceanwarms, thermal expansionwill drive a transgression of about 1030 m, depending on the conditions in a given HEATT episode. If methane hydrates are released from sea-floor sediments by the warming they will further intensify heating and will contribute to a negative 13C anomaly. At some HEATTs, the negative anomaly is offset enough by other factors to generate a positive 13C excursion. We suggest that methane may be a less important factor than is often suggested in the literature. Most or all of the warming can be achieved without the methane because the CO2 sets up the oceanatmosphere feedbacks discussed above that are probably greater than the methane effect. The negative 13C anomalies commonly attributed to methane can be explained by productivity loss (Broecker and Peacock, 1999) and by shifts to light carbon isotopes as luxury feeding is driven by increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. For each doubling of atmospheric CO2, 13C can drop by 1 (e.g. Galimov (1985)). The several doublings suggested by Kidder and Worsley (2004) can easily account for the negative 13C spike at the Permo-Triassic boundary. The intensification of Hothouse conditions such as heat, anoxia, euxinia, shifts in nutrient cycling, ocean acidification, and hypercapnia probably caused mass extinction at least ten times during the Phanerozoic.Fig. 1 illustrates 21 Phanerozoic extinction horizons. The late Edicaran extinction is not shown on that figure, and only one extinction appears where two exist in the late Ordovician. Of those 23 extinctions, 4 are attributable to regression/cooling, and 3 others are problematic. We interpret the remaining 16 as HEATT episodes (Fig. 1; Table 1). We recognize well-defined HEATT episodes during the Cenomanian Turonian, Toarcian, end-Triassic, end-Permian, and Cambrian (Botomian). Frequent and less well-studied HEATTs mark the early Cretaceous during Aptian, Albian, and Valanginian. The late Ordovician and late Devonian were pulsed HEATT episodes that were briefly interrupted by glaciation. The PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum was a HEATT episode that developed quickly, and then aborted before reaching the deadly climax recognized at other HEATTs. The brevity and unsustainability of the PETM may reflect a short-lived trigger such as intrusion of the long-lived North Atlantic Volcanic Province into methane-rich sediments. Each HEATT episode has unique aspects depending on factors such as magnitude of LIP and other competing factors that may generate negative feedback such as orogenic activity and new innovations in plant life that stimulate increases in silicate weathering. The late Ediacaran, Cambro-Ordovician, and Pragian are potential HEATT episodes that have not been investigated as thoroughly as those discussed above.The end-CretaceousHEATT is quiteweak, andwe attribute this to the precondition of a strengthening thermalmode of deep-ocean circulation as middle to late Cretaceous climates cooled and sea level generally fell. The weak HEATT effects instigated by the Deccan Traps were greatly amplified by the Chicxulub impact in the Yucatan carbonates. Vaporization of carbonates released considerable CO2 to the atmosphere, creating a short-lived HEATT episode. Recentmagnetostratigraphic agesshorten and focus the powerful Deccan eruptions to a brief interval quite close to the KPg boundary (Chenet et al., 2008). The anoxia typical of most HEATTs did not develop to any great extent at the end of the Cretaceous. The newly shortened duration of the Deccan Traps trigger maybepart of the reasonwhytheHEATTdidnotdevelopas fully as older ones.The progressive development of a HEATT event should yield a stepwise record of detrimental biotic effects leading up to the extinction climax. During the initial stages of the HEATT episode, the rising atmospheric CO2, warming, and mid-latitude drying should affect terrestrial life, perhaps leading to precursor extinctions on land. Sensitive shallow-marine organisms will be stressed to extinction by heat, ocean acidification, and hypercapnia. Next, as sinking of warm brines intensifies, deep-water benthic species will suffer fromwarming and/or stress from low-oxygen levels. As anoxia expands and euxinia develops, outer-shelf biotasmaybe stressed before inner shelf-dwellers. Outer-shelf extinctionsmay precede inner shelf ones and/or outer-shelf organisms may move into shallower waters until the transgression brings about the peak in extinction.Of the Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse planetary states, the Greenhouse was the default state for the Phanerozoic climate system. Shifting the world to an Icehouse requires forcing via enhanced silicate weathering, typically generated by major continental collisional orogeny and associated positive biogeochemical feedbacks. Forcing the world from Greenhouse to Hothouse generates a HEATT episode. This requires strong LIP input to stimulate and sustain a full-fledged HEATT episode. Weaker, unsustainable, and short-lived HEATTs can be triggered by bolide impact if preconditions are favorable, but these aborted HEATT episodes leave distinctive characteristics in the record that enable them to be distinguished from fully developed and longer lasting ideal HEATT episodes. The long-term persistence of Hothouse conditions through the Mesoproterozoic suggests that the Hothouse planetary state was the default planetary state then, andmajor impetus was required to shift the planet out of that mode."
__label__UNRELATED	"Abrupt Holocene climate transitions in the northern North Atlantic region recorded by synchronized lacustrine records in Iceland  Abstract: Two high-sediment-accumulation-rate Icelandic lakes, the glacial lake Hvitarvatn and the non-glacial lake Haukadalsvatn, contain numerous tephra layers of known age, which together with highresolution paleomagnetic secular variations allow synchronization with a well-dated marine core from the shelf north of Iceland. A composite standardized climate record from the two lakes provides a single time series that efficiently integrates multi-proxy data that reflect the evolution of summer temperatures through the Holocene. The first-order trends in biogenic silica (BSi), d13C, and C:N rise relatively abruptly following deglaciation, reaching maximum values shortly after 8 ka following a complex minimum between 8.7 and 8.0 ka. The Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) in the lakes is marked by all proxies, with a sharp transition out of the 8 ka cold event into peak summer warmth by 7.9 ka, and continuing warm with some fluctuations until 5.5 ka. Decreasing summer insolation after the HTM is reflected by incremental cooling, initially w5.5 ka, with subsequent cold perturbations recorded by all proxies 4.3 to 4.0 ka and 3.1 to 2.8 ka. The strongest disturbance occurred after 2 ka with initial summer cooling occurring between 1.4 and 1.0 ka, followed by a more severe drop in summer temperatures after 0.7 ka culminating between 0.5 and 0.2 ka. Following each late Holocene cold departure, BSi re-equilibrated at a lower value independent of the sediment accumulation rate. Some of the abrupt shifts may be related to Icelandic volcanism influencing catchment stability, but the lack of a full recovery to pre-existing values after the perturbation suggests increased periglacial activity, decreased vegetation cover, and glacier growth in the highlands of Iceland. The similarity in timing, direction and magnitude of our multi-proxy records from glacial and non-glacial lakes, and from the adjacent marine shelf, suggests that our composite record reflects large-scale shifts in ocean/atmosphere circulation throughout the northern North 6. Conclusion: The climate reconstructions derived from the glacial lake Hvitarvatn and the non-glacial lake Haukadalsvatn reveal distinct, non-linear changes that constitute some of the most coherent terrestrial evidence from Iceland for widespread, quasi-periodic abrupt Holocene climate shifts. The unusually high sediment accumulation rates characteristic of Icelandic lakes and shelves, coupled with secure geochronologies (210Pb, 137Cs, 14C, PSV synchronization, tephrochronology, and varves in glacier-dominated lakes) allows the development of precisely dated high-resolution records of climate through the Holocene, which is essential to evaluate the causes behind abrupt climate change.Despite differences in geographic settings of the HAK and HVT lake basins both records indicate an approximately 2500-year-long interval of HTM conditions beginning w7.9 ka, followed by a threshold change at w5.5 ka and the onset of Neoglaciation. The orbitally forced first-order cooling trend reflected in the lake records after 5.5 ka is interrupted by abrupt step-function shifts, recording changes in the state of the catchments, including increases in periglacial activity and decreases in vegetation cover at 4.2 ka, 3.0 ka and 1.5 ka, and culminating in the Little Ice Age (LIA) between 0.7 and 0.1 ka. The combined lake records demonstrate that landscape instability and soil erosion preceded human colonization of Iceland by several centuries, and that for several centuries after settlement soil erosion was reduced. Although changes in land use and deforestation associated with the settlement, probably made the region more susceptible to disturbance from natural climate variability, the initiation of landscape instability at the beginning of the LIA appears to be unrelated to human activity. Because Icelands climate is dominated by North Atlantic circulation, our synchronized records may provide a template for other land areas around the northern North Atlantic and GreenlandIceland and the Norwegian (GIN) seas."
__label__UNRELATED	"The initial break-up of Panga elicited by Late Palozoic deglaciation  Abstract: The break-up of Panga was principally facilitated by tensional plate stress acting on pre-existing suture zones. The rifting of Panga began during the Early Permian along the southern Tethys margin and produced the lenticular-shaped continent known as Cimmeria. A mantle-plume model is ascribed to explain the rift-related volcanism but the NW-SE oriented Cimmerian rifts do not correlate well with pre-existing suture zones or structural heterogeneities but appear to have a pertinent spatial and temporal association with Late Palozoic glacial-interglacial cycles. Mantle potential temperature estimates of Cimmerian rift-related basalts (1410 C 50 C) are similar to ambient mantle conditions rather than an active mantle-plume rift as previously suggested. Moreover, we find that the distribution of glacial deposits shows significant temporal and spatial concurrence between the glacial retreat margins and rifting sites. We conclude that the location and timing of Cimmerian rifting resulted from the exploitation of structural heterogeneities within the crust that formed due to repeated glacialinterglacial cycles during the Late Palozoic. Such effects of continental deglaciation helped to create the lenticular shape of Cimmeria and Neotethys Ocean suggesting that, in some instances, climate change may directly influence the location of rifting. Conclusions: There is a spatial and temporal association between glacial retreat and rifting of Cimmerian terranes from Gondwana during the Late Palozoic. Ambient mantle potential temperatures estimates of Early Permian Cimmerian rift-related basalts from Oman, Kashmir and Tibet are supportive of an archetypical passive continental rift rather than an active mantle-plume rift with anomalously hot mantle (TP > 1550 C). Although no inherent structural heterogeneity zones or icosahedral tessellation boundaries were present for rift margins to act upon, it is likely that a large differential stress environment, strong postglacial rebound stress, and the shielding effect of the ice sheet created regions of structural heterogeneities for a later extensional tectonic stress to exploit. Therefore, it is very likely that the eruption of flood basalts, rifting of Cimmeria and the formation of the Neotethys Ocean are directly related to deglaciation of the Late Palozoic ice sheet. Such a relationship between environmental change and supercontinent break-up may be unique to the Late Palozoic."
__label__SUPPORT	"Synchronous Wildfire Activity Rise and Mire Deforestation at the TriassicJurassic Boundary  Abstract: The end-Triassic mass extinction event (,201.4 million years ago) caused major faunal and floral turnovers in both the marine and terrestrial realms. The biotic changes have been attributed to extreme greenhouse warming across the Triassic Jurassic (TJ) boundary caused by massive release of carbon dioxide and/or methane related to extensive volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), resulting in a more humid climate with increased storminess and lightning activity. Lightning strikes are considered the primary source of wildfires, producing charcoal, microscopically recognized as inertinite macerals. The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of pyrolytic origin and allochthonous charcoal in siliciclastic TJ boundary strata has suggested widespread wildfire activity at the time. We have investigated largely autochthonous coal and coaly beds across the TJ boundary in Sweden and Denmark. These beds consist of predominantly organic material from the in situ vegetation in the mires, and as the coaly beds represent a substantial period of time they are excellent environmental archives. We document a remarkable increase in inertinite content in the coal and coaly beds across the TJ boundary. We show estimated burning temperatures derived from inertinite reflectance measurements coupled with palynological data and conclude that pre-boundary late Rhaetian mire wildfires included high-temperature crown fires, whereas latest RhaetianSinemurian mire wildfires were more frequent but dominated by lower temperature surface fires. Our results suggest a major change in the mire ecosystems across the TJ boundary from forested, conifer dominated mires to mires with a predominantly herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. Contrary to the overall regional vegetation for which onset of recovery commenced in the early Hettangian, the sensitive mire ecosystem remained affected during the Hettangian and did not start to recover until around the HettangianSinemurian boundary. Decreasing inertinite content through the Lower Jurassic suggests that fire activity gradually resumed to considerable lower levels.

This was associated with a change from more forested mires in the late Rhaetian to more fern- and shrub-dominated mire floras in the latest Rhaetian, Hettangian and early Sinemurian as indicated both by calculated burning temperatures and palynology. Increased fire activity and deforestation thus appeared to start in the latest Rhaetian below the TJ boundary. These changes are in agreement with other studies that have shown deforestation [7,15,26,69] and charcoal abundance in the latest Rhaetian close to the TJ boundary [16,23,24]. High concentrations of PAHs in Hettangian strata from Poland [24] suggest the most intense fire activity occurred during this period, followed by a decrease, with calculated burning temperatures ranging from 295377uC indicating predominance of surface fires and maybe ground fires [24]. This is in excellent agreement with our results, however our data show continued high wildfire activity in mires during the entire Hettangian (Fig. 5). The causes for the increase in fire activity across the TJ boundary can possibly be linked to two principal factors causing a more wild climate: (1) the establishment of a large sea in a seasonal climate and (2) the contemporaneous CAMP volcanism. It is tempting to select the CAMP volcanism as the main factor as its immediate effect would have been a warmer climate with increased water vapour triggered by extensive CO2 and aerosol release. Evaporation from the sea would possibly have accentuated humidity. High water vapour and seasonality likely increased the frequency of thunderstorms and lightning significantly and it is well-established that lightning strikes are the main cause of wildfire ignition [48]. Initially, thefloral change to less forested mires may have been a shorter-term effect of SO2 pollution associated with CAMP volcanism [7]. The high fire activity possibly helped to sustain more open mire environments, preventing regrowth of arborescent plants. Removal of the canopy may potentially also have made it easier to dry out surface litter in drier months making it more flammable. However, while the regional palynological record indicates early Hettangian recovery of arborescent vegetation, the mire flora remained affected indicating that the environmental changes had a more long-term effect on the sensitive mire ecosystem. The high fire activity and dominance of surface fires during the Hettangian likely indicates a change to at least periodically less waterlogged mires enabling frequent burning of dried surface fuels, maybe promoted by a fluctuating watertable facilitated by a seasonal climate with unevenly distributed rainfall through the year [35]. The TJ boundary was thus a high-stress period that forced the vegetation to adapt to new environmental conditions. Although recovery of the regional terrestrial ecosystem appears to have started already in the early Hettangian [26], recovery of the sensitive mire floras did not commence until around the HettangianSinemurian boundary and decreasing inertinite content through the Lower Jurassic (Fig. 2) suggests that fire activity gradually resumed to considerable lower and possibly more normal levels."
__label__UNRELATED	"The influence of soil age and regional climate on clay mineralogy and cation exchange capacity of moist tropical soils_ A case study from Late Quaternary chronosequences in Costa Rica  Abstract: Tropical soils exhibit large differences across landscapes in many attributes, notably clay mineralogy (2:1 vs. 1:1 clays), bulk geochemistry (Ca, Al), pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter and soil texture. In order to examine the factors controlling these variables, a series of three chronosequences (120 ka) of tropical soils on uplifted terraces along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica were studied. The three study locations differ mainly as a function of soil moisture and leaching, with conditions ranging from 2700 mm/yr mean annual precipitation (MAP) on the southern Nicoya Peninsula (4-month dry season), to 3200 mm/yr in the Esterillos region (3-month dry season), and 4250 mm/yr on the Osa Peninsula (no dry season). Analytical methods include X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission-analytical electron microscopy (TEM-AEM), inductively coupled plasma optical emission and mass spectrometry (ICP-OES, ICP-MS), ammonium acetate extraction (1 M NH4OAc, pH = 7, for CEC) and C:N analysis. Soil weathering reactions and related decrease in CEC occur three-to-four times faster in a sequence of Inceptisol-to-Oxisol soils in the wettest climate (Osa) compared to the less-moist Esterillos area; in the even drier monsoon climate soils (Nicoya), this evolved, low-CEC (< 10 cmolc/kg) state does not occur, even after 120 ka of soil formation, and rate of compositional alteration is approximately five to ten times slower than at Osa. The dominant exchangeable cation at all sites is Ca. Interlayer K and Al increase relative to Ca over time, resulting in interstratified K-S with smectite layers that become progressively more vermiculite-like and illite-like. The age-related evolution of tropical soils appears to be a predictable sequence in lowland tropical landscapes where periodic tectonism, erosion or volcanism produces unweathered parent material at the land surface. Empirical data from this project enables the extrapolation of simple equations applicable to tropical volcanic arc landscapes where presence of uplifted marine terrace soils facilitates determination of soil age. The two variables controlling soil composition can be combined into an effective age (ageeff) that takes into account soil age and weathering intensity (factoring in MAP and wet-dry months from climate data), and equations are of the form, e.g. ECEC =18.1 ln(ageeff) + 77, with R values of 0.75 to 0.87. Greatest scatter occurs in the youngest soils. Given the apparent prevalence of this sequence and the systematic nature of its reaction progression, these results could be useful for modeling tropical soils. 6. Conclusions: XRD, TEM-AEM, and FTIR analyses indicate that, with increasing soil age in all three chronosequences, early pedogenic smectite transforms into K-S and eventually to an assemblage dominated by kaolinite and halloysite. This shift in mineralogy causes a drop in CEC from 67 12 cmolc/ kg in smectite-dominated Holocene soils to 31 9 cmolc/kg in K-S dominated soils to 7 6 in Late Pleistocene halloysite + kaolinitedominated soils. These changes occur approximately three-to-four times more rapidly in the humid rainforest ecosystem of the Osa Peninsula (4250 mm MAP) compared to the drier Esterillos region (3200 MAP) and likely five-to-ten times more rapidly than the more savanna-like ecosystem of the southern Nicoya Peninsula (2700 mm MAP). The two primary factors controlling soil composition in the moist tropics age and climate can be combined into an effective age (ageeff) that accounts for weathering duration and intensity and facilitates prediction of soil properties including CEC and mineralogy."
__label__SUPPORT	"Evidence for a spike in mantle carbon outgassing during the Ediacaran period  Abstract: 1Department of Geology, University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, Oshkosh, WI, USA. 2Department of Geological and Mining Engineering and Sciences, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA. 3Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, Department of Earth Sciences, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. *e-mail: paulsen@uwosh.edu The largest reservoir of carbon on Earth resides in the mantle, but how it has evolved over the planets history and influenced global climate remains an unresolved fundamental problem1. According to standard models, there were times when the exogenic carbon inputs (igneous and metamorphic degassing) outweighed the outputs (silicate weathering, burial sequestration and subduction), leading to global warming and rising sea levels2. The balance of exogenic atmospheric inputs and outputs during the Neoproterozoic is of particular interest because this period was marked by major perturbations in the global carbon cycle that have been hypothetically connected to changing climate, atmospheric oceanic oxygenation and biodiversification before the Cambrian explosion of life3,4. Although the details of changes in the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2) throughout the Neoproterozoic are poorly understood, it seems to have risen from relatively low levels as the Earth transitioned from its Snowball Earth state in the Cryogenian (approximately 720635 million years ago (Ma)) to a maximum Phanerozoic level during its greenhouse state in the Cambrian5. Recent analyses of a growing worldwide detrital zircon database have led to the conclusion that late Neoproterozoic Phanerozoic transitions from Earths ice to greenhouse states coincide with increases in zircon abundance6. Long-term global warming has, therefore, been linked to the notion that increases in pCO2 are governed by widespread expansion of continental arc magmatism6,7. Although increasing exogenic CO2 input has commonly been taken to mark surges in carbonate subduction8, significant calcareous pelagic deposition did not commence until the Cretaceous9. Subduction of carbonated ocean crust and mantle, as well as the carbonates stripped off continents and shed into adjacent trenches, offer possible carbon inputs into Precambrian subduction zones. However, there are fundamental uncertainties about the palaeo-temperature and -pressure regimes of ancient arcs and whether they met the conditions that are required for efficient decarbonation of subducted slabs to fuel substantial CO2 emissions1. It has also been noted that time periods of increased carbonatite magmatism seem to correlate with past warmer climates (for example, during the Cretaceous and Eocene10, as well as the Ediacaran11). A plausible causal link exists, as carbonatite melts can degas on ascent, releasing significant amounts of CO2 when they reach relatively shallow depths (< 90 km)12. Carbonatites are typically made up of 50% carbonate minerals13. Therefore, even if the total magma production rate is low, they emit an anomalously large amount of CO2 compared with the average arc magma, which typically has less than 5,000 ppm of CO2. Equally important is the fact that this magma type erupts with other alkaline magmas that are also highly enriched in CO2. The global impact of alkaline and carbonatite magmatism is highlighted by studies that have shown the potential for these magma types to emit tenand up to fifty-times more CO2 into the atmosphere, respectively, than arc magmas16,17. Therefore, the record of alkaline and carbonatite magmatism in the rock record may point to significant, punctuated CO2 releases from the subcontinental mantle reservoir10; a potentially important process operating outside of the steady state within the carbon cycle that warrants investigation. We carried out a coupled UPb age and trace element analysis of 5,715 detrital zircons from 46 sandstone samples (primarily Neoproterozoicearly Palaeozoic in age) widely distributed along a ~3,000-km-long swath of the Neoproterozoicearly Palaeozoic Pacific-Gondwana margin in Antarctica (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). These sandstones are of interest because they are known to contain high concentrations of the prototypical 700500 Ma zircon UPb age population that overlaps with the EdiacaranCambrian global warming phase that has been linked to higher CO2 emissions from continental arcs6. The sources of this zircon age population may include exposed and ice-covered igneous provinces in Antarctica, such as the Ross orogen1820, for Evidence for a spike in mantle carbon outgassing during the Ediacaran period"
__label__UNRELATED	"Preservation of glacial and interglacial phases in Tethys Himalaya: evidence from geochemistry and petrography of Permo-Carboniferous sandstones from the Spiti region, Himachal Pradesh, India  Abstract: Through a multidisciplinary approach, including petrology and geochemistry, the sedimentary provenance and paleo-weathering of the Permo-Carboniferous Spiti sandstones of Tethys Himalaya are investigated. The Spiti region consists of texturally immature to mature sandstones composed of unsorted to sorted and subangular to subrounded clastic grains dominated by variable amounts of quartz and feldspar accompanied by lithic fragments (mostly metasedimentary, sedimentary, and plutonic grains). They are characterized bymoderate to high SiO2 contents, moderate K2O/Na2O ratios, but relatively low mafic contents. Uniform rare earth element (REE) patterns similar to upper continental crustal (UCC) with light REE (LREE) enrichment (LaN/ SmN=3.91), flat heavy REE (HREE; GdN/YbN=1.212.5), and negative Eu anomalies with variable amounts of REE and Eu anomalies (0.40.8) suggest that hydraulic sorting played a significant role. The striking similarities of the multi-elemental spider diagrams of the Spiti sandstones and the Himalayan granitoids indicate that sediments are sourced from the Proterozoic and Cambro-Ordovician orogenic belts of the Himalayan region. The nature of the feldspar observed in thin sections frommost altered to euhedral pristine minerals corresponding to Carboniferous to lower Permian sandstones strongly indicates a change in climate from most favorable conditions for rapid feldspar alteration (humid) to conditions where negligible alteration is possible (arid and glacial). It is found that the chemical index of alteration (CIA) values of these sandstones accorded with inferences based on modified chemical index of alteration (CIX) andCa values, and sedimentologic and paleontological evidence, discriminating well between warm-humid (indicated by high CIA values) and aridglacial (representing low CIA) conditions in the Spiti basin. Thus, these results document a complete record of glacial and interglacial phases in the Permocarboniferous Spiti sandstones, and the interpretations are consistent with other such studies on the Phanerozoic glaciation events on Gondwana supercontinent. Conclusions: The Permo-Carboniferous sandstones of the NW Tethys Himalaya, Spiti region, northern India, display considerable variations in their mineralogy, and major and trace element compositions, which are dominantly controlled by the source rocks, weathering conditions of the provenance, hydraulic sorting, and the then prevailing climatic conditions. Petrographic analysis revealed that these sandstones contain varied types and amount of detritus which was mainly derived from coarse grained plutonic rocks, recycled quartzose sediments with subordinate amounts of metamorphic rocks. This inference in turn strongly endorses our argument that the source for the Spiti basin lies very near and south of the Spiti basin such as Precambrian Higher Himalayan Vaikrita granites and gneisses and Cambro-Ordovician granites occurring all along the Lesser Himalayan zone. Quartzarenites, sublitharenites, and subarkose of the Kanawar Group of sandstones have petrographic (texture, framework mineralogy, quartz type, and inclusions in quartz) and geochemical characteristics (such as REE patterns, Th/Sc, La/Sc, Cr/Th, and Eu/Eu* ratios) that suggest quartzoze recycled sedimentary rocks as the source rocks in addition to high-grade metamorphic and plutonic igneous rocks. The obtained data are consistent with the passive continental margin tectonic setting or intra-continental rift environment for the Spiti sandstones. Thesource area was affected by deferential degree of weathering from intense to low as recorded in the detrital mineralogy and CIA values. The span of CIA values (7853) recorded in the Spiti sandsones corresponding to different formations of the Kanawar Group may result from varying (more intense to low) degrees of weathering conditions which in turn reflect variable climate conditions during the Permo-Carboniferous period. Geochemical proxies (e.g., CIA values), paleontologi ca l ( fo ss i l ) ev idence coup led wi th sys temat i c lithostratigraphic variations in the compositional maturity of the Kanawar Group sandstones (i.e., from base to top, maturesubmature to immature) are very well linked to the changing paleo-climate of Indian subcontinent (i.e., warm, humid to glacial, and arid) associated with the Carboniferous to Permian drift of the landmass through differential latitudinal zones and the overall change in global climate (Scheffler et al. 2003). Thus, the Permo-Carboniferous Tethys Himalayan sequence in the Spiti region documents progressive long-term cooling from cool humid climates in Visean to cold sub-polar climate in the Asselian period.Detrital zircon peaks in the Tethyan sediments ranging from Paleoproterozoic (1.81.9 Ga) and Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic ages (0.9Ga to 570 Ma) have been reported by many workers, and similar peak ages have been documented in correlative Lesser Himalayan and Higher Himalayan granitoid belts along strike of the Himalaya. This in turn indicates a southern provenance for the clastic Tethyan Himalayan units in Nepal and northwest India attributed to Cambro-Ordovician tectonic activity on the northern Indian margin. A good similarity between multi-elemental spider diagrams of Spiti sandstones and the Proterozoic and Paleozoic granitoids from the Himalayas is obtainedwhich substantiates the above inference and suggests that Tethyan sediments may have been derived from these granitoid belts.Acknowledgments We are thankful to the Chairman, Department of Geology, AMU, Aligarh, for providing necessary facilities.

__label__SUPPORT	"Gas emissions due to magmasediment interactions during flood magmatism at the Siberian Traps Gas dispersion and environmental consequences  Abstract: We estimate the fluxes of extremely reduced gas emissions produced during the emplacement of the Siberian Traps large igneous province, due to magma intrusion in the coaliferous sediments of the Tunguska Basin. Using the results of a companion paper (Iacono-Marziano et al., accepted for publication), and a recent work about low temperature interaction between magma and organic 10 g/yr for a single magmatic/volcanic event. These fluxes are 720 times higher than those calculated for purely magmatic gas emissions, in the absence of interaction with organic matter-rich sediments. We investigate, by means of atmospheric modelling employing present geography of Siberia, the short and mid-term dispersion of these gas emissions into the atmosphere. The lateral propagation of CO and CH4 leads to an important perturbation of the atmosphere chemistry, consisting in a strong reduction of the radical OH concentration. As a consequence, both CO and CH4 lifetimes in the lower atmosphere are enhanced by a factor of at least 3, at the continental scale, as a consequence of 30 days of magmatic activity. The short-term effect of the injection of carbon monoxide and methane into the atmosphere is therefore to increase the residence times of these two species and, in turn, their capacity of geographic expansion. The estimated CO and CH4 volume mixing ratios (i.e. the number of molecules of CO or CH4 per cm , divided by the total number of molecules per cm) in the low atmosphere are 25 ppmv at the continental scale and locally higher than 50 ppmv. The dimension of the area affected by these high volume mixing ratios decreases in the presence of a lava flow accompanying magma intrusion at depth. Complementary calculations for a 10-yr duration of the magmatic activity suggest (i) an increase in the mean CH4 volume mixing ratio of the whole atmosphere up to values 315 times higher than the current one, and (ii) recovery times of 100 yr to bring back the atmospheric volume mixing ratio of CH4 to the pre-magmatic value. Thermogenic methane emissions from the Siberian Traps have already been proposed to crucially contribute to end PermianEarly Triassic global warming and to the negative carbon isotopic shift observed globally in both marine and terrestrial sediments. Our results corroborate these hypotheses and suggest that concurrent high temperature CO emissions also played a key role by contributing to increase (i) the radiative forcing of methane and therefore in its global warming potential, and (ii) the input of isotopically light carbon into the atmosphere that generated the isotopic excursion. We also speculate a poisoning effect of high carbon monoxide concentrations on end-Permian fauna, at a local scale. & 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 5. Conclusions: LIP eruptions coincide with major mass extinctions (Vogt, 1972; Courtillot and Renne, 2003). The possible causal link has been ascribed to both short and long term effects of volcanic gas emissions (Wignall, 2001; Scaillet, 2008). Here we show that the environmental consequences of magmatic activity are, inter alia, strongly dependent on magmahost rock interactions, in particular when the host rocks are composed of carbonates, sulphates, salts, or organic compounds (as already proposed by Svensen et al., 2004, 2007, 2009; Ganino and Arndt, 2009). Such a mechanism leads to atmospheric injection of volatiles in amounts greatly exceeding the original magmatic content and possibly departing significantly from the redox state of the magma source. The atmospheric modelling of COCH4 dominated gas emissions resulting from magmaorganic matter interactions at the Siberian Traps shows that (i) carbon monoxide levels attained in the low atmosphere at the continental scale were comparable to those currently measured in polluted urban areas (25 ppmv), and significantly higher close to the degassing zone (450 ppmv); (ii) important perturbations of atmosphere chemistry were attained leading to substantial decrease in the radical OH concentration; (iii) CO and CH4 lifetimes were consequently enhanced (320 times at the continental scale),therefore increasing the residence time of these two species in the atmosphere. Ten years of magmatic/volcanic activity are calculated to increase by factor of 1050 the mean concentration of methane in the whole atmosphere, yielding a radiative forcing comparable or superior to that due to the increase of both CO2 and CH4 concentration between 1765 and 1990. Short-term poisoning of local fauna by carbon monoxide and long-term global warming by methane are therefore the most likely implications of gas emissions due to magmaorganic matter interactions at the Siberian Traps."
__label__UNRELATED	"Controls on clay minerals assemblages in an early paleogene nonmarine succession: Implications for the volcanic and paleoclimatic record of extra-andean patagonia, Argentina  Abstract: The distribution of the clay minerals of the Banco Negro Inferior-Rio Chico Group succession (BNI-RC), a middle Danianemiddle Eocene mainly continental epiclasticepyroclastic succession exposed in the Golfo San Jorge Basin, extra-Andean Patagonia (w46 LS), is assessed in order to determine the possible origin of clay and specific non-clay minerals using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The control over the clay mineralogy of the sedimentary settings, contemporary volcanism, paleoclimate and weathering conditions is considered. A paleoclimatic reconstruction is provided and correlated with the main global warming events that occurred during the early Paleogene. Mineralogical analyses of BNI-RC demonstrate that smectite and kaolin minerals (kaolinite, halloysite and kaolinite/smectite mixed layers) are the main clay minerals, whereas silica polymorphs (volcanic glass and opal) are common non-clay minerals. Throughout the succession, smectite and kaolin minerals are arranged in different proportions in the three clayemineral assemblages. These show a general vertical trend in which the smectite-dominated assemblage (S1) is replaced by the smectite-dominated assemblage associated with other clays (S2) and the kaolinite-dominated assemblage (K), and finally by S2 up-section. The detailed micromorphological analysis of the clay and non-clay minerals allows us to establish that the origins of these are by volcanic ash weathering, authigenic and pedogenic, and that different stages in the evolution of mineral transformations have occurred. The supply of labile pyroclastic material from an active volcanic area located to the northwest of the study area could have acted as precursor of the authigenic and volcanogenic minerals of the analyzed succession. Diverse fine-grained lithological facies (muddy and tuffaceous facies) and sedimentary settings (coastal swamp and transitional environments, and different fluvial systems) together with variable climate and weathering conditions controlled the mineralogical transformations and the arrangement of clayemineral assemblages. The paleoclimatic reconstruction suggests a general warm and humid climate. However, the temporal trend of the clayemineral assemblages, the ratios between smectite and kaolinite and the micromorphological analysis of clay minerals contrasted with evidence from sedimentological analyses suggest a warm and seasonal climate for the basal part of the unit, a warm and humid climate with a relatively more perennial rainfall regime in the middle part of the unit, and a warm and less humid, probably subhumid, climate up-section. Such a reconstruction makes it possible to establish a correlation with some of the hyperthermal events of the Early Paleogene Global Warming (EPGW) and, consequently, constitute one of the most complete time records of the EPGW in South America. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Conclusions: The Banco Negro Inferior-Rio Chico Group, a middle Daniane middle Eocene in age mainly continental epiclasticepyroclastic succession in the Golfo San Jorge Basin (extra-Andean Patagonia,Argentina), was deposited under the global greenhouse conditions of the early Paleogene and is contemporarywith an important period of explosive volcanic activity toward the northwest of the basin. The BNI-RC succession shows that sedimentary settings of deposition vary from coastal swamp and transitional environments (BNI and NT) through a low- and high-sinuosity fluvial system (LV, PC, LF) to a distal fluvial system with loess and ash-fall deposits (KK). Tuff and tuffaceous facies and associated paleosols are common and increase up-section. Previous petrographic and paleocurrent analyses of the succession show that such volcaniclastic materials come from the volcanoes located less than 400 km to the northwest of the study area, and that BNI-RC was only affected by shallow-burial diagenetic conditions.XRD and SEM analyses demonstrate that smectite and kaolin minerals (kaolinite, halloysite and kaolinite/smectite mixed layers) prevail over other clay minerals (illite/smectite mixed layers, illite and chlorite) in the fine-grained facies of BNI-RC. Quartz, feldspar, other silica polymorphs in the form of volcanic glass and different types of opal, together with clinoptilolite and Fe-oxides are the most abundant non-clay minerals. Such analyses provide evidence that smectite is in general well crystallized and is defined as a mixture of montmorilloniteebeidellite series. The micromorphological study confirms that such smectite was produced by the alteration of volcanic glass. Smectites with a lower degree of crystallization are also present and suggest a pedogenic origin. Wellcrystallized kaolinite with book-like, vermiform texture and vermicular stacks of plates suggests an authigenic origin. The relationship between halloysite and/or smectite and volcanic glass reveals local in situ dissolution and precipitation. The micromorphological evolution from halloysite to kaolinite and the characteristics of the kaolinite/smectite mixed layers are interpreted as pedogenic in origin. The relationship between opal and volcanic materials indicates that the silica phases came from the in situ alteration of volcanic glass. For the clinoptilolite, an authigenic origin is proposed, whereas for Fe-oxides a pedogenic origin is accepted.The clay minerals mentioned are arranged in three clayemineral assemblages: S1: rich in smectite; S2: with smectite and other clay minerals; K: kaolinite-rich. These assemblages show a trend up-section from S1 (BNIebase of LV) through S2 and K (upper part of LV and PCemiddle part of KK) to S2 (lower part of KK). Such a trend is in concordance with the change in the sedimentary settings mentioned above and with the increase in volcaniclastic materials and paleosols up-section.The presence of smectite and kaolinite suggests chemical weathering conditions under warm and humid conditions. However, the ratio between them (S/K ratio) together with the sedimentary facies analyses, makes it possible to recognize several pulses of seasonality or less intense precipitation throughout the succession, such as at BNIebase of LV and at the upper part of KK. Besides, the occurrence of halloysite in paleosols of the top of PC, tuffs of the base of LF and in some samples of the middle part of KK against the presence of kaolinite in the basalemiddle part of KK allows us to distinguish relatively more perennial e though not abundant e rainfall when the first mineral appears, and a more year-round regime where kaolinite is concentrated.Paleoclimatic reconstructions of the BNI-RC succession strongly suggest a possible correlation of these with global warm climatic events of the Early Paleogene Global Warming (EPGW). The probable presence of some of these warm events constitutes one of the most complete time records of the EPGW in South America and could contribute to the resolution of the global character of these events.Thus, the clay-mineralogical arrangement throughout the BNIRC succession is interpreted as being a consequence of theinterplay of several control factors, such as the supply of labile pyroclastic materials, sedimentary paleoenvironments and lithologies of the facies, sedimentation/pedogenesis rates, paleoclimate and weathering conditions."
__label__UNRELATED	"Beyond methane: Towards a theory for the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum  Abstract: Extreme global warmth and an abrupt negative carbon isotope excursion during the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) have been attributed to a massive release of methane hydrate from sediments on the continental slope [G.R. Dickens, J.R. O'Neil, D.K. Rea, R.M. Owen, Dissociation of oceanic methane hydrate as a cause of the carbon isotope excursion at the end of the Paleocene, Paleoceanography 10 (1995) 965971.]. However, the magnitude of the warming (5 to 6 C [J.C. Zachos, M.W. Wara, S. Bohaty, M.L. Delaney, M.R. Petrizzo, A. Brill, T.J. Bralower, I. Premoli-Silva, A transient rise in tropical sea surface temperature during the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum, Science 302 (2003) 15511554.,J.P. Kennett, L.D.

Nicolo, Rapid acidification of the ocean during the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum, Science 308 (2005) 16111615.]) indicate that the size of the carbon addition was larger than can be accounted for by the methane hydrate hypothesis. Additional carbon sources associated with methane hydrate release (e.g. pore-water venting and turbidite oxidation) are also insufficient. We find that the oxidation of at least 5000 Gt C of organic carbon is the most likely explanation for the observed geochemical and climatic changes during the PETM, for which there are several potential mechanisms. Production of thermogenic CH4 and CO2 during contact metamorphism associated with the intrusion of a large igneous province into organic rich sediments [H. Svensen, S. Planke, A. Malthe-Sorenssen, B. Jamtveit, R. Myklebust, T.R. Eidem, S.S. Rey, Release of methane from a volcanic basin as a mechanism for initial Eocene global warming, Nature 429 (2004).] is capable of supplying large amounts of carbon, but is inconsistent with the lack of extensive carbon loss in metamorphosed sediments, as well as the abrupt onset and termination of carbon release during the PETM. A global conflagration of Paleocene peatlands [A.C. Kurtz, L.R. Kump, M.A. Arthur, J.C. Zachos, A. Paytan, Early Cenozoic decoupling of the global carbon and sulfur cycles, Paleoceanography 18 (2003).] highlights a large terrestrial carbon source, but massive carbon release by fire seems unlikely as it would require that all peatlands burn at once and then for only 10 to 30 ky. In addition, this hypothesis requires an order of magnitude increase in the amount of carbon stored in peat. The isolation of a large epicontinental seaway by tectonic uplift associated with volcanism or continental collision, followed by desiccation and bacterial respiration of the aerated organic matter is another potential mechanism for the rapid release of large amounts of CO2.

Potential mechanisms of carbon release include complete combustion of an extremely large terrestrial carbon pool, metamorphism associated with a large intrusive complex in the North Atlantic, and the desiccation of a major epicontinental seaway. Further research on the timing and duration of intrusive volcanism and the organic carbon content of the metamorphic aureoles, the size of the late Paleocene terrestrial carbon pool, and the depositional histories of early Cenozoic epicontinental seaways is needed to test these hypotheses. Regardless of the specific mechanism, the PETM is a natural analogue for increases in atmospheric CO2 due to fossil fuel burning over the next century, and implies a relatively high climate sensitivity."
__label__UNRELATED	"Mass-production of CambroOrdovician quartz-rich sandstone as a consequence of chemical weathering of Pan-African terranes: Environmental implications  Abstract: A vast sheet of mature quartz sand blanketed north Africa and Arabia from the Atlantic coast to the Persian Gulf in Cambro Ordovician times. UPb geochronology of a representative section of Cambrian sandstone in southern Israel shows that these sediments are dominated by 550650 Ma detrital zircons derived from Neoproterozoic Pan-African basement. The short time lag between magmatic consolidation of a Pan-African source and deposition of its erosional products indicates that, despite their significant mineralogical maturity, the voluminous quartz-rich sandstones on the northern margin of Gondwana are essentially firstcycle sediments. Mass production of these voluminous first-cycle quartz-rich sandstones resulted from widespread chemical weathering of the Pan-African continental basement. We suggest that conditions favoring silicate weathering, particularly a warm and humid climate, low relief and low sedimentation rates prevailed over large tracts of Gondwana in the aftermath of the Pan-African orogeny. An unusually corrosive CambroOrdovician atmosphere and humid climate enhanced chemical weathering on the vegetation-free landscape. We infer that late NeoproterozoicCambroOrdovician atmospheric pCO2 rose as a consequence of widespread late Neoproterozoic volcanism, followed by an uptake of CO2 by chemical weathering to produce the CambroOrdovician sandstone as a negative feedback.

__label__SUPPORT	"Bipolar correlation of volcanism with millennial climate change  Abstract: Analyzing data from our optical dust logger, we find that volcanic ash layers from the Siple Dome (Antarctica) borehole are simultaneous (with >99% rejection of the null hypothesis) with the onset of millennium-timescale cooling recorded at Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2; Greenland). These data are the best evidence yet for a causal connection between volcanism and millennial climate change and lead to possibilities of a direct causal relationship. Evidence has been accumulating for decades that volcanic eruptions can perturb climate and possibly affect it on long timescales and that volcanism may respond to climate change. If rapid climate change can induce volcanism, this result could be further evidence of a southern-lead NorthSouth climate asynchrony. Alternatively, a volcanic-forcing viewpoint is of particular interest because of the high correlation and relative timing of the events, and it may involve a scenario in which volcanic ash and sulfate abruptly increase the soluble iron in large surface areas of the nutrientlimited Southern Ocean, stimulate growth of phytoplankton, which enhance volcanic effects on planetary albedo and the global carbon cycle, and trigger northern millennial cooling. Large global temperature swings could be limited by feedback within the volcanoclimate system."
__label__UNRELATED	"Petrology of Rifted-Margin Sand (Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, Yemen)  Abstract: The Red SeaGulf of Aden rift system, displaying a complete record of magmatic activity and characterized by arid climate and negligible anthropic modifications, provides an ideal natural laboratory for studies aimed at defining actualistic references for both volcanic and nonvolcanic rifted-margin provenances. Rifted-margin sands are derived in various proportions from volcanic to plutonic rocks emplaced before, during, or after the climax of tectonic extension (volcanic rifted-margin provenance) and from prerift sedimentary successions and underlying crystalline basements progressively unroofed during uplift of rift blocks (rift-shoulder provenance). Volcaniclastic rifted-margin sands are feldspatholithic, as are those shed by Pacific-type magmatic arcs, but are characterized by bimodal (basalt/rhyolite) lithics, abundant granophyre grains, and low plagioclase/total feldspar (P/F) ratios due to supply from synrift hypersolvus alkali granites, representing the upper levels of rift-generated juvenile crust. Augite dominates among dense minerals; detritus from postrift alkali-basalt fields includes olivine and, locally, enstatite and spinel. Sedimentary detritus from undissected rift shoulders consists of recycled quartz and carbonate sedimentary lithics; dense mineral assemblages include largely rounded to subrounded, recycled durable grains, zircon, and rutile being concentrated locally due to their higher density. Arkosic sands from basement rocks exposed on dissected rift shoulders display remarkably consistent compositions, with excess quartz with respect to ideal arkose; hornblende-rich assemblages from amphibolite-facies gneiss terranes contrast with epidote-dominated assemblages from greenschist-facies arc terranes. Diagnostic signatures and compositional trends recorded by modern Yemen sands may help in interpreting provenance of ancient rift-related sandstone suites. Conclusions: This work provides detailed information on both framework grain and dense-mineral composition of modern sand from the Red SeaGulf of Aden rift system, a classic laboratory for actualistic rift studies. The Yemen case is particularly significant because, due to arid climates and low population density, sand composition can be safely held as primary and not modified by either chemical weathering or mans activities. Processes in the depositional environment also have a minor effect, as documented by negligible compositional differences between major wadi and beach sands (second- to third-order sampling scale of Ingersoll 1990; Critelli et al. 1997).Along the young continental margins of Yemen, detritus is supplied in various proportions by riftrelated magmatic rocks and by sedimentary successions and underlying Pan-African basement exposed on the uplifted shoulders of the rift. Contrasting feldspatholithic volcano-plutonic (volcanic rifted-margin provenance) and quartzolithic sedimentaclastic to arkosic basementaclastic sig-natures (rift-shoulder provenance) are clearly differentiated on classic Dickinsons QFL diagrams.Rift-related volcano-plutonic detrital suitesnot previously recognizedplot within the magmatic arc provenance field (fig. 3; Dickinson 1985) and are not easily discriminated from sediment shed by Pacific-type magmatic arcs. Diagnostic criteria include low P/F ratios due to supply from hypersolvus alkali-granite stocks and bimodal (basalt/rhyolite) volcanic lithic populations (fig. 8).Rift-shoulder detrital suites plot in the continental block provenance field at increasing distance from the Q pole with increasing depth of erosion level (undissected to dissected stages; fig. 10); however, sand from arc terranes (including paleovolcanic to metabasite lithics) straddles the boundary with the recycled orogen field. Sand from undissected rift-shoulders entirely consists of recycled quartz and carbonate grains from prerift sedimentary successions. Arkosic sand from Precambrian basement rocks shows remarkably consistent composition from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden and invariably includes significant amounts of excess quartz with respect to ideal arkose.Transitional rift-shoulder to mixed compositions occur where basement rocks are sparsely exposed beneath sedimentary or volcanic sequences, as along the Jurassic Marib-Balhaf graben or at the periphery of the Yemen Traps plateau. Occurrence of ancient fault lineaments, reactivated repeatedly at successive stages of geologic evolution, can significantly affect detrital modes of modern sand (fig. 4) and cause marked compositional changes between adjacent drainage basins (first- to second-order sampling scales).Volcanic rifted-margin and rift-shoulder provenances are characterized by markedly contrasting dense-mineral assemblages (fig. 6). Volcaniclastic Red Sea sands contain mostly brown augite from the Yemen Traps, locally associated with orthopyroxenes (chiefly hypersthene) from deeper-seated gabbroic rocks; alkali-basalt fields of the Gulf of Aden also shed common olivine and locally, spinel and enstatite. Rift-shoulder detritus is dominated by metamorphic minerals because sedimentary successions provide few dense grains. Amphibolitefacies gneiss terranes supply dominant hornblende, associated with either tremolite-actinolite and epidote (e.g., sand from the Asir terrane) or garnet (sand from the Abas terrane); greenschist-facies arc terranes mostly shed epidote (e.g., Mukalla terrane; fig. 11). Comparable mineralogical suites characterize the Nile sands (fig. 9), fed from the western shoulder of the Red Sea rift and Ethiopian volcanic plateau.This content downloaded from 150.135.135.069 on February 26, 2019 12:43:51 PM All use subject to University of Chicago Press Terms and Conditions (http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/t-and-c).Journal of Geology R I F T - M A R G I N S A N D P E T R O L O G Y 295A C K N O W L E D G M E N T SWe thank our friends in Yemen, Ali Mohsin Hassan, Ahmed Mugbil Hassan, and Hussein, for their kind help in the field.

__label__UNRELATED	"Palaeoflood-generating mechanisms on Earth, Mars, and Titan Introduction: The scientific study of palaeoflooding has risen and fallen largely in concert with prevailing scientific paradigms (Baker, 1998). The paradigm in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was catastrophism, the idea that the geological record and landscape change is the product of sudden, short, violent events. In palaeoflood science this paradigm was expressed as diluvialism the view that the Biblical flood was historically accurate and could explain various geological formations and fossil remains. Catastrophism gave way to uniformitarianism, first introduced in 1830, which stipulated that the Earth's formations are the product of slow, gradual change. Under this paradigm, geological formations previously explained by catastrophic (Biblical) flooding were often transmuted into the effects of sustained river flow or glaciation. The Channeled Scabland in Washington, USA, was originally interpreted at glacial in origin, either directly (through flow of glacial ice) or indirectly (through diversion of rivers). Consequently, the proposal by J Harlan Bretz of massive flooding as an explanation for the Channeled Scabland was originally treated as an absurd or outrageous hypothesis (cf. Davis, 1926; Baker, 1978). Decades of study demonstrated the verity of this hypothesis, establishing palaeoflood hydrology and geomorphology as a subdiscipline of geology (e.g. Kochel and Baker, 1982). During"
__label__UNRELATED	"Vegetation and climate change, fire-regime shifts and volcanic disturbance in ChiloE Continental (43S) during the last 10,000 years  Abstract: Disentangling the roles of paleofires and explosive volcanism from climatic drivers of past vegetation change is a subject insufficiently addressed in the paleoecological literature. The coastal region of the Chilo e Continental sector of northwestern Patagonia is ideal in this regard considering its proximity to active eruptive centers and the possibility of establishing comparisons with more distal, upwind sites where volcanic influence is minimal. Here we present a fine-resolution pollen and macroscopic charcoal record from Lago Teo with the aim of documenting the local vegetation and climate history, and assessing the role of disturbance regimes as drivers of vegetation change during the last ~10,000 years. The Lago Teo record shows a conspicuous warm/dry interval between ~7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP followed by a cooling trend and increase in precipitation that has persisted until the present, in agreement with previous studies in the region and interpretations of past southern westerly wind activity at multi-millennial scales. The presence of 26 tephras throughout the record allows examination of the relationship between explosive volcanism and vegetation change under contrasting climatic states of the Holocene. We found consistent statistically significant increases in Tepualia stipularis after tephra deposition over the last 10,000 years, in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP and in Hydrangea over the last 7500 years. Our results indicate a primary role of climate change as driver of long-term vegetation change and as a modulator of vegetation responses to volcanic disturbance at multidecadal and centennial timescales. 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Conclusions: The pollen record from Lago Teo shows multi-millennial dominance of Valdivian rainforest between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP, followed by a gradual replacement by North Patagonian rainforests over the last ~7500 years in the Andean foothills of Chilo e Continental. Aspects of this transition can be explained by a multimillennial cooling trend concomitant with a shift from weakerthan-present SWW during the early Holocene to stronger SWW since 7500 cal yrs BP (Moreno, 2004).The tephrostratigraphy of Lago Teo shows 26 airfall deposits which precede conspicuous changes in the fossil pollen record. We found consistent statistically significant declines in T. stipularis and increases in Eucryphia/Caldcluvia following the deposition of tephras between 7500 and 10,000 cal yrs BP, and increases in T. stipularis over the last 10,000 years. We also observe consistent and significant increases in Hydrangea after the deposition of tephras between 0 and 7500 cal yrs BP and after tephras originating from the Michinmahuida Volcanic Center, and consistent significant increases inW. trichosperma after tephras originating from the Volc an Chait en. Thick tephras also precede major vegetation changes, however, the paucity of these events prevents us from drawing firm conclusions. In sum, our results suggest that explosive volcanism has influenced the structure and composition of the temperate rainforests of Chilo e Continental over the last 10,000 years, and that the response of different opportunistic tree species is modulated by the mean climate state.We identify high paleofire activity between 8250 and 9850 cal yrs BP and during the last 520 years, and lack of consistent statistical significance association between tephra deposition and local fire. This sporadic nature of local fire close to Lago Teo contrasts with the multi-millennial pattern at regional scale (Power et al., 2008; Whitlock et al., 2007), suggesting that climate and vegetation changes in this hyperhumid sector of Chilo e Continental were not conducive for persistent long-term shifts in fire regime during the last 10,000 years and that explosive volcanism did not influence fire regimes near Lago Teo during the Holocene."

A Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model was draped with geo-referenced geological and topographical maps and air photos. The entire RVP region was inspected systematically for tectonic lineaments and volcanic vents. Tectonic lineaments show two distinct directions, NWSE and NNESSW, consistent with the idea of a current stress regime of local NESW compression. We find that there is tectonic control on the regional location for at least two of the three major volcanoes as well as for local distribution of eruptive vents on each of these three volcanoes. Field data show that major volcano instability events occurred in the Holocene for Ngozi caldera and Rungwe. These instability events are possibly associated with the faults controlling the location of both volcanoes. This study highlights the need for monitoring RVP tectonic and volcanic activity. 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: The RVP volcanotectonic architecture was investigated with RS imagery. Air photos were geo-referenced to an SRTM DEM to investigate the spatial distribution and relation between volcanic centres and tectonic lineaments. The tectonic lineament analysis revealed two distinct directions (NWSE and NNESSW), consistent with tectonic models for the region.A spatial distribution analysis of volcanic vents reveals a strong tectonic control on vent distribution. At Ngozi and Rungwe, there is a narrow NWSE elongated zone of vents passing through the volcano summits and consistent with the effect of a major NWSE buried rift fault intersecting with NNESSW faults. Ngozi and Rungwe both show evidence of destabilizing events likely as a result of tectonic activity. At Kyejo, there is a separate cluster of vents also elongated NWSE but with more scatter. There is also an increased role for secondary control by the Mbaka Fault directed obliquely from the main Kyejo trend. Both RS imagery and field studies have shown that the phonolite dome field in the SW Usangu Basin should not be considered the result of recent RVP activity. Leaving this dome field out of the RVP, the recent volcanic vents are confined to one NWSE elongated fault block bounded by the MbakaMbeya Range and Livingstone Faults."

The pyroclastic rocks present a maximum outcropping thickness of 120 m and are dominated by vitreous lapilli and minor lithic tuffs, the products of active volcanism nearby. About 10% of the tuffs consist of lenses of fine banded tuffs with a high leaf content that were deposited in shallow lakes during quiescent periods between periods of volcanic activity. This tuff sequence is pervasively transformed to clinoptilolite/heulandite and mordenite with variable amounts of plagioclase, minor quartz and smectite. Factors thought to have influenced this conversion to zeolites are a humid climate following deposition combined with a slightly elevated heat flow. Local hydrogeological conditions have modified the cation-hydrogen ion ratios across the study area favoring the formation of clinoptilolite/heulandite and mordenite with medium-minor smectite in the center and south, and a more abundant presence of smectite in the north of the study area.

__label__UNRELATED	"Giant evaporite belts of the Neogene central Andes  Abstract: Large volumes of continental evaporites accumulated within the central Andes during Neogene uplift of the Altiplano-Puna plateau and development of the Andean volcanic arc. Halite and gypsum are dominant minerals, along with local and economically important borates. Play a conditions have existed since ca. 15 Ma; halite and borate deposition has occurred for the past 7 to 8 m.y. Evaporites formed in salar environments (e.g., playa lakes) and are characterized by complex mineral assemblages, occurrence, zonation, and geochemistry. Evaporite deposition was controlled by volcanism, geothermal activity, closed drainage, and climate. These Andean deposits, and their controls, differ from evaporites in other continental and marine environments. INTRODUCTION It is widely known that an extensive continental plateau and volcanic arc developed in the central Andes beginning in the Miocene, caused by subduction of the Nazca plate beneath South America. An unappreciated feature of the central Andes is that vast quantities of nonmarine evaporites accumulated in sedimentary basins in the midst of the Neogene Andean uplift. Neogene basins evolved in close relation to arc construction and plateau uplift. New chronological data, presented here, indicate that playa environments have existed since 15 Ma. Neogene and Quaternary evaporitic basins, which locally exceed 5 km in thickness, are an outstanding illustration of mass transfer within the Andean edifice by chemical and physical means. Volcanism, thermal activity, closed basins, and an arid environment together formed a unique surface and crustal environment that controlled evaporite occurrence and mineral assemblages. GEODYNAMIC SETTING OF THE PUNA PLATEAU The Altiplano-Puna plateau, 3 5 0 0 m in base elevation, dominates the physiography of the central Andes (Isacks, 1988). The Puna forms the southern third of the plateau system. A volcanic arc has been active along the western margin of the Altiplano-Puna from Miocene time to the present (Jordan and Gardeweg, 1989). A plateau-scale, internally drained, hydrologic basin is bounded by the volcanic arc on the west and a tectonic highland on the east. Salt flats cover the interior basins of the plateau, totaling thousands of square kilometres. Together, the volcanoes and salt flats are the most spectacular features of the central Andes (Fig. 1). CONDITIONS THAT FAVOR EVAPORITE ACCUMULATION IN THE PUNA Conditions that led to accumulation of evaporite deposits include characteristics of the surface environment and of magmatic and tectonic Figure 1. Location of study area with respect to coast of Chile, political boundaries, and Neogene volcanic arc of central Andes.

A combination of theoretical reasoning and empirical data indicates that the following elements are of critical importance in Puna evaporite deposition. Closed Basins Hydrologically closed drainages in an arid climate, where evaporation exceeds inflow, form conditions favorable for evaporite deposition (Sonnenfeld, 1984). Within the regional Puna basin, several westnorth west-trending volcanic fingers cross the plateau (Fig. 1) (Salfity et al., 1984; Viramonte et al., 1984a) and divide the plateau into separate basins. These basins are further divided by north-south-trending structural blocks, producing numerous stagnant compartments (Igarzabal, 1982).

Eolian dunes locally close parts of surface drainage systems. Volcanism Volcanic activity plays several roles in establishing a favorable evaporite environment and in controlling evaporite mineral assemblages. Beyond the direct controls described here, volcanism is a source of heat that drives geothermal activity. Mass Transfer. Volcanic flows are weathered and eroded, and the volcanic rock-derived detritus and ions are transported to basins where they mix with other clastic and dissolved components. Ash falls have an important content of adsorbed chemical elements (Coradossi et al., 1984; Viramonte et al., 1984b) that are transferred to brines. The amount of ash-adsorbed chemical elements incorporated into the basins could be very large, considering that one volcanic complex, Galan caldera, erupted 1000 km of material in a single eruptive interval (Fig. 1) (Francis et al., 1983). Ignimbrites of the central Andes have high salt contents; even minor weathering releases salts to the air and to surface waters (Ericksen, 1961; Ericksen and Salas, 1989). Closure of Drainage Basins. As noted above, in the Puna, topographic barriers of volcanic origin contribute to closed drainages. Some Puna basins are completely surrounded and can be considered to be intravolcanic basins. Subsidence. Subsidence mechanisms in the Altiplano-Puna are poorly understood (Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Sebrier et al., 1988) but may involve volcanic activity. In some cases a clear spatial and apparent temporal coincidence exists between subsidence and volcanism, and subsidence may be enhanced in the vicinity of the volcanoes. Arizaro Siete Curvas"
__label__SUPPORT	"Source, genesis, and timing of giant ignimbrite deposits associated with Ethiopian continental flood basalts  Abstract: The Ethiopian continental flood basalt (CFB) province ( 30 Ma, 3 10 km) was formed as the result of the impingement of the Afar mantle plume beneath the Ethiopian lithosphere. This province includes major sequences of rhyolitic ignimbrites generally found on top of the flood basalt sequence. Their volume is estimated to be at least 6 10km, which represents 20% of that of the trap basalts. Their phenocryst assemblage (alkali feldspar, quartz, aegyrine-augite, ilmenite Ti-magnetite, richterite, and eckermanite) suggests temperatures in the range of 740 to 900C. Four units were recognized in the field (Wegel Tena, Jima, Lima Limo, and Debre Birhan areas), each with its own geochemical specificity. Zr/Nb ratios remain constant between basalt and rhyolite in each area, and rhyolites associated with high-Ti or low-Ti basalts are, respectively, enriched or depleted in titanium. Their trace element and isotope (Sr, Nd, O) signatures (high Nd/Nd and low Sr/Sr ratios, compared to those of rhyolites from other CFB provinces) are clearly different from those of typical crustal melts and indicate that the Ethiopian rhyolites are among the most isotopically primitive rhyolites. Their major and trace element patterns suggest that they are likely to be derived from fractional crystallization of basaltic magmas similar in composition to the exposed flood basalts with only limited crustal contribution. Since Ethiopian high-Ti basalts have been shown to form from melting of a mantle plume, it is likely that Ethiopian ignimbrites, at least those that are Ti-rich, also incorporated material from the deep mantle. Rb-Sr isochrons on whole rocks and mineral separates (30.1 0.4 Ma for Wegel Tena and 30.5 0.4 Ma for Jima ignimbrites) show that most of the silicic volcanism occurred within 2 Ma during the Oligocene. Ignimbritic eruptions resumed in the Miocene during two episodes dated at 15.4 0.2 Ma and 8.0 0.2 Ma for the Debre Birhan area. The Rb-Sr isochron ages of ignimbrites (both Oligocene and Miocene rhyolites) are indistinguishable within uncertainties from the Ar/Ar ages of the underlying flood basalts. The Oligocene ignimbrites and the underlying trap basalts are synchronous with a shift in the oxygen composition of foraminifera recorded in Indian and Atlantic Ocean cores. The temporal coincidence of Ethiopian Oligocene volcanism, which released immense volumes of S ( 1.4 10 mol) and Cl (6.4 10 mol) into the atmosphere over a short time span, with the global cooling event at 30.3 Ma suggests that this volcanism might have accelerated the climate change that was already underway.

It is compared with available proxy time series for the same period and with more refined data for more recent years. Contrary to previous speculations, the stratosphere from 1671 to 1881 seems to have been mostly undisturbed volcanically, with only two or three eruptions having injected into it truly significant amounts of aerosol-producing and climate-altering sulfur gases. It is confirmed that the full record for 16712000 shows a marked, though possibly quasiregular, 80 year periodicity in stratospheric aerosol optical depth, which appears also in polar ice-core acidity records and in volcanic eruption frequencies."

__label__UNRELATED	"Holocene vegetation and volcanic activity, Auckland Isthmus, New Zealand  Abstract: A 12 000 to 4000 yr BP pollen and tephra-bearing profile from Auckland, New Zealand, provides insights into the vegetation history and evidence for early Holocene volcanic activity in this area centred on the Mount Wellington basaltic volcano. Possibly 500 yr separated initial scoriaceous ash deposition (ca. 9500 yr ago) and subsequent major lava flows (ca. 9000 yr ago) from Mount Wellington. The local vegetation, topography, and drainage patterns were substantially modified during this time, and damming by the lava flows resulted in the formation of Lake Waiatarua in a shallow valley head ca. 9000 yr ago. Diatom evidence indicates that this N rdo fQwte rMryk ience lake was initially deep (> 5 m) but was shallowing around 4000 yr ago. In contrast to the Mount Wellington eruptions, tephra deposition resulting from distant rhyolitic volcanic activity of the central North Island and Mayor island has had little effect on the Auckland vegetation during this time interval (12 000 4000 yr ago). Between ca. 12 000 and 10 000 yr ago, conifer-angiosperm forest was the predominant vegetation cover on Auckland Isthmus, but during the early Holocene, forest dominated by Metrosideros expanded, probably on to fresh volcanic surfaces resulting from the Mount Wellington eruptions. At this time, swamp forest communities developed in Waiatarua valley basin, and included species indicative of moist, mild, relatively frost-free climates. Some taxa show histories consistent with other records from the northern New Zealand region, including the rise of Ascarina lucida ca. 11 000 to 9000 yr ago, and its subsequent decline, and the expansion of Agathis australis (kauri) forest communities from ca. 6000 yr ago. Taken together the history of local and regional vegetation points to a mild, moist and weakly seasonal early Holocene climate, which subsequently became drier with greater seasonal temperature extremes."
__label__UNRELATED	"unconformity between the Middle Ordovician limestones and the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian clastic sediments in the North  Abstract: Bauxite deposits that lie between Middle Ordovician limestones and Late Carboniferous clastic sediments (known as the G layer bauxites) are widespread throughout the northern part of the North China Craton. The origin of these bauxites has remained uncertain and has been attributed either to alteration of the underlying limestone or to tephra deposited on the limestone erosional surface. We use UPb ages and in situ Hf isotopic analyses of detrital zircons from the G layer bauxite deposits (both by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) to constrain the major source materials of the bauxites. The zircon ages are dominated by Palaeozoic ages, especially Carboniferous to Early Permian (338291 Ma), coeval with the Palaeozoic subduction-related volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift on the northern margin of the North China Craton. Zircon Hf(t) values range from 2.2 to 24.5 and are dominated by negative values, similar to those of Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift, but distinct from those of Palaeozoic magmatic rocks in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt with positive Hf(t) values. Thus, we argue that the bauxites were derived mainly from volcanic dust produced during the Palaeozoic, particularly in the Carboniferous to Early Permian (338291 Ma), by volcanism in the Inner Mongolia Palaeo-Uplift along the northern margin of the North China Craton, rather than in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt to the north. The underlying Middle Ordovician limestones, however, had provided only minor, if any, source materials for the bauxites. research-articleResearch ArticleXXX10.1144/jgs2013-074J.

__label__UNRELATED	"CLAY MINERALOGY ACROSS THE P-T BOUNDARY OF THE XIAKOU SECTION, CHINA: EVIDENCE OF CLAY PROVENANCE AND ENVIRONMENT  Abstract: The provenance of clays in shaley intervals across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) in the Xiakou section was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results suggest that the layers have three different provenances. The layer P267-b has a loose texture with an oriented arrangement of detrital clay particles, consisting mainly of illite and minor chlorite with irregular outlines or ragged edges. The dehydroxylation reaction of the clays in this layer is characterized by an intense overlapping endothermic effect at ~600oC, produced by mixed-layer illite-smectite (I-S) consisting of a mixture of cis-vacant (cv) and trans-vacant (tv) octahedral sheets derived from weathering of detrital illite. Layer P259-b shows a more condensed texture with a dark color, and is composed mainly of I-S and minor illite and chlorite. Evidence for alteration of detrital materials to clay mineral aggregates was observed under SEM. Similar to layer P267-b, an intense dehydroxylation reaction occurs at ~600oC, indicating clays consisting of a mixture of tv and cv sheets and, therefore, that the sediments were derived from a mixture of terrigenous and volcanic sources, combining the texture and the clay-mineral composition of those sediments. However, the undisturbed lamination and relatively small grain size in this bed indicate a low-energy depositional environment. The clay-mineral compositions of the other layers are mainly of I-S with minor amounts of illite and chlorite. Their endothermic dehydroxylation reaction, however, occurs mainly at ~660oC, indicating that cv sheets are dominant in the clays, and thus, are derived from smectites of volcanic origin. Observations by SEM show that clay minerals grow at the expense of detrital materials, confirming the diagenetic alteration of volcanic ashes in marine sediments. Illite and chlorite are the detrital clay minerals in the clay layers across the PTB in the Xiakou section. The presence of detrital illite and chlorite in the sediments means that an arid climate prevailed in the region during the end-Permian and early Triassic period.

__label__UNRELATED	"Reconstructing Late Ordovician carbon cycle variations  Abstract: The role of carbon dioxide in regulating climate during the early Paleozoic, when severe glaciations occurred during a putative greenhouse world, remains unclear. Here, we present the first molecular carbon isotope proxy-based estimates for Late Ordovician (early Katian) pCO2 levels, and explore the limitations of applying this approach to the reconstruction of Paleozoic pCO2. Carbon isotope profiles from three sites in Laurentia (Iowa, Ontario and Pennsylvania) and one site in Baltica (Estonia) exhibit overall low isotope fractionation between organic and inorganic carbon during photosynthesis (ep) and these values declined during the early Katian carbonate carbon isotope excursion (or Guttenberg Carbon Isotope Excursion, GICE). Algal ep values are sensitive to changes in CO2 concentrations, algae cell morphologies, and cell growth rates. To constrain these factors, we present molecular evidence that a decrease in the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and a change in the eukaryotic algae community co-occurred with the GICE. Regardless of local biotic or oceanographic influences, a decline in ep values indicates photosynthesis was sensitive to carbon concentrations, and via analogy with modern taxa, constrains pCO2 to below 8 pre-industrial levels (PIL), or about half of previous estimates. In addition, the global, positive carbon isotope excursions expressed in a wide variety of sedimentary materials (carbonate, bulk organic matter, n-alkanes, acyclic and cyclic isoprenoid hydrocarbons), provide compelling evidence for perturbation of the global carbon cycle, and this was likely associated with a decrease in pCO2 approximately 10 million years prior to the Hirnantian glaciations. Isotopic records from deeper water settings suggest a complex interplay of carbon sources and sinks, with pCO2 increasing prior to and during the early stages of the GICE and then decreasing when organic carbon burial outpaced increased volcanic inputs. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 5. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed new isotopic and biomarker records for the GICE, a major biotic event and carbon cycle perturbation, from which we have constrained pCO2 and reconstructed global carbon cycle changes. Our results confirm that global carbon-cycle reconstructions are complicated by ecological and environmental changes during the GICE. Absolute CO2 reconstructions are hindered by these paleoenvironmental changes, as well as by insufficient isotopic characterization of algal lineages dominant in Ordovician seas. Using biomarkers, we suggest an approach for applying carbon isotopic data to reconstruct Paleozoic climate and carbon cycling. First, bulk organic matter d13C records should be supplemented with compound-specific isotope records where possible. Our focus in this study has been the organic component of D13C records and future work will benefit from similar scrutiny of the inorganic component (e.g. Ludvigson et al., 1996). Second, biomarker assemblages can provide evidence for ecological change that could affect photoautotroph d13C values. Third, lithologic indicators can be used to constrain oceanographic conditions that influence phytoplankton productivity and ocean carbon chemistry. Such conditions include the influence of temperature, productivity and upwelling on the exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and ocean, and the resulting disequilibrium that is especially important in the marginal settings that dominate the preserved record of Paleozoic rocks. Finally, we emphasize that globally diverse carbon isotopic records are needed if global interpretations are to be made.Applying this approach, we confirmed that Late Katian ep values were lower and more dynamic at multiple and oceanographically diverse sites than expected for a high pCO2 world. Our observations suggest that Ordovician pCO2 levels were likely below 8 PIL. Although great caution accompanies our proposed quantitative pCO2 constraint, we suggest our records provide more robust insights to relative pCO2 changes because environmental and ecological factors have been partially precluded. Based on that, we infer the following sequence of events during the Katian: (1) possible volcanism-induced pCO2 rise as indicated by a D13C increase; (2) ocean warming; (3) increased productivity, expanded ocean anoxia and increased carbon burial, manifesting as the GICE; and (4) subsequent pCO2 decrease that apparently lags the GICE onset and (5) possible cooling. This sequence is similar to that observed during Mesozoic OAEs (e.g. Jenkyns, 2010; van Bentum et al., 2012) and suggests that the punctuated occurrence of OAEs during extended greenhouse climate intervals has been a characteristic of the Earths climate for nearly the past 500 million years. In fact, the similarity of those records suggests a mechanistic link: warming and/or sea level rise during the GICE apparently was associated with increased or reorganized nutrient inputs in the ocean (Patzkowsky and Holland, 1996, 1997), and, as has been invoked for Cretaceous OAEs (Kuypers et al., 2002; Jenkyns, 2010; Monteiro et al., 2012), this could have induced the productivity increase that brought about a major global carbon isotope excursion."

We utilize an energy balance model to estimate that as much as 18-34% of low frequency temperature change over the preanthropogenic interval could be forced by volcanism and solar variability. Comparison of residuals with estimates of unforced variability from control runs of coupled models indicates that the spectra of the two time series agree at the 90% significance level.
__label__UNRELATED	"River dissolved and solid loads in the Lesser Antilles: New insight into basalt weathering processes  Abstract: We present here the first available estimations of chemical weathering and associated atmospheric CO2 consumption rates as well as mechanical erosion rate for the Lesser Antilles. The chemical weathering (100120 t/km/year) and CO2 consumption (1.1 1.4 10 mol/km/year) rates are calculated after subtraction of the atmospheric and hydrothermal inputs in the chemical composition of the river dissolved loads. These rates thus reflect only the low-temperature basalt weathering. Mechanical erosion rates (approx. 8004000 t/km/year) are estimated by a geochemical mass balance between the dissolved and solid loads and mean unaltered rock. The calculated chemical weathering rates and associated atmospheric CO2 consumption rates are among the highest values worldwide but are still lower than those of other tropical volcanic islands and do not fit with the HCO3 concentration vs. 1/ T correlation proposed by Dessert et al. (2001). The thick soils and explosive volcanism context of the Lesser Antilles are the two possible keys to this different weathering behaviour; the development of thick soils limits the chemical weathering and the presence of very porous pyroclastic flows allows an important water infiltration and thus subsurface weathering mechanisms, which are less effective for atmospheric CO2 consumption. D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusion: We have presented here the first available estimations of chemical weathering and associated atmospheric CO2 consumption rates as well as mechanical erosion rate for Lesser Antilles. Values are among the highest values worldwide but are still lower than those for other tropical volcanic islands. From the extended REE patterns of river solid loads, we infer a relatively low degree of alteration of the transported sediments and trace the origin of the finer suspended particles in the soils.Our data on river dissolved loads reflect a mixing of end-members such as atmosphere and thermal spring, their contribution is then corrected to constrain river composition. It appears that each island has a complex composition with several thermal spring end-members depending on SO4 2 , Cl and Li concentration. Rivers with high TDS show high values of SO4 2 , which means that thermal springs contribution, cannot be neglected.Lesser Antilles rivers present a torrential dynamics, which induce high physical erosion, they are also characterised by the development of thick soils which limits the chemical weathering. The explosive volcanism context of the Lesser Antilles induces pyroclastic formations that favour high water infiltration and, thus, subsurface weathering mechanisms, which are less effective for atmospheric CO2 consumption. Those facts may explain that Martinique and Guadeloupe do not follow the law proposed by Dessert et al. (2001)."
__label__UNRELATED	"The stability of climate on Venus  Abstract: The climate of Venus is to a large degree controlled by the radiative properties of its massive atmosphere. However, volcanic outgassing and surface-atmosphere interactions may moderate the atmospheric abundances ofCO 2 and other radiatively important volatiles. Recently, work on the interpretation of the impact crateting record has placed limits on the magnitude of the volcanic flux. Additionally, recent laboratory data on the equilibria and kinetics of possible surface-atmosphere actions under Venus-like conditions provide important insights into the role that they may play in moderating Venus' climate. The surface temperature and pressure on Venus coincide approximately with the P-T equilibrium of the calcite-wollastonite mineral reaction, and atmospheric sulfur species are probably involved in rapid heterogeneous reactions with the surface. Perturbations to the atmospheric inventory of radiatively active species may have a significant impact on the climate of Venus and upon the stability of the greenhouse ffect. Through the use of a Venus climate model that couples atmospheric radiative-convective equilibrium with surface processes, we show that it is likely that Venus' climate is at or near a state of unstable quilibrium. Furthermore, we show that only moderate perturbations in the abundances of radiatively active volatiles may be sufficient to precipitate changes to new climate regimes."

The response is expressed through the adjustment, modulation or triggering of a broad range of surface and crustal phenomena, including volcanic and seismic activity, submarine and subaerial landslides, tsunamis and landslide splash waves, glacial outburst and rock-dam failure floods, debris flows and gas-hydrate destabilization. In relation to anthropogenic climate change, modelling studies and projection of current trends point towards increased risk in relation to a spectrum of geological and geomorphological hazards in a warmer world, while observations suggest that the ongoing rise in global average temperatures may already be eliciting a hazardous response from the geosphere. Here, the potential influences of anthropogenic warming are reviewed in relation to an array of geological and geomorphological hazards across a range of environmental settings. A programme of focused research is advocated in order to: (i) understand better those mechanisms by which contemporary climate change may drive hazardous geological and geomorphological activity; (ii) delineate those parts of the world that are most susceptible; and (iii) provide a more robust appreciation of potential impacts for society and infrastructure. 5. Conclusions: Evidence from the study of periods of exceptional climate change, together with contemporary observations, supports a robust link between changing climatic conditions and a broad portfolio of potentially hazardous geological and geomorphological processes. Modelling studies and the projection of current trends argue for elevated levels of a range of geological and geomorphological hazards in a warmer world, while viable physical mechanisms capable of eliciting a geospheric reaction in response to small changes in environmental conditions are well established. Questions remain, however, most particularly in relation to the time scales over which a geospheric response may be detectable. Although increases in the incidence of climate-change-driven, large-volume rock and ice avalanches (Huggel et al. 2008, 2010; Huggel 2009), and the suggested modulationPhil. Trans. R. Soc. A (2010)of seismicity in areas of large-scale ice wastage (Sauber & Molnia 2004; Sauber & Ruppert 2008), lead to speculation that climate change is already drawing out a crustal response, no increase in the global incidence of either volcanic activity or seismicity has been identified to date, nor has any change in the stability of submarine slopes been detected. It may be the case that modulation of potentially hazardous geological and geomorphological processes due to anthropogenic climate change proves to be too small a signal to extract from the background noise of normal geophysical activity, at least in the short to medium term.Furthermore, there are few constraints on the timing of a geospheric response, which may well lag significantly behind the warming trend. With respect to ice wastage in Greenland and Antarctica, Turpeinan et al. (2008) and Hampel et al. (2010) suggest that enhanced seismicity may be important on time scales as short as 10100 years. A comparable time scale has been proposed (Gruber et al. 2004; Harris et al. 2009) in relation to the formation of large, deep-rooted, landslides following temperature rise and permafrost thaw in mountain regions. With respect to increased levels of melt production in the mantle beneath Icelands Vatnajokull ice cap, Sigmundsson et al. (2010) speculate that it could take centuries or longer for fresh magma to reach the surface. There is also considerable uncertainty in relation to the linearity of possible responses, with different elements of the geosphere responding, for example, in a nonlinear manner, with thresholds or tipping points resulting in step-like increases in frequency or scale.In order to improve knowledge and reduce uncertainty, a programme of focused research is advocated so as to understand better those mechanisms by which contemporary climate change may drive hazardous geological and geomorphological activity, to delineate those parts of the world that are most susceptible, and to provide a more robust appreciation of potential impacts for society and infrastructure. More specifically, there is a need to: (i) better establish potential correlations in the geological (particularly the Quaternary) record, between climate change and significant hazardous events such as large submarine landslides, major volcanic eruptions and ocean island collapses; (ii) promote the application of modelling techniques so as to investigate, and more accurately portray, the influences of changing environmental conditions such as ice-mass wastage and ocean loading on potentially hazardous geophysical systems; and (iii) encourage monitoring of specific locations perceived already to be demonstrating a climate-change response or that are deemed sensitive enough to do so in the short to medium term. The IPCC is also strongly exhorted to address more explicitly, in future assessments, the impact of anthropogenic climate change on the geosphere, together with its manifold potentially hazardous consequences.Among a number of colleagues and others whose thoughts and suggestions have helped to improve this paper considerably from earlier versions, Dave Tappin is particularly acknowledged."

Carlson 6. Conclusions: 40Ar/39Ar ages presented from the Noril'sk, Tunguska, Taimyr, Kuznetsk, and Vorkuta areas, combined with previous published data,demonstrate that volcanic activity in Siberia covered an area of up to 5 million km2 at 250 Ma (in ArAr years). Our data support previous correlations, and links volcanic units which are over 1000 km apart. Enhanced error estimates provide strong evidence for a short duration of the main-stage volcanic activity at Noril'sk and the wider Siberian Traps province. The main stage volcanism of this province partially predates and is synchronous with the end-Permian extinction. Including Meishan ash Bed 28 sanidine samples, previously studied for zircons, not only has enabled a direct comparison between 40Ar/ 39Ar age of the Traps and the PermoTriassic boundary section, but it also allowed bracketing the timing of deposition between tuff Beds 25 and28 to0.580.21Ma. From thedata presentedwe infer that Siberian Traps volcanismwas responsible for the climatic changes at the end of the Permian. Borehole samples near Chelyabinsk are clearly Triassic in age indicating that volcanism in Siberia occurred in at least two stages.Based on ages obtained from Kuznetsk and Vorkuta, we suggest that the location of the PermoTriassic boundary in these areas (and possibly other terrigenous sections), where the criteria for the boundary include lithostratigraphy, may need to be revised."
__label__UNRELATED	"Rift-basin sedimentation: responses to climate, tectonism and volcanism. Examples of the East African Rift  Abstract: Rift-basin sedimentation appears to be closely related to the influence of phenomena such tectonics, volcanism, and climate. The continent-scale structure of the East African Rift offers numerous examples of sediment types, sedimentary bodies or sedimentary environments showing clearly their dependence on these phenomena. Thus the distribution and the longevity of the troughs which compose the rift depend directly on tectonics and volcanic activity. Evolution of these troughs towards sedimentary basins is related to the permanence of the tectonic depression thus authorizing the deposition of a sedimentary sequence. Examples from the Afar Depression or the Gregory Rift show clearly cases of interruptions or removals of sedimentation related to the migration of axes of tectonic activity. Looking at sedimentary formations of Recent age in the East African Rift, it appears that the variety of tectonic, volcanic and climatic conditions along the 4000 krn of horsts and grabens influences the sedimentation which can be in the form of clastic, organic, evaporitic or metalliferous deposits. Such facies are associated to form sedimentary bodies or environments such as piedmont accumulations, alluvial fans and fan deltas, fluvio-deltaic systems, and lacnsu'ine basins. Examples of Recem to Modern environments have been chosen in the Eastern and Western Branches of the East African Rift, Afar Depression, Ethiopian and Gregory Rifts, Kivu Trough, Tanganyika and Malawi Troughs. They clearly illustrate the close correlations existing between sedimentation, tectonics, volcanism and climate at different scales of time and space in such a complicated structure as the East African Rift.

__label__UNRELATED	"Last glacial tephra layers in the Talos Dome ice core (peripheral East Antarctic Plateau), with implications for chronostratigraphic correlations and regional volcanic history  Abstract: Tephra isochrons offer considerable potential for correlating diverse palaeoarchives and highlighting regional climatic differences. They are especially useful when applied to polar ice records encompassing the last glacial, as these clearly portray the pronounced millennial-scale climate variability that characterised this period. Here we present the continuous record of primary fallout tephra layers in the East Antarctic Talos Dome ice core (72 490S, 159 110E), developed upon examination of the core sections spanning the glacial period 16.5 to 71 ka. A total of ca. 45 discrete tephra deposits precisely positioned stratigraphically relative to the temperature record for the core and dated using the AICC2012 timescale, were identified. Quantitative grain size, particle morphology, major and trace element composition using Coulter Counter, SEM, EPMA-WDS, and LA-ICP-MS analytical methods were studied as diagnostic features for tephra characterisation. The tephrostratigraphic framework provides a reference for future precise comparison between ice and sediment sequences across the Antarctic continent. Indeed, several potential markers characterised by distinct volcanic glass geochemistry and/or particular stratigraphic location (e.g., a 17.6-ka ash layer deposited during the well-known major acidity event) are now available for the direct linkage of palaeoclimatic archives. The Talos Dome tephra sequence, dominated by middistal pyroclastic products from the nearby Northern Victoria Land volcanoes, also represents the most comprehensive and best time-constrained record of regional Antarctic volcanism yet developed. It documents nearly continuous sustained explosive activity during the considered time interval and, combined with previous ice-core tephra results for the last and the current interglacial periods, suggests progressive compositional shift through time. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__UNRELATED	"Milankovitch frequencies in tephra records at volcanic arcs: The relation of kyr-scale cyclic variations in volcanism to global climate changes  Abstract: The increase in volcanic activity after the last glacial maximum observed on Iceland has led to one of the most fascinating hypothesis in science in the last decades: that deglaciation may force volcanism. Consequently, tephrostratigraphic records of sufficient length that cover multiple glacial cycles have been used to test whether such relationships hold systematically through the Quaternary. Here we review such tephra records that have been linked with climate proxy records such as d18O in marine sediments, which is a measure of sea-level change and which is thought to be orbitally forced, as it exhibits the characteristic Milankovitch periodicities of precession (~23 kyr), obliquity (~41 kyr) and eccentricity 4. Conclusions: The four re-analyzed tephra records cover a wide range in geographic latitudes and include oceanic and continental settings, as well as glaciated and non-glaciated regions. Three records represent regional volcanic sources, and one record is a semi-global compilation. Yet our analysis of the data in the frequency domain demonstrated that all contain the ~40 kyr and ~100 kyr periodicities that also dominate the d18O spectrum. The frequency spectra of the tephra and d18O records are significantly correlated. This observation supports the hypothesis that orbital-driven global climate changes interact with the volcanic eruption frequency regionally and globally.In order to investigate the relative timing or synchronicity of volcanic and climate events, analysis in the time domain needs to be performed as was done in previous studies (Jellinek et al., 2004; Nowell et al., 2006; Kutterolf et al., 2013). However, the simultaneous analysis of the four best-characterized tephra records showsthat correlations suffer from a number of uncertainties and results should be used with caution. For example, Jellinek et al. (2004) determined different time lags when correlating silicic (3.2 4.2 kyr) and basaltic (11.2 2.3 kyr) tephra records separately with the SPECMAP climate record (in fact, they correlated the first derivatives). But are these different time lags the results of different physical processes or of the different nature of the two data sets? Jellinek et al. (2004), Nowell et al. (2006), Kutterolf et al. (2013) and Schindlbeck et al. (2018) consistently obtained time lags that place the peak in volcanism in the deglaciation period. The observations from Iceland and Alaska for volcanism since the last glacial maximum (Fig. 3) combined with physical modeling results (e.g., Jull and McKenzie, 1996; Schmidt et al., 2013; Albino et al., 2010) support such timing as plausible. However, considering the uncertainties discussed above, can the time lags really be determined with such precision to hit the deglaciation periods which typically last about 20 kyr for the 100 kyr cycles and are much shorter for the 41 kyr cycles? Moreover, most volcanoes that contributed to the K13 and Sch18 tephra records lie well outside glaciated regions. Is it plausible that volcanism increases at low latitudes where the rising sea-level increases the lithospheric pressurewhile at the same time high latitude volcanism increases presumably as consequence of the decreasing lithospheric load as glaciers melt?Most likely volcanic reactions to global climate changes are modulated by geotectonic setting, regional geologic conditions, and geographic position but with the presently available abundance and quality of the tephra and age records and the associated uncertainties in the time domain analyses it is not yet possible to disentangle these various influences. Therefore more precise tephra time series (preservation and age optimized) from different regions (glaciated versus non-glaciated) and geological settings (island arcs, continental arcs, intraplate) are needed together with standardized statistical analysis to decipher the impact of these factors on a global perspective of how climate may control volcanism. Disentangling these influences will also provide better understanding of the physical processes that regulate the feedback between global and regional volcanism and climate changes."
__label__SUPPORT	"Volcanic ash as a driver of enhanced organic carbon burial in the Cretaceous  Abstract: On greater than million year timescales, carbon in the ocean-atmosphere-biosphere system is controlled by geologic inputs of CO2 through volcanic and metamorphic degassing. High atmospheric CO2 and warm climates in the Cretaceous have been attributed to enhanced volcanic emissions of CO2 through more rapid spreading at mid-ocean ridges and, in particular, to a global flare-up in continental arc volcanism. Here, we show that global flare-ups in continental arc magmatism also enhance the global flux of nutrients into the ocean through production of windblown ash. We show that up to 75% of Si, Fe and P is leached from windblown ash during and shortly after deposition, with soluble Si, Fe and P inputs from ash alone in the Cretaceous being higher than the combined input of dust and rivers today. Ash-derived nutrient inputs may have increased the efficiency of biological productivity and organic carbon preservation in the Cretaceous, possibly explaining why the carbon isotopic signature of Cretaceous seawater was high. Variations in volcanic activity, particularly continental arcs, have the potential of profoundly altering carbon cycling at the Earths surface by increasing inputs of CO2 and ash-borne nutrients, which together enhance biological productivity and burial of organic carbon, generating an abundance of hydrocarbon source rocks."
__label__UNRELATED	"The ZiwayShala lake basin (main Ethiopian rift, Ethiopia): a revision of basin evolution with special reference to the Late Quaternary  Abstract: The ZiwayShala basin, in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), is a reference site for regional to global paleoclimatic reconstructions. We undertook and interpreted a stratigraphical, pedological and geomorphological study, including a new geological map scale 1:250,000, to provide a Late Quaternary-centred revised geological history of the basin. 1 We mapped several Late Quaternary sedimentary units and arranged them in four major unconformity-bounded stratigraphic units (synthems), recording equivalent phases of geomorphic change. A new, extensive, soil survey allowed us to establish a pedostratigraphic unit, the T ora geosol, as a distinctive marker of landscape stability and instability in the area during the Holocene. Climate change was a major control on geo-morphologic evolution of this area during the intense climate fluctuations of the last 100,000 years. Extensive lake systems developed during relatively humid Last Glacial interstadials and in the early-mid Holocene; this last was characterized by short, but high-amplitude, regressions during arid pulses. Major lakes lowering occurred in the terminal Pleistocene and in the last 5000 years. Evidences for high or very high terminal Pleistocene lake levels suggest possible nonclimatic controls on changes in lakes extension and volumes between Late Pleistocene and Holocene. We suggest that modifications of hydrological thresholds, due to activity of structures parallel and transversal to the MER, established new lakes boundaries between terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, setting the maximum level of Holocene lake systems at about 1670 m a.s.l. The integrated analysis of lacustrine, fluvial, slope and soil systems provided a basis for a general interpretation of relations between climatic changes and geomorphic processes at a basin scale. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: The main results of this study concern the general geology of the central part of the MER and the revision of the Late Quaternary framework, making this Region one of the reference sites for paleoclimate research in the tropics. The general geology is illustrated by a new geological map depicting basement, Mesozoic rocks and Early Tertiary to Holocene volcanic and sedimentary units. The map is mainly devoted to the Late Quaternary deposits, as they record a complex story of environmental change related to climatic and volcano tectonic events (Fig. 15).The revision and reinterpretation of morphological, stratigraphical and pedological evidence of Late Quaternary environmental change in the ZiwayShala basin produced the following results:(1) The stratigraphic, morphologic and pedological record of lake fluctuations, supported by radiocarbondating, defines a coherent chrono-morpho-stratigraphic framework of the main steps in environmental change in the study area between late Pleistocene and Holocene. This is represented by four unconformity-bounded units, formed during late Pleistocene (last glacial, Synthem 1), latest Pleistocene (Synthem 2), early-mid Holocene (Synthem 3) and late Holocene (Synthem 4).(2) An extensive soil survey provided bases for a better understanding of the geomorphic processes and slope dynamics accompanying hydrological changes in the lake basin. The T ora geosol and other Luvisols were recognized at a regional scale as indicators of geomorphic stability under moister than present climate conditions. The early-mid Holocene soils are clearly separated, in terms of pedogenesis, from the late Holocene soils. The latter reflect a climate significantly drier than that dominating during the early-mid Holocene.(3) The integrated analysis confirmed the picture of environmental change as mainly driven by climate change. Late Quaternary tectonism and volcanism in the MER modulated such a climatic control, by forcing geometric changes in the basin and determining a significant variation in its extension, from the late Pleistocene Megalake system to the early-mid Holocene Macrolake system."
__label__SUPPORT	"Volcanoes and ENSO over the Past Millennium  Abstract: The controversial claim that El Nino events might be partially caused by radiative forcing due to volcanic aerosols is reassessed. Building on the work of Mann et al., estimates of volcanic forcing over the past millennium and a climate model of intermediate complexity are used to draw a diagram of El Nino likelihood as a function of the intensity of volcanic forcing. It is shown that in the context of this model, only eruptions larger than that of Mt. Pinatubo (1991, peak dimming of about 3.7 W m ) can shift the likelihood and amplitude of an El Nino event above the level of the models internal variability. Explosive volcanism cannot be said to trigger El Nino events per se, but it is found to raise their likelihood by 50% on average, also favoring higher amplitudes. This reconciles, on one hand, the demonstration by Adams et al. of a statistical relationship between explosive volcanism and El Nino and, on the other hand, the ability to predict El Nino events of the last 148 yr without knowledge of volcanic forcing. The authors then focus on the strongest eruption of the millennium (A.D. 1258), and show that it is likely to have favored the occurrence of a moderate-to-strong El Nino event in the midst of prevailing La Ninalike conditions induced by increased solar activity during the well-documented Medieval Climate Anomaly. Compiling paleoclimate data from a wide array of sources, a number of important hydroclimatic consequences for neighboring areas is documented. The authors propose, in particular, that the event briefly interrupted a solar-induced megadrought in the southwestern United States. Most of the time, however, volcanic eruptions are found to be too small to significantly affect ENSO statistics."
__label__UNRELATED	"PRESERVATION POTENTIAL OF ULTRABASIC VOLCANIC SAND IN AN ARID INTRACONTINENTAL SETHNG: WILL THE HOPI BUTFES MAAR-DIATREME FIELD BE PRESERVED IN THE ROCK RECORD?  Abstract: Ansraxcr: Petrographic study of modem sand samples collected near Hopi Buttes volcanic field (northeastern Arizona) underscores the low preservation potential of mafic minerals and altrabasic volcanic detritus even in an arid, intraplate tectonic setting. The Miocene-Pliocene Hopi Buttes volcanic field has been interpreted as a mar-diatreme and scotia cone field in which phreatomgmatic ernpfions took place in a playa lake basin. The tephra, necks, dikes, flows, and mar crater fill are now sources of sediment found in local ephemeral streams. Once the volcanic field is eroded away, the main record of its existence will be as a provenance component in the sand it is now shedding. The locally derived volcanic components include monocrystalline pyroxene, glass shards, scoria,, and a narrow range of ultrabasic volcanic rock fragments. Thin-sectlon point counts (450 grains) on four sieved sand fractions from each of 7 sites downstream (0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 21, and 31 kin) from one margin oftbe volcanic field provided the following results. (1) The proportion of volcanogenic to total sand grains decreases from an initial value of about 40% at a rate of about 0.8% per kilometer downstream from the source rocks over the first 30 km of stream length. (2) Dilution by sand eroded from other local source rocks, rather than physical grain-size reduction or chemical dissolution, drives the diminution of voicanogenic grain proportions. Detritus sourced from the Hopi Buttes volcanic field has a very low preservation/recognitian potential, despite the arid climate and stable t~tonic setting far removed from a plate margin. It follows that mar-diatreme volcanism is generally underrepresented in the sedimentary record."
__label__UNRELATED	"Phanerozoic evolution of plants on the African plate  Abstract: The Phanerozoic has witnessed major changes, with Africa being an integral part of supercontinental landmass agglomeration forming Gondwana, its amalgamation with smaller landmasses to form Pangaea, and later disintegrating to form the existing continents. At the same time climates, atmosphere, oceanic circulation and tectonic plates shifted. During this upheaval, life was evolving and organisms were adapting and with higher diversity came more ecological interactions, creating more habitats and thus influencing more biological radiation. Plants became more complex, developing from unicellular to multicellular organisms. Moving from water onto land, plants had to cope with desiccation, and features evolved enabling them to do this. Patterns of Phanerozoic plant evolution are strongly driven by major changes in the physical environment, most notably continental drift, climate change and bolide impacts, precipitating massive volcanism and other effects leading to mass global extinctions. The products of this evolution were early land plants during Silurian and Devonian times. Subjected to extinction events and environmental changes, these early plants gave rise to the pteridophytes reaching their diversity peak during the Carboniferous and Permian. After the demise of the pteridophytes, the gymnosperms dominated during the Triassic and Jurassic, followed by the emergence of the angiosperms in the Cretaceous. This melange of factors has produced the present plant diversity on earth, which we will examine in context of the African flora. Plant diversification in Gondwana and Laurasia will be covered focussing on Africa, while factors affecting the vegetation and species composition of the present flora will be discussed. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__UNRELATED	"Martian cratering 11. Utilizing decameter scale crater populations to study Martian history  Abstract: New information has been obtained in recent years regarding formation rates and the production size-frequency distribution (PSFD) of decameter-scale primary Martian craters formed during recent orbiter missions. Here we compare the PSFD of the currently forming small primaries (P) with new data on the PSFD of the total small crater population that includes primaries and field secondaries (P + fS), which represents an average over longer time periods. The two data sets, if used in a combined manner, have extraordinary potential for clarifying not only the evolutionary history and resurfacing episodes of small Martian geological formations (as small as one or few km) but also possible episodes of recent climatic change. In response to recent discussions of statistical methodologies, we point out that crater counts do not produce idealized statistics, and that inherent uncertainties limit improvements that can be made by more sophisticated statistical analyses. We propose three mutually supportive procedures for interpreting crater counts of small craters in this context. Applications of these procedures support suggestions that topographic features in upper meters of mid-latitude ice-rich areas date only from the last few periods of extreme Martian obliquity, and associated predicted climate excursions. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The discovery of small new primary craters (D 4 m to 45 m) offers valuable opportunities for understanding the history of Martian geologic processes and climate variations in the last millions of years, and for attempting to separate the effects of primary and secondary craters. 2. A new, 2016 iteration isochron diagram template is offered, showing our current best-estimate PSFD curves down to D = 1 m, and other features. 3. The difference between this PSFD and the SFD of new primary craters may be attributed to the contribution of field secondaries. 4. Improved statistical methods have limited promise for improving crater chronometry of Mars. This is because the underlying built-in uncertainties in reading absolute ages from crater SFD data are significantly larger than the prospective improvements offered by adjusting statistical techniques applied to crater counts. 5. Many areas of Mars have complex histories of erosion, deposition, exhumation, etc., which make log-incremental plots of crater SFDs more useful than cumulative plots because the log-incremental plots show exactly the number state of craters surviving in each D bin, thus measuring topography survival effects at each size scale without influence from larger scale features. 6. Three procedures are suggested for analyzing counts of small craters in many Martian regions. (1) Crater counts at decameter scales can be combined with latest measurements of the P production rate ofprimary craters (e.g., Daubar et al. 2013) to give upper limits to the ages of small Martian features. (2) These ages should be compared with current best-estimate isochron-based crater retention ages, which involve counts of primaries plus field secondaries (P + fS). These should take into account a wide range in D by being applied to each diameter bin. These ages are typically several times lower than the independent (P-based) upper limit ages. With good fits to SFDs, the derived ages may indicate formation times of broad geologic formations; in cases involving the Opik effect, they reflect survival times of topography as a function of vertical relief. (3) These counts should be done first for sharp, bowl-shaped craters and then totaled with remaining degraded craters. Comparisons of results among the three procedures should be made in each diameter bin independently, because survival times and geologic histories at different scales are size-dependent. 7. Our suggested techniques suggest that decameterscale, near-surface layers of some Martian regions (exemplified by Greg crater, at 38 S) are correlated with climatic episodes of ice deposition, most likely caused by high-obliquity excursions within the last 5 to 20 Myr. 8. As more statistics on new, dated impact craters accumulate over the coming years, prospects are good for a growing understanding of the geologic and geophysical recent history of Mars and its surface layers at human scales (meters and decameters) by utilizing accumulating data about formation of small craters.AcknowledgmentsWKH thanks the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern, Switzerland, for supporting various stages of this work.

__label__UNRELATED	"Photogeologic mapping and the geologic history of the Hellas basin floor, Mars  7. Conclusions: On the basis of our observations, we conclude the following:(1) The early history of the Hellas basin (>3.8 Ga) experienced extended periods of fluvial and possibly lacustrine activity. While clear evidence for a basin-wide body of water and/ or ice is absent, morphologic observations along the northern rim indicate low-energy river environments. (2) The majority of the Hellas basin infill ( 1.51.7 106 km3) appears to consist of volcanic material emplaced as two distinct sequences ( 3.8 and 3.7 Ga). Crustal shortening by a compressive stress field occurred soon after their formation. With Malea and Tyrrhena Paterae being suitable sources (overlapping AMAs), we suggest that the older sequence covered the entire basin floor. Hadriaca and Amphitrites Paterae are suitable sources for the younger sequence (overlapping AMAs), which covered only the western half of the basin floor. (3) Intermittent and contemporaneous units in the basin center and along the southern/southeastern rim, probably of glacio-fluvial origin, suggest huge volumes of material were deposited simultaneously and/or shortly after the volcanic episodes. An apparent phase of increased erosion and deposition 3.7 Ga ago is also in agreement with Halevy and Head (2014), who proposed that outgassing by a maximum in global volcanism at that time caused warmer episodes enabling repeated subaerial water run-off. Thus, Hellas Planitia and its surroundings are a key location to observe the influence of volcanic activity on the martian climate. (4) Our observations are in good agreement with a previous wind circulation model (Howard et al., 2012). We suggest that persistent, katabatic winds capable of triggering saltation and, thus, abrasion, carved out the Hellas Planitia trough including Peneus Palus (containing the deepest point on Mars) within few 100s of Ma, probably during the Amazonian. A somewhat shallower, but similarly shaped, basinscale topographic low can also be observed in the west southwestern Argyre basin and could, thus, potentially be of the same origin. In the Hellas basin, we propose that the removed material was re-deposited closer to its center, where the model predicts lower wind speeds. Coverage by 100s of meters of such airfall deposits might also explain the apparent absence of landforms formed by a putative basin-wide glaciation and/or sea potentially associated with the central deposits. (5) The nature of the honeycomb terrain remains ambiguous, although our observations are in agreement with an interpretation as an older (>3.8 Ga) landscape that was formed by ductile deformation of some sort, and exhumed by persistent winds in the Amazonian as part of the Hellas Planitia trough formation. However, we cannot constrain the original formation age of the honeycomb terrain, as its contacts reveal only little concise stratigraphic information. Furthermore, we found that the reticulate and banded terrains, which were previously associated or equated with the honeycomb terrain (Moore andWilhelms, 2001, 2007; Kite et al., 2009), are morphologically distinct units. The banded terrain appears to superpose parts of the other two terrains, but also occurs elsewhere in the basin, predominantly along the wind-carved Hellas Planitia trough. Similar landforms in the center and southeast of the basin might represent different stages of apparent degradation of the banded terrain. Thus, we propose an eolian formation as volatile-rich airfall deposits by turbulent flows along the edges of Hellas Plani-tias katabatic wind alley. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to better constrain the origin of these enigmatic, unique terrains."
__label__UNRELATED	"Lilliput effect in late Maastrichtian planktic foraminifera: Response to environmental stress Introduction: Size reduction, termed the Lilliput effect by Urbanek (1993), has been observed in many organisms ranging from large mammals to invertebrates and to the smallest microscopic organisms, the singlecelled foraminifera. Invariably, the size changes are associated with high-stress environments, such as greenhouse warming, mesotrophic or restricted basins, shallow marginal settings and volcanically active regions. They represent a particular survival strategy most often associated with the aftermath of mass extinctions (e.g., Urbanek, 1993; Twitchett, 1999; Twitchett et al., 2001; Twitchett, 2006), and more rarely with pre-extinction or other high-stress environments (MacLeod, 1990; MacLeod et al., 2000). It is well known that the most severe biotic crises follow a predictable scenario of mass extinctions, size reduction, survival of a few small species and evolution regardless of the cause. In the aftermath of major catastrophes, often a single disaster taxon tends to dominate for a brief time. These are generally small, unornamented species that are rare or absent in normal environments, such as the planktic foraminifer Guembelitria (Keller and Pardo, 2004) after the KT boundary mass extinction, stromatolites and the inarticulate brachiopod Lingula before and after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction, respectively (Schubert and Bottjer, 1992; Rodland and Bottjer, 2001; Whalen et al., 2002), 5. Conclusions: 1) The Lilliput effect includes morphologic and intraspecies size reductions, which are commonly recognized as biotic responses in the aftermath of mass extinctions. This study shows that the Lilliput effect is not unique to catastrophic events. 2) The Lilliput effect was observed in diverse environments ranging from greenhouse warming, restricted basins and marginal marine settings to volcanic activity. The biotic stress response is similar in all types of high-stress environments, varying onlywith the degreeof environmental change, regardless of the particular causes that induced stress conditions. 3) Between optimal conditions and catastrophe there is a continuum of increasing biotic stress. In climatically challenged environments, there is selective elimination of large specialized species (kstrategy), intraspecies size reduction and increase in abundance of low oxygen tolerant heterohelicids. 4) Increased biotic stress, observed in restricted basin and shallow marginal seas, results in further diversity reduction, elimination of all k-strategists, dominance of heterohelicids and blooms of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria. 5) Themost extreme biotic stress conditions occur in regions of active volcanic activity. Assemblages are reduced to a few dwarfed taxa and disaster opportunists dominate, similar to the aftermath of the KT mass extinction. 6) Based on the late Maastrichtian Lilliput effect in planktic foraminifera, a scenario for the KT mass extinction must account for both volcanism and possibly multiple impacts, which superimposed on an already stressed late Maastrichtian biota exceeded threshold conditions for Cretaceous planktic foraminifera."

Volcanism may have commenced slightly earlier (~1620 Ma) in the southern portion of the plateau arid then ceased around 10 Ma. The dominant lavas are pyroxeneand plagioclase-phyric shoshonites with subordinate occurrences of dacites and rhyolites. Their mineralogy reflects crystallization from high-temperature (^1100C) magmas which had elevated oxygen and water fugaciti.es. Geochemically, they are characterized by relatively low TiO2, AI2O3 and Fe^Os, and high .A&^Q coupled with variable abundances of compatible trace elements and very high contents of incompatible trace elements. Normalized incompatible element patterns have marked negative Nb, la and Ti anomalies whereas K^O appears to be buffered at ~4% over a wide range of SiO^.

__label__UNRELATED	"On observing the compositional variability of the surface of Venus using nightside nearinfrared thermal radiation  Abstract: [1] There are several windows in the near-infrared wavelength range ( 1 mm), in which thermal radiation emitted from the planetary surface penetrates through the thick Venus atmosphere and clouds. In this study we develop an improved method to estimate the surface emissivity on the basis of near-infrared thermal emission from the nightside Venus, which is observed through these windows. A simple radiative transfer model demonstrates that multiple reflection of thermal radiation between the atmosphere (including clouds) and the solid surface has a significant influence on the observed radiance under the condition of Venus, where reflectivity of overlying atmosphere and clouds is high. Thus it is necessary to take the effect of the reflection by the planetary surface into account in order to estimate accurately the variation in the surface emissivity on the basis of nearinfrared observation of Venus. The net effect of multiple reflection of surface thermal radiation between the atmosphere and the surface is to significantly reduce the spatial contrast in thermal radiation due to surface compositional variation. The model calculation demonstrates that despite this effect, detection of granitic rocks on the Venus surface using near-infrared windows is feasible. Since granitic and basaltic rocks have dramatically different 1 mm emissivities, granitic rocks are distinguishable from basaltic rocks by ground-based telescopic observation. AVenus orbiter that measures both the near-infrared thermal radiation and the surface altitude with great accuracy will provide us with a reliable surface emissivity map of Venus, which is a very valuable tool to detect granitic (i.e., Earth-like continental) rocks on Venus. 5. Conclusion: [43] To estimate the surface emissivity of Venus from the observations through near-infrared windows, it is important to consider the influence of the multiple reflection between the planetary surface and the atmosphere/clouds. Since this process significantly obscures the difference in the surface emissivity, analysis neglecting the surface reflection fails to find a signature of the surface emissivity difference. Reexamination of the previous analysis demonstrates that there may be a significant spatial variation in the surface emissivity as large as 20%, which corresponds to the difference between granitic rocks and basaltic rocks. [44] Correction of the influence of scattering by the clouds is crucial in estimating the surface emissivity. Since the uncertainty in the estimation of the surface emissivityincreases rather sharply with atmospheric reflectance, nearinfrared data obtained when the atmospheric reflectance is temporally low due to the natural variation in cloud optical thickness is extremely important in obtaining accurate emissivity data of the Venus surface. [45] Spatial variation in the surface emissivity (i.e., the relative surface emissivity of a location with respect to that of another location) can be determined precisely enough to distinguish granitic rocks from basaltic rocks. The uncertainty in the estimation of the surface emissivity is controlled mostly by the error induced by the correction of the spatial variability of clouds. However, the uncertainty in the estimated spatial variation (i.e., relative emissivity) is significantly smaller than the uncertainty in the estimated value itself (i.e., absolute emissivity), when the estimated surface emissivities are affected in a similar way. To obtain a highquality data set, in which all the estimated surface emissivities are affected by clouds in a similar way, integration over a period longer than the timescale of temporal cloud variation is an effective way. [46] Since spatial resolution is limited by the intense scattering by clouds, it seems difficult to probe a small features such as the pancake domes ( 100 km). However, it can be determined whether large highland terrains on Venus, such as Ishtar Terra, Aphrodite Terra, and Lada Terra, have mineralogic compositions much more silicic (i.e., granitic) than surrounding (probable) basaltic plains.[47] Acknowledgments.

Conclusion: The synthesis of data (sedimentological, palaeontological, geochemical, mineralogical, etc.) of the upper Cenomanianlower Turonian carbonate platform of the Preafrican Trough allows us to propose a 3D model of the platform configuration. In this way, palaeoenvironmental conditions of the Preafrican Trough are compared with those of other platforms at the same period.During the late Cenomanian and the CCIE (Cenomanian Carbon Isotope Excursion), dysoxic bottom waters are present in the deepest environment of the mid- to outer-ramp, in the west of the platform. In the peritidal to mid-ramp environments of the eastern platform, waters remain well-oxygenated. The climate is arid before the CCIE and warm with contrasted seasons during the CCIE, associated with (1) oligotrophic to mesotrophic palaeoproductivity conditions and (2) the extensive development of a platform mainly composed of photozoan, followed by heterozoan, carbonate-producing ecosystems over a large part of the Saharan platform. However, this scenario is not in accordance with other studies considering that the presence of wet climate during the CCIE, causing an intense chemical weathering of the continents, also leads to an increase of the palaeoproductivity at a global scale. In the Preafrican Trough, the poorly-oxygenated waters spread out from the deep basins and cover the platform in response to sealevel rise.The most significant event recorded on the platform is early Turonian in age. Just after the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary and the CCIE, the platform is flooded (drowning phase), leading to the development of an outer-ramp environment over the entire platform. This flooding is linked to the end of the major Cenomanian transgression and the establishment of eutrophic conditions which disrupt carbonate-producing organisms. These eutrophic conditions lead to highly dysoxic conditions in the bottom and intermediate waters of the platform, thus leading to the disappearance of the majority of the palaeontological groups, except for opportunist benthic and planktonic foraminifera, which are able to proliferate. The enhanced palaeoproductivity causing the dysoxia is due to increased nutrient inputs. These latter are partly linked to the presence of a hot and wet climate that could induce a slight increase of chemical weathering on the continent. But, the decrease of the detrital influx during the early Turonian, the massive presence of silica and the reduction of weatherable continental areas after the Cenomanian transgression argue for another main source of nutrient input, probably the hydrothermalism/volcanism of the Caribbean LIP and oceanic ridges. The presence of dysoxic/anoxic conditions in several regions of thetropical Central Atlantic during the early Turonian is another argument in favor of this last hypothesis."
__label__UNRELATED	"Triggering of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide in relation to paleoceanography and climate history of the continental margin north of Spitsbergen  Abstract: [1] On the basis of the detailed sedimentological record of the key-core PS66/309-1 and a review of open literature, we present an assessment of the paleoenvironmental conditions as well as trigger mechanism of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide north of Spitsbergen. The Svalbard archipelago is characterized by strong inflow of Atlantic water accompanied by rapidly falling sea level, rapidly growing Svalbard-Barents SeaIce Sheet, and associated increasing glaciotectonic activity during the time window around 30 calendar kyr B. P. of this catastrophic failure event. Thus the potential trigger mechanisms include sediment buoyancy and excess pore pressure, hydrate stability, and tectonic/glaciotectonic processes. While the common scenarios seem to fail to explain this unique submarine megaslide, we focus on glacial processes and their consequences for the regional tectonic framework. We conclude that the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide has been the consequence of the rapid onset of Late Weichselian glaciation resulting in a drastic sea level drop, asymmetrical ice loading, and a forebulge development leading to enhanced tectonic movements along the Hinlopen fault zone. As the final trigger we assume a strong earthquake positioned below or close to the SE Sophia Basin. 5. Conclusions: Triggering Scenario for the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide: [40] The Hinlpen TMF and parts of the adjacent continental slope collapsed around 30 cal kyr B.P. Preconditioning and trigger mechanism appear to be special to explain the unprecedented geometry and physical configuration of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide.[41] The lithological (climatically controlled) preconditions are (1) intercalation of interglacial and glacial sediments of the Pleistocene strata on the shelf and (2) transition of glacigenic debris flows of a TMF into normal glaciomarine sediments.[42] The environmental (climatically controlled) preconditioning of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide include (1) higher influx of warm Atlantic water by the paleo-WSC (HP 2) accompanied by (2) a rapid drop in sea level as inferred from terrestrial geologic evidence as well as global data forcing the (3) HSZ to thin and large isostatic movements along the Hinlopen cross-shelf trough resulting from ice loading of the rapidly growing SBIS.[43] The changes in sediment buoyancy of 0.21% (2000 m water depth) appear to small for explain the initial failure. Excess pore water pressure due to pressure changes within semi or fully closed pore space sediment systems appears unlikely as the trigger since the TMF sediments have been deposited during sea level low stands and should therefore approach equilibrium.[44] Despite the absence of hydrate indications, we cannot tell from our data whether or not gas hydrates contributed to less slope stability within the preslide Hinlopen TMF. However, gas hydrates might not explain the initial slope failure although they possibly contributed to less slope stability within the upper slope.[45] Considering that only part of the Hinlopen TMF collapsed (along a major fault zone), theories based on changes in the temperature and/or pressure field fail to explain the stability within the remaining TMF.[46] Asymmetrical loading on the continent corner by rapid onset of the Late Weichselian Glaciation around 30 cal kyr B.P. accompanied by a forebulge development and a strong earthquake, probably positioned below or close to the bottle neck of13 of 15the headwall region probably resulted in unprecedented movements along the Hinlopen cross shelf trough. The subsequent sediment failure along this major fault zone appears to be the favorite triggering scenario for the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide. Thus the trigger is external and not internal (lithological, compensating overburden) as has been proposed for other slides."
__label__SUPPORT	"PII: S  Abstract: Comparing the timing of mass extinctions with the formation age of large igneous provinces reveals a close correspondence in five cases, but previous claims that all such provinces coincide with extinction events are unduly optimistic. The best correlation occurs for four consecutive mid-Phanerozoic examples, namely the end-Guadalupian extinctionrEmeishan flood basalts, the end-Permian extinctionrSiberian Traps, the end-Triassic extinctionrcentral Atlantic volcanism and the early Toarcian extinctionrKaroo Traps. Curiously, the onset of eruptions slightly post-dates the main phase of extinctions in these examples. Of the seven post-Karoo provinces, only the Deccan Traps coincide with a mass extinction, but in this case, the nature of the biotic crisis is best reconciled with the effects of a major bolide impact. Intraoceanic volcanism may also be implicated in a relatively minor end-Cenomanian extinction crisis, although once again the main phase of volcanism occurs after the crisis. The link between large igneous province formation and extinctions remains enigmatic; volume of extrusives and extinction intensity are unrelated and neither is there any apparent relationship Z . with the rapidity of province formation. Violence of eruptions proportions of pyroclastics also appears unimportant. Six out of 11 provinces coincide with episodes of global warming and marine anoxiardysoxia, a relationship that suggests that volcanic CO emissions may have an important effect on global climate. Conversely, there is little, if any, geological 2 evidence for cooling associated with continental flood basalt eruptions suggesting little long-term impact of SO emissions. 2 Large carbon isotope excursions are associated with some extinction events and intervals of flood basalt eruption but these are too great to be accounted for by the release of volcanic CO alone. Thus, voluminous volcanism may in some 2 Z . circumstances trigger calamitous global environmental changes runaway greenhouses , perhaps by causing the dissociation of gas hydrates. The variable efficiency of global carbon sinks during volcanic episodes may be an important control on environmental effects and may explain why the eruption of some vast igneous provinces, such as the ParanaEtendeka Traps, have little perceptible climatic impact. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, his concluZsion that Athe correlation is almost perfectB Courtil.lot, 1999, p. 97 is too optimistic, particularly ifPalaeozoic mass extinctions are considered. This review reveals the following relationships:Z .1 Of the 15 major Phanerozoic extinctions, only six coincide with major episodes of volcanicity. However, all extinction events of the last 300 Ma coincide with LIPs, with. the best correlation occurring for the 4 mid-Phanerozoic event that began withthe end-Guadalupian mass extinction. Subsequent extinctions have been less intense, with the exception of the KT event whose magnitude is likely due to the effects of bolide impact not volcanism.Z .2 For many LIPs, the onset of eruptions, or the interval immediately before this, appears to coincide with the extinction interval, perhaps suggesting that volcanicity triggered harmful environmental change.Z .3 The eruption volume of flood basalt provinces Z .is unrelated to extinction intensity Fig. 9 , andneither is their duration, which once again argues for their role in triggering further change, such as gas hydrate release.Z .4 Episodes of global warmingrmarine anoxia show the best correlation with flood basalt volcanism Z .Table 1 . Thus, all post-Palaeozoic oceanic anoxic Zevents coincide with intervals of LIP formation e.g. Keith, 1982; Sinton and Duncan, 1997; Kerr, 1998; .Jenkyns, 1999 . This connection may be connected with volcanic CO emission, particularly if the2 warming effect is exacerbated by gas hydrate dissociation.

The efficiency of C sinks, and their ability to drawdown atmospheric CO levels may control the2 duration of Arunaway greenhouseB intervals and thus their impact on the worlds biota. This efficiency appears to have undergone a secular increase in the past 300 Ma, with early Mesozoic volcanism having substantially more environmental impact than Tertiary volcanism."
__label__UNRELATED	"Compositional variation and palaeoenvironment of the volcanolithic Fort Cooper Coal Measures, Bowen Basin, Australia  Abstract: Article history: Received 26 November 2015 Received in revised form 8 April 2016 Accepted 14 April 2016 Available online 16 April 2016 An integrated analysis of megascopic lithotype, microscopicmaceral andmineral composition, stable carbon isotope and interburden sedimentology from a single well was used to interpret the response of the Late Permian Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM) to regional and global environmental influences. The FCCM are differentiated from underlying, relatively high vitrinite Moranbah Coal Measures, and overlying higher inertinite Rangal Coal Measures in the BowenBasin by their intercalationwith abundant tuff and siliciclastic partings and interbeds. Besides this, there is little described about the variation in the organic composition of the FCCM and its causes. The FCCM can be subdivided into a lower aggradational Fair Hill Formation, transgressed by the shallow marinederived Black Alley Shale that interfinger with/is overlain by the progradational Middle Main Seams and Burngrove Formation coal measures. The coals are dominantly dull withminor bright bands that are more abundant in the Burngrove Formation representing a change in plant composition. The maceral analysis shows that the coals in the Fair Hill Formation andMiddleMain Seams are vitrinite-rich (8090%mmf) albeitwith highmineral matter suggesting the formation of precursory peat under rising water levels and with high sediment (tuff) influx and preservation. The coals in the Burngrove Formation have an increased inertinite content (30% mmf) but are also high in mineral matter suggesting a shift to increased decomposition arising from a fluctuating water table, possibly increased aridity and/or microbial activity. Tuffs occur throughout, and although their frequency is higher in the lower Fair Hill Formation, the preservation of thicker tuffs in the upper Burngrove Formation indicates increased intensity of volcanism that could have modified the environment. Variation in carbon isotope compositions show a parabolic trend, from around24.1 in the Fair Hill Formation to more variable values in the Middle Main Seams with an overall C-enrichment upwards in the Burngrove Formation, prior to the C values becoming negative (depleted between 1 to 4% from the average 24.1) in the top seams and into the overlying Rangal Coal Measures. The C-depletion trend in the upper part of the section is unexpected in view of corresponding increase in inertinite content of the coals indicating that the C values/ plant composition and inertinite content are decoupled, unless the inertinite origin is from intense microbial decay. Similar stable carbon isotope depletion trends have been observed elsewhere in an equivalent stratigraphic interval of the BowenBasin suggesting that the carbon isotope values are responding to global conditions that cause negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary. Overall, the basin was continuously subsiding and peats accumulated with constant interruptions from excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. The low proportion of visible thick bright bands coupled with high telovitrinite (mmf) content suggests a marsh to fen environment, with an open canopy and ponding able to preserve volcanic ash falls. 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 4. Summary and conclusions: This study established the depositional and palaeoenvironmental architecture of the FCCM in Foxleigh 4 using sedimentary interpretations, coal lithotype profile, maceral composition and organic stable carbon isotope analysis. Overall, the FCCM record an upward progradational sequence in a downwarping basin with high sedimentation rates coincident with volcanism.The sedimentary interpretations suggest that the FCCM sequence is interrupted by the regional Black Alley Shale transgression; however, the lithotype and maceral composition of coal does not really respond except in the Burngrove Formation. The basin was continuously subsiding and the coals could not develop as thick bright banded coals, although they do have abundant vitrinite group macerals on a mineral matter free basis. Due to high input of sediments and volcanic ash fall, the accumulated peat was preserved and buried rapidly. The high mineral matter in the coal is the reason for the macroscopically dull nature of the FCCM coals.In the Fair Hill Formation, the aggradational sequence and increase in faunal bioturbation upwards in the sequence (Fig. 3) indicates rising base level leading to the Black Alley Shale transgression. The coals in the Fair Hill Formation are vitrinite-rich albeit with high mineral matter suggesting the formation of coal under high sediment influx.The Middle Main Seams with high vitrinite composition do represent suitable conditions for peat accumulation; however, abundant carbonaceousmudstone in the coal seams indicates that the peatmire was possibly drowned or under fluctuating water table conditions. The inconsistent carbon isotopes also support the fluctuating water level in the Middle Main Seams. Such type of peat formation is common in a coastal or deltaic settingwhere unstable accommodation andpeat accumulation may result in frequent flooding (Diessel, 1992b; Taylor et al., 1998). Based on variable carbon isotopes trends, one can interpret frequent water level fluctuations during the Middle Main Seams after the BlackAlley Shale transgression. The ash yields and lithotypeproportions suggest that the peat was receiving excessive sediments. This scenario can be related to the regional tectonic setting of the Bowen Basin in the Late Permian where the ongoing Hunter Bowen Orogeny increased the sediment influx in the basin that invaded the peat mire systems. Hence, the Middle Main Seams may represent a transition to declining base level conditions.The coals in the overlying Burngrove Formation are also high in ash yield indicative of excessive sediment supply, which can also force the base level to decline. Preservation of thick tuffs in the Burngrove Formation (Fig. 4B) indicates increased intensity of volcanism, and open peat canopies to preserve the ash falls. It is likely that the Hunter Bowen Orogeny had caused increased mire disturbance upwards in the FCCM sequence associated with excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. In this context, coals in the Burngrove Formation show a change in maceral composition with higher inertinite content (Fig. 3). The inertinite is interpreted to result from declining water level supplemented by microbial activity risen from volcanic ash deposition.Considering the progradational sequence of the Burngrove Formation, the base level/water level is expected to decline; however, the carbon isotopes represent a depleting trend where they should have more enriching trend. The contrast betweenmaceral composition and carbon isotopes can be explained by the global climatic changes near the endPermian time. The Late Permian is characterised by increased aridity and warming (Chumakov and Zharkov, 2003; Faure et al., 1995; Fluteau et al., 2001; Kidder and Worsley, 2004) due to the eruption of Siberianflood basalts and possible release of clathrates leading to deglaciation and increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Melting permafrost would also result in intense degradation, the release of clathrates and also CH4 into the atmosphere. This effect is also interpreted through negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary (Retallack et al., 2011), also observed by Van de Wetering et al. (2013) in Burngrove equivalent Kaloola Member and Rangal equivalent Bandanna Coal Measures in the southern Bowen Basin.Hence, throughout the FCCMsequence, subsidence and sediment influx related to Hunter Bowen Orogeny may have been the dominant control on the formation and resulting quality of the coals. Although the coals are high in ash yield, much from volcaniclastics, they are also vitrinite-rich. This could contribute to variable gas reservoir quality locally or to the potential for coking coal, albeit of low yields."
__label__UNRELATED	"Paleofloristic evidence of climate change near and beyond the PermianTriassic boundary Introduction: The historical stratotypes of the Upper Permian Systemare situated in the VolgaSevernaya Dvina Basin of European Russia. The boundary between the Vyatkian Stage (formerly a horizon of the Tatarian Stage, presently subdivided into the Zamoshinkovian, Lyuptyugian and Molomian horizons) and Vetlugian Group, formerly recognized as the PermianTriassic boundary (PTB) is unconformable over the larger part of the basin (Strok et al., 1984). The hiatus was assessed on the basis of magnetostratigraphic correlation as encompassing the whole Changhsingian Stage of the standard chronostratigraphic scale (Lozovsky and Esaulova, 1998). However, owing to the recent discovery of transitional floristic assemblages (Krassilov, 1999a,b, 2000; Afonin et al., 2001; Lozovsky et al., 2001; Sennikov and Golubev, 2005; Naugolnykh, 2005; Karasev and Krassilov, 2007), the Vyatkian Vetlugian sections of European Russia became potentially important for understanding terrestrial events near the PTB. The floristic assemblages discussed in this paper were found in the apparently continuous PermianTriassic sequences near Nedubrovo Village on the Kitchmenga River, Severnaya Dvina River Basin, 60 2 41.86N; 454429.80E and in the vicinity of Vyazniki Town on the Klyazma River, Volga Basin, 561524.55 N; 42 613.97 E (Fig. 1). They represent two short-lived, but distinct stages of floristic evolution just below and above the 6. Conclusion: We conclude that a prominent climate change occurred during the transitional interval near the PTB. It was chronologically and perhaps causally correlated with the rise of landmasses, global regression and voluminous inter-plate magmatic events, such as the Siberian and Emeishan traps. The effects of climate change on terrestrial vegetation are manifested at the phytosociological (the rise of conifers with a downslope shift of altitudinal vegetation belts), morphological (decrease of leaf size), and physiological (SI fluctuation) levels, indicating a pronounced cooling simultaneously affecting the nonmarine and marine realms.Triassic biomes divided by the paleo-Urals (dash line): Localities: 1, Southern Sweden, 0, Armenia, 11, Bashkiria and Orenburg Region, 12, Ilek River, 13, Eastern Urals, Serov 18, Arkit, 19, Son Kul', 20, Issyk Kul', 21, Kenderlyk, 22, Southern Fergana, 23, Pamir, 24,The high rate, but non-catastrophic floristic change over the transitional interval is witnessed by the rapid replacement of dominant forms among peltasperms and the first appearances of progenitorial Mesozoic forms in the mist of still numerically prominent Permian survivors.A decrease of renewable biomass brought about by the spread of conifer forests might have affected the Permian herbivores and, through trophic cascades, the therapsid fauna as a whole in much the same way as one of us postulated for the end-Cretaceous dinosaur communities (Krassilov, 1981).With transgression starting in the terminal Permian, aquatic plant production dramatically increased, promoting expansion of aquatic or semiaquatic forms (dvinosaurs) that became more prominent through the transitional interval. Ponding of estuaries and eutrophication, enhanced by fertilizers from volcanic sources, affected marine shallows damping biodiversity and promoting a few ubiquitous phyto- and zooplankton species of great stratigraphic utility (Krassilov et al., 1999a, b; Afonin et al., 2001).Further development of this trend brought about a greenhouse period analogous to the latest Paleocene thermal maximum about 200 million years later. Such episodes are here considered to be relatively short, giving way to a more typical pattern of distinct longpersistent zonal distribution of terrestrial biomes."
__label__UNRELATED	"Low 18O zircon grains in the Neoarchean Rum Jungle Complex, northern Australia: An indicator of emergent continental crust  Abstract: The timing of widespread continental emergence is generally considered to have had a dramatic effect on the hydrological cycle, atmospheric conditions, and climate. New secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) oxygen and laser-ablationmulticollectorinductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) Lu-Hf isotopic results from dated zircon grains in the granitic Neoarchean Rum Jungle Complex provide a minimum time constraint on the emergence of continental crust above sea level for the North Australian craton. A 2535 7 Ma monzogranite is characterized by magmatic zircon with slightly elevated 18O (6.07.5 relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water [VSMOW]), consistent with some contribution to the magma from reworked supracrustal material. A supracrustal contribution to magma genesis is supported by the presence of metasedimentary rock enclaves, a large population of inherited zircon grains, and subchondritic zircon Hf (Hf = 6.6 to 4.1). A separate, distinct crustal source to the same magma is indicated by inherited zircon grains that are dominated by low 18O values (2.54.8, n = 9 of 15) across a range of ages (35362598 Ma; Hf = 18.2 to +0.4). The low 18O grains may be the product of one of two processes: (1) grain-scale diffusion of oxygen in zircon by exchange with a low 18O magma or (2) several episodes of magmatic reworking of a Mesoarchean or older low 18O source. Both scenarios require shallow crustal magmatism in emergent crust, to allow interaction with rocks altered by hydrothermal meteoric water in order to generate the low 18O zircon. In the fi rst scenario, assimilation of these altered rocks during Neoarchean magmatism generated low 18O magma with which residual detrital zircons were able to exchange oxygen, while preserving their U-Pb systematics. In the second scenario, wholesale melting of the altered rocks occurred in several distinct events through the Mesoarchean, generating low 18O magma from which zircon crystallized. Ultimately, in either scenario, the low 18O zircons were entrained as inherited grains in a Neoarchean granite. The data suggest operation of a modern hydrological cycle by the Neoarchean and add to evidence for the increased emergence of continents by this time.

The zircon U-Pb, Lu-Hf, and O isotopic compositions of magmatic and inherited grains indicate that at least two distinct sources contributed to the granitic magma of the Rum Jungle Complex. The fi rst source is interpreted to be a granitic magma, which was generated by melting of older than 3.3 Ga supracrustal rocks, as gleaned from elevated 18O (6.07.5) and evolved Hf (4.1 to 6.6) ofthe 2535 Ma magmatic zircon population, and consistent with the presence of metasedimentary enclaves and inherited older zircons in the granite. A second source is interpreted to be a low 18O magma formed by melting of hydrothermally altered supracrustal rocks, which were then assimilated by the intrusive Rum Jungle Complex monzogranite, based on the low 18O composition of most of the inherited zircon grains in the granite.We propose that magmatism at shallow crustal levels provided the mechanism for generating low 18O magma by interaction with hydrothermal-Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/lithosphere/article-pdf/6/1/17/3050233/17.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019"
__label__UNRELATED	"Fire regimes and vegetation responses in two Mediterranean-climate regions  Abstract: Wildfires resulting from thunderstorms are common in some Mediterranean-climate regions, such as southern California, and have played an important role in the ecology and evolution of the flora. Mediterranean-climate regions are major centers for human population and thus anthropogenic impacts on fire regimes may have important consequences on these plant formations. However, changes in fire regimes may have different impacts on Mediterranean type-ecosystems depending on the capability of plants to respond to such perturbations. Therefore, we compare here fire regimes and vegetation responses of two Mediterraneanclimate regions which differ in wildfire regimes and history of human occupation, the central zone of Chile (matorral) and the southern area of California in United States (chaparral). In Chile almost all fires result from anthropogenic activities, whereas lightning fires resulting from thunderstorms are frequent in California. In both regions fires are more frequent in summer, due to high accumulation of dry plant biomass for ignition. Humans have markedly increased fires frequency both in the matorral and chaparral, but extent of burned areas has remained unaltered, probably due to better fire suppression actions and a decline in the built-up of dry plant fuel associated to increased landscape fragmentation with less flammable agricultural and urban developments. As expected, post-fire plant regeneration responses differs between the matorral and chaparral due to differences in the importance of wildfires as a natural evolutionary force in the system. Plants from the chaparral show a broader range of post-fire regeneration responses than the matorral, from basal resprouting, to lignotuber resprouting, and to fire-stimulated germination and flowering with fire-specific clues such as heat shock, chemicals from smoke or charred wood. Plants from the matorral have some resprouting capabilities after fire, but these probably evolved from other environmental pressures, such as severe and long summer droughts, herbivory, and volcanism. Although both Mediterranean-type ecosystems have shown to be resilient to anthropogenic fires, increasing fire frequency may be an important factor that needs to be considered as it may result in strong negative effects on plant successional trends and on plant diversity."

Conclusions: We have undertaken detailed field investigations of the fluvial succession exposed in the ~30 km reach of the Euphrates valley directly downstream of the Ataturk Dam, where this valley is inundated only by the shallow upstream end of the Birecik Reservoir and thus approximates its natural form, and in the adjoining lower reaches of the Goksu tributary. Unspiked K\\Ar dating of late Middle Miocene to Late Miocene basalt flows that abut the Euphrates throughout its length within SE Turkey has been used to provide a chronology for the early stages of development of this river system following regional emergence above sea level in the early Middle Miocene. For example, beside the Ataturk Dam Lake at Siverek Iskelesi, basalt dated to 10.240.22 Ma (2) caps a Euphrates gravel ~80 m above the modern river, the oldest Euphrates terrace currently recognised.Amounts and rates of fluvial incision vary across this northern part of the Arabian Platform in a complex manner, due to the interaction between regional uplift and localised vertical crustal motions caused by slip on active reverse faults beneath anticlines. The study reach downstream of the Ataturk Dam lies in the footwall of one such fault, beneath the Bozova Anticline. We estimate that the resulting rate of localised subsidence, superimposed onto the background regional uplift, has been ~0.01 mm a1 during the present phase of crustal deformation, which began at ~3.73.6 Ma, but was higher, maybe ~0.03 mm a1, during the previous phase, which began at ~6 Ma, when the pattern of plate motions in the surrounding region was different (Fig. 1). The large palaeo-lake centred around Adyaman, farther north, is inferred to have existed during this ~6 Ma to ~3.73.6 Ma phase of plate motion, apparently because the relatively rapid localised hanging-wall uplift on the northern flank of the Bozova Anticline led to blockage of the Euphrates valley near the site of the modern Ataturk Dam.The uppermost part of a thick fluvial aggradation west of the Euphrates near Karababa Bridge, inferred to date from around the Mid Pliocene, reaches ~100 m above the modern river, and after correction for an estimated ~30 m of localised subsidence and by ~50 m for subsequent downstream lengthening of the Euphrates channel, indicates ~180 mof subsequent regional uplift. The Euphrates then incised to within ~20 m of its present level by the mid Early Pleistocene, before a switch to regional subsidence accompanied the deposition of a second thick fluvial aggradation, the top of which is ~70 m above the modern river. Subsequent renewed regional uplift, following the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution, has resulted in the development of a succession of fluvial terraces, typically inset into these older aggradations, which are correlated with the 100 ka Milankovitch climate cycles.The early part of the Euphrates chronology, constrained mainly by the disposition of basalt flows, indicates ~800 m of regional uplift since the early Middle Miocene, of which an estimated ~330 m is masked by the subsequent downstream lengthening of the river. Components of localised uplift and subsidence, caused by slip on reverse faults beneath anticlines, are superimposed onto this regional pattern, the hanging-wall uplift being much larger (in one case, roughly five times larger) than the footwall subsidence.Our results provide, for the first time, detailed documentation of the complex development of the Euphrates valley in SE Turkey during the Late Cenozoic, due to the interaction between regional uplift and localised crustal deformation. The study also demonstrates the benefits of applying multidisciplinary techniques to investigate an important, but hitherto poorly documented, river system.Supplementarymaterials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.01.005."
__label__SUPPORT	"Stable isotope records across the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition, Stevns Klint, Denmark: New insights from the chromium isotope system  Abstract: Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene time represents a critical transitional period in Earth history. Global events include short-term instability in climate and ocean circulation, large igneous province emplacement, and catastrophic extinction of marine and terrestrial fauna due at least in part to a bolide impact event. The response of the ocean system to Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) global events has been the subject of much research, yet fundamental questions remain regarding carbon cycling, climate, ocean mixing, and redox conditions. To help elucidate paleoceanographic changes across the KPg transition, we revisit the classic Maastrichtian to Danian chalk-limestone succession at Stevns Klint, Denmark with a suite of new geochemical data, including insights from the redox-sensitive chromium isotope system. We use carbon and oxygen isotope trends to form a well-constrained framework for the succession, before presenting strontium isotope, chromium isotope, and rare-earth element data for the units deposited both before and after the K-Pg event. Carbon isotopes show only minor perturbation across the K-Pg boundary and oxygen isotopes record a prominent positive excursion, with both of these trends standing in contrast to many K-Pg boundary sections worldwide. Strontium isotopes record a spike towards more radiogenic values, which is consistent with a globally-observed, short-term weathering pulse. The chromium isotope profile of Maastrichtian chalk begins with strongly positive values followed by a sharp negative excursion associated with a facies shift and initiation of bottom currents in the Chalk Sea. dCr values then recover, before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary and into the Danian limestone. Chromium isotope trends do not correspond to changes in hydrothermal input or basin redox conditionsinstead, we propose that mixing of water masses with distinct chromium isotope signatures controlled temporal chromium isotope variability. The local mixing event inferred from our Maastrichtian chromium isotope data could be related to a temporary inflow of Tethyan bottom waters, or the shift from end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming (associated with Deccan volcanism) to the worldwide cooling phase that immediately preceded the K-Pg boundary. No immediate change in chromium isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary, indicating that the bolide impactor did not substantially perturb the marine chromium cycle, at least at the scale resolvable by our data.

All rights reserved. 6. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present an extensive new geochemical dataset spanning the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition at Stevns Klint, Denmark. Carbon and oxygen isotopes provide a general framework for the succession, and we further report strontium isotope, trace element, and rare-earth element data. Our focus, however, is on the novel chromium isotope system before and after the K-Pg event. Together, these data help elucidate oceanographic changes in the Danish Chalk Sea across this critical transition in Earth history. Carbon isotopes show only minor perturbation in bulk sediments across the K-Pg boundary, whereas oxygen isotopes record a prominent positive excursion. These trends are in contrast to some classic K-Pg boundary sections worldwide, which could reflect a degree of restriction between the Danish Basin and the open ocean. Strontium isotopes record a spike towards more radiogenic values above the K-Pg boundary, which is consistent with global trends that suggest a short-lived episode of enhanced terrestrial weathering associated with the K-Pg event.Maastrichtian to Danian strata of the Danish Basin are also ideal for measuring chromium isotopes because of theG.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305332 329general lack of diagenetic alteration and detrital contamination. d53Cr values are strongly positive in the Maastrichtian Sigerslev Member (the White Chalk), followed by a prominent negative excursion across the SigerslevHjerup transition. Chromium isotope values then rise through the middle Hjerup Member (the Grey Chalk), before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary. This signal is generally reproducible at several other localities across the Stevns Peninsula. Comparison to stratigraphic trends in strontium isotopes, the europium anomaly, and the redox-sensitive cerium anomaly suggest that chromium isotope trends were not controlled by either hydrothermal input to the basin or prevailing redox conditions. Instead, we propose that temporal chromium isotope trends were controlled by the mixing of water masses with distinct chromium isotope signatures in an isotopically heterogeneous Chalk Sea. This hypothesis is supported by association of the most prominent Maastrichtian chromium isotope excursion with sedimentological evidence for a distinct facies shift, development of seafloor topography, and initiation of bottom currents in the Chalk Sea. The potential mixing event recorded by this excursion could be related to the shift from end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming (associated with Deccan volcanism) to the worldwide cooling phase that immediately preceded the K-Pg boundary. Contrary to expectation, no sharp change in chromium isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary, suggesting that chromium cycling in the Danish Basin was not significantly perturbed by the K-Pg impact event, at least at the scale resolvable by our data. Instead, local oceanographic processes continued to be the prevailing control on chromium isotope trends, providing an example whereby chromium isotopes can be used as an oceanographic proxy in ancient carbonate-dominated depositional systems."
__label__UNRELATED	"Cohort establishment on slopes: Growth rates, demographic patterns, and the relationship to volcanic eruptions  Abstract: Little is known about keystone Carnegiea giganteas populations and the global-scale factors that influence its distribution and regeneration success. We sampled 300 plants on a northand on a south-facing slope, determined age structure, and compared results to those of other studies in topographically flat areas using regression and ANOVA. We found that growth rates are about the same for the two slopes, but more young Carnegiea were documented on the south-facing than on the north-facing slope, likely due to microclimatic differences and susceptibilities. Fewer individuals were represented in the higher age classes than often found in topographically flat populations. We found that individuals are faster growing on slopes than on flats, likely due to differences in sediment size and make-up. Finally, a recent study linked worldwide volcanism with cohort establishment in topographically flat areas. We found that successful cohort establishment in both populations (northand south-facing) was significantly higher during years with greater volcanic activity (and the years that were subsequently influenced by airborne materials ejected from the eruption), the first such observation for sloped populations. Volcanic eruptions occurring worldwide impact the regeneration success of this species, and in a variety of topographic settings, extending our previous knowledge of the link between global geologic events and climate change with the regeneration of this species locally (the first ever documented), which with further research will surely be extended to other species in other biomes worldwide. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__SUPPORT	"Carbon sequestration activated by a volcanic CO2 pulse during Ocean Anoxic Event 2  Abstract: The Cretaceous Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (about 94 million years ago) is thought to be linked to extensive volcanism, which triggered a biogeochemical chain of events that eventually led to widespread marine anoxia and a remarkable increase in carbon burial in marine sediments13. It has been suggested that the event was accompanied by a substantial decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentrations4, but the quantification of the drawdown remains controversial5,6. Here we reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations throughout the ocean anoxic event from counts of the stomata in fossil leaves, and use terrestrial carbon isotopes to link the reconstruction to marine records of the event7,8. We find that before the onset of ocean anoxia, atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased by 20% over background levels of 370/70 ppm. This was part of a long-term rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, presumably caused by volcanism, which reached a peak of 500/180 ppm. However, two pulses of extensive carbon burial during the ocean anoxic event, as indicated by positive carbon isotope excursions, are associated with decreased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We conclude that the sequestration of marine organic carbon led to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration of up to 26% during Ocean Anoxic Event 2. During Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), the rate and magnitude of organic carbon production and preservation were greatly elevated from typical background Cretaceous levels for periods of a half to one million years9. They are defined in the rock record by widely traceable intervals of laminated fine-grained strata (Fig. 1) with elevated organic carbon content10 and 24h positive excursions in 13C of carbonate and organic carbon, respectively8,11. Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2), which brackets the CenomanianTuronian boundary, records a major disturbance in the global carbon cycle when global temperatures were at their highest level for the past 115million years (Myr; ref. 12). On the basis of carbon isotope data4, it was argued that the burial of marine organic carbon associated with OAE2 might have been sufficient to shift the ocean to a net carbon sink. The resulting drawdown in pCO2 could have produced a transient cooling of the prevailing greenhouse climate of the Late Cretaceous period4. Previous efforts to test for pCO2 drawdown during OAE2 (refs 5, 6) provide indirect support for the carbon sequestration hypothesis4. However, these studies have focused solely on marine records and there are significant uncertainties associated with the pCO2 proxies used (for example, geoporphyrin-based p reconstruction in epeiric settings5, and interpretations depending on undocumented early evolution of C4 plants in the Cretaceous period6). Here we present a high-resolution atmospheric palaeo-pCO2 reconstruction across the onset of OAE2 based on the stomatal index method13.

__label__UNRELATED	"Hinterland drainage closure and lake formation in response to middle Eocene Farallon slab removal, Nevada, U.S.A Introduction: Hinterland lakes can accumulate archives of orogenic landscapes that are otherwise largely erosional and thus rarely preserved in the geologic record. Lacustrine lithofacies in particular can be sensitive indicators of local and regional basin hydrology, and can record subtle deformation caused by dynamic or isostatic processes (Carroll and Bohacs, 1999; Smith et al., 2014; DeCelles et al., 2015). Due to structural deformation in orogenic belts and the often dynamic paleogeography of terrestrial depositional environments, hinterland lake strata are often difficult to reconstruct using traditional stratigraphic correlation (i.e., Umhoefer et al., 2010). The hinterland of the North American Cordillera underwent contraction from the Triassic through Late Cretaceous due to viscous coupling between the subducting Farallon plate and North American lithosphere (DeCelles, 2004). Beginning at approximately 80 Ma, volcanism in the Sierra Nevada ceased due to flattening of the slab, and deep-seated contractile deformation occurred across the Laramide foreland (Erslev, 1993; Copeland et al., 2017). The stratigraphic record after 80 Ma of the Cordilleran hinterland is much less complete than the record of the foreland to the east. Isolated exposures suggest surface deformation and the incision of paleovalleys from the Late Cretaceous through early Eocene (Smith and Ketner, 1976; Druschke et al., 6. Conclusions: New 40Ar/39Ar ages constrain the Elko Formation and related strata to ca. 4938 Ma, making it one of the most well-dated lake deposits on Earth. Isolated lakes formed in northeast Nevada prior to ca. 48.7 Ma in the Coal Mine Canyon area. Regional deposition of freshwater lithofacies in the broader Elko Basin began at ca. 43.5 Ma, and was followed by lake expansion and increasingly saline and alkaline conditions at ca. 42.8 Ma, which resulted in the deposition of organic-rich mudstones across the basin. By ca. 41 Ma, an increasingly evaporitic, stromatolitic Lake Elko frequently received large volumes of volcanic ash and ignimbrites from local sources. Elko Formation accumulation ceased by ca. 40 Ma, reflecting final infill of Lake Elko. Dglass values from tephras within the Elko Formation vary systematically with environment of deposition, with significant enrichment of deuterium in lacustrine versus non-lacustrine settings. Dglass values and geochronology together show that the locus of highest evaporation migrated from south to north from Lake Elko at ca. 41 Ma to a smaller Copper Basin lake by ca. 38 Ma. The Elko Formation likely does not encompass the MECO, but this global warming event may be recorded in the ca. 40.45 0.25 Ma tuff of Nelson Creek. Samples of the tuff taken from lacustrine strata have Dglass values that are 80102 higher than the Dglass values of samples of the tuff taken from fluvial deposits, reflecting a difference in D values between evaporated lake waters and precipitation-derived waters. Highly varying 18O values in the Pinon Range section likely reflect differences in the amount of evaporation and carbonate-formation temperatures between carbonates formed in evaporative lakes, freshwater lakes, and pedogenic environments. Measured maximum Dglass differences between lacustrine and non-lacustrine ash beds would translate to a 18O of 11.5 using the GMWL, which could account for the entirety of the 18O shift attributed to surface uplift by Mulch et al. (2015). An absence of an uplift signature during the middle Eocene is consistent with the observation by Cassel et al. (2014) that the highest paleoelevations recorded in ignimbrites southwest of the Elko Basin occurred during the Oligocene, subsequent to Elko Formation deposition. The lacustrine portion of the Dead Horse Formation was deposited between ca. 40 Ma and ca. 39 Ma, and marks the final Paleogene lacustrine accumulation in the region. The Eocene lacustrine succession in northeast Nevada is overlain by Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic facies and isolated locally derived siliciclastic facies. These strata are regionally overlain by an unconformity at the base of the Miocene Humboldt Formation which represents a lacuna of 20 m.y. We interpret the overall progression of Elko Basin paleoenvironments from alluvial to freshwater lacustrine to saline lacustrine, followed by high volumes of volcanic infill, and then non-deposition toreflect to surface subsidence during ecologitization of the Farallon slab and uplift and magmatism subsequent to slab removal. Drainage disruption and ponding of surface waters likely resulted from one or more slab removal-related processes: 1) migrating surface uplift associated with slab removal; 2) thermal and isostatic uplift caused by felsic magmatism; 3) early detachment faulting associated with core complex exhumation; 4) dynamic subsidence triggered by RayleighTaylor instabilities or initial delamination of the mantle lithosphere following slab removal and heating; or 5) some combination of these processes. Further, the spatial coincidence of lake basins with metamorphic core complexes across the North American Cordilleran hinterland may reflect a genetic link between removal of mantle lithosphere by drips and delamination and the initiation of metamorphic core complexes."

The Huqf Supergroup spans the period ca. 725540 Ma, and is composed of three groups. The Abu Mahara Group (ca. 725 to b645 Ma) hosts two glacial successions separated by an interval of nonglacial, deep to shallow marine sedimentary rocks. The base of the overlying Nafun Group (ca.b645547 Ma) is marked by a transgressive post-glacial carbonate, which initiates an overstepping of basement-cored structural highs and the deposition of an extensive blanket of carbonate and siliciclastic stratigraphy. The Ara Group (ca. 547540 Ma), which is known mostly from the subsurface, comprises carbonates, evaporites and organic-rich shales, with interbedded ashes, deposited in a large number of NS trending troughs and platforms. The three groups of the Huqf Supergroup correspond to three phases of basin development. The Abu Mahara Group was deposited on an eroded crystalline and metasedimentary basement. An early stage of basin formation preserved b1.5 km of marginal to deeper marine sedimentary rocks, including an older Cryogenian glacial succession infilling erosional palaeovalleys. Renewed tectonic subsidence associated with submarine volcanism allowed the preservation of a N1 km-thick, cyclical, rift basinfill of glacial and non-glacial sedimentary rocks representing a younger Cryogenian icehouse epoch. Progressively older source areas were exhumed during the interval ca. 725 to b645 Ma, with unroofed 800+ Ma granitoid plutons providing the bulk of sediment, supplemented by syn-extension volcanics, and eventually by distant Mesoand Palaeoproterozoic sources. The wide extent of the Nafun Group, basin-wide correlation of major lithostratigraphic units, and its modest thickness (1 km) suggest a period of thermal contraction following Abu Mahara rifting. The Oman area was probably a region of slightly stretched continental lithosphere (which passed to the NE into a passive continental margin), occupied by a continental margin rim basin during deposition of the Nafun Group. The Nafun Group bears little resemblance to the coeval small basin-fills choked with calcalkaline volcanic detritus in the Arabian Shield, but the correlation of the Nafun Group with the Jibalah Group indicates that the contiguous continental rim basin extended from Oman across the tectonically deformed eastern fringe of the ArabianNubian Shield. Inundation of the Arabian Shield area and incorporation within the Nafun basin was probably facilitated by extensional collapse and tectonic escape. Sources for 600640 Ma zircons, found in the Nafun Group, can readily be identified in the Arabian Nubian Shield. Renewed volcanism, compartmentalization of the basin by NS trending structural highs and troughs, and an increase in sediment accumulation rates, typifies the Ara Group. The Ara Group deposits formed part of an extensive, latitudinal evaporite belt, with a depocentre translated outwards relative to the Nafun basin, suggesting continuing tectonic progradation of the eastern margin of the ArabianNubian Shield.

Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139185 of eastern Gondwana is the most likely cause of Ara volcanism and tectonism, in which case the Oman area can be viewed as occupying a retro-arc setting at this stage, between a subducting margin and the East African orogen. Coeval calc-alkaline plutons and rhyolitic to andesitic volcanics are found in the Central Iranian Terrane. Neoproterozoic glaciations are recorded in the rift and passive margin stratigraphy predating the final amalgamation of continental fragments into greater Gondwana. In Oman, glaciation was contemporaneous with the development of an Andean-type orogen in the ArabianNubian Shield while passive margin basins continued to subside in northern Iran, India and South China. The elevated topography associated with the Andean-type orogen together with passive margin mega-escarpments may have promoted nucleation of ice caps that sourced marine-terminating valley glaciers and ice streams. However, the triggering of Cryogenian glaciation must ultimately be related to the biogeochemical cycles operating on a planet with a nascent land biota, lack of calcifying plankton and reduced solar luminosity. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Conclusions: Recent advances in the understanding of the sedimentology, chemostratigraphy and geochronology of the Huqf Supergroup of Oman has highlighted the importance of the Omani Neoproterozoic-earliest Cambrian stratigraphy in assessing regional tectonics and global climate history.The Abu Mahara Group was deposited on exhumed continental crust that was formed principally at 825 850 Ma, most likely related to subduction. Its subsequent evolution during the Cryogenian can initially be closely linked with the accreted terranes of Arabia, especially those of nearby Yemen. Unroofed 825+ Ma plutons, metamorphic complexes, younger (750710 Ma) dykes and small unfoliated granitoid stocks and 800 Ma felsic volcanics provided detritus, including zircons, for the GhubrahAyn basins, in which an older Cryogenian glaciation is recorded. Reactivation of basin development associated with basaltic volcanism took place at ca. 650 Ma, correlative with the termination of a long period of terrane accretion in the ArabianNubian Shield and peak metamorphism in the East African orogen. The Fiq basin received detritus from progressively unroofing provenance areas, including new sources from synrift volcanics and MesoPalaeoproterozoic terranes. The end of the younger Cryogenian (Fiq) glaciation is marked by basin deepening and overstep of basement-cored highs by the post-glacial transgressive Hadash carbonate.Basin subsidence during the Nafun Group was extensive, with major lithostratigraphic packages being correlatable far to the west and north of Oman. The 1 km-thick Nafun Group is thought to have been deposited in a rim basin, perched close to the continental margin, due to thermal contraction following continental179P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139185stretching, and to have been connected to the open ocean through corridors in the north and northeast. Additional sources for 600640 Ma detrital zircons of the Nafun Group include igneous suites of the ArabianNubian Shield, suggesting that Oman had long been sutured to the ArabianNubian Shield by this stage. MesoPalaeoproterozoic sources may include basement fragments of the Afif (Khida) or Yemeni (Abas, Al-Mukalla) terranes.The change to the Ara Group is marked by a tectonic compartmentalization that caused rapid facies changes from relatively elevated carbonate platforms to intervening troughs accumulating salt. At the same time, an onset of volcanism is associated with the start of subduction of proto-Tethyan ocean floor around the periphery of eastern Gondwana. The Oman area was squeezed between this subduction margin and the welt of the megasuture in the Arabian Nubian Shield.The older Cryogenian glaciation took place at a time of globally dispersed continents following the breakup of Rodinia. The younger Cryogenian glaciation occurred close to the time of the peak of mountain building in the East African Orogen. There seem to be no simple clues relating the Neoproterozoic glaciations preserved in the Huqf Supergroup to plate positions or tectonic topography. The preservation of glacial successions in rift basins and continental margin basins may be more an effect of enhanced preservation than implying any direct causal link between tectonics and climate change."
__label__UNRELATED	"Martian cratering 11. Utilizing decameter scale crater populations to study Martian history  Abstract: New information has been obtained in recent years regarding formation rates and the production size-frequency distribution (PSFD) of decameter-scale primary Martian craters formed during recent orbiter missions. Here we compare the PSFD of the currently forming small primaries (P) with new data on the PSFD of the total small crater population that includes primaries and field secondaries (P + fS), which represents an average over longer time periods. The two data sets, if used in a combined manner, have extraordinary potential for clarifying not only the evolutionary history and resurfacing episodes of small Martian geological formations (as small as one or few km) but also possible episodes of recent climatic change. In response to recent discussions of statistical methodologies, we point out that crater counts do not produce idealized statistics, and that inherent uncertainties limit improvements that can be made by more sophisticated statistical analyses. We propose three mutually supportive procedures for interpreting crater counts of small craters in this context. Applications of these procedures support suggestions that topographic features in upper meters of mid-latitude ice-rich areas date only from the last few periods of extreme Martian obliquity, and associated predicted climate excursions. CONCLUSIONS: 1. The discovery of small new primary craters (D 4 m to 45 m) offers valuable opportunities for understanding the history of Martian geologic processes and climate variations in the last millions of years, and for attempting to separate the effects of primary and secondary craters. 2. A new, 2016 iteration isochron diagram template is offered, showing our current best-estimate PSFD curves down to D = 1 m, and other features. 3. The difference between this PSFD and the SFD of new primary craters may be attributed to the contribution of field secondaries. 4. Improved statistical methods have limited promise for improving crater chronometry of Mars. This is because the underlying built-in uncertainties in reading absolute ages from crater SFD data are significantly larger than the prospective improvements offered by adjusting statistical techniques applied to crater counts. 5. Many areas of Mars have complex histories of erosion, deposition, exhumation, etc., which make log-incremental plots of crater SFDs more useful than cumulative plots because the log-incremental plots show exactly the number state of craters surviving in each D bin, thus measuring topography survival effects at each size scale without influence from larger scale features. 6. Three procedures are suggested for analyzing counts of small craters in many Martian regions. (1) Crater counts at decameter scales can be combined with latest measurements of the P production rate ofprimary craters (e.g., Daubar et al. 2013) to give upper limits to the ages of small Martian features. (2) These ages should be compared with current best-estimate isochron-based crater retention ages, which involve counts of primaries plus field secondaries (P + fS). These should take into account a wide range in D by being applied to each diameter bin. These ages are typically several times lower than the independent (P-based) upper limit ages. With good fits to SFDs, the derived ages may indicate formation times of broad geologic formations; in cases involving the Opik effect, they reflect survival times of topography as a function of vertical relief. (3) These counts should be done first for sharp, bowl-shaped craters and then totaled with remaining degraded craters. Comparisons of results among the three procedures should be made in each diameter bin independently, because survival times and geologic histories at different scales are size-dependent. 7. Our suggested techniques suggest that decameterscale, near-surface layers of some Martian regions (exemplified by Greg crater, at 38 S) are correlated with climatic episodes of ice deposition, most likely caused by high-obliquity excursions within the last 5 to 20 Myr. 8. As more statistics on new, dated impact craters accumulate over the coming years, prospects are good for a growing understanding of the geologic and geophysical recent history of Mars and its surface layers at human scales (meters and decameters) by utilizing accumulating data about formation of small craters.AcknowledgmentsWKH thanks the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) in Bern, Switzerland, for supporting various stages of this work.

__label__UNRELATED	"Photogeologic mapping and the geologic history of the Hellas basin floor, Mars  7. Conclusions: On the basis of our observations, we conclude the following:(1) The early history of the Hellas basin (>3.8 Ga) experienced extended periods of fluvial and possibly lacustrine activity. While clear evidence for a basin-wide body of water and/ or ice is absent, morphologic observations along the northern rim indicate low-energy river environments. (2) The majority of the Hellas basin infill ( 1.51.7 106 km3) appears to consist of volcanic material emplaced as two distinct sequences ( 3.8 and 3.7 Ga). Crustal shortening by a compressive stress field occurred soon after their formation. With Malea and Tyrrhena Paterae being suitable sources (overlapping AMAs), we suggest that the older sequence covered the entire basin floor. Hadriaca and Amphitrites Paterae are suitable sources for the younger sequence (overlapping AMAs), which covered only the western half of the basin floor. (3) Intermittent and contemporaneous units in the basin center and along the southern/southeastern rim, probably of glacio-fluvial origin, suggest huge volumes of material were deposited simultaneously and/or shortly after the volcanic episodes. An apparent phase of increased erosion and deposition 3.7 Ga ago is also in agreement with Halevy and Head (2014), who proposed that outgassing by a maximum in global volcanism at that time caused warmer episodes enabling repeated subaerial water run-off. Thus, Hellas Planitia and its surroundings are a key location to observe the influence of volcanic activity on the martian climate. (4) Our observations are in good agreement with a previous wind circulation model (Howard et al., 2012). We suggest that persistent, katabatic winds capable of triggering saltation and, thus, abrasion, carved out the Hellas Planitia trough including Peneus Palus (containing the deepest point on Mars) within few 100s of Ma, probably during the Amazonian. A somewhat shallower, but similarly shaped, basinscale topographic low can also be observed in the west southwestern Argyre basin and could, thus, potentially be of the same origin. In the Hellas basin, we propose that the removed material was re-deposited closer to its center, where the model predicts lower wind speeds. Coverage by 100s of meters of such airfall deposits might also explain the apparent absence of landforms formed by a putative basin-wide glaciation and/or sea potentially associated with the central deposits. (5) The nature of the honeycomb terrain remains ambiguous, although our observations are in agreement with an interpretation as an older (>3.8 Ga) landscape that was formed by ductile deformation of some sort, and exhumed by persistent winds in the Amazonian as part of the Hellas Planitia trough formation. However, we cannot constrain the original formation age of the honeycomb terrain, as its contacts reveal only little concise stratigraphic information. Furthermore, we found that the reticulate and banded terrains, which were previously associated or equated with the honeycomb terrain (Moore andWilhelms, 2001, 2007; Kite et al., 2009), are morphologically distinct units. The banded terrain appears to superpose parts of the other two terrains, but also occurs elsewhere in the basin, predominantly along the wind-carved Hellas Planitia trough. Similar landforms in the center and southeast of the basin might represent different stages of apparent degradation of the banded terrain. Thus, we propose an eolian formation as volatile-rich airfall deposits by turbulent flows along the edges of Hellas Plani-tias katabatic wind alley. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to better constrain the origin of these enigmatic, unique terrains."
__label__UNRELATED	"Lilliput effect in late Maastrichtian planktic foraminifera: Response to environmental stress Introduction: Size reduction, termed the Lilliput effect by Urbanek (1993), has been observed in many organisms ranging from large mammals to invertebrates and to the smallest microscopic organisms, the singlecelled foraminifera. Invariably, the size changes are associated with high-stress environments, such as greenhouse warming, mesotrophic or restricted basins, shallow marginal settings and volcanically active regions. They represent a particular survival strategy most often associated with the aftermath of mass extinctions (e.g., Urbanek, 1993; Twitchett, 1999; Twitchett et al., 2001; Twitchett, 2006), and more rarely with pre-extinction or other high-stress environments (MacLeod, 1990; MacLeod et al., 2000). It is well known that the most severe biotic crises follow a predictable scenario of mass extinctions, size reduction, survival of a few small species and evolution regardless of the cause. In the aftermath of major catastrophes, often a single disaster taxon tends to dominate for a brief time. These are generally small, unornamented species that are rare or absent in normal environments, such as the planktic foraminifer Guembelitria (Keller and Pardo, 2004) after the KT boundary mass extinction, stromatolites and the inarticulate brachiopod Lingula before and after the Permo-Triassic mass extinction, respectively (Schubert and Bottjer, 1992; Rodland and Bottjer, 2001; Whalen et al., 2002), 5. Conclusions: 1) The Lilliput effect includes morphologic and intraspecies size reductions, which are commonly recognized as biotic responses in the aftermath of mass extinctions. This study shows that the Lilliput effect is not unique to catastrophic events. 2) The Lilliput effect was observed in diverse environments ranging from greenhouse warming, restricted basins and marginal marine settings to volcanic activity. The biotic stress response is similar in all types of high-stress environments, varying onlywith the degreeof environmental change, regardless of the particular causes that induced stress conditions. 3) Between optimal conditions and catastrophe there is a continuum of increasing biotic stress. In climatically challenged environments, there is selective elimination of large specialized species (kstrategy), intraspecies size reduction and increase in abundance of low oxygen tolerant heterohelicids. 4) Increased biotic stress, observed in restricted basin and shallow marginal seas, results in further diversity reduction, elimination of all k-strategists, dominance of heterohelicids and blooms of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria. 5) Themost extreme biotic stress conditions occur in regions of active volcanic activity. Assemblages are reduced to a few dwarfed taxa and disaster opportunists dominate, similar to the aftermath of the KT mass extinction. 6) Based on the late Maastrichtian Lilliput effect in planktic foraminifera, a scenario for the KT mass extinction must account for both volcanism and possibly multiple impacts, which superimposed on an already stressed late Maastrichtian biota exceeded threshold conditions for Cretaceous planktic foraminifera."

Volcanism may have commenced slightly earlier (~1620 Ma) in the southern portion of the plateau arid then ceased around 10 Ma.

__label__UNRELATED	"On observing the compositional variability of the surface of Venus using nightside nearinfrared thermal radiation  Abstract: [1] There are several windows in the near-infrared wavelength range ( 1 mm), in which thermal radiation emitted from the planetary surface penetrates through the thick Venus atmosphere and clouds. In this study we develop an improved method to estimate the surface emissivity on the basis of near-infrared thermal emission from the nightside Venus, which is observed through these windows. A simple radiative transfer model demonstrates that multiple reflection of thermal radiation between the atmosphere (including clouds) and the solid surface has a significant influence on the observed radiance under the condition of Venus, where reflectivity of overlying atmosphere and clouds is high. Thus it is necessary to take the effect of the reflection by the planetary surface into account in order to estimate accurately the variation in the surface emissivity on the basis of nearinfrared observation of Venus. The net effect of multiple reflection of surface thermal radiation between the atmosphere and the surface is to significantly reduce the spatial contrast in thermal radiation due to surface compositional variation. The model calculation demonstrates that despite this effect, detection of granitic rocks on the Venus surface using near-infrared windows is feasible. Since granitic and basaltic rocks have dramatically different 1 mm emissivities, granitic rocks are distinguishable from basaltic rocks by ground-based telescopic observation. AVenus orbiter that measures both the near-infrared thermal radiation and the surface altitude with great accuracy will provide us with a reliable surface emissivity map of Venus, which is a very valuable tool to detect granitic (i.e., Earth-like continental) rocks on Venus. 5. Conclusion: [43] To estimate the surface emissivity of Venus from the observations through near-infrared windows, it is important to consider the influence of the multiple reflection between the planetary surface and the atmosphere/clouds. Since this process significantly obscures the difference in the surface emissivity, analysis neglecting the surface reflection fails to find a signature of the surface emissivity difference. Reexamination of the previous analysis demonstrates that there may be a significant spatial variation in the surface emissivity as large as 20%, which corresponds to the difference between granitic rocks and basaltic rocks. [44] Correction of the influence of scattering by the clouds is crucial in estimating the surface emissivity. Since the uncertainty in the estimation of the surface emissivityincreases rather sharply with atmospheric reflectance, nearinfrared data obtained when the atmospheric reflectance is temporally low due to the natural variation in cloud optical thickness is extremely important in obtaining accurate emissivity data of the Venus surface. [45] Spatial variation in the surface emissivity (i.e., the relative surface emissivity of a location with respect to that of another location) can be determined precisely enough to distinguish granitic rocks from basaltic rocks. The uncertainty in the estimation of the surface emissivity is controlled mostly by the error induced by the correction of the spatial variability of clouds. However, the uncertainty in the estimated spatial variation (i.e., relative emissivity) is significantly smaller than the uncertainty in the estimated value itself (i.e., absolute emissivity), when the estimated surface emissivities are affected in a similar way. To obtain a highquality data set, in which all the estimated surface emissivities are affected by clouds in a similar way, integration over a period longer than the timescale of temporal cloud variation is an effective way. [46] Since spatial resolution is limited by the intense scattering by clouds, it seems difficult to probe a small features such as the pancake domes ( 100 km). However, it can be determined whether large highland terrains on Venus, such as Ishtar Terra, Aphrodite Terra, and Lada Terra, have mineralogic compositions much more silicic (i.e., granitic) than surrounding (probable) basaltic plains.[47] Acknowledgments.

Conclusion: The synthesis of data (sedimentological, palaeontological, geochemical, mineralogical, etc.) of the upper Cenomanianlower Turonian carbonate platform of the Preafrican Trough allows us to propose a 3D model of the platform configuration. In this way, palaeoenvironmental conditions of the Preafrican Trough are compared with those of other platforms at the same period.During the late Cenomanian and the CCIE (Cenomanian Carbon Isotope Excursion), dysoxic bottom waters are present in the deepest environment of the mid- to outer-ramp, in the west of the platform. In the peritidal to mid-ramp environments of the eastern platform, waters remain well-oxygenated. The climate is arid before the CCIE and warm with contrasted seasons during the CCIE, associated with (1) oligotrophic to mesotrophic palaeoproductivity conditions and (2) the extensive development of a platform mainly composed of photozoan, followed by heterozoan, carbonate-producing ecosystems over a large part of the Saharan platform. However, this scenario is not in accordance with other studies considering that the presence of wet climate during the CCIE, causing an intense chemical weathering of the continents, also leads to an increase of the palaeoproductivity at a global scale. In the Preafrican Trough, the poorly-oxygenated waters spread out from the deep basins and cover the platform in response to sealevel rise.The most significant event recorded on the platform is early Turonian in age. Just after the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary and the CCIE, the platform is flooded (drowning phase), leading to the development of an outer-ramp environment over the entire platform. This flooding is linked to the end of the major Cenomanian transgression and the establishment of eutrophic conditions which disrupt carbonate-producing organisms. These eutrophic conditions lead to highly dysoxic conditions in the bottom and intermediate waters of the platform, thus leading to the disappearance of the majority of the palaeontological groups, except for opportunist benthic and planktonic foraminifera, which are able to proliferate. The enhanced palaeoproductivity causing the dysoxia is due to increased nutrient inputs. These latter are partly linked to the presence of a hot and wet climate that could induce a slight increase of chemical weathering on the continent. But, the decrease of the detrital influx during the early Turonian, the massive presence of silica and the reduction of weatherable continental areas after the Cenomanian transgression argue for another main source of nutrient input, probably the hydrothermalism/volcanism of the Caribbean LIP and oceanic ridges. The presence of dysoxic/anoxic conditions in several regions of thetropical Central Atlantic during the early Turonian is another argument in favor of this last hypothesis."
__label__UNRELATED	"Triggering of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide in relation to paleoceanography and climate history of the continental margin north of Spitsbergen  Abstract: [1] On the basis of the detailed sedimentological record of the key-core PS66/309-1 and a review of open literature, we present an assessment of the paleoenvironmental conditions as well as trigger mechanism of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide north of Spitsbergen. The Svalbard archipelago is characterized by strong inflow of Atlantic water accompanied by rapidly falling sea level, rapidly growing Svalbard-Barents SeaIce Sheet, and associated increasing glaciotectonic activity during the time window around 30 calendar kyr B. P. of this catastrophic failure event. Thus the potential trigger mechanisms include sediment buoyancy and excess pore pressure, hydrate stability, and tectonic/glaciotectonic processes. While the common scenarios seem to fail to explain this unique submarine megaslide, we focus on glacial processes and their consequences for the regional tectonic framework. We conclude that the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide has been the consequence of the rapid onset of Late Weichselian glaciation resulting in a drastic sea level drop, asymmetrical ice loading, and a forebulge development leading to enhanced tectonic movements along the Hinlopen fault zone. As the final trigger we assume a strong earthquake positioned below or close to the SE Sophia Basin. 5. Conclusions: Triggering Scenario for the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide: [40] The Hinlpen TMF and parts of the adjacent continental slope collapsed around 30 cal kyr B.P. Preconditioning and trigger mechanism appear to be special to explain the unprecedented geometry and physical configuration of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide.[41] The lithological (climatically controlled) preconditions are (1) intercalation of interglacial and glacial sediments of the Pleistocene strata on the shelf and (2) transition of glacigenic debris flows of a TMF into normal glaciomarine sediments.[42] The environmental (climatically controlled) preconditioning of the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide include (1) higher influx of warm Atlantic water by the paleo-WSC (HP 2) accompanied by (2) a rapid drop in sea level as inferred from terrestrial geologic evidence as well as global data forcing the (3) HSZ to thin and large isostatic movements along the Hinlopen cross-shelf trough resulting from ice loading of the rapidly growing SBIS.[43] The changes in sediment buoyancy of 0.21% (2000 m water depth) appear to small for explain the initial failure. Excess pore water pressure due to pressure changes within semi or fully closed pore space sediment systems appears unlikely as the trigger since the TMF sediments have been deposited during sea level low stands and should therefore approach equilibrium.[44] Despite the absence of hydrate indications, we cannot tell from our data whether or not gas hydrates contributed to less slope stability within the preslide Hinlopen TMF. However, gas hydrates might not explain the initial slope failure although they possibly contributed to less slope stability within the upper slope.[45] Considering that only part of the Hinlopen TMF collapsed (along a major fault zone), theories based on changes in the temperature and/or pressure field fail to explain the stability within the remaining TMF.[46] Asymmetrical loading on the continent corner by rapid onset of the Late Weichselian Glaciation around 30 cal kyr B.P. accompanied by a forebulge development and a strong earthquake, probably positioned below or close to the bottle neck of13 of 15the headwall region probably resulted in unprecedented movements along the Hinlopen cross shelf trough. The subsequent sediment failure along this major fault zone appears to be the favorite triggering scenario for the Hinlopen/Yermak Megaslide. Thus the trigger is external and not internal (lithological, compensating overburden) as has been proposed for other slides."
__label__SUPPORT	"PII: S  Abstract: Comparing the timing of mass extinctions with the formation age of large igneous provinces reveals a close correspondence in five cases, but previous claims that all such provinces coincide with extinction events are unduly optimistic. The best correlation occurs for four consecutive mid-Phanerozoic examples, namely the end-Guadalupian extinctionrEmeishan flood basalts, the end-Permian extinctionrSiberian Traps, the end-Triassic extinctionrcentral Atlantic volcanism and the early Toarcian extinctionrKaroo Traps. Curiously, the onset of eruptions slightly post-dates the main phase of extinctions in these examples. Of the seven post-Karoo provinces, only the Deccan Traps coincide with a mass extinction, but in this case, the nature of the biotic crisis is best reconciled with the effects of a major bolide impact. Intraoceanic volcanism may also be implicated in a relatively minor end-Cenomanian extinction crisis, although once again the main phase of volcanism occurs after the crisis. The link between large igneous province formation and extinctions remains enigmatic; volume of extrusives and extinction intensity are unrelated and neither is there any apparent relationship Z . with the rapidity of province formation. Violence of eruptions proportions of pyroclastics also appears unimportant. Six out of 11 provinces coincide with episodes of global warming and marine anoxiardysoxia, a relationship that suggests that volcanic CO emissions may have an important effect on global climate. Conversely, there is little, if any, geological 2 evidence for cooling associated with continental flood basalt eruptions suggesting little long-term impact of SO emissions. 2 Large carbon isotope excursions are associated with some extinction events and intervals of flood basalt eruption but these are too great to be accounted for by the release of volcanic CO alone. Thus, voluminous volcanism may in some 2 Z . circumstances trigger calamitous global environmental changes runaway greenhouses , perhaps by causing the dissociation of gas hydrates. The variable efficiency of global carbon sinks during volcanic episodes may be an important control on environmental effects and may explain why the eruption of some vast igneous provinces, such as the ParanaEtendeka Traps, have little perceptible climatic impact. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Subsequent extinctions have been less intense, with the exception of the KT event whose magnitude is likely due to the effects of bolide impact not volcanism.Z .2 For many LIPs, the onset of eruptions, or the interval immediately before this, appears to coincide with the extinction interval, perhaps suggesting that volcanicity triggered harmful environmental change.Z .3 The eruption volume of flood basalt provinces Z .is unrelated to extinction intensity Fig. 9 , andneither is their duration, which once again argues for their role in triggering further change, such as gas hydrate release.Z .4 Episodes of global warmingrmarine anoxia show the best correlation with flood basalt volcanism Z .Table 1 . Thus, all post-Palaeozoic oceanic anoxic Zevents coincide with intervals of LIP formation e.g. Keith, 1982; Sinton and Duncan, 1997; Kerr, 1998; .Jenkyns, 1999 . This connection may be connected with volcanic CO emission, particularly if the2 warming effect is exacerbated by gas hydrate dissociation. However, it is an unresolved paradox that these warmingranoxia events are associated with Zboth major mass extinctions e.g. the end-Permian . Zevent , modest extinctions, e.g. the end-Cenomanian . Zevent , very minor extinctions e.g. the late . ZPalaeocene and no extinctions at all e.g. the Early .Cretaceous Selli Event .Z . Z .5 The duration of volcanogenic? oceanic anoxia varies greatly. Thus, the PTr marine anoxic event persisted for several million years, whereas the Late Palaeocene thermal maximum lasted for only 100 ka. The efficiency of C sinks, and their ability to drawdown atmospheric CO levels may control the2 duration of Arunaway greenhouseB intervals and thus their impact on the worlds biota. This efficiency appears to have undergone a secular increase in the past 300 Ma, with early Mesozoic volcanism having substantially more environmental impact than Tertiary volcanism."
__label__UNRELATED	"Compositional variation and palaeoenvironment of the volcanolithic Fort Cooper Coal Measures, Bowen Basin, Australia  Abstract: Article history: Received 26 November 2015 Received in revised form 8 April 2016 Accepted 14 April 2016 Available online 16 April 2016 An integrated analysis of megascopic lithotype, microscopicmaceral andmineral composition, stable carbon isotope and interburden sedimentology from a single well was used to interpret the response of the Late Permian Fort Cooper Coal Measures (FCCM) to regional and global environmental influences. The FCCM are differentiated from underlying, relatively high vitrinite Moranbah Coal Measures, and overlying higher inertinite Rangal Coal Measures in the BowenBasin by their intercalationwith abundant tuff and siliciclastic partings and interbeds. Besides this, there is little described about the variation in the organic composition of the FCCM and its causes. The FCCM can be subdivided into a lower aggradational Fair Hill Formation, transgressed by the shallow marinederived Black Alley Shale that interfinger with/is overlain by the progradational Middle Main Seams and Burngrove Formation coal measures. The coals are dominantly dull withminor bright bands that are more abundant in the Burngrove Formation representing a change in plant composition. The maceral analysis shows that the coals in the Fair Hill Formation andMiddleMain Seams are vitrinite-rich (8090%mmf) albeitwith highmineral matter suggesting the formation of precursory peat under rising water levels and with high sediment (tuff) influx and preservation. The coals in the Burngrove Formation have an increased inertinite content (30% mmf) but are also high in mineral matter suggesting a shift to increased decomposition arising from a fluctuating water table, possibly increased aridity and/or microbial activity. Tuffs occur throughout, and although their frequency is higher in the lower Fair Hill Formation, the preservation of thicker tuffs in the upper Burngrove Formation indicates increased intensity of volcanism that could have modified the environment. Variation in carbon isotope compositions show a parabolic trend, from around24.1 in the Fair Hill Formation to more variable values in the Middle Main Seams with an overall C-enrichment upwards in the Burngrove Formation, prior to the C values becoming negative (depleted between 1 to 4% from the average 24.1) in the top seams and into the overlying Rangal Coal Measures. The C-depletion trend in the upper part of the section is unexpected in view of corresponding increase in inertinite content of the coals indicating that the C values/ plant composition and inertinite content are decoupled, unless the inertinite origin is from intense microbial decay. Similar stable carbon isotope depletion trends have been observed elsewhere in an equivalent stratigraphic interval of the BowenBasin suggesting that the carbon isotope values are responding to global conditions that cause negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary. Overall, the basin was continuously subsiding and peats accumulated with constant interruptions from excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. The low proportion of visible thick bright bands coupled with high telovitrinite (mmf) content suggests a marsh to fen environment, with an open canopy and ponding able to preserve volcanic ash falls. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Summary and conclusions: This study established the depositional and palaeoenvironmental architecture of the FCCM in Foxleigh 4 using sedimentary interpretations, coal lithotype profile, maceral composition and organic stable carbon isotope analysis. Overall, the FCCM record an upward progradational sequence in a downwarping basin with high sedimentation rates coincident with volcanism.The sedimentary interpretations suggest that the FCCM sequence is interrupted by the regional Black Alley Shale transgression; however, the lithotype and maceral composition of coal does not really respond except in the Burngrove Formation. The basin was continuously subsiding and the coals could not develop as thick bright banded coals, although they do have abundant vitrinite group macerals on a mineral matter free basis. Due to high input of sediments and volcanic ash fall, the accumulated peat was preserved and buried rapidly. The high mineral matter in the coal is the reason for the macroscopically dull nature of the FCCM coals.In the Fair Hill Formation, the aggradational sequence and increase in faunal bioturbation upwards in the sequence (Fig. 3) indicates rising base level leading to the Black Alley Shale transgression. The coals in the Fair Hill Formation are vitrinite-rich albeit with high mineral matter suggesting the formation of coal under high sediment influx.The Middle Main Seams with high vitrinite composition do represent suitable conditions for peat accumulation; however, abundant carbonaceousmudstone in the coal seams indicates that the peatmire was possibly drowned or under fluctuating water table conditions. The inconsistent carbon isotopes also support the fluctuating water level in the Middle Main Seams. Such type of peat formation is common in a coastal or deltaic settingwhere unstable accommodation andpeat accumulation may result in frequent flooding (Diessel, 1992b; Taylor et al., 1998). Based on variable carbon isotopes trends, one can interpret frequent water level fluctuations during the Middle Main Seams after the BlackAlley Shale transgression. The ash yields and lithotypeproportions suggest that the peat was receiving excessive sediments. This scenario can be related to the regional tectonic setting of the Bowen Basin in the Late Permian where the ongoing Hunter Bowen Orogeny increased the sediment influx in the basin that invaded the peat mire systems. Hence, the Middle Main Seams may represent a transition to declining base level conditions.The coals in the overlying Burngrove Formation are also high in ash yield indicative of excessive sediment supply, which can also force the base level to decline. Preservation of thick tuffs in the Burngrove Formation (Fig. 4B) indicates increased intensity of volcanism, and open peat canopies to preserve the ash falls. It is likely that the Hunter Bowen Orogeny had caused increased mire disturbance upwards in the FCCM sequence associated with excessive sedimentation and volcanic eruptions. In this context, coals in the Burngrove Formation show a change in maceral composition with higher inertinite content (Fig. 3). The inertinite is interpreted to result from declining water level supplemented by microbial activity risen from volcanic ash deposition.Considering the progradational sequence of the Burngrove Formation, the base level/water level is expected to decline; however, the carbon isotopes represent a depleting trend where they should have more enriching trend. The contrast betweenmaceral composition and carbon isotopes can be explained by the global climatic changes near the endPermian time. The Late Permian is characterised by increased aridity and warming (Chumakov and Zharkov, 2003; Faure et al., 1995; Fluteau et al., 2001; Kidder and Worsley, 2004) due to the eruption of Siberianflood basalts and possible release of clathrates leading to deglaciation and increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Melting permafrost would also result in intense degradation, the release of clathrates and also CH4 into the atmosphere. This effect is also interpreted through negative excursions in carbon isotopes before the P-T boundary (Retallack et al., 2011), also observed by Van de Wetering et al. (2013) in Burngrove equivalent Kaloola Member and Rangal equivalent Bandanna Coal Measures in the southern Bowen Basin.Hence, throughout the FCCMsequence, subsidence and sediment influx related to Hunter Bowen Orogeny may have been the dominant control on the formation and resulting quality of the coals. Although the coals are high in ash yield, much from volcaniclastics, they are also vitrinite-rich. This could contribute to variable gas reservoir quality locally or to the potential for coking coal, albeit of low yields."
__label__UNRELATED	"Paleofloristic evidence of climate change near and beyond the PermianTriassic boundary Introduction: The historical stratotypes of the Upper Permian Systemare situated in the VolgaSevernaya Dvina Basin of European Russia. The boundary between the Vyatkian Stage (formerly a horizon of the Tatarian Stage, presently subdivided into the Zamoshinkovian, Lyuptyugian and Molomian horizons) and Vetlugian Group, formerly recognized as the PermianTriassic boundary (PTB) is unconformable over the larger part of the basin (Strok et al., 1984). The hiatus was assessed on the basis of magnetostratigraphic correlation as encompassing the whole Changhsingian Stage of the standard chronostratigraphic scale (Lozovsky and Esaulova, 1998). However, owing to the recent discovery of transitional floristic assemblages (Krassilov, 1999a,b, 2000; Afonin et al., 2001; Lozovsky et al., 2001; Sennikov and Golubev, 2005; Naugolnykh, 2005; Karasev and Krassilov, 2007), the Vyatkian Vetlugian sections of European Russia became potentially important for understanding terrestrial events near the PTB. The floristic assemblages discussed in this paper were found in the apparently continuous PermianTriassic sequences near Nedubrovo Village on the Kitchmenga River, Severnaya Dvina River Basin, 60 2 41.86N; 454429.80E and in the vicinity of Vyazniki Town on the Klyazma River, Volga Basin, 561524.55 N; 42 613.97 E (Fig. 1). They represent two short-lived, but distinct stages of floristic evolution just below and above the 6. Conclusion: We conclude that a prominent climate change occurred during the transitional interval near the PTB. It was chronologically and perhaps causally correlated with the rise of landmasses, global regression and voluminous inter-plate magmatic events, such as the Siberian and Emeishan traps. The effects of climate change on terrestrial vegetation are manifested at the phytosociological (the rise of conifers with a downslope shift of altitudinal vegetation belts), morphological (decrease of leaf size), and physiological (SI fluctuation) levels, indicating a pronounced cooling simultaneously affecting the nonmarine and marine realms.Triassic biomes divided by the paleo-Urals (dash line): Localities: 1, Southern Sweden, 0, Armenia, 11, Bashkiria and Orenburg Region, 12, Ilek River, 13, Eastern Urals, Serov 18, Arkit, 19, Son Kul', 20, Issyk Kul', 21, Kenderlyk, 22, Southern Fergana, 23, Pamir, 24,The high rate, but non-catastrophic floristic change over the transitional interval is witnessed by the rapid replacement of dominant forms among peltasperms and the first appearances of progenitorial Mesozoic forms in the mist of still numerically prominent Permian survivors.A decrease of renewable biomass brought about by the spread of conifer forests might have affected the Permian herbivores and, through trophic cascades, the therapsid fauna as a whole in much the same way as one of us postulated for the end-Cretaceous dinosaur communities (Krassilov, 1981).With transgression starting in the terminal Permian, aquatic plant production dramatically increased, promoting expansion of aquatic or semiaquatic forms (dvinosaurs) that became more prominent through the transitional interval. Ponding of estuaries and eutrophication, enhanced by fertilizers from volcanic sources, affected marine shallows damping biodiversity and promoting a few ubiquitous phyto- and zooplankton species of great stratigraphic utility (Krassilov et al., 1999a, b; Afonin et al., 2001).Further development of this trend brought about a greenhouse period analogous to the latest Paleocene thermal maximum about 200 million years later. Such episodes are here considered to be relatively short, giving way to a more typical pattern of distinct longpersistent zonal distribution of terrestrial biomes."
__label__UNRELATED	"Low 18O zircon grains in the Neoarchean Rum Jungle Complex, northern Australia: An indicator of emergent continental crust  Abstract: The timing of widespread continental emergence is generally considered to have had a dramatic effect on the hydrological cycle, atmospheric conditions, and climate. New secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) oxygen and laser-ablationmulticollectorinductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) Lu-Hf isotopic results from dated zircon grains in the granitic Neoarchean Rum Jungle Complex provide a minimum time constraint on the emergence of continental crust above sea level for the North Australian craton. A 2535 7 Ma monzogranite is characterized by magmatic zircon with slightly elevated 18O (6.07.5 relative to Vienna standard mean ocean water [VSMOW]), consistent with some contribution to the magma from reworked supracrustal material. A supracrustal contribution to magma genesis is supported by the presence of metasedimentary rock enclaves, a large population of inherited zircon grains, and subchondritic zircon Hf (Hf = 6.6 to 4.1). A separate, distinct crustal source to the same magma is indicated by inherited zircon grains that are dominated by low 18O values (2.54.8, n = 9 of 15) across a range of ages (35362598 Ma; Hf = 18.2 to +0.4). The low 18O grains may be the product of one of two processes: (1) grain-scale diffusion of oxygen in zircon by exchange with a low 18O magma or (2) several episodes of magmatic reworking of a Mesoarchean or older low 18O source. Both scenarios require shallow crustal magmatism in emergent crust, to allow interaction with rocks altered by hydrothermal meteoric water in order to generate the low 18O zircon. In the fi rst scenario, assimilation of these altered rocks during Neoarchean magmatism generated low 18O magma with which residual detrital zircons were able to exchange oxygen, while preserving their U-Pb systematics. In the second scenario, wholesale melting of the altered rocks occurred in several distinct events through the Mesoarchean, generating low 18O magma from which zircon crystallized. Ultimately, in either scenario, the low 18O zircons were entrained as inherited grains in a Neoarchean granite. The data suggest operation of a modern hydrological cycle by the Neoarchean and add to evidence for the increased emergence of continents by this time.

The zircon U-Pb, Lu-Hf, and O isotopic compositions of magmatic and inherited grains indicate that at least two distinct sources contributed to the granitic magma of the Rum Jungle Complex. The fi rst source is interpreted to be a granitic magma, which was generated by melting of older than 3.3 Ga supracrustal rocks, as gleaned from elevated 18O (6.07.5) and evolved Hf (4.1 to 6.6) ofthe 2535 Ma magmatic zircon population, and consistent with the presence of metasedimentary enclaves and inherited older zircons in the granite. A second source is interpreted to be a low 18O magma formed by melting of hydrothermally altered supracrustal rocks, which were then assimilated by the intrusive Rum Jungle Complex monzogranite, based on the low 18O composition of most of the inherited zircon grains in the granite.We propose that magmatism at shallow crustal levels provided the mechanism for generating low 18O magma by interaction with hydrothermal-Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/lithosphere/article-pdf/6/1/17/3050233/17.pdf by University of Arizona user on 21 February 2019"
__label__UNRELATED	"Fire regimes and vegetation responses in two Mediterranean-climate regions  Abstract: Wildfires resulting from thunderstorms are common in some Mediterranean-climate regions, such as southern California, and have played an important role in the ecology and evolution of the flora. Mediterranean-climate regions are major centers for human population and thus anthropogenic impacts on fire regimes may have important consequences on these plant formations. However, changes in fire regimes may have different impacts on Mediterranean type-ecosystems depending on the capability of plants to respond to such perturbations. Therefore, we compare here fire regimes and vegetation responses of two Mediterraneanclimate regions which differ in wildfire regimes and history of human occupation, the central zone of Chile (matorral) and the southern area of California in United States (chaparral). In Chile almost all fires result from anthropogenic activities, whereas lightning fires resulting from thunderstorms are frequent in California. In both regions fires are more frequent in summer, due to high accumulation of dry plant biomass for ignition. Humans have markedly increased fires frequency both in the matorral and chaparral, but extent of burned areas has remained unaltered, probably due to better fire suppression actions and a decline in the built-up of dry plant fuel associated to increased landscape fragmentation with less flammable agricultural and urban developments. As expected, post-fire plant regeneration responses differs between the matorral and chaparral due to differences in the importance of wildfires as a natural evolutionary force in the system. Plants from the chaparral show a broader range of post-fire regeneration responses than the matorral, from basal resprouting, to lignotuber resprouting, and to fire-stimulated germination and flowering with fire-specific clues such as heat shock, chemicals from smoke or charred wood. Plants from the matorral have some resprouting capabilities after fire, but these probably evolved from other environmental pressures, such as severe and long summer droughts, herbivory, and volcanism. Although both Mediterranean-type ecosystems have shown to be resilient to anthropogenic fires, increasing fire frequency may be an important factor that needs to be considered as it may result in strong negative effects on plant successional trends and on plant diversity."

Conclusions: We have undertaken detailed field investigations of the fluvial succession exposed in the ~30 km reach of the Euphrates valley directly downstream of the Ataturk Dam, where this valley is inundated only by the shallow upstream end of the Birecik Reservoir and thus approximates its natural form, and in the adjoining lower reaches of the Goksu tributary. Unspiked K\\Ar dating of late Middle Miocene to Late Miocene basalt flows that abut the Euphrates throughout its length within SE Turkey has been used to provide a chronology for the early stages of development of this river system following regional emergence above sea level in the early Middle Miocene. For example, beside the Ataturk Dam Lake at Siverek Iskelesi, basalt dated to 10.240.22 Ma (2) caps a Euphrates gravel ~80 m above the modern river, the oldest Euphrates terrace currently recognised.Amounts and rates of fluvial incision vary across this northern part of the Arabian Platform in a complex manner, due to the interaction between regional uplift and localised vertical crustal motions caused by slip on active reverse faults beneath anticlines. The study reach downstream of the Ataturk Dam lies in the footwall of one such fault, beneath the Bozova Anticline. We estimate that the resulting rate of localised subsidence, superimposed onto the background regional uplift, has been ~0.01 mm a1 during the present phase of crustal deformation, which began at ~3.73.6 Ma, but was higher, maybe ~0.03 mm a1, during the previous phase, which began at ~6 Ma, when the pattern of plate motions in the surrounding region was different (Fig. 1). The large palaeo-lake centred around Adyaman, farther north, is inferred to have existed during this ~6 Ma to ~3.73.6 Ma phase of plate motion, apparently because the relatively rapid localised hanging-wall uplift on the northern flank of the Bozova Anticline led to blockage of the Euphrates valley near the site of the modern Ataturk Dam.The uppermost part of a thick fluvial aggradation west of the Euphrates near Karababa Bridge, inferred to date from around the Mid Pliocene, reaches ~100 m above the modern river, and after correction for an estimated ~30 m of localised subsidence and by ~50 m for subsequent downstream lengthening of the Euphrates channel, indicates ~180 mof subsequent regional uplift. The Euphrates then incised to within ~20 m of its present level by the mid Early Pleistocene, before a switch to regional subsidence accompanied the deposition of a second thick fluvial aggradation, the top of which is ~70 m above the modern river. Subsequent renewed regional uplift, following the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution, has resulted in the development of a succession of fluvial terraces, typically inset into these older aggradations, which are correlated with the 100 ka Milankovitch climate cycles.The early part of the Euphrates chronology, constrained mainly by the disposition of basalt flows, indicates ~800 m of regional uplift since the early Middle Miocene, of which an estimated ~330 m is masked by the subsequent downstream lengthening of the river. Components of localised uplift and subsidence, caused by slip on reverse faults beneath anticlines, are superimposed onto this regional pattern, the hanging-wall uplift being much larger (in one case, roughly five times larger) than the footwall subsidence.Our results provide, for the first time, detailed documentation of the complex development of the Euphrates valley in SE Turkey during the Late Cenozoic, due to the interaction between regional uplift and localised crustal deformation. The study also demonstrates the benefits of applying multidisciplinary techniques to investigate an important, but hitherto poorly documented, river system.Supplementarymaterials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.01.005."
__label__SUPPORT	"Stable isotope records across the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition, Stevns Klint, Denmark: New insights from the chromium isotope system  Abstract: Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene time represents a critical transitional period in Earth history. Global events include short-term instability in climate and ocean circulation, large igneous province emplacement, and catastrophic extinction of marine and terrestrial fauna due at least in part to a bolide impact event. The response of the ocean system to Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) global events has been the subject of much research, yet fundamental questions remain regarding carbon cycling, climate, ocean mixing, and redox conditions. To help elucidate paleoceanographic changes across the KPg transition, we revisit the classic Maastrichtian to Danian chalk-limestone succession at Stevns Klint, Denmark with a suite of new geochemical data, including insights from the redox-sensitive chromium isotope system. We use carbon and oxygen isotope trends to form a well-constrained framework for the succession, before presenting strontium isotope, chromium isotope, and rare-earth element data for the units deposited both before and after the K-Pg event. Carbon isotopes show only minor perturbation across the K-Pg boundary and oxygen isotopes record a prominent positive excursion, with both of these trends standing in contrast to many K-Pg boundary sections worldwide. Strontium isotopes record a spike towards more radiogenic values, which is consistent with a globally-observed, short-term weathering pulse. The chromium isotope profile of Maastrichtian chalk begins with strongly positive values followed by a sharp negative excursion associated with a facies shift and initiation of bottom currents in the Chalk Sea. dCr values then recover, before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary and into the Danian limestone. Chromium isotope trends do not correspond to changes in hydrothermal input or basin redox conditionsinstead, we propose that mixing of water masses with distinct chromium isotope signatures controlled temporal chromium isotope variability. The local mixing event inferred from our Maastrichtian chromium isotope data could be related to a temporary inflow of Tethyan bottom waters, or the shift from end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming (associated with Deccan volcanism) to the worldwide cooling phase that immediately preceded the K-Pg boundary. No immediate change in chromium isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary, indicating that the bolide impactor did not substantially perturb the marine chromium cycle, at least at the scale resolvable by our data.

All rights reserved. 6. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present an extensive new geochemical dataset spanning the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition at Stevns Klint, Denmark. Carbon and oxygen isotopes provide a general framework for the succession, and we further report strontium isotope, trace element, and rare-earth element data. Our focus, however, is on the novel chromium isotope system before and after the K-Pg event. Together, these data help elucidate oceanographic changes in the Danish Chalk Sea across this critical transition in Earth history. Carbon isotopes show only minor perturbation in bulk sediments across the K-Pg boundary, whereas oxygen isotopes record a prominent positive excursion. These trends are in contrast to some classic K-Pg boundary sections worldwide, which could reflect a degree of restriction between the Danish Basin and the open ocean. Strontium isotopes record a spike towards more radiogenic values above the K-Pg boundary, which is consistent with global trends that suggest a short-lived episode of enhanced terrestrial weathering associated with the K-Pg event.Maastrichtian to Danian strata of the Danish Basin are also ideal for measuring chromium isotopes because of theG.J. Gilleaudeau et al. /Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 235 (2018) 305332 329general lack of diagenetic alteration and detrital contamination. d53Cr values are strongly positive in the Maastrichtian Sigerslev Member (the White Chalk), followed by a prominent negative excursion across the SigerslevHjerup transition. Chromium isotope values then rise through the middle Hjerup Member (the Grey Chalk), before falling steadily across the K-Pg boundary. This signal is generally reproducible at several other localities across the Stevns Peninsula. Comparison to stratigraphic trends in strontium isotopes, the europium anomaly, and the redox-sensitive cerium anomaly suggest that chromium isotope trends were not controlled by either hydrothermal input to the basin or prevailing redox conditions. Instead, we propose that temporal chromium isotope trends were controlled by the mixing of water masses with distinct chromium isotope signatures in an isotopically heterogeneous Chalk Sea. This hypothesis is supported by association of the most prominent Maastrichtian chromium isotope excursion with sedimentological evidence for a distinct facies shift, development of seafloor topography, and initiation of bottom currents in the Chalk Sea. The potential mixing event recorded by this excursion could be related to the shift from end-Maastrichtian greenhouse warming (associated with Deccan volcanism) to the worldwide cooling phase that immediately preceded the K-Pg boundary. Contrary to expectation, no sharp change in chromium isotopes is recorded across the K-Pg boundary, suggesting that chromium cycling in the Danish Basin was not significantly perturbed by the K-Pg impact event, at least at the scale resolvable by our data. Instead, local oceanographic processes continued to be the prevailing control on chromium isotope trends, providing an example whereby chromium isotopes can be used as an oceanographic proxy in ancient carbonate-dominated depositional systems."

We sampled 300 plants on a northand on a south-facing slope, determined age structure, and compared results to those of other studies in topographically flat areas using regression and ANOVA. We found that growth rates are about the same for the two slopes, but more young Carnegiea were documented on the south-facing than on the north-facing slope, likely due to microclimatic differences and susceptibilities. Fewer individuals were represented in the higher age classes than often found in topographically flat populations. We found that individuals are faster growing on slopes than on flats, likely due to differences in sediment size and make-up. Finally, a recent study linked worldwide volcanism with cohort establishment in topographically flat areas. We found that successful cohort establishment in both populations (northand south-facing) was significantly higher during years with greater volcanic activity (and the years that were subsequently influenced by airborne materials ejected from the eruption), the first such observation for sloped populations. Volcanic eruptions occurring worldwide impact the regeneration success of this species, and in a variety of topographic settings, extending our previous knowledge of the link between global geologic events and climate change with the regeneration of this species locally (the first ever documented), which with further research will surely be extended to other species in other biomes worldwide. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

__label__SUPPORT	"Carbon sequestration activated by a volcanic CO2 pulse during Ocean Anoxic Event 2  Abstract: The Cretaceous Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (about 94 million years ago) is thought to be linked to extensive volcanism, which triggered a biogeochemical chain of events that eventually led to widespread marine anoxia and a remarkable increase in carbon burial in marine sediments13. It has been suggested that the event was accompanied by a substantial decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentrations4, but the quantification of the drawdown remains controversial5,6. Here we reconstruct atmospheric CO2 concentrations throughout the ocean anoxic event from counts of the stomata in fossil leaves, and use terrestrial carbon isotopes to link the reconstruction to marine records of the event7,8. We find that before the onset of ocean anoxia, atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased by 20% over background levels of 370/70 ppm. This was part of a long-term rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, presumably caused by volcanism, which reached a peak of 500/180 ppm. However, two pulses of extensive carbon burial during the ocean anoxic event, as indicated by positive carbon isotope excursions, are associated with decreased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We conclude that the sequestration of marine organic carbon led to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentration of up to 26% during Ocean Anoxic Event 2. During Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), the rate and magnitude of organic carbon production and preservation were greatly elevated from typical background Cretaceous levels for periods of a half to one million years9. They are defined in the rock record by widely traceable intervals of laminated fine-grained strata (Fig. 1) with elevated organic carbon content10 and 24h positive excursions in 13C of carbonate and organic carbon, respectively8,11. Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (OAE2), which brackets the CenomanianTuronian boundary, records a major disturbance in the global carbon cycle when global temperatures were at their highest level for the past 115million years (Myr; ref. 12). On the basis of carbon isotope data4, it was argued that the burial of marine organic carbon associated with OAE2 might have been sufficient to shift the ocean to a net carbon sink. The resulting drawdown in pCO2 could have produced a transient cooling of the prevailing greenhouse climate of the Late Cretaceous period4. Previous efforts to test for pCO2 drawdown during OAE2 (refs 5, 6) provide indirect support for the carbon sequestration hypothesis4. However, these studies have focused solely on marine records and there are significant uncertainties associated with the pCO2 proxies used (for example, geoporphyrin-based p reconstruction in epeiric settings5, and interpretations depending on undocumented early evolution of C4 plants in the Cretaceous period6). Here we present a high-resolution atmospheric palaeo-pCO2 reconstruction across the onset of OAE2 based on the stomatal index method13. The stomatal index method is founded on a genetically controlled inverse relationship between pCO2 and the"
__label__UNRELATED	"Hinterland drainage closure and lake formation in response to middle Eocene Farallon slab removal, Nevada, U.S.A Introduction: Hinterland lakes can accumulate archives of orogenic landscapes that are otherwise largely erosional and thus rarely preserved in the geologic record. Lacustrine lithofacies in particular can be sensitive indicators of local and regional basin hydrology, and can record subtle deformation caused by dynamic or isostatic processes (Carroll and Bohacs, 1999; Smith et al., 2014; DeCelles et al., 2015). Due to structural deformation in orogenic belts and the often dynamic paleogeography of terrestrial depositional environments, hinterland lake strata are often difficult to reconstruct using traditional stratigraphic correlation (i.e., Umhoefer et al., 2010). The hinterland of the North American Cordillera underwent contraction from the Triassic through Late Cretaceous due to viscous coupling between the subducting Farallon plate and North American lithosphere (DeCelles, 2004). Beginning at approximately 80 Ma, volcanism in the Sierra Nevada ceased due to flattening of the slab, and deep-seated contractile deformation occurred across the Laramide foreland (Erslev, 1993; Copeland et al., 2017). The stratigraphic record after 80 Ma of the Cordilleran hinterland is much less complete than the record of the foreland to the east. Isolated exposures suggest surface deformation and the incision of paleovalleys from the Late Cretaceous through early Eocene (Smith and Ketner, 1976; Druschke et al., 6. Conclusions: New 40Ar/39Ar ages constrain the Elko Formation and related strata to ca. 4938 Ma, making it one of the most well-dated lake deposits on Earth. Isolated lakes formed in northeast Nevada prior to ca. 48.7 Ma in the Coal Mine Canyon area. Regional deposition of freshwater lithofacies in the broader Elko Basin began at ca. 43.5 Ma, and was followed by lake expansion and increasingly saline and alkaline conditions at ca. 42.8 Ma, which resulted in the deposition of organic-rich mudstones across the basin. By ca. 41 Ma, an increasingly evaporitic, stromatolitic Lake Elko frequently received large volumes of volcanic ash and ignimbrites from local sources. Elko Formation accumulation ceased by ca. 40 Ma, reflecting final infill of Lake Elko. Dglass values from tephras within the Elko Formation vary systematically with environment of deposition, with significant enrichment of deuterium in lacustrine versus non-lacustrine settings. Dglass values and geochronology together show that the locus of highest evaporation migrated from south to north from Lake Elko at ca. 41 Ma to a smaller Copper Basin lake by ca. 38 Ma. The Elko Formation likely does not encompass the MECO, but this global warming event may be recorded in the ca. 40.45 0.25 Ma tuff of Nelson Creek. Samples of the tuff taken from lacustrine strata have Dglass values that are 80102 higher than the Dglass values of samples of the tuff taken from fluvial deposits, reflecting a difference in D values between evaporated lake waters and precipitation-derived waters. Highly varying 18O values in the Pinon Range section likely reflect differences in the amount of evaporation and carbonate-formation temperatures between carbonates formed in evaporative lakes, freshwater lakes, and pedogenic environments. Measured maximum Dglass differences between lacustrine and non-lacustrine ash beds would translate to a 18O of 11.5 using the GMWL, which could account for the entirety of the 18O shift attributed to surface uplift by Mulch et al. (2015). An absence of an uplift signature during the middle Eocene is consistent with the observation by Cassel et al. (2014) that the highest paleoelevations recorded in ignimbrites southwest of the Elko Basin occurred during the Oligocene, subsequent to Elko Formation deposition. The lacustrine portion of the Dead Horse Formation was deposited between ca. 40 Ma and ca. 39 Ma, and marks the final Paleogene lacustrine accumulation in the region. The Eocene lacustrine succession in northeast Nevada is overlain by Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic facies and isolated locally derived siliciclastic facies. These strata are regionally overlain by an unconformity at the base of the Miocene Humboldt Formation which represents a lacuna of 20 m.y. We interpret the overall progression of Elko Basin paleoenvironments from alluvial to freshwater lacustrine to saline lacustrine, followed by high volumes of volcanic infill, and then non-deposition toreflect to surface subsidence during ecologitization of the Farallon slab and uplift and magmatism subsequent to slab removal. Drainage disruption and ponding of surface waters likely resulted from one or more slab removal-related processes: 1) migrating surface uplift associated with slab removal; 2) thermal and isostatic uplift caused by felsic magmatism; 3) early detachment faulting associated with core complex exhumation; 4) dynamic subsidence triggered by RayleighTaylor instabilities or initial delamination of the mantle lithosphere following slab removal and heating; or 5) some combination of these processes. Further, the spatial coincidence of lake basins with metamorphic core complexes across the North American Cordilleran hinterland may reflect a genetic link between removal of mantle lithosphere by drips and delamination and the initiation of metamorphic core complexes."
__label__UNRELATED	"The Huqf Supergroup of Oman: Basin development and context for Neoproterozoic glaciation  Abstract: The Huqf Supergroup of the Sultanate of Oman provides important information on the geological evolution of the Arabian Persian Gulf region during a protracted period of continental dispersal and reassembly on the periphery of the Gondwanan supercontinent during the Neoproterozoic, and also provides important constraints on the nature of extreme climate swings during this critical period in the evolution of Earth's biosphere. The Huqf Supergroup spans the period ca. 725540 Ma, and is composed of three groups. The Abu Mahara Group (ca. 725 to b645 Ma) hosts two glacial successions separated by an interval of nonglacial, deep to shallow marine sedimentary rocks. The base of the overlying Nafun Group (ca.b645547 Ma) is marked by a transgressive post-glacial carbonate, which initiates an overstepping of basement-cored structural highs and the deposition of an extensive blanket of carbonate and siliciclastic stratigraphy. The Ara Group (ca. 547540 Ma), which is known mostly from the subsurface, comprises carbonates, evaporites and organic-rich shales, with interbedded ashes, deposited in a large number of NS trending troughs and platforms. The three groups of the Huqf Supergroup correspond to three phases of basin development. The Abu Mahara Group was deposited on an eroded crystalline and metasedimentary basement. An early stage of basin formation preserved b1.5 km of marginal to deeper marine sedimentary rocks, including an older Cryogenian glacial succession infilling erosional palaeovalleys. Renewed tectonic subsidence associated with submarine volcanism allowed the preservation of a N1 km-thick, cyclical, rift basinfill of glacial and non-glacial sedimentary rocks representing a younger Cryogenian icehouse epoch. Progressively older source areas were exhumed during the interval ca. 725 to b645 Ma, with unroofed 800+ Ma granitoid plutons providing the bulk of sediment, supplemented by syn-extension volcanics, and eventually by distant Mesoand Palaeoproterozoic sources. The wide extent of the Nafun Group, basin-wide correlation of major lithostratigraphic units, and its modest thickness (1 km) suggest a period of thermal contraction following Abu Mahara rifting. The Oman area was probably a region of slightly stretched continental lithosphere (which passed to the NE into a passive continental margin), occupied by a continental margin rim basin during deposition of the Nafun Group. The Nafun Group bears little resemblance to the coeval small basin-fills choked with calcalkaline volcanic detritus in the Arabian Shield, but the correlation of the Nafun Group with the Jibalah Group indicates that the contiguous continental rim basin extended from Oman across the tectonically deformed eastern fringe of the ArabianNubian Shield. Inundation of the Arabian Shield area and incorporation within the Nafun basin was probably facilitated by extensional collapse and tectonic escape. Sources for 600640 Ma zircons, found in the Nafun Group, can readily be identified in the Arabian Nubian Shield. Renewed volcanism, compartmentalization of the basin by NS trending structural highs and troughs, and an increase in sediment accumulation rates, typifies the Ara Group. The Ara Group deposits formed part of an extensive, latitudinal evaporite belt, with a depocentre translated outwards relative to the Nafun basin, suggesting continuing tectonic progradation of the eastern margin of the ArabianNubian Shield.

Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139185 of eastern Gondwana is the most likely cause of Ara volcanism and tectonism, in which case the Oman area can be viewed as occupying a retro-arc setting at this stage, between a subducting margin and the East African orogen. Coeval calc-alkaline plutons and rhyolitic to andesitic volcanics are found in the Central Iranian Terrane. Neoproterozoic glaciations are recorded in the rift and passive margin stratigraphy predating the final amalgamation of continental fragments into greater Gondwana. In Oman, glaciation was contemporaneous with the development of an Andean-type orogen in the ArabianNubian Shield while passive margin basins continued to subside in northern Iran, India and South China. The elevated topography associated with the Andean-type orogen together with passive margin mega-escarpments may have promoted nucleation of ice caps that sourced marine-terminating valley glaciers and ice streams. However, the triggering of Cryogenian glaciation must ultimately be related to the biogeochemical cycles operating on a planet with a nascent land biota, lack of calcifying plankton and reduced solar luminosity. 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. 7. Conclusions: Recent advances in the understanding of the sedimentology, chemostratigraphy and geochronology of the Huqf Supergroup of Oman has highlighted the importance of the Omani Neoproterozoic-earliest Cambrian stratigraphy in assessing regional tectonics and global climate history.The Abu Mahara Group was deposited on exhumed continental crust that was formed principally at 825 850 Ma, most likely related to subduction. Its subsequent evolution during the Cryogenian can initially be closely linked with the accreted terranes of Arabia, especially those of nearby Yemen. Unroofed 825+ Ma plutons, metamorphic complexes, younger (750710 Ma) dykes and small unfoliated granitoid stocks and 800 Ma felsic volcanics provided detritus, including zircons, for the GhubrahAyn basins, in which an older Cryogenian glaciation is recorded. Reactivation of basin development associated with basaltic volcanism took place at ca. 650 Ma, correlative with the termination of a long period of terrane accretion in the ArabianNubian Shield and peak metamorphism in the East African orogen. The Fiq basin received detritus from progressively unroofing provenance areas, including new sources from synrift volcanics and MesoPalaeoproterozoic terranes. The end of the younger Cryogenian (Fiq) glaciation is marked by basin deepening and overstep of basement-cored highs by the post-glacial transgressive Hadash carbonate.Basin subsidence during the Nafun Group was extensive, with major lithostratigraphic packages being correlatable far to the west and north of Oman. The 1 km-thick Nafun Group is thought to have been deposited in a rim basin, perched close to the continental margin, due to thermal contraction following continental179P.A. Allen / Earth-Science Reviews 84 (2007) 139185stretching, and to have been connected to the open ocean through corridors in the north and northeast. Additional sources for 600640 Ma detrital zircons of the Nafun Group include igneous suites of the ArabianNubian Shield, suggesting that Oman had long been sutured to the ArabianNubian Shield by this stage. MesoPalaeoproterozoic sources may include basement fragments of the Afif (Khida) or Yemeni (Abas, Al-Mukalla) terranes.The change to the Ara Group is marked by a tectonic compartmentalization that caused rapid facies changes from relatively elevated carbonate platforms to intervening troughs accumulating salt. At the same time, an onset of volcanism is associated with the start of subduction of proto-Tethyan ocean floor around the periphery of eastern Gondwana. The Oman area was squeezed between this subduction margin and the welt of the megasuture in the Arabian Nubian Shield.The older Cryogenian glaciation took place at a time of globally dispersed continents following the breakup of Rodinia. The younger Cryogenian glaciation occurred close to the time of the peak of mountain building in the East African Orogen. There seem to be no simple clues relating the Neoproterozoic glaciations preserved in the Huqf Supergroup to plate positions or tectonic topography. The preservation of glacial successions in rift basins and continental margin basins may be more an effect of enhanced preservation than implying any direct causal link between tectonics and climate change."
__label__SUPPORT	"Further evidence of important environmental information content in red-to-green ratios as depicted in paintings by great masters  Abstract: We examine sunsets painted by famous artists as proxy information for the aerosol optical depth after major volcanic eruptions. Images derived from precision colour protocols applied to the paintings were compared to online images, and found that the latter, previously analysed, provide accurate information. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) at 550 nm, corresponding to Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes, calculated by introducing red-to-green (R / G) ratios from a large number of paintings to a radiative transfer model, were significantly correlated with independent proxies from stratospheric AOD and optical extinction data, the dust veil index, and ice core volcanic indices. AODs calculated from paintings were grouped into 50-year intervals from 1500 to 2000. The year of each eruption and the 3 following years were defined as volcanic. The remaining non-volcanic years were used to provide additional evidence of a multidecadal increase in the atmospheric optical depths during the industrial revolution. The increase of AOD at 550 nm calculated from the paintings grows from 0.15 in the middle 19th century to about 0.20 by the end of the 20th century. To corroborate our findings, an experiment was designed in which a master painter/colourist painted successive sunsets during and after the passage of Saharan aerosols over the island of Hydra in Greece. Independent solar radiometric measurements confirmed that the master colourists R / G ratios which were used to model his AODs, matched the AOD values measured in situ by co-located sun photometers during the declining phase of the Saharan aerosol. An independent experiment was performed to understand the difference between R / G ratios calculated from a typical volcanic aerosol and those measured from the mineral aerosol during the Hydra experiment. It was found that the differences in terms of R / G ratios were small, ranging between 2.6 % and +1.6 %. Also, when analysing different parts of cloudless skies of paintings following major volcanic eruptions, any structural differences seen in the paintings had not altered the results discussed above. However, a detailed study on all possible sources of uncertainties involved (such as the impact of clouds on R / G ratios) still needs to be studied. Because of the large number of paintings studied, we tentatively propose the conclusion that regardless of the school, red-to-green ratios from great masters can provide independent proxy AODs that correlate with widely accepted proxies and with independent measurements. Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 2988 C. S. Zerefos et al.: Further evidence of important environmental information content 6 Conclusions: Understanding the atmospheric composition of the past centuries is a very difficult task due to scarcity of available measurements. Especially for atmospheric components such as aerosols and their variability over the past 500 years, relevant information is rare (Thornes and Constable, 1999; Grattan, 2006; Zerefos et al., 2007). In this work we have expanded the idea of Zerefos et al. (2007), which used an alternative and indirect way of using the Angstroms law of atmospheric physics that describes the different effects of aerosols on the different wavelengths (colours) of solar light, together with the use of an alternative database of solar light representations, calculated from paintings by great masters in the past centuries.At first, a series of paintings by master painters (in the period of 15002000) have been revisited and comparisons between digital images of paintings from lower resolution vs. high resolution, derived from high precision protocols, showed similar results, as far as the R / G ratios measured at sunsets are concerned. Statistically significant correlation coefficients were found between the R / G ratio values retrieved from low quality/resolution and high quality/resolution digital images at a sample of 124 landscape paintings from the Tate Gallery. The earlier estimates of the aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (based on R / G calibrated ratios from paintings) and the radiative transfer model by Mayer and Kylling (2005) and Mayer and Emde (2007) were used to compile an independent time series with AODs during 15002000. The correlation coefficients between other proxy indices and the estimated AODs from the R / G ratios from paintings are statistically significant. Also the precision by which the extremeAtmos. Chem.

Zerefos et al.: Further evidence of important environmental information content 2995112Figure 9 3112Figure 10 34AODs between paintings and proxies, during large volcanic eruptions, match in most cases.The comparison between 50-year averages of the AODs (from R / G paintings) with the total sulfate in ice core and the stratospheric AOD, from which the year of known large volcanic eruptions and the three years that followed were excluded, shows that compared to the pre-industrial period, the industrial period had higher aerosol content, as it is well known and expected from independent data sets in the literature (e.g. Neftel et al., 1985; Robock and Free, 1995; Robertson et al., 2001; Forster et al., 2007). Based on the information retrieved from the paintings studied, we estimated thisincrease to range from 0.15 (middle 19th century) to about 0.20 (by the end of the 20th century).Finally, to corroborate our findings, an experiment was designed in which a master painter/colourist painted successive sunsets during the passage of a Saharan dust outbreak over our experimental site (island of Hydra, Greece) on 19 and 20 June 2010. The master painter did not know anything about the passage of a Saharan dust event. Our independent sunphotometric measurements at Hydra confirmed that the calculated AOD values from R / G ratios measured in the master colourist paintings, matched quite well to the AOD values measured in situ as well as with measurements from a digital camera. It should be noted here that all four watercolours by Panayiotis Tetsis were digitized using the same procedures and standards applied to all works of art photographed by the Photographic Department of the National Gallery, London. These findings point to the conclusion that the experiment provides a new presentation of how a painter, a digital camera and scientific instruments capture changes in R / G ratios at high and low aerosol overhead cases.The new information in the paper can be summarized as follows:The comparison of high precision with low precision colour protocol images at independent samples of paintings from the Tate and the National Galleries in London strengthen the tentative results proposed in an earlier paper by Zerefos et al. (2007).AODs from a multi-hundred sample of paintings show statistically significant correlations with independent proxies.Structural differences in paintings do not seem to alter the above results. The signal-to-noise ratios following volcanic eruptions are statistically significant.When averaged in 50-year intervals, AODs from paintings in non-volcanic years agree with completely independent data sets with the observed increases of the industrial aerosol in the past 150 years.R / G ratios calculated from different natural profiles such as from volcanic aerosols and Saharan mineral aerosols showwww.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/2987/2014/ Atmos.

This explains how the experiment performed with an internationally known master colourist arrived at similar results with an increase in R / G ratios during the passage of a Saharan dust event.Regardless of the school, red-to-green ratios from great masters can provide independent proxy AODs that correlate with widely accepted proxies and with independent measurements.The main conclusion of the paper is that nature speaks to the hearts and souls of the artists. When colouring sunsets the R / G ratios perceived by the brain contain important environmental information. It remains to an interdisciplinary community to study further the evidence presented in this research.Acknowledgements.

__label__UNRELATED	"Internal structure of the ice sheet between Kohnen station and Dome Fuji, Antarctica, revealed by airborne radio-echo sounding  Abstract: This study aims to demonstrate that deep ice cores can be synchronized using internal horizons in the ice between the drill sites revealed by airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) over a distance of >1000 km, despite significant variations in glaciological parameters, such as accumulation rate between the sites. In 2002/03 a profile between the Kohnen station and Dome Fuji deep ice-core drill sites, Antarctica, was completed using airborne RES. The survey reveals several continuous internal horizons in the RES section over a length of 1217 km. The layers allow direct comparison of the deep ice cores drilled at the two stations. In particular, the counterpart of a visible layer observed in the Kohnen station (EDML) ice core at 1054m depth has been identified in the Dome Fuji ice core at 575m depth using internal RES horizons. Thus the two ice cores can be synchronized, i.e. the ice at 1560m depth (at the bottom of the 2003 EDML drilling) is 49 ka old according to the Dome Fuji age/depth scale, using the traced internal layers presented in this study. CONCLUSIONS: We succeeded in tracing eight internal RES horizons along a 1217 km profile along the ice divide from Dome Fuji to Kohnen station. Moreover, we have been able to identifycorresponding visible layers documented in the EDML and Dome Fuji ice cores using these horizons. Thus the age/ depth scale of the Dome Fuji deep ice core (Watanabe and others, 2003) could be transferred to the EDML ice core drilled at Kohnen station. Finally, an age of 49 ka has been derived for the 1560m deep EDML ice core retrieved in the 2002/03 field season. We have thus demonstrated the potential of RES horizons to synchronize climate records derived from ice cores drilled at sites >1000 km apart."
__label__UNRELATED	"Incision of a river curvature due to exhumed Miocene volcanic landforms: Danube Bend, Hungary  Abstract: A new model for the formation and relief evolution of the Danube Bend, northern Hungary, is discussed on geomorphological and volcanological grounds. We propose that the present-day U-shaped loop of the Danube Bend was partly inherited from the horseshoe caldera morphology of Keser} us Hill volcano, a mid-Miocene (ca 15 Ma) lava dome complex with an eroded central depression open to the north. According to combined palaeogeographical data and erosion rate calculations, the drainage pattern in the Danube Bend region was formed when Pleistocene tectonic movements resulted in river incision and sedimentary cover removal. Formation of the present curvature of the river was due to the exhumation of the horseshoe-shaped caldera as well as the surrounding resistant volcaniclastic successions (i.e. Visegrad Castle Hill) and a hilltop lava dome (Szent Mihaly Hill). The process accelerated and the present narrow gorge of the Danube Bend was formed by very rapid, as young as late Quaternary differential tectonic uplift, also enhancing the original volcanic morphology. On the basis of comparative long-term erosion-rate calculations, we estimated successive elevation changes of the volcanic edifice, including partial burial in late Miocene time. In comparison with various order-of-magnitude changes, the mid-to-late Quaternary vertical movements show increased rates and/or base level drop in the Pannonian Basin. Conclusion: The Pleistocene evolution of the Danube Bend is proposed to be governed by the exhumation of the original Miocene volcanic relief. In the Northern Visegrad Mountains, the main Keser}us Hill volcanic edifice was a lava dome complex, characterized by a horseshoeshaped scar open to the north. Reconstruction of the original volcanic cone, that was made up mostly of resistant block-and-ash flow breccias, is supported by plotting detailed dip measurements against present topography. The lava-capped Szent Mihaly Hill to the north and the resistant Visegrad Castle Hill breccias to the east were also among the least erodible features.Postvolcanic relief evolution of the volcanic edifice has been constrained by subsequent, mostly Pannonian sedimentation, various climates and, especially since the Plio-Pleistocene, tectonic movements. A fluvial regime replaced the initial marine and subsequent lacustrine environments during Pliocene times, when an alluvial plain may have formed on the Pannonian sediments in the northern foreground of Keser}us Hill volcano.Early rivers dewatering large north Carpathian catchment areas should have appeared in that plain. As a result of occasional high discharges as well as tectonic movements, intense fluvial erosion of the trunk channel and short bedrock tributaries led to the ultimate removal of postvolcanic sedimentary cover.More recent differential uplift and erosion base level drop had fundamental effects on the drainage pattern. After the sedimentary cover was removed, the reappearance of the horseshoe caldera determined the shape of the river pathway. As the incision of the Danube has continued, the caldera morphology has been progressively exhumed and morphologically enhanced. In addition, the exposed, resistant volcanic formations to the north (Szent Mihaly Hill) and east (Visegrad Castle Hill) were also capable of topographically controlling the river curvature. Eventually, the present-day Danube Bend has been fixed in between. Position of river terraces combined with uplift/river incision rates shows that most of the inferred process should have occurred during mid-to-late Quaternary times.Acknowledgments The Hungarian National Scientific Fund (OTKA T043644, T047104, F043346 and F043715), the German Research Foundation (DFG, Fr 610/201) are thanked for financial support, as well as the Bolyai Postdoctoral Fellowship (BO-00175/100) to DK, the Magyary Postdoctoral Fellowship to KN, the Bekesy Postdoctoral Fellowship to BSz and the Marie Curie Fellowship to ZsRR.

__label__UNRELATED	"Possible Juventae Chasma subice volcanic eruptions and Maja Valles ice outburst floods on Mars: Implications of Mars Global Surveyor crater densities, geomorphology, and topography  Abstract: [1] This article discusses image, topographic, and spectral data from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission that provide new information concerning the surface age, geomorphology, and topography of the Juventae Chasma/Maja Valles system. Our study utilizes data from two instruments on board MGS: images from the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and topography from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Within Maja Valles we can now observe depositional bars with megaripples that unequivocally show catastrophic floods occurred in the channel. Viking impact crater densities indicated the chasma and channel floor areas were all one age (late Hesperian to Amazonian); however, MOC data indicate a marked difference in densities of small craters between Juventae Chasma, Maja Valles, and the channel debouchment area in Chryse Planitia basin. Although other processes may contribute to crater variability, young resurfacing events in the chasma and episodes of recent erosion at Maja Valles channel head may possibly account for the disparate crater densities along the chasma/channel system. Relatively young volcanic eruptions may have contributed to resurfacing; as in Juventae Chasma, a small possible volcanic cone of young dark material is observed. MOC data also indicate previously unknown interior layered deposit mounds in the chasma that indicate at least two periods of mound formation. Finally, MOLA topography shows that the entire floor of the chasma lies at the same elevation as the channel debouchment area in Chryse basin, resulting in a 3-km-high barrier to water flow out of the chasma. Blocked ponded water would rapidly freeze in the current (and likely past) climate of Mars. For catastrophic flow to occur in Maja Valles, some process is required to melt ice and induce floods out of the chasma. We suggest subice volcanic eruption and calculate estimates of water discharges and volumes that these eruptions might have produced. 4. Discussion and Conclusion: [33] MGS data has provided many new insights into the origins of the Maja Valles/Juventae Chasma system. For instance, new crater counts from MOC (N/A) images indicate variable surface ages along the length of the channel, with the channel mouth being the oldest surface. Large-scale bars with megaripples, obstacle marks and kettle holes observed on MOC images indicate the catastrophic flooding truly occurred in Maja Valles. A variably cratered streamlined island indicates at least two periods of flooding occurred at the head of the channel. Sparse impact craters near the headwater area suggest the latest flood episode may be relatively recent, perhaps Amazonian in age. Better age information was unattainable, asincremental crater plots [Hartmann et al., 2001] did not provide good statistics for these resurfaced areas. MOC images show evidence of late-stage ground ice in the chasma (such as thermokarst pits and brittle fracture of materials), as well as a small craterless cone that suggests recent volcanism. If the ILD mounds are subice volcanoes, then image data imply that at least two periods of flooding may be supported by at least two stages of mound formation in Juventae Chasma. MOLA topography indicates a 3-km topographic barrier to water flow between Juventae Chasma and Maja Valles. Assuming subice volcanism generated floods, it is possible to use the heights and volumes of the mound, the morphology of the chasma, and calorimetry values of known eruptions to estimate that Maja was cut by several floods having discharges of up to 106 m3/s. These floods could have been generated from melted ice, and beneath the ice they were driven by heat and the gravity potential to flow over the barrier and out of the chasma. These calculated discharges are much lower than those generated by channel morphology methods, but they may reflect more realistic estimates of flow, as channels rarely fill valleys to bank-full flood stage. [34] Crater-count data presented in this paper suggest that floods from the youngest episode either did not reach the full extent of the channel or had very little effect on surface modification of the lower channel areas. On Lunae Planum, along the northern downstream area of Maja Valles, MOC images show no evidence of young floods and MOLA data show no topographic lows capable of ponding floodwaters. [35] Although MOC images show clear evidence of catastrophic flooding in the mid-section of Maja Valles, we cannot rule out the possibility of debris flows and/or glacial erosion downstream. Though no evidence of flowing ice has yet been observed, the frigid temperatures of Mars, the extraordinary runouts of the circum-Chryse outflow channels, and some geomorphic features may suggest some combination of catastrophic flooding, mass flow, and glacial action [Chapman and Scott, 1989; De Hon and Pani, 1993]. [36] Catastrophic flood features in the mid-section of Maja Valles also do not rule out a pre-flood origin of the system associated with mass flows or cryoclastic flows. Some process such as volcanism or cryoclastic eruption had to create the chasma void in order to pond the ice that sourced subsequent floods. In the cryoclastic flow scenario,the initial eruption of subsurface CO2 would not preclude ice in the chasma [Chapman and Tanaka, 2002]. A CO2 aquifer, as modeled by Hoffman [2000], may overlie liquid water that could infill surface voids after CO2 eruption (N. Hoffman, personal communication, 2001) and freeze. Creation of the void by CO2 eruption, later water filling thechasmata, subsequent ice melting by subice volcanism, and jokulhlaup-induced mass flows could presumably all be due to the continued rise of local magma sources to the surface [Chapman and Tanaka, 2002]. [37] Finally, new MGS data are providing information about relatively young processes in the chasma. For example, MOC images indicate a young cone of dark material that may be a volcano. These types of young vents may have produced the dark mafic deposits in the Valles Marineris chasmata. MOC N/A image crater counts indicate a very young surface age of Juventae Chasma may be due to surface modification by late-stage erosion of friable target rocks, disruption by melting of late-stage ground ice, the young mafic volcanic activity, some material subsequently removed that protected the area from impacts (dust, ice?), and recent eolian activity. [38] Though many circum-Chryse outflow channels have multiple sources, Juventae Chasma is an isolated chasma that sourced the Maja Valles channel. These unique characteristics suggest the Juventae Chasma/Maja Valles can be considered a perhaps simpler type example of this kind of collapse-fed channel system. Additional detailed geologic mapping of the entire chasma/channel system may provide clues to help evaluate the nature, origin, and age of (1) chasmata; (2) chaotic material; (3) ILDs; and (4) outflow channels.[39] Acknowledgments.

Miocene potassic to ultrapotassic volcanism is widespread in southern Tibet and has been generally attributed to convective removal of collision-thickened Asian lithosphere, which is also responsible for the uplift of the plateau. An implicit assumption of this model is the existence of a hydrous, metasomatized (i.e., phlogopite bearing) lithospheric mantle that remained after the convective thinning and was subsequently heated to form small-volume melts. If such a lithospheric mantle was present in the Miocene, it implies further change since that time, as seismic velocities indicate that cold and strong upper mantle occurs beneath the thick crust in southern Tibet. Here we describe peridotite xenoliths entrained in Middle Miocene ultrapotassic lavas from Sailipu, southern Tibet. The results suggest the existence of hot, highly metasomatized lithospheric mantle beneath southern Tibet during the Middle Miocene, and thus support the idea that convective thinning of the lithosphere was responsible for the uplift of the plateau. The relict mantle was later removed or squeezed northward by the underthrusting Indian continental lithosphere, which terminated magmatism in southern Tibet and played a role in creating the entire plateau. CONCLUSIONS: Peridotite xenoliths entrained in the Sailipu ultrapotassic rocks were derived from lithospheric mantle rather than representing cognate cumulates of the host lavas. Their compositions confi rm the existence of hot, wet, and thinned mantle lithosphere beneath southern Tibet during the Miocene. All these characteristics support the view that the thickened Asian lithospheric mantle had been convectively thinned by the Middle Miocene, and that this removal led to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau."

Synthetic data on the paleogeographic history of Northeastern Atlantic and Betic-Rifian basin, during the Neogene (from Brittany, France, to Morocco) 95:263-286 This paper presents the results of a synthetic compilation of the studies of Neogene marine deposits recognized on the northeastern Atlantic coast from Morocco to northern France. The shoreline fluctuations as well as the tectonic and climatic events are discussed regarding the following time intervals and eustatic cycles: late Oligocene, TB 1.4 cycle (ca 25-22.7 Ma); Aquitanian, TB1.5 cycle (22.7-20.6 Ma); Burdigalian, TB2.1-2 cycles (20.6-16.5 Ma); Langhian Serravallian, TB2.3-6 cycles (16.510.4 Ma); Tortonian, TB3.1-2 cycles (10.4-6.4 Ma); Messinian, TB3.3-4 (pars) cycles (6.4-5.3 Ma) and Pliocene (5.3-1.8 Ma). Marine Upper Chattian is well represented in the Aquitaine Basin (France), with various facies formed in a tropical climate. During the Aquitanian and the Burdigalian, the transgressions extended in wide neritic gulfs in France, Portugal, Spain and North of Morocco. The Middle Miocene transgression is well pronounced in the different areas. In the Betico-Rifian realm, overthrusts are established and the flysch resorption is concluded at the end of that time. During the Upper Miocene, the marine realm is locally back from the preceding one; outstanding events occurred in the tectonic Betico-Rifian basin, the eastern part of which was affected by the Mediterranean salinity crisis during the Messinian. Finally, in the Pliocene, most of the features of the modern palaeogeography are evidenced, even when the coastal frontage of several areas is still affected by little transgressions."
__label__UNRELATED	"The community ecology of Asian rain forests, in relation to catastrophic events  Abstract: Although natural catastrophic disturbance of tropical forests in Asia can be caused by volcanism and earthquakes climate-induced catastrophes are most widespread. These are prevalent and most diverse at high tropical latitudes because of the single annual dry and wet monsoon. Comparative studies indicate that periodicity of catastrophes may influence forest physiognomy, structure and species richness but long-term research in sample plots suggests that a variety of other factors are locally influential. The importance of accounting for natural catastrophes in silvicultural protocols is stressed, and research priorities identified."
__label__UNRELATED	"Magnetostratigraphy and tephrochronology of the Upper Quaternary sediments in the Okhotsk Sea: implication of terrigenous, volcanogenic and biogenic matter supply  Abstract: Seven lithological units, alternating between horizons enriched in biogenic opal (diatoms) and carbonate (foraminifera) and units composed largely of terrigenous sediment with very low biogenic admixture, were distinguished in a series of Late Quaternary sediment cores from the Sea of Okhotsk. Sediments were characterised using on-board visual description, smear-slides analyses, grain-size composition and magnetic susceptibility (MS) records. Five tephra marker layers, identified as Ko, TR, K2, K3 and K4, were distinguished using petrological, mineralogical and geochemical analyses. Age models were developed by comparing lithological units, tephra stratigraphy and MS records with oxygen isotope curves and with records of biogenic CaCO3, opal content, and sediment grain-size composition in three AMS radiocarbon dated Okhotsk cores. This chronological framework allowed us to investigate climate control over the sedimentation regime and productivity, and to clarify the formation times of the lithological and tephra units. The data show that sediment MS variations in the south-eastern area of the glacial Okhotsk Sea arose primarily from volcanic material input. The sedimentation in all other parts of the sea was mainly controlled by the supply of terrigenous material. The cores show a tight correlation between MS, sediment grain size and climate change in the Okhotsk Sea: coarse sediments with a high MS were accumulated during the cold period-oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 2, 4, 6; fine sediments with a low ice-rafted debris (IRD) content and MS were formed in the warm isotope stages. According to the oxygen isotope stratigraphy and radiocarbon data, the Ko, TR, K2, K3 and K4 tephra were deposited at 7.7, 8.0, 26.0 kyr BP, in MIS 4 about 60^70 kyr ago, and near MIS 5.4, respectively. Comparison of tephra mineralogy, petrology, spatial distributions and ages with the history of Kurile^Kamchatka volcanism allows us to identify likely candidates for the tephra source eruptions. The combined use of MS records, tephrochronology and lithological unit sequences provides a detailed basis for Okhotsk Sea sediment stratigraphy. ? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Conclusions: A sequence of seven LU (diatomaceous ooze (1), transitional (2), foraminifera bearing (3), terrigenous I (4), biogenic II (5), terrigenous II (6) and biogenic III (7)) was identied in the series of the Late Quaternary sediment cores using on-board sediment descriptions, smearslides analyses, grain-size composition and MS records. The age models of cores V34-90, V34-98 andMARGO 3063 2-5-02936, based on oxygen-isotope stratigraphy and AMS 14C data, provide a time-scale for the LU. Records of CaCO3 and opal content, grain-size composition and MS throw light on their relationship with the climate changes in the Okhotsk Sea. The terrigenous LU 4, with few biogenic components and low CaCO3 and opal content occurred during MIS 2^4 and 5.1^5.4, and is associated with the glacial mode of surface environment and with low productivity. LU 5, characterised by a high diatom and foraminifera content, is associated with the highly productive interglacial mode of Okhotsk Sea hydrology, being coeval with the pronounced global warming of MIS 5.5. The preceding terrigenous LU 6 can be tentatively correlated with glacial MIS 6, and the biogenic LU 7 with the warm events of MIS 7. The sequence of (foraminifera-bearing) LU 3, (transitional) LU 2 and (diatomaceous ooze) LU 1, spanning the periods of 12.4^8.3 kyr, 8.3^5.5 kyr and 5.5 kyr-present, respectively, demonstrates the progression from glacial (LU 4) to interglacial mode sedimentation (LU 1) in the Okhotsk Sea. The mapping of MS distribution in the Okhotsk Sea sediments, using average glacial MS values, allows us to delineate a south-eastern area adjoining the northern Kuriles and southern Kamchatka, which is inuenced by input of volcanic material. Sedimentation in the main part of the sea was mainly governed by the supply of terrigenous material. The observed patterns of variability in MS, IRD and silt fractions in the dated cores V34-98 and 936 show a primary climate control of the sedimentation regime, with a high MS during cold MIS 2 and 4 and a low MS for warmer MIS 1, 3, 5.1, 5.3, and 5.5 and probably MIS 7. The Ko, TR, K2, K3 and K4 tephra were separated and identied in the Okhotsk Sea cores using their petrological, mineralogical, morphological and geochemical parameters as well as refractive index and colour. The age models of cores V34-90, V34-98, 936 and the time scale of the LU sequence and MS records dene these tephra ages and stratigraphy as 7.8, 8.0, 26.0 kyr BP, MIS 4 (60^70 kyr BP) and MIS 5.4, respectively. Comparisons of the observed tephra characteristics,their dispersal patterns and ages with the history of Kurile^Kamchatka volcanism suggest possible candidates for the source eruptions. Eruptions of the Tao^Rusyr Volcano (Onekotan Island), Kurile Lake Volcano (south Kamchatka), and Nemo III volcano (Nemo-III caldera, Onekotan Island) likely produced the TR, Ko and K2 tephra, respectively. We suggest that an earlier eruption of the Nemo Volcano (oldest Nemo-I caldera, Onekotan Island) and one of the volcanoes in the middle Kurile Island Arc produced the K3 and K4 tephra. By correlating visual stratigraphy and geochemical properties across two suites of Okhotsk Sea cores we have developed a coherent set of MS records, LU sequence and tephrochronology which provide a detailed stratigraphic framework for Okhotsk Sea sediments. MS and litho-stratigraphy, which are strongly controlled by variations in the accumulation of the coarse terrigenous and the biogenic components, represent the response of the sedimentation regime, biota and productivity of the Okhotsk Sea to the regional climate change."
__label__UNRELATED	"Holocene lake development of two Dalmatian lagoons (Malo and Veliko Jezero, Isle of Mljet) in respect to changes in Adriatic sea level and climate  Abstract: Within the Austrian IGBP=PAGES project Palaeolimnology of AdriaticAlpine Lakes (PAAL), geochemical and diatom analyses were performed on sediment cores of Malo and Veliko Jezero, two karstic coastal lakes on the island Mljet, Croatia. Combined with diatom calibration, they provide evidence of remarkable environmental changes during the Holocene. The formation of the lakes in the early Holocene was triggered by a rise in the Adriatic sea level from approximately 50 to 30 m, which resulted in the transmission of seawater through karst, and by a temporary increase in precipitation. The onset of this pluvial period was dated in Malo Jezero at 8.4 kyr B.P. and had its maximum approximately 76 kyr B.P. It was briefly interrupted by a dryer episode from about 7.2 until 7.1 kyr B.P. Between 6 and 5.5 kyr B.P., a transition to the present Mediterranean climate occurred. The marine ingression into Veliko Jezero through the Soline channel, with a present depth of 2.5 m, took place about 5 kyr B.P. From 5 to 4 kyr B.P., the oscillating sea level gradually approached the present value. A tephra layer at 7.3 kyr B.P. in both lakes was related to sudden environmental changes that were probably caused by tectonic movements accompanying Italian volcanism. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: We suggest that lake formation was influenced by the rise of the Adriatic Sea and, at least temporarily, by an increase in precipitation. It was possible to ascertain the sea level rise because the shallow lake basin of Malo Jezero was filled up later than that of Veliko. The initial brackish conditions in Malo Jezero in the time interval 8.88.4 kyr B.P. correspond in Veliko to a change from a slightly brackish swamp to a lake with higher salinity. It may be due to both the transmission of seawater through the permeable karst (caused by the Adriatic sea level rise from approximately 50 to 30 m) and enhanced evaporation. In both lakes the brackish environment was followed by the onset of distinct freshwater incursions about 8.4 kyr B.P., indicating increased precipitation. It correlates with climate and environmental changes detected for the Mediterranean: in the Italian crater lake Albano, marked biostratigraphic changes were observed by Manca et al. (1996) for this time; these were interpreted as climatic deterioration. From foraminiferal oxygen isotopic records, Kallel et al. (1996, 1997) observed a cooling of the spring sea surface temperature (up to 2.5oC) and a salinity decrease in the Thyrrenean Sea, corresponding to the onset of sapropel deposition. They considered a pluvial phase lasting from approximately 8 until 4.5 kyr B.P. In the southernAdriatic a change to sapropelithic sedimentation was recorded at 8.6 kyr B.P. by Fontugne et al. (1989). The observation of pluvial periods extends also to Northern Africa, where Adamson et al. (1980) detected a mid-Holocene moisture interval, with an upper boundary of 5 kyr B.P.A tephra layer of probably Campanian provenience was deposited at 7.3 kyr B.P., being an excellent stratigraphic marker in both Mljet lakes. Tephra deposition was accompanied by environmental changes. Presumably, tectonic movements related to Italian volcanism caused a sudden seawater transmission through the more permeable karst system into Veliko Jezero.About 7.1 kyr B.P. a short dryer phase was detected, separating an older and a younger pluvial phase. Corresponding indications are widespread in the Mediterranean, and observed in different environments: in Spain, from low lake levels and expansion of sclerophyllous vegetation (Jalut et al., 1997); and in the Thyrrenean (Kallel et al., 1997) and Adriatic Sea (Fontugne et al., 1989), from oxygen isotope fluctuations measured in foraminifers. This dry phase as observed in Malo Jezero was followed by a phase with indications of increased precipitation between ca. 7.1 and 6.3 kyr B.P. A transition to a Mediterranean climate followed (6.35.5 kyr B.P.), with the main precipitation during winter, but with less summer drought. The latter is indicated by the time lag of the expansion of Quercus ilex. In the aquatic environment in Malo a gradual decrease of summer precipitation was inferred from oligotrophication probably due to reduced nutrient input from catchment erosion during the growth period. However, if the dating is correct, the onset of the Mediterranean climax vegetation and summer drought in Mljet was approximately 1000 years earlier than inferred by Jalut et al. (1997) for the area in Spain north of 40oN.The marine ingression into Veliko Jezero over the Soline channel, with a modern elevation of 2.5 m, took place about 5 kyr B.P. From 5 to 4 kyr B.P. the oscillating sea level approached the present value.In conclusion, the unique situation of coastal lakes embedded within a karstic system made it possible to get valuable new information about the Adriatic sea levels and timing of the Holocene transgression.

__label__UNRELATED	"Major episodes of geologic change: correlations, time structure and possible causes  Abstract: Published data sets of major geologic events of the past ~ 250 Myr (extinction events, sea-level lows, continental flood-basalt eruptions, mountain-building events, abrupt changes in sea-floor spreading, ocean-anoxic and blackshale events and the largest evaporite deposits) have been synthesized (with estimated errors). These events show evidence for a statistically significant periodic component with an underlying periodicity, formally equal to 26.6 Myr, and a recent maximum, close to the present time. The cycle may not be strictly periodic, but a periodicity of ~ 30 Myr is robust to probable errors in dating of the geologic events. The intervals of geologic change seem to involve jumps in sea-floor spreading associated with episodic continental rifting, volcanism, enhanced orogeny, global sea-level changes and fluctuations in climate. The period may represent a purely internal earth-pulsation, but evidence of planetesimal impacts at several extinction boundaries, and a possible underlying cycle of 28-36 Myr in crater ages, suggests that highly energetic impacts may be affecting global tectonics. A cyclic increase in the flux of planetesimals might result from the passage of the Solar System through the central plane of the Milky Way Galaxy--an event with a periodicity and mean phasing similar to that detected in the geologic changes."
__label__UNRELATED	"Do phreatomagmatic eruptions at Ubehebe Crater (Death Valley, California) relate to a wetter than present hydroclimate?  Abstract: [1] Phreatomagmatic eruptions occur when rising magma encounters groundwater and/or surface water, causing a steam explosion and the ejection of country rock and pyroclastic material. The predominance of this type of activity at the Ubehebe volcanic field in northern Death Valley, California, is enigmatic owing to the extremely arid climate of the region. A novel application of Be surface exposure dating is presented to determine the timing of phreatomagmatic eruptions at Ubehebe Crater and to test the idea that volcanism may relate to a wetter than present hydro-climate. Twelve of the fifteen ages obtained lie between 0.8 and 2.1 ka, while three samples give older, mid-Holocene ages. The cluster between 0.8 and 2.1 ka is interpreted as encompassing the interval of volcanic activity during which Ubehebe Crater was formed. The remaining older ages are inferred to date eruptions at the older neighboring craters. The main and most recent period of activity encompasses the Medieval Warm Period, an interval of prolonged drought in the American southwest, as well as slightly wetter conditions prior to the Medieval Warm Period. Phreatomagmatic activity under varied hydrologic conditions casts doubt on the idea that eruptive timing relates to a wetter hydro-climate. Instead, the presence of a relatively shallow modern water table suggests that sufficient groundwater was generally available for phreatomagmatic eruptions at the Ubehebe site, in spite of prevailing arid conditions. This and the youth of the most recent activity suggest that the Ubehebe volcanic field may constitute a more significant hazard than generally appreciated. Citation: Sasnett, P., B. M. Goehring, N. Christie-Blick, and J. M. Schaefer (2012), Do phreatomagmatic eruptions at Ubehebe Crater (Death Valley, California) relate to a wetter than present hydro-climate?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L02401, doi:10.1029/2011GL050130. 6. Conclusions: [17] This study demonstrates that surface exposure dating can be successfully used to date volcanic eruptions with high precision if quartz-bearing materials are present. The ages obtained show that the most recent activity in the Ubehebe volcanic field is younger than anticipated, with much of the activity and the formation of Ubehebe Crater occurring between 2.1 ka and 0.8 ka. While the timing of eruptive activity overlaps with times of elevated precipitation, we cannot establish a clear relationship between phreatomagmatic activity and climatic fluctuations. Instead, we suggest that the requisite water was sourced from permanent groundwater located in Miocene conglomerates beneath the crater field. [18] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Apatite fission-track evidence for regional exhumation in the subtropical Eocene, block faulting, and localized fluid flow in east-central Alaska  Abstract: The origin and antiquity of the subdued topography of the YukonTanana Upland (YTU), the physiographic province between the Denali and Tintina faults, are unresolved questions in the geologic history of interior Alaska and adjacent Yukon. We present apatite fission-track (AFT) results for 33 samples from the 2300 km2 western Fortymile district in the YTU in Alaska and propose an exhumation model that is consistent with preservation of volcanic rocks in valleys that requires base level stability of several drainages since latest CretaceousPaleocene time. AFT thermochronology indicates widespread cooling below 110 C at 5647 Ma (early Eocene) and 4436 Ma (middle Eocene). Samples with 3327, 19, and 10 Ma AFT ages, obtained near a major northeast-trending fault zone, apparently reflect hydrothermal fluid flow. Uplift and erosion following 107 Ma magmatism exposed plutonic rocks to different extents in various crustal blocks by latest Cretaceous time. We interpret the Eocene AFT ages to suggest that higher elevations were eroded during the Paleogene subtropical climate of the subarctic, while base level remained essentially stable. Tertiary basins outboard of the YTU contain sediment that may account for the required >2 km of removed overburden that was not carried to the sea by the ancestral Yukon River system. We consider a climate driven explanation for the Eocene AFT ages to be most consistent with geologic constraints in concert with block faulting related to translation on the Denali and Tintina faults resulting from oblique subduction along the southern margin of Alaska. Resume : La question de lorigine et de lage du relief adouci des hautes terres du YukonTanana (HTYT), la province physiographique situee entre les failles de Denali et de Tintina, demeure sans reponse dans le contexte de lhistoire geologique de linterieur de lAlaska et du Yukon voisin. Nous presentons les resultats danalyses des traces de fission dans lapatite (TFA) pour 33 echantillons provenant du district de Fortymile occidental, dans les HTYT en Alaska, et proposons un modele dexhumation qui concorde avec la preservation de roches volcaniques dans les vallees, ce qui necessite que les niveaux de base de plusieurs bassins versants soient demeures stables depuis la periode du Cretace terminal-Paleocene. La thermochronologie par TFA indique un refroidissement repandu sous les 110 C a 5647 Ma (Eocene precoce) et 4436 Ma (Eocene moyen). Des echantillons presentant des ages TFA de 3327, 19 et 10 Ma, obtenus pres dune faille majeure dorientation nord-est, semblent refleter lecoulement de fluides hydrothermaux. Le soulevement et lerosion faisant suite au magmatisme a 107 Ma avaient, au Cretace terminal, expose a divers degres des roches plutoniques dans divers blocs crustaux. Nous en concluons que les ages TFA eocenes indiqueraient que les zones de plus haute elevation ont ete erodees durant la periode de climat subtropical de la region subarctique au Paleogene, alors que le niveau de base demeurait essentiellement stable. Des bassins dage tertiaire distaux par rapport aux HTYT contiennent des sediments qui pourraient expliquer les plus de 2 km de materiaux sus-jacents retires qui nont pas ete transportes vers la mer par le reseau ancestral du fleuve Yukon. Nous estimons quune explication reliee au climat pour les ages TFA eocenes est ce qui correspond le mieux aux contraintes geologiques, de concert avec le morcellement par failles associe a la translation le long des failles de Denali et de Tintina resultant de la subduction oblique le long de la marge meridionale de lAlaska. [Traduit par la Redaction] Conclusions: Apatite fission-track results from the YukonTanana Upland document widespread Eocene cooling through the fission-track Partial Annealing Zone for a collection that is dominated by ridgetop samples in this region of comparatively low relief. Samples obtained near northeast-trending fault zones that separate major crustal blocks commonly yield Oligocene and Miocene AFT ages attributed to local hydrothermal fluid flow. Although no clear pattern of AFT cooling ages relative to exhumation levels of the various crustal blocks is evident, differential uplift of blocks likely played a role in the low-temperature thermal evolution of the YTU, as has been proposed for some areas. Uplift and erosion following mid-Cretaceous magmatism led to exposure of 107 Ma and older plutonic rocks in some fault-bounded blocks. Nevertheless, an additional mechanism is required to account for removal of >2 km of material, to explain the present surface position of material with Eocene AFT ages in interfluvial areas.Critical to interpreting the AFT results is geologic evidence that the Fortymile River drainage evidently has not experienced major change in base level since the latest Cretaceous (70 Ma) and other nearby drainages, such as the Charley and Goodpaster rivers, since at least the Paleocene. This observation suggests that Tertiary uplift and exhumation as a result of far-field effects of southern Alaskan convergent-plate tectonism is not the sole mechanism to explain Eocene cooling. We therefore propose a model in which the warm, wet late Paleocene middle Eocene subtropical climate, for which there is ample documentation across Arctic and subarctic North America, was responsible for weathering and erosion that led to rapid cooling of rocks that yield Eocene AFT ages. While valleys cut in the Late Cretaceous Paleocene remained stable, enhanced chemical weathering and frequent intense storm events would have shed overburden from interfluves, to be carried as fine-grained sediment either through the ancestral Yukon River (Kwikhpak River in Alaska) to the sea or deposited relatively nearby in the Nenana, Yukon Flats, and, possibly, Susitna basins. Lack of concurrent regional isostatic uplift may be explained by an increase in crustal density brought about by emplacement of unexposed mafic intrusions related to regional Paleogene bimodal magmatism. Although as yet imperfect, our model that invokes climate-driven selective exhumation of high ground appears to better explain widespread Eocene AFT ages in interior Alaska than does a mechanism dominated by tectonic forcing and uplift. Our data set, while nonideal in its design, sets the stage for future, closely spaced sampling for lowtemperature thermochronologic systems along transects across the highest elevations, deepest valleys, and most important structures in the YTU."

The results show that clay minerals at Site U1340 are dominated by illite, with a moderate amount of smectite and chlorite, and minor kaolinite. Sediment source studies suggest that the clay mineral assemblages and their sources in the studied core are controlled primarily by the climate conditions. During the warm periods, clay minerals originated mainly from the adjacent Aleutian Islands, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios increased. During the cold periods, clay minerals from the Alaskan region distinctly increased, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios declined. Based on smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and clay mineral crystallinities, the evolutionary history of the paleoclimate was revealed in the Bering Sea. In general, the Bering Sea was characterized by warm and wet climate condition from 4.3 to 3.94 Ma, and then cold and dry condition associated with the enhanced volcanism from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thereafter, the climate gradually became cold and wet, and then was dominated by a cold and dry condition since 2.74 Ma, probably induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. The interval from 1.95 to 1.07 Ma was a transitional period of the climate gradually becoming cold and wet. After the middle Pleistocene transition (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), the Bering Sea was governed mainly by cold and wet climate with several intervals of warm climate at ~0.42 Ma (MIS 11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9) and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), respectively. During the last 9.21 ka (the Holocene), the Bering Sea was characterized primarily by relatively warm and wet climatic conditions. 5 Conclusions: The age model of IODP Site U1340 is amended, and the base age is calculated as about 4.3 Ma, that is, the late Early Pliocene (Late Zanclean).Clay mineral assemblages at Site U1340 consist mainly of illite (an average of 70%), followed by smectite and chlorite (an average of 17% and 10%, respectively), with minor kaolinite (an average of 3%). The sources of clay minerals are closely related to the climate conditions. During the warm periods, the clay minerals originated mainly from the adjacent Aleutian Islands, and smectite/(illite+ chlorite) ratios increased. During the cold periods, clay minerals from the Alaskan region distinctly increased, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios declined. Thus, the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio may be used as a proxy on climatechanges in the Bering Sea and adjacent regions. The evolutionary history of the paleoclimate was revealed in the Bering Sea based on smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and clay mineral crystallinities. In general, the Bering Sea was characterized by warm and wet climate condition from 4.3 to 3.94 Ma, and then cold and dry condition associated with the enhancing of the volcanism from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thereafter, the climate gradually became cold and wet, and then was dominated by the cold and dry climate since 2.74 Ma, probably induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. The interval from 1.95 to 1.07 Ma was a transitional period of the climate gradually becoming cold and wet. After the middle Pleistocene transition (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), the Bering Sea was governed mainly by cold and wet climate with several intervals of warm climate and intensified chemical weathering at ~0.42 Ma (MIS 11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9), and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), respectively.

__label__UNRELATED	"Patagonian continental deposits (Cretaceous-Tertiary)  Abstract: We review stratigraphic records from various continental basins throughout Patagonia from the Cretaceous to the Late Tertiary and show that they can be used to reconstruct the history of the region, including the number and extension of marine transgressions as a result of sea level changes, changes in climate, and changes in the composition of the vertebrate fauna. The various independent sedimentary basins are analyzed with respect to internal facies relationships and in relation to global changes in climate and oscillations of sealevel. Volcanic processes associated with active volcanic arcs contributed lavas and substantial volumes of pyroclastics during this time interval. The interplay between different geological processes that took place during this time shaped the landscape of the continent and changed the associated flora and fauna, which were developed in this region, differing from other areas of southern South America and part of West Antarctica. 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 103, 289304. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that stratigraphic records from various continental basins throughout Patagonia from the Cretaceous to the Late Tertiary can be used to reconstruct the history of the region, including the number and extension of marine transgressions as a result of sea level changes, changes in climate, and changes in the composition of the vertebrate fauna. Such changes are documented in the region, probably better than elsewhere in South America. The different pulses in Andean uplift can be described as recordedby the continental sequences. The Patagonian continental deposits are an ideal laboratory that can be used to improve our understanding of the evolution of this part of the South American continent.Thermal anomalies on the global climatic record occurring during this time are coeval with major tectonic events affecting the southern Andes. At various times between the Cretaceous and the Pliocene, sea level was significantly higher than at present and the implications of these changes in sea level for the palaeogeography of the region have been explained. For example, during the Cretaceous warm interval (approximately 90 to 80 Mya), global sea level was between 100 to 170 m higher than today, thus implying that the surface of Patagonia at that time was approximately 45% smaller than today. The changes from deep marine to very shallow seas that took place during the Cretaceous along the recently created southern Patagonian basins are in contrast with the open deep marine conditions between Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica during the Cenozoic. This configuration reflects the opposite movement of the Nazca Plate and the Antarctic plate when the Drake Passage was formed (Fig. 9).The record of continental mammalian fauna in Patagonia reflects a large-scale succession of climate changes. From the Early Palaeocene to the Pleistocene, the environment exhibited a consistent shift in climate changing from warm, wet and non-seasonal (Paleocene to Eocene) to cold and dry (Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene) and finally to seasonal (Middle to Late Miocene) (Barreda & Palazzesi, 2007). Concomitantly, biomes moved from tropical forest to steppes, through a sequence comprising subtropical forests, woodland savanna, park-savanna, and grassland savanna.Forests would have been widespread in the Palaeogene within areas now occupied by steppe. They have even been documented in the Early Neogene in the extra-Andean region, both based on the palynological and palaeobotanical evidence (Barreda & Palazzesi, 2007). The PalaeoceneEarly Eocene interval was dominated by rain forest, characterized mainly by very diverse vegetation in the Early Eocene.The full opening of the Drake passage during the Late Tertiary led to the isolation of Patagonia and of its continental fauna. The building of the Panama isthmus during the Early Miocene put the South and North American faunas in contact, thus rapidly inducing changes in the faunal composition of Patagonia."
__label__UNRELATED	"The subsurface geology of Rome: Sedimentary processes, sea-level changes and astronomical forcing  Abstract: Article history: Received 30 May 2013 Accepted 1 May 2014 Available online 10 May 2014 9. Conclusions: Investigation of the subsurface geology of the Rome area, performed by integrating outcrop and borehole data, has revealed four aggradational successions with coarse fluvial gravel at the base, grading upwards into sand and fluvial-lacustrine to coastal marine clay (Paleo-Tiber units 14). Two of these sequences are characterized by double aggradation cycles (Paleo-Tiber units 3AB and 4AB).Deposition of these aggradational successions follows the establishment of coastal continental conditions in the area of Rome at the end of the early Pleistocene, and precedes the start of the large explosive activity at the Albani Hills volcanic district at 561 1 ka.Time constraints provided by 40Ar/39Ar dating of interbedded tephra within these aggradational successions establishes a strict link between deposition and glacio-eustatic cycles between 800 and 600 ka.In particular, comparison of the timing of deposition of the PaleoTiber aggradational successions with the 18O record shows an overall good match between the deposition of five gravel sections and the occurrence of as many lowstands of the oxygen isotope curve, as well as between the deposition of six clay sections and the occurrence of as many highstands, in this time span.While the four major depositional sequences match the four 100 ky glacial cycles (MIS 21, 19, 17, 15), the two minor aggradation cycles match two prominent sub-stages of the isotope curve (MIS 18.3, 15.3).However, when the occurrence of the glacial terminations provided by the astronomical calibration of the isotope curve in the time span 900600 ka is compared to that provided by applying the model proposed by Marra et al. (2008) that identifies the sedimentary switch from gravel to clay in the aggradational successions of the Paleo-Tiber River with the flex points of this curve, a systematic mismatch is revealed.Deposition of the gravel sectionsmatches theminima of summer insolation at 65N preceding by oneprecession cycle those afterwhich the glacial terminations occur, based on the astrochronologic tuning of the 18O record. The common factor is that these minima were warmer than all the other minima of insolation occurring between 900 and 600 ka.We interpret this fact as the evidence that these relatively warmer minimawere able to trigger significant sea-level rise during the following maximum of insolation, causing aggradation of gravel beds within the coastal area of Rome. However, the lack of complete conditions required for the occurrence of glacial terminations (whose definition is not the aim of the present study) caused the aggradation of the sedimentary succession to be aborted, and eventually completed during the subsequent maximum of insolation, to which a full deglaciation was associated.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.05.001."
__label__UNRELATED	"Clay mineralogy of the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary successions of the Cauvery Basin (southeastern India): implications for sediment source and palaeoclimates at the K/T boundary  Abstract: Clay mineral analyses were carried out on late Maastrichtianearly Palaeocene (CretaceousTertiary) sedimentary rocks in the Ariyalur area of the Cauvery Basin (southeastern India). These investigations were aimed at determining the sedimentary provenance and palaeoclimate of the area in the latest Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary. The late Cretaceous deposits show significant palaeogeographic variation in clay mineral contents across the study area. Mixed-layer illite-smectites dominate the clay mineral content of the uppermost Maastrichtian of all areas, with elevated smectite, illite, palygorskite, sepiolite, kaolinite and chlorite occurring at intervals through the succession. This combination and widespread variation in the clay mineral suite suggests a lithologically highly variable source terrain and lack of sediment mixing during transport. Mixed-layer clays occur with both kaolinite and palygorskite, interpreted in terms of a seasonal (warm and wet, warm and dry) source area. The uppermost Maastrichtian of the Niniyur section displays an upward increase in illite content, suggesting that the adjacent continental area became strongly influenced by physical weathering just prior to the K/T boundary. The return of mixed-layer clays, smectite, illite and kaolinite during the early Tertiary suggests that chemical weathering in a seasonal climate once again controlled the formation of clay minerals. These results imply that the volcanism associated with the Deccan Traps had no sudden effect on the Cretaceous or Tertiary sedimentation and clay mineralogy of this area. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

__label__SUPPORT	"Variability of the ocean heat content during the last millennium an assessment with the ECHO-g Model  Abstract: Studies addressing climate variability during the last millennium generally focus on variables with a direct influence on climate variability, like the fast thermal response to varying radiative forcing, or the large-scale changes in atmospheric dynamics (e.g. North Atlantic Oscillation). The ocean responds to these variations by slowly integrating in depth the upper heat flux changes, thus producing a delayed influence on ocean heat content (OHC) that can later impact low frequency SST (sea surface temperature) variability through reemergence processes. In this study, both the externally and internally driven variations of the OHC during the last millennium are investigated using a set of fully coupled simulations with the ECHO-G (coupled climate model ECHAMA4 and ocean model HOPE-G) atmosphereocean general circulation model (AOGCM). When compared to observations for the last 55 yr, the model tends to overestimate the global trends and underestimate the decadal OHC variability. Extending the analysis back to the last one thousand years, the main impact of the radiative forcing is an OHC increase at high latitudes, explained to some extent by a reduction in cloud cover and the subsequent increase of shortwave radiation at the surface. This OHC response is dominated by the effect of volcanism in the preindustrial era, and by the fast increase of GHGs during the last 150 yr. Likewise, salient impacts from internal climate variability are observed at regional scales. For instance, upper temperature in the equatorial Pacific is controlled by ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) variability from interannual to multidecadal timescales. Also, both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AM ) modulate intermittently the interdecadal OHC variability in the North Pacific and Mid Atlantic, respectively. The NAO, through its influence on North Atlantic surface heat fluxes and convection, also plays an important role on the OHC at multiple timescales, leading first to a cooling in the Labrador and Irminger seas, and later on to a North Atlantic warming, associated with a delayed impact on the AMO. 6 Conclusions and discussion: The upper OHC response to the external forcing as well as the fingerprint of several modes of climate variability have been assessed in a suite of observations and model simulations covering the period 1000 to 2100 AD.Clim. Past, 9, 547565, 2013 www.clim-past.net/9/547/2013/In the instrumental period, the model overestimates the warming trend and underestimates the decadal OHC700 variability. The misrepresentation in trends is explained to some extent by the lack of sulphate aerosols in the simulations, whose cooling effect is known to partially offset the GHGdriven warming (Delworth et al., 2005). Note that aerosols have also been proposed to be a main contributor to North Atlantic decadal variability over the last century (Booth et al., 2012). The spatial distribution and intensity of the upper OHC warming trends have changed from 19551990 to 19912010. These changes respond, respectively, to a sustained increase of the net radiative forcing (mostly associated with an acceleration of GHG emissions) and a shift in the values of the PDO and AMO indices.All the long simulations are found to exhibit initial thermal instabilities, which in the case of FOR1 and FOR2 obey too short a spin-down period to bring the ocean to thermal equilibrium with the forcing conditions in year 1000 AD. To minimise the effect of the corresponding drift in temperature, the analysis only focuses on the OHC in the upper 700 m, where the CTRL run remains stable and FOR2 shows a good correspondence both with the net radiative forcing and two paleo records of global sea level change.The spatial imprint of the radiative forcing has also been analysed. All the individual forcings show a similar impact, with larger effect at extratropical latitudes. This larger response at midlatitudes is partly explained by a local reduc-tion in cloud cover, thus allowing a larger fraction of solar radiation to reach the ocean surface. Other contributions to the net surface heat flux, such as the outgoing longwave radiation or the sensible and latent heat fluxes, do not reproduce this different latitudinal response. In the preindustrial era, a large part of the forced OHC700 variability is associated with volcanism, with some solar contribution at interdecadal timescales (periods from 10 to 100 yr). After 1850, low-frequency OHC700 variability is mainly responding to the increased GHG concentrations, and the influence of volcanic activity remains important at decadal and intradecadal timescales. Interestingly, the ocean shows a delayed response to all the radiative forcings, with the largest impacts occurring about 2, 20 and 70 yr after the changes in volcanic, solar and GHG forcing, respectively.Finally, the contributions from four large-scale modes of climate variability have been explored (i.e. ENSO, the PDO, the AMO and the NAO). As their influence on the OHC700 is larger at regional scales, their spectral features have been directly analysed in their respective centres of action. In these four regions the long-term OHC700 variations still exhibit some modulation by the external forcing. Yet at shorter timescales (annual to secular) the regions show periods of spectral coherence with their corresponding climate indices. The influence of ENSO is mainly localised in the equatorial Pacific, where it is found to dominate the local OHC700 variability from interannual to multidecadal timescales. Likewise, positive PDO and AMO indices relate, respectively, to a cooling in the North Pacific and warming at midlatitudes in the North Atlantic, both modes contributing discontinuously to OHC700 variability at multidecadal timescales. The NAO, in the model and observations, produces a cooling over the Labrador Sea, which in the simulations gives rise to a strengthening of the AMOC cell. This impact takes place from interannual to interdecadal timescales. Furthermore, the fact that natural modes of climate variability, such as ENSO, NAO or AMO, can impact the OHC700 globally or locally is important for the coming decades, since they can temporarily mitigate or intensify the ocean warming signal and they can modulate as well the regional sea level rise.To assess the general relevance of these results, we now discuss the limitations of the ECHO-G model, and put it in the context of other AOGCMs. The major constraint relies on the use of flux adjustments (and more in particular heat flux corrections), since they can largely affect the ocean heat content and its regional patterns. However, a comparison of these terms with the actual fluxes at the surface (see SupplementTable 4 and Fig. 3) shows that in overall, and in particular in the centres of action of ENSO, the AMO and the NAO, the magnitude of heat adjustments remains considerably smaller, thus suggesting that their probable impact on ocean heat uptake is also small (Sausen et al., 1988). In contrast, freshwater adjustments remain comparably important, particularly across the Gulf Sream, thus evidencing that some ocean dynamics are misrepresented by the model, and thereby castingwww.clim-past.net/9/547/2013/ Clim. Past, 9, 547565, 2013doubt on the validity of our results for regions like the North Atlantic. In a recent study, (Pardaens et al., 2011) compared the spread in sea level projections (for which OHC relates directly with the thermosteric component) between two different ensembles within the QUMP (Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Projections) project, and found comparable results for the experiments with and without flux adjustments. That same study included a model intercomparison of SL in future projections, in which ECHO-G shows a great degree of coherence with the mean model ensemble, reproducing most of its different local features, like a SL dipole in the North Atlantic, a strong meridional gradient in the Southern Ocean with negative changes near 60 N and positive further north, and positive SL anomalies in the North Pacific, these latter two being coherent with the larger OHC700 changes in the extratropics found herein. In a different intercomparison study (Fernandez-Donado et al., 2012), the simulations FOR1 and FOR2 show values for the equilibrium climate sensitivity, the transient climate response and the temperature change in the MCA-LIA transition well within the range of the other millennial simulations, most of them not using flux corrections. However, it is important to note that ECHO-G stands out to have the smallest heat uptake efficiency among all the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models (Kuhlbrodt and Gregory, 2012). In either case, it is not clear what this implies in terms of the reliability of the model, as the same analysis states that models tend to overestimate this value. Indeed, ocean stratification (which controls how fast heat is transported downward and thereby contributes to the heat uptake efficiency) is rather realistic in ECHO-G when compared to observations and the ensemble of CMIP-3 and CMIP-5 simulations. To conclude, the ECHO-G overall performance, despite the flux corrections, seems comparable to that in other AOGCMs. However, evaluating the validity of our results in other model simulations is an important subject for further work.Supplementary material related to this article is available online at: http://www.clim-past.net/9/547/2013/ cp-9-547-2013-supplement.zip.Acknowledgements.

__label__UNRELATED	"Statistical separation of observed global and European climate data into natural and anthropogenic signals  Abstract: Observed global and European spatiotemporal related fields of surface air temperature, mean-sea-level pressure and precipitation are analyzed statistically with respect to their response to external forcing factors such as anthropogenic greenhouse gases, anthropogenic sulfate aerosol, solar variations and explosive volcanism, and known internal climate mechanisms such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). As a first step, a principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the observed spatiotemporal related fields to obtain spatial patterns with linear independent temporal structure. In a second step, the time series of each of the spatial patterns is subject to a stepwise regression analysis in order to separate it into signals of the external forcing factors and internal climate mechanisms as listed above as well as the residuals. Finally a back-transformation leads to the spatiotemporally related patterns of all these signals being intercompared. Two kinds of significance tests are applied to the anthropogenic signals. First, it is tested whether the anthropogenic signal is significant compared with the complete residual variance including natural variability. This test answers the question whether a significant anthropogenic climate change is visible in the observed data. As a second test the anthropogenic signal is tested with respect to the climate noise component only. This test answers the question whether the anthropogenic signal is significant among others in the observed data. Using both tests, regions can be specified where the anthropogenic influence is visible (second test) and regions where the anthropogenic influence has already significantly changed climate (first test)."
__label__SUPPORT	"Further evidence of important environmental information content in red-to-green ratios as depicted in paintings by great masters  Abstract: We examine sunsets painted by famous artists as proxy information for the aerosol optical depth after major volcanic eruptions. Images derived from precision colour protocols applied to the paintings were compared to online images, and found that the latter, previously analysed, provide accurate information. Aerosol optical depths (AODs) at 550 nm, corresponding to Northern Hemisphere middle latitudes, calculated by introducing red-to-green (R / G) ratios from a large number of paintings to a radiative transfer model, were significantly correlated with independent proxies from stratospheric AOD and optical extinction data, the dust veil index, and ice core volcanic indices. AODs calculated from paintings were grouped into 50-year intervals from 1500 to 2000. The year of each eruption and the 3 following years were defined as volcanic. The remaining non-volcanic years were used to provide additional evidence of a multidecadal increase in the atmospheric optical depths during the industrial revolution. The increase of AOD at 550 nm calculated from the paintings grows from 0.15 in the middle 19th century to about 0.20 by the end of the 20th century. To corroborate our findings, an experiment was designed in which a master painter/colourist painted successive sunsets during and after the passage of Saharan aerosols over the island of Hydra in Greece. Independent solar radiometric measurements confirmed that the master colourists R / G ratios which were used to model his AODs, matched the AOD values measured in situ by co-located sun photometers during the declining phase of the Saharan aerosol. An independent experiment was performed to understand the difference between R / G ratios calculated from a typical volcanic aerosol and those measured from the mineral aerosol during the Hydra experiment. It was found that the differences in terms of R / G ratios were small, ranging between 2.6 % and +1.6 %. Also, when analysing different parts of cloudless skies of paintings following major volcanic eruptions, any structural differences seen in the paintings had not altered the results discussed above. However, a detailed study on all possible sources of uncertainties involved (such as the impact of clouds on R / G ratios) still needs to be studied. Because of the large number of paintings studied, we tentatively propose the conclusion that regardless of the school, red-to-green ratios from great masters can provide independent proxy AODs that correlate with widely accepted proxies and with independent measurements. Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 2988 C. S. Zerefos et al.: Further evidence of important environmental information content 6 Conclusions: Understanding the atmospheric composition of the past centuries is a very difficult task due to scarcity of available measurements. Especially for atmospheric components such as aerosols and their variability over the past 500 years, relevant information is rare (Thornes and Constable, 1999; Grattan, 2006; Zerefos et al., 2007). In this work we have expanded the idea of Zerefos et al. (2007), which used an alternative and indirect way of using the Angstroms law of atmospheric physics that describes the different effects of aerosols on the different wavelengths (colours) of solar light, together with the use of an alternative database of solar light representations, calculated from paintings by great masters in the past centuries.At first, a series of paintings by master painters (in the period of 15002000) have been revisited and comparisons between digital images of paintings from lower resolution vs. high resolution, derived from high precision protocols, showed similar results, as far as the R / G ratios measured at sunsets are concerned. Statistically significant correlation coefficients were found between the R / G ratio values retrieved from low quality/resolution and high quality/resolution digital images at a sample of 124 landscape paintings from the Tate Gallery. The earlier estimates of the aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (based on R / G calibrated ratios from paintings) and the radiative transfer model by Mayer and Kylling (2005) and Mayer and Emde (2007) were used to compile an independent time series with AODs during 15002000. The correlation coefficients between other proxy indices and the estimated AODs from the R / G ratios from paintings are statistically significant. Also the precision by which the extremeAtmos. Chem.

Zerefos et al.: Further evidence of important environmental information content 2995112Figure 9 3112Figure 10 34AODs between paintings and proxies, during large volcanic eruptions, match in most cases.The comparison between 50-year averages of the AODs (from R / G paintings) with the total sulfate in ice core and the stratospheric AOD, from which the year of known large volcanic eruptions and the three years that followed were excluded, shows that compared to the pre-industrial period, the industrial period had higher aerosol content, as it is well known and expected from independent data sets in the literature (e.g. Neftel et al., 1985; Robock and Free, 1995; Robertson et al., 2001; Forster et al., 2007). Based on the information retrieved from the paintings studied, we estimated thisincrease to range from 0.15 (middle 19th century) to about 0.20 (by the end of the 20th century).Finally, to corroborate our findings, an experiment was designed in which a master painter/colourist painted successive sunsets during the passage of a Saharan dust outbreak over our experimental site (island of Hydra, Greece) on 19 and 20 June 2010. The master painter did not know anything about the passage of a Saharan dust event. Our independent sunphotometric measurements at Hydra confirmed that the calculated AOD values from R / G ratios measured in the master colourist paintings, matched quite well to the AOD values measured in situ as well as with measurements from a digital camera. It should be noted here that all four watercolours by Panayiotis Tetsis were digitized using the same procedures and standards applied to all works of art photographed by the Photographic Department of the National Gallery, London. These findings point to the conclusion that the experiment provides a new presentation of how a painter, a digital camera and scientific instruments capture changes in R / G ratios at high and low aerosol overhead cases.The new information in the paper can be summarized as follows:The comparison of high precision with low precision colour protocol images at independent samples of paintings from the Tate and the National Galleries in London strengthen the tentative results proposed in an earlier paper by Zerefos et al. (2007).AODs from a multi-hundred sample of paintings show statistically significant correlations with independent proxies.Structural differences in paintings do not seem to alter the above results. The signal-to-noise ratios following volcanic eruptions are statistically significant.When averaged in 50-year intervals, AODs from paintings in non-volcanic years agree with completely independent data sets with the observed increases of the industrial aerosol in the past 150 years.R / G ratios calculated from different natural profiles such as from volcanic aerosols and Saharan mineral aerosols showwww.atmos-chem-phys.net/14/2987/2014/ Atmos.

This explains how the experiment performed with an internationally known master colourist arrived at similar results with an increase in R / G ratios during the passage of a Saharan dust event.Regardless of the school, red-to-green ratios from great masters can provide independent proxy AODs that correlate with widely accepted proxies and with independent measurements.The main conclusion of the paper is that nature speaks to the hearts and souls of the artists. When colouring sunsets the R / G ratios perceived by the brain contain important environmental information. It remains to an interdisciplinary community to study further the evidence presented in this research.Acknowledgements.

__label__UNRELATED	"Internal structure of the ice sheet between Kohnen station and Dome Fuji, Antarctica, revealed by airborne radio-echo sounding  Abstract: This study aims to demonstrate that deep ice cores can be synchronized using internal horizons in the ice between the drill sites revealed by airborne radio-echo sounding (RES) over a distance of >1000 km, despite significant variations in glaciological parameters, such as accumulation rate between the sites. In 2002/03 a profile between the Kohnen station and Dome Fuji deep ice-core drill sites, Antarctica, was completed using airborne RES. The survey reveals several continuous internal horizons in the RES section over a length of 1217 km. The layers allow direct comparison of the deep ice cores drilled at the two stations. In particular, the counterpart of a visible layer observed in the Kohnen station (EDML) ice core at 1054m depth has been identified in the Dome Fuji ice core at 575m depth using internal RES horizons. Thus the two ice cores can be synchronized, i.e. the ice at 1560m depth (at the bottom of the 2003 EDML drilling) is 49 ka old according to the Dome Fuji age/depth scale, using the traced internal layers presented in this study. CONCLUSIONS: We succeeded in tracing eight internal RES horizons along a 1217 km profile along the ice divide from Dome Fuji to Kohnen station. Moreover, we have been able to identifycorresponding visible layers documented in the EDML and Dome Fuji ice cores using these horizons. Thus the age/ depth scale of the Dome Fuji deep ice core (Watanabe and others, 2003) could be transferred to the EDML ice core drilled at Kohnen station. Finally, an age of 49 ka has been derived for the 1560m deep EDML ice core retrieved in the 2002/03 field season. We have thus demonstrated the potential of RES horizons to synchronize climate records derived from ice cores drilled at sites >1000 km apart."
__label__UNRELATED	"Incision of a river curvature due to exhumed Miocene volcanic landforms: Danube Bend, Hungary  Abstract: A new model for the formation and relief evolution of the Danube Bend, northern Hungary, is discussed on geomorphological and volcanological grounds. We propose that the present-day U-shaped loop of the Danube Bend was partly inherited from the horseshoe caldera morphology of Keser} us Hill volcano, a mid-Miocene (ca 15 Ma) lava dome complex with an eroded central depression open to the north. According to combined palaeogeographical data and erosion rate calculations, the drainage pattern in the Danube Bend region was formed when Pleistocene tectonic movements resulted in river incision and sedimentary cover removal. Formation of the present curvature of the river was due to the exhumation of the horseshoe-shaped caldera as well as the surrounding resistant volcaniclastic successions (i.e. Visegrad Castle Hill) and a hilltop lava dome (Szent Mihaly Hill). The process accelerated and the present narrow gorge of the Danube Bend was formed by very rapid, as young as late Quaternary differential tectonic uplift, also enhancing the original volcanic morphology. On the basis of comparative long-term erosion-rate calculations, we estimated successive elevation changes of the volcanic edifice, including partial burial in late Miocene time. In comparison with various order-of-magnitude changes, the mid-to-late Quaternary vertical movements show increased rates and/or base level drop in the Pannonian Basin. Conclusion: The Pleistocene evolution of the Danube Bend is proposed to be governed by the exhumation of the original Miocene volcanic relief. In the Northern Visegrad Mountains, the main Keser}us Hill volcanic edifice was a lava dome complex, characterized by a horseshoeshaped scar open to the north. Reconstruction of the original volcanic cone, that was made up mostly of resistant block-and-ash flow breccias, is supported by plotting detailed dip measurements against present topography. The lava-capped Szent Mihaly Hill to the north and the resistant Visegrad Castle Hill breccias to the east were also among the least erodible features.Postvolcanic relief evolution of the volcanic edifice has been constrained by subsequent, mostly Pannonian sedimentation, various climates and, especially since the Plio-Pleistocene, tectonic movements. A fluvial regime replaced the initial marine and subsequent lacustrine environments during Pliocene times, when an alluvial plain may have formed on the Pannonian sediments in the northern foreground of Keser}us Hill volcano.Early rivers dewatering large north Carpathian catchment areas should have appeared in that plain. As a result of occasional high discharges as well as tectonic movements, intense fluvial erosion of the trunk channel and short bedrock tributaries led to the ultimate removal of postvolcanic sedimentary cover.More recent differential uplift and erosion base level drop had fundamental effects on the drainage pattern. After the sedimentary cover was removed, the reappearance of the horseshoe caldera determined the shape of the river pathway. As the incision of the Danube has continued, the caldera morphology has been progressively exhumed and morphologically enhanced. In addition, the exposed, resistant volcanic formations to the north (Szent Mihaly Hill) and east (Visegrad Castle Hill) were also capable of topographically controlling the river curvature. Eventually, the present-day Danube Bend has been fixed in between. Position of river terraces combined with uplift/river incision rates shows that most of the inferred process should have occurred during mid-to-late Quaternary times.Acknowledgments The Hungarian National Scientific Fund (OTKA T043644, T047104, F043346 and F043715), the German Research Foundation (DFG, Fr 610/201) are thanked for financial support, as well as the Bolyai Postdoctoral Fellowship (BO-00175/100) to DK, the Magyary Postdoctoral Fellowship to KN, the Bekesy Postdoctoral Fellowship to BSz and the Marie Curie Fellowship to ZsRR.

__label__UNRELATED	"Possible Juventae Chasma subice volcanic eruptions and Maja Valles ice outburst floods on Mars: Implications of Mars Global Surveyor crater densities, geomorphology, and topography  Abstract: [1] This article discusses image, topographic, and spectral data from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission that provide new information concerning the surface age, geomorphology, and topography of the Juventae Chasma/Maja Valles system. Our study utilizes data from two instruments on board MGS: images from the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and topography from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Within Maja Valles we can now observe depositional bars with megaripples that unequivocally show catastrophic floods occurred in the channel. Viking impact crater densities indicated the chasma and channel floor areas were all one age (late Hesperian to Amazonian); however, MOC data indicate a marked difference in densities of small craters between Juventae Chasma, Maja Valles, and the channel debouchment area in Chryse Planitia basin. Although other processes may contribute to crater variability, young resurfacing events in the chasma and episodes of recent erosion at Maja Valles channel head may possibly account for the disparate crater densities along the chasma/channel system. Relatively young volcanic eruptions may have contributed to resurfacing; as in Juventae Chasma, a small possible volcanic cone of young dark material is observed. MOC data also indicate previously unknown interior layered deposit mounds in the chasma that indicate at least two periods of mound formation. Finally, MOLA topography shows that the entire floor of the chasma lies at the same elevation as the channel debouchment area in Chryse basin, resulting in a 3-km-high barrier to water flow out of the chasma. Blocked ponded water would rapidly freeze in the current (and likely past) climate of Mars. For catastrophic flow to occur in Maja Valles, some process is required to melt ice and induce floods out of the chasma. We suggest subice volcanic eruption and calculate estimates of water discharges and volumes that these eruptions might have produced. 4. Discussion and Conclusion: [33] MGS data has provided many new insights into the origins of the Maja Valles/Juventae Chasma system. For instance, new crater counts from MOC (N/A) images indicate variable surface ages along the length of the channel, with the channel mouth being the oldest surface. Large-scale bars with megaripples, obstacle marks and kettle holes observed on MOC images indicate the catastrophic flooding truly occurred in Maja Valles. A variably cratered streamlined island indicates at least two periods of flooding occurred at the head of the channel. Sparse impact craters near the headwater area suggest the latest flood episode may be relatively recent, perhaps Amazonian in age. Better age information was unattainable, asincremental crater plots [Hartmann et al., 2001] did not provide good statistics for these resurfaced areas. MOC images show evidence of late-stage ground ice in the chasma (such as thermokarst pits and brittle fracture of materials), as well as a small craterless cone that suggests recent volcanism. If the ILD mounds are subice volcanoes, then image data imply that at least two periods of flooding may be supported by at least two stages of mound formation in Juventae Chasma. MOLA topography indicates a 3-km topographic barrier to water flow between Juventae Chasma and Maja Valles. Assuming subice volcanism generated floods, it is possible to use the heights and volumes of the mound, the morphology of the chasma, and calorimetry values of known eruptions to estimate that Maja was cut by several floods having discharges of up to 106 m3/s. These floods could have been generated from melted ice, and beneath the ice they were driven by heat and the gravity potential to flow over the barrier and out of the chasma. These calculated discharges are much lower than those generated by channel morphology methods, but they may reflect more realistic estimates of flow, as channels rarely fill valleys to bank-full flood stage. [34] Crater-count data presented in this paper suggest that floods from the youngest episode either did not reach the full extent of the channel or had very little effect on surface modification of the lower channel areas. On Lunae Planum, along the northern downstream area of Maja Valles, MOC images show no evidence of young floods and MOLA data show no topographic lows capable of ponding floodwaters. [35] Although MOC images show clear evidence of catastrophic flooding in the mid-section of Maja Valles, we cannot rule out the possibility of debris flows and/or glacial erosion downstream. Though no evidence of flowing ice has yet been observed, the frigid temperatures of Mars, the extraordinary runouts of the circum-Chryse outflow channels, and some geomorphic features may suggest some combination of catastrophic flooding, mass flow, and glacial action [Chapman and Scott, 1989; De Hon and Pani, 1993]. [36] Catastrophic flood features in the mid-section of Maja Valles also do not rule out a pre-flood origin of the system associated with mass flows or cryoclastic flows. Some process such as volcanism or cryoclastic eruption had to create the chasma void in order to pond the ice that sourced subsequent floods. In the cryoclastic flow scenario,the initial eruption of subsurface CO2 would not preclude ice in the chasma [Chapman and Tanaka, 2002]. A CO2 aquifer, as modeled by Hoffman [2000], may overlie liquid water that could infill surface voids after CO2 eruption (N. Hoffman, personal communication, 2001) and freeze. Creation of the void by CO2 eruption, later water filling thechasmata, subsequent ice melting by subice volcanism, and jokulhlaup-induced mass flows could presumably all be due to the continued rise of local magma sources to the surface [Chapman and Tanaka, 2002]. [37] Finally, new MGS data are providing information about relatively young processes in the chasma. For example, MOC images indicate a young cone of dark material that may be a volcano. These types of young vents may have produced the dark mafic deposits in the Valles Marineris chasmata. MOC N/A image crater counts indicate a very young surface age of Juventae Chasma may be due to surface modification by late-stage erosion of friable target rocks, disruption by melting of late-stage ground ice, the young mafic volcanic activity, some material subsequently removed that protected the area from impacts (dust, ice?), and recent eolian activity. [38] Though many circum-Chryse outflow channels have multiple sources, Juventae Chasma is an isolated chasma that sourced the Maja Valles channel. These unique characteristics suggest the Juventae Chasma/Maja Valles can be considered a perhaps simpler type example of this kind of collapse-fed channel system. Additional detailed geologic mapping of the entire chasma/channel system may provide clues to help evaluate the nature, origin, and age of (1) chasmata; (2) chaotic material; (3) ILDs; and (4) outflow channels.[39] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Fragments of hot and metasomatized mantle lithosphere in Middle Miocene ultrapotassic lavas, southern Tibet  Abstract: Uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and its infl uence on our global climate have been the focus of numerous studies. Miocene potassic to ultrapotassic volcanism is widespread in southern Tibet and has been generally attributed to convective removal of collision-thickened Asian lithosphere, which is also responsible for the uplift of the plateau. An implicit assumption of this model is the existence of a hydrous, metasomatized (i.e., phlogopite bearing) lithospheric mantle that remained after the convective thinning and was subsequently heated to form small-volume melts. If such a lithospheric mantle was present in the Miocene, it implies further change since that time, as seismic velocities indicate that cold and strong upper mantle occurs beneath the thick crust in southern Tibet. Here we describe peridotite xenoliths entrained in Middle Miocene ultrapotassic lavas from Sailipu, southern Tibet. The results suggest the existence of hot, highly metasomatized lithospheric mantle beneath southern Tibet during the Middle Miocene, and thus support the idea that convective thinning of the lithosphere was responsible for the uplift of the plateau. The relict mantle was later removed or squeezed northward by the underthrusting Indian continental lithosphere, which terminated magmatism in southern Tibet and played a role in creating the entire plateau. CONCLUSIONS: Peridotite xenoliths entrained in the Sailipu ultrapotassic rocks were derived from lithospheric mantle rather than representing cognate cumulates of the host lavas. Their compositions confi rm the existence of hot, wet, and thinned mantle lithosphere beneath southern Tibet during the Miocene. All these characteristics support the view that the thickened Asian lithospheric mantle had been convectively thinned by the Middle Miocene, and that this removal led to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau."

T., Cahuzac, B., Lauriat-Rage, A., Montenat, C. and Pujol, C., 1992. Synthetic data on the paleogeographic history of Northeastern Atlantic and Betic-Rifian basin, during the Neogene (from Brittany, France, to Morocco) 95:263-286 This paper presents the results of a synthetic compilation of the studies of Neogene marine deposits recognized on the northeastern Atlantic coast from Morocco to northern France. The shoreline fluctuations as well as the tectonic and climatic events are discussed regarding the following time intervals and eustatic cycles: late Oligocene, TB 1.4 cycle (ca 25-22.7 Ma); Aquitanian, TB1.5 cycle (22.7-20.6 Ma); Burdigalian, TB2.1-2 cycles (20.6-16.5 Ma); Langhian Serravallian, TB2.3-6 cycles (16.510.4 Ma); Tortonian, TB3.1-2 cycles (10.4-6.4 Ma); Messinian, TB3.3-4 (pars) cycles (6.4-5.3 Ma) and Pliocene (5.3-1.8 Ma). Marine Upper Chattian is well represented in the Aquitaine Basin (France), with various facies formed in a tropical climate. During the Aquitanian and the Burdigalian, the transgressions extended in wide neritic gulfs in France, Portugal, Spain and North of Morocco. The Middle Miocene transgression is well pronounced in the different areas. In the Betico-Rifian realm, overthrusts are established and the flysch resorption is concluded at the end of that time. During the Upper Miocene, the marine realm is locally back from the preceding one; outstanding events occurred in the tectonic Betico-Rifian basin, the eastern part of which was affected by the Mediterranean salinity crisis during the Messinian. Finally, in the Pliocene, most of the features of the modern palaeogeography are evidenced, even when the coastal frontage of several areas is still affected by little transgressions."

These are prevalent and most diverse at high tropical latitudes because of the single annual dry and wet monsoon. Comparative studies indicate that periodicity of catastrophes may influence forest physiognomy, structure and species richness but long-term research in sample plots suggests that a variety of other factors are locally influential. The importance of accounting for natural catastrophes in silvicultural protocols is stressed, and research priorities identified."

Sediments were characterised using on-board visual description, smear-slides analyses, grain-size composition and magnetic susceptibility (MS) records. Five tephra marker layers, identified as Ko, TR, K2, K3 and K4, were distinguished using petrological, mineralogical and geochemical analyses. Age models were developed by comparing lithological units, tephra stratigraphy and MS records with oxygen isotope curves and with records of biogenic CaCO3, opal content, and sediment grain-size composition in three AMS radiocarbon dated Okhotsk cores. This chronological framework allowed us to investigate climate control over the sedimentation regime and productivity, and to clarify the formation times of the lithological and tephra units. The data show that sediment MS variations in the south-eastern area of the glacial Okhotsk Sea arose primarily from volcanic material input. The sedimentation in all other parts of the sea was mainly controlled by the supply of terrigenous material. The cores show a tight correlation between MS, sediment grain size and climate change in the Okhotsk Sea: coarse sediments with a high MS were accumulated during the cold period-oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 2, 4, 6; fine sediments with a low ice-rafted debris (IRD) content and MS were formed in the warm isotope stages. According to the oxygen isotope stratigraphy and radiocarbon data, the Ko, TR, K2, K3 and K4 tephra were deposited at 7.7, 8.0, 26.0 kyr BP, in MIS 4 about 60^70 kyr ago, and near MIS 5.4, respectively. Comparison of tephra mineralogy, petrology, spatial distributions and ages with the history of Kurile^Kamchatka volcanism allows us to identify likely candidates for the tephra source eruptions. The combined use of MS records, tephrochronology and lithological unit sequences provides a detailed basis for Okhotsk Sea sediment stratigraphy. ? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Conclusions: A sequence of seven LU (diatomaceous ooze (1), transitional (2), foraminifera bearing (3), terrigenous I (4), biogenic II (5), terrigenous II (6) and biogenic III (7)) was identied in the series of the Late Quaternary sediment cores using on-board sediment descriptions, smearslides analyses, grain-size composition and MS records. The age models of cores V34-90, V34-98 andMARGO 3063 2-5-02936, based on oxygen-isotope stratigraphy and AMS 14C data, provide a time-scale for the LU. Records of CaCO3 and opal content, grain-size composition and MS throw light on their relationship with the climate changes in the Okhotsk Sea. The terrigenous LU 4, with few biogenic components and low CaCO3 and opal content occurred during MIS 2^4 and 5.1^5.4, and is associated with the glacial mode of surface environment and with low productivity. LU 5, characterised by a high diatom and foraminifera content, is associated with the highly productive interglacial mode of Okhotsk Sea hydrology, being coeval with the pronounced global warming of MIS 5.5. The preceding terrigenous LU 6 can be tentatively correlated with glacial MIS 6, and the biogenic LU 7 with the warm events of MIS 7. The sequence of (foraminifera-bearing) LU 3, (transitional) LU 2 and (diatomaceous ooze) LU 1, spanning the periods of 12.4^8.3 kyr, 8.3^5.5 kyr and 5.5 kyr-present, respectively, demonstrates the progression from glacial (LU 4) to interglacial mode sedimentation (LU 1) in the Okhotsk Sea. The mapping of MS distribution in the Okhotsk Sea sediments, using average glacial MS values, allows us to delineate a south-eastern area adjoining the northern Kuriles and southern Kamchatka, which is inuenced by input of volcanic material. Sedimentation in the main part of the sea was mainly governed by the supply of terrigenous material. The observed patterns of variability in MS, IRD and silt fractions in the dated cores V34-98 and 936 show a primary climate control of the sedimentation regime, with a high MS during cold MIS 2 and 4 and a low MS for warmer MIS 1, 3, 5.1, 5.3, and 5.5 and probably MIS 7. The Ko, TR, K2, K3 and K4 tephra were separated and identied in the Okhotsk Sea cores using their petrological, mineralogical, morphological and geochemical parameters as well as refractive index and colour. The age models of cores V34-90, V34-98, 936 and the time scale of the LU sequence and MS records dene these tephra ages and stratigraphy as 7.8, 8.0, 26.0 kyr BP, MIS 4 (60^70 kyr BP) and MIS 5.4, respectively. Comparisons of the observed tephra characteristics,their dispersal patterns and ages with the history of Kurile^Kamchatka volcanism suggest possible candidates for the source eruptions. Eruptions of the Tao^Rusyr Volcano (Onekotan Island), Kurile Lake Volcano (south Kamchatka), and Nemo III volcano (Nemo-III caldera, Onekotan Island) likely produced the TR, Ko and K2 tephra, respectively. We suggest that an earlier eruption of the Nemo Volcano (oldest Nemo-I caldera, Onekotan Island) and one of the volcanoes in the middle Kurile Island Arc produced the K3 and K4 tephra. By correlating visual stratigraphy and geochemical properties across two suites of Okhotsk Sea cores we have developed a coherent set of MS records, LU sequence and tephrochronology which provide a detailed stratigraphic framework for Okhotsk Sea sediments. MS and litho-stratigraphy, which are strongly controlled by variations in the accumulation of the coarse terrigenous and the biogenic components, represent the response of the sedimentation regime, biota and productivity of the Okhotsk Sea to the regional climate change."
__label__UNRELATED	"Holocene lake development of two Dalmatian lagoons (Malo and Veliko Jezero, Isle of Mljet) in respect to changes in Adriatic sea level and climate  Abstract: Within the Austrian IGBP=PAGES project Palaeolimnology of AdriaticAlpine Lakes (PAAL), geochemical and diatom analyses were performed on sediment cores of Malo and Veliko Jezero, two karstic coastal lakes on the island Mljet, Croatia. Combined with diatom calibration, they provide evidence of remarkable environmental changes during the Holocene. The formation of the lakes in the early Holocene was triggered by a rise in the Adriatic sea level from approximately 50 to 30 m, which resulted in the transmission of seawater through karst, and by a temporary increase in precipitation. The onset of this pluvial period was dated in Malo Jezero at 8.4 kyr B.P. and had its maximum approximately 76 kyr B.P. It was briefly interrupted by a dryer episode from about 7.2 until 7.1 kyr B.P. Between 6 and 5.5 kyr B.P., a transition to the present Mediterranean climate occurred. The marine ingression into Veliko Jezero through the Soline channel, with a present depth of 2.5 m, took place about 5 kyr B.P. From 5 to 4 kyr B.P., the oscillating sea level gradually approached the present value. A tephra layer at 7.3 kyr B.P. in both lakes was related to sudden environmental changes that were probably caused by tectonic movements accompanying Italian volcanism. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. 6. Conclusions: We suggest that lake formation was influenced by the rise of the Adriatic Sea and, at least temporarily, by an increase in precipitation. It was possible to ascertain the sea level rise because the shallow lake basin of Malo Jezero was filled up later than that of Veliko. The initial brackish conditions in Malo Jezero in the time interval 8.88.4 kyr B.P. correspond in Veliko to a change from a slightly brackish swamp to a lake with higher salinity. It may be due to both the transmission of seawater through the permeable karst (caused by the Adriatic sea level rise from approximately 50 to 30 m) and enhanced evaporation. In both lakes the brackish environment was followed by the onset of distinct freshwater incursions about 8.4 kyr B.P., indicating increased precipitation. It correlates with climate and environmental changes detected for the Mediterranean: in the Italian crater lake Albano, marked biostratigraphic changes were observed by Manca et al. (1996) for this time; these were interpreted as climatic deterioration. From foraminiferal oxygen isotopic records, Kallel et al. (1996, 1997) observed a cooling of the spring sea surface temperature (up to 2.5oC) and a salinity decrease in the Thyrrenean Sea, corresponding to the onset of sapropel deposition. They considered a pluvial phase lasting from approximately 8 until 4.5 kyr B.P. In the southernAdriatic a change to sapropelithic sedimentation was recorded at 8.6 kyr B.P. by Fontugne et al. (1989). The observation of pluvial periods extends also to Northern Africa, where Adamson et al. (1980) detected a mid-Holocene moisture interval, with an upper boundary of 5 kyr B.P.A tephra layer of probably Campanian provenience was deposited at 7.3 kyr B.P., being an excellent stratigraphic marker in both Mljet lakes. Tephra deposition was accompanied by environmental changes. Presumably, tectonic movements related to Italian volcanism caused a sudden seawater transmission through the more permeable karst system into Veliko Jezero.About 7.1 kyr B.P. a short dryer phase was detected, separating an older and a younger pluvial phase. Corresponding indications are widespread in the Mediterranean, and observed in different environments: in Spain, from low lake levels and expansion of sclerophyllous vegetation (Jalut et al., 1997); and in the Thyrrenean (Kallel et al., 1997) and Adriatic Sea (Fontugne et al., 1989), from oxygen isotope fluctuations measured in foraminifers. This dry phase as observed in Malo Jezero was followed by a phase with indications of increased precipitation between ca. 7.1 and 6.3 kyr B.P. A transition to a Mediterranean climate followed (6.35.5 kyr B.P.), with the main precipitation during winter, but with less summer drought. The latter is indicated by the time lag of the expansion of Quercus ilex. In the aquatic environment in Malo a gradual decrease of summer precipitation was inferred from oligotrophication probably due to reduced nutrient input from catchment erosion during the growth period. However, if the dating is correct, the onset of the Mediterranean climax vegetation and summer drought in Mljet was approximately 1000 years earlier than inferred by Jalut et al. (1997) for the area in Spain north of 40oN.The marine ingression into Veliko Jezero over the Soline channel, with a modern elevation of 2.5 m, took place about 5 kyr B.P. From 5 to 4 kyr B.P. the oscillating sea level approached the present value.In conclusion, the unique situation of coastal lakes embedded within a karstic system made it possible to get valuable new information about the Adriatic sea levels and timing of the Holocene transgression. Simultaneously, distinct climatic periods could be iden-S.

__label__UNRELATED	"Major episodes of geologic change: correlations, time structure and possible causes  Abstract: Published data sets of major geologic events of the past ~ 250 Myr (extinction events, sea-level lows, continental flood-basalt eruptions, mountain-building events, abrupt changes in sea-floor spreading, ocean-anoxic and blackshale events and the largest evaporite deposits) have been synthesized (with estimated errors). These events show evidence for a statistically significant periodic component with an underlying periodicity, formally equal to 26.6 Myr, and a recent maximum, close to the present time. The cycle may not be strictly periodic, but a periodicity of ~ 30 Myr is robust to probable errors in dating of the geologic events. The intervals of geologic change seem to involve jumps in sea-floor spreading associated with episodic continental rifting, volcanism, enhanced orogeny, global sea-level changes and fluctuations in climate. The period may represent a purely internal earth-pulsation, but evidence of planetesimal impacts at several extinction boundaries, and a possible underlying cycle of 28-36 Myr in crater ages, suggests that highly energetic impacts may be affecting global tectonics. A cyclic increase in the flux of planetesimals might result from the passage of the Solar System through the central plane of the Milky Way Galaxy--an event with a periodicity and mean phasing similar to that detected in the geologic changes."
__label__UNRELATED	"Do phreatomagmatic eruptions at Ubehebe Crater (Death Valley, California) relate to a wetter than present hydroclimate?  Abstract: [1] Phreatomagmatic eruptions occur when rising magma encounters groundwater and/or surface water, causing a steam explosion and the ejection of country rock and pyroclastic material. The predominance of this type of activity at the Ubehebe volcanic field in northern Death Valley, California, is enigmatic owing to the extremely arid climate of the region. A novel application of Be surface exposure dating is presented to determine the timing of phreatomagmatic eruptions at Ubehebe Crater and to test the idea that volcanism may relate to a wetter than present hydro-climate. Twelve of the fifteen ages obtained lie between 0.8 and 2.1 ka, while three samples give older, mid-Holocene ages. The cluster between 0.8 and 2.1 ka is interpreted as encompassing the interval of volcanic activity during which Ubehebe Crater was formed. The remaining older ages are inferred to date eruptions at the older neighboring craters. The main and most recent period of activity encompasses the Medieval Warm Period, an interval of prolonged drought in the American southwest, as well as slightly wetter conditions prior to the Medieval Warm Period. Phreatomagmatic activity under varied hydrologic conditions casts doubt on the idea that eruptive timing relates to a wetter hydro-climate. Instead, the presence of a relatively shallow modern water table suggests that sufficient groundwater was generally available for phreatomagmatic eruptions at the Ubehebe site, in spite of prevailing arid conditions. This and the youth of the most recent activity suggest that the Ubehebe volcanic field may constitute a more significant hazard than generally appreciated. Citation: Sasnett, P., B. M. Goehring, N. Christie-Blick, and J. M. Schaefer (2012), Do phreatomagmatic eruptions at Ubehebe Crater (Death Valley, California) relate to a wetter than present hydro-climate?, Geophys. Res. Lett., 39, L02401, doi:10.1029/2011GL050130. 6. Conclusions: [17] This study demonstrates that surface exposure dating can be successfully used to date volcanic eruptions with high precision if quartz-bearing materials are present. The ages obtained show that the most recent activity in the Ubehebe volcanic field is younger than anticipated, with much of the activity and the formation of Ubehebe Crater occurring between 2.1 ka and 0.8 ka. While the timing of eruptive activity overlaps with times of elevated precipitation, we cannot establish a clear relationship between phreatomagmatic activity and climatic fluctuations. Instead, we suggest that the requisite water was sourced from permanent groundwater located in Miocene conglomerates beneath the crater field. [18] Acknowledgments.

__label__UNRELATED	"Apatite fission-track evidence for regional exhumation in the subtropical Eocene, block faulting, and localized fluid flow in east-central Alaska  Abstract: The origin and antiquity of the subdued topography of the YukonTanana Upland (YTU), the physiographic province between the Denali and Tintina faults, are unresolved questions in the geologic history of interior Alaska and adjacent Yukon. We present apatite fission-track (AFT) results for 33 samples from the 2300 km2 western Fortymile district in the YTU in Alaska and propose an exhumation model that is consistent with preservation of volcanic rocks in valleys that requires base level stability of several drainages since latest CretaceousPaleocene time. AFT thermochronology indicates widespread cooling below 110 C at 5647 Ma (early Eocene) and 4436 Ma (middle Eocene). Samples with 3327, 19, and 10 Ma AFT ages, obtained near a major northeast-trending fault zone, apparently reflect hydrothermal fluid flow. Uplift and erosion following 107 Ma magmatism exposed plutonic rocks to different extents in various crustal blocks by latest Cretaceous time. We interpret the Eocene AFT ages to suggest that higher elevations were eroded during the Paleogene subtropical climate of the subarctic, while base level remained essentially stable. Tertiary basins outboard of the YTU contain sediment that may account for the required >2 km of removed overburden that was not carried to the sea by the ancestral Yukon River system. We consider a climate driven explanation for the Eocene AFT ages to be most consistent with geologic constraints in concert with block faulting related to translation on the Denali and Tintina faults resulting from oblique subduction along the southern margin of Alaska. Resume : La question de lorigine et de lage du relief adouci des hautes terres du YukonTanana (HTYT), la province physiographique situee entre les failles de Denali et de Tintina, demeure sans reponse dans le contexte de lhistoire geologique de linterieur de lAlaska et du Yukon voisin. Nous presentons les resultats danalyses des traces de fission dans lapatite (TFA) pour 33 echantillons provenant du district de Fortymile occidental, dans les HTYT en Alaska, et proposons un modele dexhumation qui concorde avec la preservation de roches volcaniques dans les vallees, ce qui necessite que les niveaux de base de plusieurs bassins versants soient demeures stables depuis la periode du Cretace terminal-Paleocene. La thermochronologie par TFA indique un refroidissement repandu sous les 110 C a 5647 Ma (Eocene precoce) et 4436 Ma (Eocene moyen). Des echantillons presentant des ages TFA de 3327, 19 et 10 Ma, obtenus pres dune faille majeure dorientation nord-est, semblent refleter lecoulement de fluides hydrothermaux. Le soulevement et lerosion faisant suite au magmatisme a 107 Ma avaient, au Cretace terminal, expose a divers degres des roches plutoniques dans divers blocs crustaux. Nous en concluons que les ages TFA eocenes indiqueraient que les zones de plus haute elevation ont ete erodees durant la periode de climat subtropical de la region subarctique au Paleogene, alors que le niveau de base demeurait essentiellement stable. Des bassins dage tertiaire distaux par rapport aux HTYT contiennent des sediments qui pourraient expliquer les plus de 2 km de materiaux sus-jacents retires qui nont pas ete transportes vers la mer par le reseau ancestral du fleuve Yukon. Nous estimons quune explication reliee au climat pour les ages TFA eocenes est ce qui correspond le mieux aux contraintes geologiques, de concert avec le morcellement par failles associe a la translation le long des failles de Denali et de Tintina resultant de la subduction oblique le long de la marge meridionale de lAlaska. [Traduit par la Redaction] Conclusions: Apatite fission-track results from the YukonTanana Upland document widespread Eocene cooling through the fission-track Partial Annealing Zone for a collection that is dominated by ridgetop samples in this region of comparatively low relief. Samples obtained near northeast-trending fault zones that separate major crustal blocks commonly yield Oligocene and Miocene AFT ages attributed to local hydrothermal fluid flow. Although no clear pattern of AFT cooling ages relative to exhumation levels of the various crustal blocks is evident, differential uplift of blocks likely played a role in the low-temperature thermal evolution of the YTU, as has been proposed for some areas. Uplift and erosion following mid-Cretaceous magmatism led to exposure of 107 Ma and older plutonic rocks in some fault-bounded blocks. Nevertheless, an additional mechanism is required to account for removal of >2 km of material, to explain the present surface position of material with Eocene AFT ages in interfluvial areas.Critical to interpreting the AFT results is geologic evidence that the Fortymile River drainage evidently has not experienced major change in base level since the latest Cretaceous (70 Ma) and other nearby drainages, such as the Charley and Goodpaster rivers, since at least the Paleocene. This observation suggests that Tertiary uplift and exhumation as a result of far-field effects of southern Alaskan convergent-plate tectonism is not the sole mechanism to explain Eocene cooling. We therefore propose a model in which the warm, wet late Paleocene middle Eocene subtropical climate, for which there is ample documentation across Arctic and subarctic North America, was responsible for weathering and erosion that led to rapid cooling of rocks that yield Eocene AFT ages. While valleys cut in the Late Cretaceous Paleocene remained stable, enhanced chemical weathering and frequent intense storm events would have shed overburden from interfluves, to be carried as fine-grained sediment either through the ancestral Yukon River (Kwikhpak River in Alaska) to the sea or deposited relatively nearby in the Nenana, Yukon Flats, and, possibly, Susitna basins. Lack of concurrent regional isostatic uplift may be explained by an increase in crustal density brought about by emplacement of unexposed mafic intrusions related to regional Paleogene bimodal magmatism. Although as yet imperfect, our model that invokes climate-driven selective exhumation of high ground appears to better explain widespread Eocene AFT ages in interior Alaska than does a mechanism dominated by tectonic forcing and uplift. Our data set, while nonideal in its design, sets the stage for future, closely spaced sampling for lowtemperature thermochronologic systems along transects across the highest elevations, deepest valleys, and most important structures in the YTU."
__label__UNRELATED	"Clay mineral assemblages at IODP Site U1340 in the Bering Sea and their paleoclimatic significance  Abstract: Clay mineral assemblages and crystallinities in sediments from IODP Site 1340 in the Bering Sea were analyzed in order to trace sediment sources and reconstruct the paleoclimatic history of the Bering Sea since Pliocene (the last ~4.3 Ma). The results show that clay minerals at Site U1340 are dominated by illite, with a moderate amount of smectite and chlorite, and minor kaolinite. Sediment source studies suggest that the clay mineral assemblages and their sources in the studied core are controlled primarily by the climate conditions. During the warm periods, clay minerals originated mainly from the adjacent Aleutian Islands, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios increased. During the cold periods, clay minerals from the Alaskan region distinctly increased, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios declined. Based on smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and clay mineral crystallinities, the evolutionary history of the paleoclimate was revealed in the Bering Sea. In general, the Bering Sea was characterized by warm and wet climate condition from 4.3 to 3.94 Ma, and then cold and dry condition associated with the enhanced volcanism from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thereafter, the climate gradually became cold and wet, and then was dominated by a cold and dry condition since 2.74 Ma, probably induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. The interval from 1.95 to 1.07 Ma was a transitional period of the climate gradually becoming cold and wet. After the middle Pleistocene transition (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), the Bering Sea was governed mainly by cold and wet climate with several intervals of warm climate at ~0.42 Ma (MIS 11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9) and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), respectively. During the last 9.21 ka (the Holocene), the Bering Sea was characterized primarily by relatively warm and wet climatic conditions. 5 Conclusions: The age model of IODP Site U1340 is amended, and the base age is calculated as about 4.3 Ma, that is, the late Early Pliocene (Late Zanclean).Clay mineral assemblages at Site U1340 consist mainly of illite (an average of 70%), followed by smectite and chlorite (an average of 17% and 10%, respectively), with minor kaolinite (an average of 3%). The sources of clay minerals are closely related to the climate conditions. During the warm periods, the clay minerals originated mainly from the adjacent Aleutian Islands, and smectite/(illite+ chlorite) ratios increased. During the cold periods, clay minerals from the Alaskan region distinctly increased, and smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios declined. Thus, the smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratio may be used as a proxy on climatechanges in the Bering Sea and adjacent regions. The evolutionary history of the paleoclimate was revealed in the Bering Sea based on smectite/(illite+chlorite) ratios and clay mineral crystallinities. In general, the Bering Sea was characterized by warm and wet climate condition from 4.3 to 3.94 Ma, and then cold and dry condition associated with the enhancing of the volcanism from 3.94 to 3.6 Ma. Thereafter, the climate gradually became cold and wet, and then was dominated by the cold and dry climate since 2.74 Ma, probably induced by the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation. The interval from 1.95 to 1.07 Ma was a transitional period of the climate gradually becoming cold and wet. After the middle Pleistocene transition (1.07 to 0.8 Ma), the Bering Sea was governed mainly by cold and wet climate with several intervals of warm climate and intensified chemical weathering at ~0.42 Ma (MIS 11), ~0.33 Ma (MIS 9), and ~0.12 Ma (MIS 5), respectively.

__label__UNRELATED	"Patagonian continental deposits (Cretaceous-Tertiary)  Abstract: We review stratigraphic records from various continental basins throughout Patagonia from the Cretaceous to the Late Tertiary and show that they can be used to reconstruct the history of the region, including the number and extension of marine transgressions as a result of sea level changes, changes in climate, and changes in the composition of the vertebrate fauna. The various independent sedimentary basins are analyzed with respect to internal facies relationships and in relation to global changes in climate and oscillations of sealevel. Volcanic processes associated with active volcanic arcs contributed lavas and substantial volumes of pyroclastics during this time interval. The interplay between different geological processes that took place during this time shaped the landscape of the continent and changed the associated flora and fauna, which were developed in this region, differing from other areas of southern South America and part of West Antarctica. 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 103, 289304. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that stratigraphic records from various continental basins throughout Patagonia from the Cretaceous to the Late Tertiary can be used to reconstruct the history of the region, including the number and extension of marine transgressions as a result of sea level changes, changes in climate, and changes in the composition of the vertebrate fauna. Such changes are documented in the region, probably better than elsewhere in South America. The different pulses in Andean uplift can be described as recordedby the continental sequences. The Patagonian continental deposits are an ideal laboratory that can be used to improve our understanding of the evolution of this part of the South American continent.Thermal anomalies on the global climatic record occurring during this time are coeval with major tectonic events affecting the southern Andes. At various times between the Cretaceous and the Pliocene, sea level was significantly higher than at present and the implications of these changes in sea level for the palaeogeography of the region have been explained. For example, during the Cretaceous warm interval (approximately 90 to 80 Mya), global sea level was between 100 to 170 m higher than today, thus implying that the surface of Patagonia at that time was approximately 45% smaller than today. The changes from deep marine to very shallow seas that took place during the Cretaceous along the recently created southern Patagonian basins are in contrast with the open deep marine conditions between Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica during the Cenozoic. This configuration reflects the opposite movement of the Nazca Plate and the Antarctic plate when the Drake Passage was formed (Fig. 9).The record of continental mammalian fauna in Patagonia reflects a large-scale succession of climate changes. From the Early Palaeocene to the Pleistocene, the environment exhibited a consistent shift in climate changing from warm, wet and non-seasonal (Paleocene to Eocene) to cold and dry (Middle Eocene to Early Oligocene) and finally to seasonal (Middle to Late Miocene) (Barreda & Palazzesi, 2007). Concomitantly, biomes moved from tropical forest to steppes, through a sequence comprising subtropical forests, woodland savanna, park-savanna, and grassland savanna.Forests would have been widespread in the Palaeogene within areas now occupied by steppe. They have even been documented in the Early Neogene in the extra-Andean region, both based on the palynological and palaeobotanical evidence (Barreda & Palazzesi, 2007). The PalaeoceneEarly Eocene interval was dominated by rain forest, characterized mainly by very diverse vegetation in the Early Eocene.The full opening of the Drake passage during the Late Tertiary led to the isolation of Patagonia and of its continental fauna. The building of the Panama isthmus during the Early Miocene put the South and North American faunas in contact, thus rapidly inducing changes in the faunal composition of Patagonia."
__label__UNRELATED	"The subsurface geology of Rome: Sedimentary processes, sea-level changes and astronomical forcing  Abstract: Article history: Received 30 May 2013 Accepted 1 May 2014 Available online 10 May 2014 9. Conclusions: Investigation of the subsurface geology of the Rome area, performed by integrating outcrop and borehole data, has revealed four aggradational successions with coarse fluvial gravel at the base, grading upwards into sand and fluvial-lacustrine to coastal marine clay (Paleo-Tiber units 14). Two of these sequences are characterized by double aggradation cycles (Paleo-Tiber units 3AB and 4AB).Deposition of these aggradational successions follows the establishment of coastal continental conditions in the area of Rome at the end of the early Pleistocene, and precedes the start of the large explosive activity at the Albani Hills volcanic district at 561 1 ka.Time constraints provided by 40Ar/39Ar dating of interbedded tephra within these aggradational successions establishes a strict link between deposition and glacio-eustatic cycles between 800 and 600 ka.In particular, comparison of the timing of deposition of the PaleoTiber aggradational successions with the 18O record shows an overall good match between the deposition of five gravel sections and the occurrence of as many lowstands of the oxygen isotope curve, as well as between the deposition of six clay sections and the occurrence of as many highstands, in this time span.While the four major depositional sequences match the four 100 ky glacial cycles (MIS 21, 19, 17, 15), the two minor aggradation cycles match two prominent sub-stages of the isotope curve (MIS 18.3, 15.3).However, when the occurrence of the glacial terminations provided by the astronomical calibration of the isotope curve in the time span 900600 ka is compared to that provided by applying the model proposed by Marra et al. (2008) that identifies the sedimentary switch from gravel to clay in the aggradational successions of the Paleo-Tiber River with the flex points of this curve, a systematic mismatch is revealed.Deposition of the gravel sectionsmatches theminima of summer insolation at 65N preceding by oneprecession cycle those afterwhich the glacial terminations occur, based on the astrochronologic tuning of the 18O record. The common factor is that these minima were warmer than all the other minima of insolation occurring between 900 and 600 ka.We interpret this fact as the evidence that these relatively warmer minimawere able to trigger significant sea-level rise during the following maximum of insolation, causing aggradation of gravel beds within the coastal area of Rome. However, the lack of complete conditions required for the occurrence of glacial terminations (whose definition is not the aim of the present study) caused the aggradation of the sedimentary succession to be aborted, and eventually completed during the subsequent maximum of insolation, to which a full deglaciation was associated.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2014.05.001."
__label__UNRELATED	"Clay mineralogy of the Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary successions of the Cauvery Basin (southeastern India): implications for sediment source and palaeoclimates at the K/T boundary  Abstract: Clay mineral analyses were carried out on late Maastrichtianearly Palaeocene (CretaceousTertiary) sedimentary rocks in the Ariyalur area of the Cauvery Basin (southeastern India). These investigations were aimed at determining the sedimentary provenance and palaeoclimate of the area in the latest Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary. The late Cretaceous deposits show significant palaeogeographic variation in clay mineral contents across the study area. Mixed-layer illite-smectites dominate the clay mineral content of the uppermost Maastrichtian of all areas, with elevated smectite, illite, palygorskite, sepiolite, kaolinite and chlorite occurring at intervals through the succession. This combination and widespread variation in the clay mineral suite suggests a lithologically highly variable source terrain and lack of sediment mixing during transport. Mixed-layer clays occur with both kaolinite and palygorskite, interpreted in terms of a seasonal (warm and wet, warm and dry) source area. The uppermost Maastrichtian of the Niniyur section displays an upward increase in illite content, suggesting that the adjacent continental area became strongly influenced by physical weathering just prior to the K/T boundary. The return of mixed-layer clays, smectite, illite and kaolinite during the early Tertiary suggests that chemical weathering in a seasonal climate once again controlled the formation of clay minerals. These results imply that the volcanism associated with the Deccan Traps had no sudden effect on the Cretaceous or Tertiary sedimentation and clay mineralogy of this area. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

__label__SUPPORT	"Variability of the ocean heat content during the last millennium an assessment with the ECHO-g Model  Abstract: Studies addressing climate variability during the last millennium generally focus on variables with a direct influence on climate variability, like the fast thermal response to varying radiative forcing, or the large-scale changes in atmospheric dynamics (e.g. North Atlantic Oscillation). The ocean responds to these variations by slowly integrating in depth the upper heat flux changes, thus producing a delayed influence on ocean heat content (OHC) that can later impact low frequency SST (sea surface temperature) variability through reemergence processes. In this study, both the externally and internally driven variations of the OHC during the last millennium are investigated using a set of fully coupled simulations with the ECHO-G (coupled climate model ECHAMA4 and ocean model HOPE-G) atmosphereocean general circulation model (AOGCM). When compared to observations for the last 55 yr, the model tends to overestimate the global trends and underestimate the decadal OHC variability. Extending the analysis back to the last one thousand years, the main impact of the radiative forcing is an OHC increase at high latitudes, explained to some extent by a reduction in cloud cover and the subsequent increase of shortwave radiation at the surface. This OHC response is dominated by the effect of volcanism in the preindustrial era, and by the fast increase of GHGs during the last 150 yr. Likewise, salient impacts from internal climate variability are observed at regional scales. For instance, upper temperature in the equatorial Pacific is controlled by ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) variability from interannual to multidecadal timescales. Also, both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AM ) modulate intermittently the interdecadal OHC variability in the North Pacific and Mid Atlantic, respectively. The NAO, through its influence on North Atlantic surface heat fluxes and convection, also plays an important role on the OHC at multiple timescales, leading first to a cooling in the Labrador and Irminger seas, and later on to a North Atlantic warming, associated with a delayed impact on the AMO. 6 Conclusions and discussion: The upper OHC response to the external forcing as well as the fingerprint of several modes of climate variability have been assessed in a suite of observations and model simulations covering the period 1000 to 2100 AD.Clim. Past, 9, 547565, 2013 www.clim-past.net/9/547/2013/In the instrumental period, the model overestimates the warming trend and underestimates the decadal OHC700 variability. The misrepresentation in trends is explained to some extent by the lack of sulphate aerosols in the simulations, whose cooling effect is known to partially offset the GHGdriven warming (Delworth et al., 2005). Note that aerosols have also been proposed to be a main contributor to North Atlantic decadal variability over the last century (Booth et al., 2012). The spatial distribution and intensity of the upper OHC warming trends have changed from 19551990 to 19912010. These changes respond, respectively, to a sustained increase of the net radiative forcing (mostly associated with an acceleration of GHG emissions) and a shift in the values of the PDO and AMO indices.All the long simulations are found to exhibit initial thermal instabilities, which in the case of FOR1 and FOR2 obey too short a spin-down period to bring the ocean to thermal equilibrium with the forcing conditions in year 1000 AD. To minimise the effect of the corresponding drift in temperature, the analysis only focuses on the OHC in the upper 700 m, where the CTRL run remains stable and FOR2 shows a good correspondence both with the net radiative forcing and two paleo records of global sea level change.The spatial imprint of the radiative forcing has also been analysed. All the individual forcings show a similar impact, with larger effect at extratropical latitudes. This larger response at midlatitudes is partly explained by a local reduc-tion in cloud cover, thus allowing a larger fraction of solar radiation to reach the ocean surface. Other contributions to the net surface heat flux, such as the outgoing longwave radiation or the sensible and latent heat fluxes, do not reproduce this different latitudinal response. In the preindustrial era, a large part of the forced OHC700 variability is associated with volcanism, with some solar contribution at interdecadal timescales (periods from 10 to 100 yr). After 1850, low-frequency OHC700 variability is mainly responding to the increased GHG concentrations, and the influence of volcanic activity remains important at decadal and intradecadal timescales. Interestingly, the ocean shows a delayed response to all the radiative forcings, with the largest impacts occurring about 2, 20 and 70 yr after the changes in volcanic, solar and GHG forcing, respectively.Finally, the contributions from four large-scale modes of climate variability have been explored (i.e. ENSO, the PDO, the AMO and the NAO). As their influence on the OHC700 is larger at regional scales, their spectral features have been directly analysed in their respective centres of action. In these four regions the long-term OHC700 variations still exhibit some modulation by the external forcing. Yet at shorter timescales (annual to secular) the regions show periods of spectral coherence with their corresponding climate indices. The influence of ENSO is mainly localised in the equatorial Pacific, where it is found to dominate the local OHC700 variability from interannual to multidecadal timescales. Likewise, positive PDO and AMO indices relate, respectively, to a cooling in the North Pacific and warming at midlatitudes in the North Atlantic, both modes contributing discontinuously to OHC700 variability at multidecadal timescales. The NAO, in the model and observations, produces a cooling over the Labrador Sea, which in the simulations gives rise to a strengthening of the AMOC cell. This impact takes place from interannual to interdecadal timescales. Furthermore, the fact that natural modes of climate variability, such as ENSO, NAO or AMO, can impact the OHC700 globally or locally is important for the coming decades, since they can temporarily mitigate or intensify the ocean warming signal and they can modulate as well the regional sea level rise.To assess the general relevance of these results, we now discuss the limitations of the ECHO-G model, and put it in the context of other AOGCMs. The major constraint relies on the use of flux adjustments (and more in particular heat flux corrections), since they can largely affect the ocean heat content and its regional patterns. However, a comparison of these terms with the actual fluxes at the surface (see SupplementTable 4 and Fig. 3) shows that in overall, and in particular in the centres of action of ENSO, the AMO and the NAO, the magnitude of heat adjustments remains considerably smaller, thus suggesting that their probable impact on ocean heat uptake is also small (Sausen et al., 1988). In contrast, freshwater adjustments remain comparably important, particularly across the Gulf Sream, thus evidencing that some ocean dynamics are misrepresented by the model, and thereby castingwww.clim-past.net/9/547/2013/ Clim. Past, 9, 547565, 2013doubt on the validity of our results for regions like the North Atlantic. In a recent study, (Pardaens et al., 2011) compared the spread in sea level projections (for which OHC relates directly with the thermosteric component) between two different ensembles within the QUMP (Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Projections) project, and found comparable results for the experiments with and without flux adjustments. That same study included a model intercomparison of SL in future projections, in which ECHO-G shows a great degree of coherence with the mean model ensemble, reproducing most of its different local features, like a SL dipole in the North Atlantic, a strong meridional gradient in the Southern Ocean with negative changes near 60 N and positive further north, and positive SL anomalies in the North Pacific, these latter two being coherent with the larger OHC700 changes in the extratropics found herein. In a different intercomparison study (Fernandez-Donado et al., 2012), the simulations FOR1 and FOR2 show values for the equilibrium climate sensitivity, the transient climate response and the temperature change in the MCA-LIA transition well within the range of the other millennial simulations, most of them not using flux corrections. However, it is important to note that ECHO-G stands out to have the smallest heat uptake efficiency among all the CMIP3 and CMIP5 models (Kuhlbrodt and Gregory, 2012). In either case, it is not clear what this implies in terms of the reliability of the model, as the same analysis states that models tend to overestimate this value. Indeed, ocean stratification (which controls how fast heat is transported downward and thereby contributes to the heat uptake efficiency) is rather realistic in ECHO-G when compared to observations and the ensemble of CMIP-3 and CMIP-5 simulations. To conclude, the ECHO-G overall performance, despite the flux corrections, seems comparable to that in other AOGCMs. However, evaluating the validity of our results in other model simulations is an important subject for further work.Supplementary material related to this article is available online at: http://www.clim-past.net/9/547/2013/ cp-9-547-2013-supplement.zip.Acknowledgements.

__label__UNRELATED	"Statistical separation of observed global and European climate data into natural and anthropogenic signals  Abstract: Observed global and European spatiotemporal related fields of surface air temperature, mean-sea-level pressure and precipitation are analyzed statistically with respect to their response to external forcing factors such as anthropogenic greenhouse gases, anthropogenic sulfate aerosol, solar variations and explosive volcanism, and known internal climate mechanisms such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). As a first step, a principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the observed spatiotemporal related fields to obtain spatial patterns with linear independent temporal structure. In a second step, the time series of each of the spatial patterns is subject to a stepwise regression analysis in order to separate it into signals of the external forcing factors and internal climate mechanisms as listed above as well as the residuals. Finally a back-transformation leads to the spatiotemporally related patterns of all these signals being intercompared. Two kinds of significance tests are applied to the anthropogenic signals. First, it is tested whether the anthropogenic signal is significant compared with the complete residual variance including natural variability. This test answers the question whether a significant anthropogenic climate change is visible in the observed data. As a second test the anthropogenic signal is tested with respect to the climate noise component only. This test answers the question whether the anthropogenic signal is significant among others in the observed data. Using both tests, regions can be specified where the anthropogenic influence is visible (second test) and regions where the anthropogenic influence has already significantly changed climate (first test)."
